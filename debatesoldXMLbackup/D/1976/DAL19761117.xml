      <P>I was speaking last evening on Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment.  That amendment proposes to delete lines 45 to 63 of section 14, that is, subsection (b) which reads:</P>
      <P>uphold the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution, especially those relating to rightful liberty of expression, and</P>
      <P>subsection (c) which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>have regard to the need for the formation of public awareness and understanding of the values and traditions of countries other than the State, including in particular <Col N="119" /> those of such countries which are members of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>The amendment deals with the responsibility of the Authority in relation to programming&mdash;that they be mindful of the need for safeguarding, enriching and strengthening the cultural, social and economic fabric of Ireland.  It is a matter of vital interest to all of us that our national broadcasting system should do everything possible to encourage a sense of pride and dignity in Irish people, to put it bluntly, success in Ireland.  For example, part of the amendment reads:</P>
    <P>....strengthening the cultural, social and economic fabric of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Over the past couple of years generally RTE have shown some improvement in that, indirectly, they do convey to people some idea of the industrial developments taking place. One of the reasons why it is essential to have a national broadcasting system in a small country the size of ours is that only a nationally owned system, as distinct from a foreign owned or commercially owned system, will have a vital interest in how we succeed economically.  It will have a vital interest in the cultural, social and economic fabric and in the strengthening of our sense of identity. I have always argued that if foreign interests are allowed to have any control or influence over our broadcasting system that can only be damaging to us as a nation because no other broadcasting system, no other country will be as interested in the future of all the people of this island as are we ourselves and as a system under a national authority will be.</P>
    <P>I do not want to use this amendment to too great an extent to draw attention to the sort of output we are getting from RTE.  However, there are some comments I should like to make in this regard.  For example, figures available to me indicate that programming production in RTE in 1965 was 61 per cent Irish, that is, programming created within the State. In 1970 that had dropped to 57 per <Col N="120" /> cent and by 1975 it was down to 42 per cent.  That may be due to lack of resources or capital but it is a factor I should like the Minister to examine. It is part of what we are talking about, what the Minister is talking about in section 14, and what Deputy Fitzpatrick is talking about in the amendments to this section.  It is part and parcel of what Ireland is made up of.  Admittedly in 1960 after the formation of Telefís Éireann&mdash;in the first ten years&mdash;probably there was a good deal of experimentation.  I expect that programmes were made during that period that one would not repeat. Any authority working in that way would come to its own conclusions. Nevertheless, there is an indication that we are becoming, to some extent at least, more dependent on the import of overseas programmes.</P>
    <P>I merely draw attention to those figures to stress the importance of keeping before us what we are providing the public with on our national broadcasting station.  I have to bear in mind, having been a member of the Authority, that one has in a large area of the State to compete with other channels which are coming in side by side due to geographical accident.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of culture and language the use of Irish on RTE has always been a matter of some interest and at some times of public controversy.  I am drawing attention to changes in the situation merely to arrive at some sort of analysis.  The amount of time estimated to have been given to the production of programmes in Irish in 1970 was around 4 per cent.  By 1975 this had fallen to 2.8 per cent.  When I was a member of the Authority the emphasis some of us tried to put on the question was not the volume of programmes in Irish but rather their content.  It is important that RTE, in dealing with their obligations in this area, should bear in mind that it is not merely a question of satisfying the demands of any particular group on the basis of so many hours.  The important thing is the cherishing of our own language and culture.  I would measure our responsibility in the content of the programmes put out rather than the volume of them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> The 2.8 per cent seems to be very small, but it is interesting to note that the programmes put out have a very large audience.  As far as I know the peak programmes on RTE in the English language at the moment are programmes like &ldquo;The Late, Late Show&rdquo;.  It is interesting to note, if my information is correct, that recently introduced programmes such as &ldquo;Trom agus Eadrom&rdquo; have a viewing audience of between 600,000 and 700,000, which is within reaching distance of peak viewing programmes.  It is important to appreciate this because it is not until one begins to study these statistics that one realises that programmes which I find very attractive and very easy to watch like &ldquo;Trom agus Eadrom,&rdquo; have a great appeal to the Irish public.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to note that between 75 per cent and 80 per cent of our people like to look at programmes either in the Irish language or bilingual programmes.  I am not suggesting that we should suddenly load RTE with programmes in the Irish language.  Our obligations as legislators and also those of RTE as a national broadcasting system in regard to the Irish language and culture can be given a little more emphasis in the future, seeing that the public are showing their support for programmes of this kind.</P>
    <P>Section 14 and the amendment refer to the same cultural relationship between ourselves and other countries. The amendment says &ldquo;especially her partners in the European Economic Community&rdquo;.  Paragraph (c) refers to &ldquo;such countries which are members of the European Economic Community&rdquo;. The description in paragraph (c) does not seem to me to be quite right.  There are other European countries.  Since we are a European country the cultures of all European countries should be given equal emphasis in what is described in the Bill as &ldquo;the formation of public awareness and understanding of the values and traditions of countries other than the State&rdquo;.  I do not see any reason for confining this to the eight members of the European Economic Community.  There are other countries, such as Spain, Portugal, <i>et cetera</i> who are not members.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> The amendment states that the service should &ldquo;be a balanced service of information, enlightenment and entertainment for people of different ages, interests and tastes covering the whole range of programming in fair proportion&rdquo;. Unfortunately, those of us who are genuinely interested in television and broadcasting do not have the time to watch programmes and we have to rely on outside opinion and information to guide us on how far this sort of ideal is being attempted.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more cultural programmes about the North of Ireland.  It is unfortunate that our signal is not available there.  Nevertheless, the more we see of what goes on there&mdash;the good and the bad&mdash; the better for us.  The last paragraph of the amendment states that the programmes &ldquo;be made available so far as practicable to the people of the whole island of Ireland&rdquo;.  This is something which will have to await until the present unfortunate situation has settled down and some means found of arranging for the transmission of our programmes to the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick's intention is not to reflect on the Minister's proposals in the Bill but rather to ensure that RTE can provide for a continuing expression of Irish identity.  There should be no doubt in the minds of people who come into the country when they turn on television that they are listening to a television station in Ireland.  That is one of the priorities the Authority should bear in mind at all times.</P>

      <P>The Minister on the last occasion said that we were less serious than we should be on an important issue like this.  I want to refer to Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment in relation to subsection (4) which speaks of &ldquo;a balanced service of information&rdquo;. It is very important that we should have a balanced service of information just as we have in this House Government and Opposition.  It is important that the public should be able to assess information properly. That is not so at present.  We have seen in recent times Ministers being interviewed and the Minister for Posts <Col N="123" /> and Telegraphs himself being interviewed after speaking to 40 people in Tipperary where it was indicated that this speech was an effort to influence the Labour Party Conference&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this in order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the broadcasting facilities of the country should be used by the Minister to try to influence a conference that takes places next Saturday.  They have not yet changed the name of the station from RTE to RTOB and, until they do, the Minister has only the same right as anybody else.</P>
      <P>The Opposition have been denied an opportunity of full expression in regard to their policy and to current affairs.  In the past we have had political programmes in which members of the Opposition and members of the Government discussed current affairs and each in turn were allowed to put forward their points of view. That situation no longer exists since this Government took office.  The Opposition as a result find themselves in a very vulnerable position without access to broadcasting, no way of communicating with the people, of discussing current affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Current affairs have been presented by the Government in a variety of ways.  I have gone through the newspapers and listened to broadcasts and I want to indicate some of the references that have been made.  The Government have been propped up by the Government Information Services, the Government crutch for ailing Ministers.  Statements have come from this source time and again when Ministers were in difficulties because their statements were incorrect or needed polishing or needed an additional slant.  I ask the Minister to suggest to RTE that they should use one description or another and that the description they use must be used only in relation to facts and can be pinned down later.  If we go through the different forms of reference used we find that information comes first to the aid of the Ministers and the <Col N="124" /> Government.  When statements need correction, having been made on the basis of collective responsibility, the Government Information Services come in.  Then we have statements by &ldquo;a Government spokesman&rdquo;.  Then we get &ldquo;an official Government source&rdquo;.  Is there a difference between the two?  The people find it difficult to know which form of reference carries some degree of responsibility.  We also have the &ldquo;informed source close to the Government&rdquo;.  What does this mean?  Is that something different from &ldquo;a Government spokesman&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>We also find reference to &ldquo;an unofficial spokesman of the Government&rdquo;. What is that?  When information is given through the broadcasting service or the media it should be positive. We also have references to &ldquo;a reliable source&rdquo;.  Are the Government Information Services not a reliable source?  Is the Government spokesman not a reliable source?  Is an informed source close to the Government not a reliable source? Where do we stand in relation to the information that is being given? Again, we have reference to &ldquo;a usually reliable source&rdquo;.  Is that a source which is sometimes reliable and sometimes not?  It is very difficult for the ordinary listener to try to assess what is fact and what is fiction in view of these various forms of reference. Quite a lot that has been presented has been fiction, especially in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>We also get &ldquo;a source close to the Minister&rdquo;.  Is that a different source from &ldquo;a source close to the Government&rdquo; or an &ldquo;informed source close to the Government&rdquo;?  I could go on through a long list.  We now hear of Ministers thinking out loud.  What does this mean?  Are they expressing the opinion of the Government or private views?  In future the people should be told exactly what the basis of the information is because they are confused by the very many sources that are indicated, apart from supplied scripts and other descriptions of sources of information.  If it is a supplied script that should be clearly indicated. The source of the information should be identified so that the public <Col N="125" /> can try to assess its reliability.  The Taoiseach has had to repudiate Ministers time and again and this is a very unsatisfactory situation.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has found himself repudiated by the Taoiseach, chastised by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is hardly relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to a balanced service of information.  We want to know the exact source so that we can make an assessment.  It is irritating when a Minister goes on television and one has to wait two days to find out if he is being repudiated by the Taoiseach.  At present people are unable to assess the situation for two or three days because of the confusion that has arisen in recent times as a result of this business of thinking out loud, abusive statements and the Taoiseach, or the Government or a Government spokesman, repudiating them.  We must be able to assess the value of the information imparted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to ask his colleagues to come clean about this situation in regard to a balanced service of information. I ask that Ministers be made available to present their policies just as we did when we were in power.  We should have these political programmes so as to stimulate public opinion and ensure that the public will be aware of the problems and will have them discussed by Government and Opposition in an open way and not have Government Ministers safeguarded by the Government Information Services as they have been on all too many occasions. This upholstery around Ministers is unhealthy for themselves because they do not think for themselves. Give them the opportunity to come out and discuss in an open way the various problems that confront the people, particularly current affairs and party policies, so that the public can understand.  Is it a question that the Government do not want the public to understand what their policies are, that they are afraid to come forward and discuss matters because of their incompetence in relation to their activities over the past <Col N="126" /> three years?  If that is so, fair enough. Let the public know that they want to cover up for the past three years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dowling, I would remind you that what we are discussing here is the manner in which RTE do their work and not the manner in which the Government do their work.  The Deputy must confine his remarks to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the question of a balanced service of information, and the RTE Authority have a responsibility to the citizens and the Government also have a responsibility. If the Government can influence RTE&mdash;and they can&mdash;in relation to political programmes it is up to the Ministers, the Government and RTE to get together.  We are ready, willing and able to meet the situation.</P>
      <P>I say again how confusing and unbalanced the situation is.  Recently in Wexford the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and a Wexford Deputy, Deputy Esmonde, were brought on to the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;. There was complete and utter disregard for the Fianna Fáil Whip, Deputy Seán Browne.  On that night at 9.30 p.m., just before the programme went on the air, somebody rang him up and asked him if he would go on the show.  Was that sufficient notice?  This was a complete frame-up on one of the RTE programmes. I protest against the manner in which Deputies of the Opposition have been treated by RTE in the past, and this is a recent classic example. The statement made by Gay Byrne on that occasion, that he did not know where Deputy Browne was, did not help the situation.  Was this an effort to deprive Fianna Fáil of a voice on that occasion?  Fine Gael and Labour, a Minister and a Deputy appeared on the programme, a completely unbalanced programme and there was a complete insult to the Fianna Fáil Whip and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I protest in the strongest possible terms that this type of unbalance is not what is desired by the people, irrespective of their political opinions. It may be desired by some persons <Col N="127" /> within RTE, possibly by the Government and maybe by the Minister.  It is a matter that will have to be rectified as soon as possible.  The importance of the Opposition is often stressed in this House.  It is alleged that we do not explain the whys and wherefores of our policy or how we can carry out the policies we indicate.  We want the opportunity to do this on the air and we will be ready, willing and able any time the Minister, the Government and RTE are ready.  We do not want any protection.  We do not need to be propped up by political crutches such as the Government Information Services. We do not want to be isolated as Ministers are at the moment.  We want to get there and explain and discuss the situation as we see it.  On one occasion I had the opportunity of discussing on television the Forcible Entry Bill with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when both he and Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i>, now Minister for Lands, put the then Opposition's point of view.</P>
    <P>If RTE want a member of the Labour Party and of Fine Gael and we stand alone, then we can cope with that situation.  We have a positive policy that we want to discuss.  We are willing to discuss current affairs legislation that is before us at the moment.  We need this balanced service of information.  No longer can the protection that has been given to Ministers be tolerated.  No longer can we stand for the type of selection there has been in the past and which is apparent right up to date.  There is absolutely no balance whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Minister in all seriousness to throw off the shackles and cloaks, cast away the crutches, come out into the open and discuss a policy, if the Government have one.  Let him discuss the affairs of the nation if he wants to discuss them openly and fairly so that the people may be able to assess, because they will have the opportunity in a short time of making their decision known.  Before they have that opportunity let us get out into the open and let us have this balance that is necessary and desirable.  I feel strongly <Col N="128" /> about this as do other members of my party.  I consider that &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; was a classic example of RTE's complete disregard for the main Opposition party who represent in this House the greatest number of people in the country.  It is unfair to ask a member of a party at the last moment to go on the air.  I could understand this if a member had opted out.  I cannot understand it where a programme is arranged, where a Minister and a Fine Gael Deputy are on the spot and Deputy Seán Browne is asked by telephone to participate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we get some explanation of this and an assurance from the Minister that on future occasions when a person is required to participate in a programme that they will get in touch with that person to get his views so that he will have the opportunity of assessing the situation and giving a reply.  If at a later stage he wishes to consult with members of his party or with the party as a whole he can do so.</P>
      <P>I have not much more to say on this aspect.  I will have something to say on other aspects of the amendment, on the upholding of the values enshrined in the Constitution.  The Constitution has been kicked aside by another Minister of Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what it is all about.  Some of the Ministers apparently do not understand, and I hope this part of the amendment will be brought to their notice, that there are values enshrined in the Constitution which Telefís Éireann and the Minister must uphold.  The Minister I referred to on the controversy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is not in order, Deputy Dowling.  I must advise the Deputy first of all that this is the Committee Stage of a Bill and what we have heard here this morning <Col N="129" /> are speeches tantamount to Second Reading speeches.  The Chair appreciates the importance of the amendment and the section, but we are having Second Reading speeches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of upholding the values enshrined in the Constitution.  In recent weeks we had large-scale coverage from Press and television in relation to the upholding of the values enshrined in the Constitution. Some people are not aware of it. It is good to have it in the Bill, but not alone should the Authority be aware, which I am sure they are, but members of the Government should be aware that values enshrined in the Constitution must be upheld.  There are other matters which I will deal with when other speakers have had the opportunity of expressing their points of view on this amendment.</P>

      <P>I regard section 14 as being one of the most important sections in this Bill. That is why I welcome the amendments our spokesman submitted in an effort to satisfy the recommendations made by the Broadcasting Review Committee in respect of what is described as &ldquo;culture&rdquo; and its relationship and relevance to RTE.  I will not name all the members of the committee but it would be fair to say that with personalities on it ranging from Mr. Justice George D. Murnaghan to Dr. Thomas Kenneth Whitaker, the committee represented what might be regarded as a crosssection of the population.  What is proposed in section 14 is not in keeping with the recommendation from that body nor is it acceptable to me because it does not have regard to the important elements of Irish culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> When one speaks of the Gaelic tradition in the Minister's presence it appears to disturb him slightly.  On a former occasion when I spoke of the Gaelic tradition here and expressed my views and hopes on the Irish language, the Minister subsequently&mdash;I will not say with malice or purpose, but for whatever reason&mdash;misrepresented what I said.  He said publicly that I was advocating an Ireland where we would only have one language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will permit me to interrupt, I said correctly that he was advocating a 32-county Gaelic-speaking Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that as if I were excluding other languages. I want to put on the record of this House that that was never my intention nor would I be so foolish as to say we should only have a 32-county Irish-speaking Ireland.  That may come in the year 5000, I do not know.  I am talking about the Ireland I know or the Ireland I can visualise in the next decade or even the next century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are in earnest about giving this country an Irish identity there is no better way to do it than through the Irish language.  To me the Gaelic tradition is not peculiar to a few people in Connemara, to the membership of Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, the Gaelic League, the Language Freedom Movement or anybody else.  It is a tradition 2,000 years old which covers all that happened in this country.  That is the Gaelic tradition, the tradition which was once in the ascendancy and is now, one must admit, on the decline.  If history shows anything, it is that one can never get away from tradition.  At times tradition can be inconvenient to the people or to Governments and they try to substitute something else for it, something more convenient and more political, but you can take it from me, and from history, that they will never suppress it.  I see in this legislation an effort to depart from the real Irish tradition covering and governing all shades of opinion, north and south. There are people in the North, Presbyterians and Loyalists, to whom the <Col N="131" /> language is as dear as it is to the people living in Connemara or any other place.</P>
    <P>Section 14, which I am sure was dictated by the Minister, includes a reference to the Irish language but in my view the thought behind it is that RTE will keep as far away from it as possible lest it disturb the equilibrium of the new pluralistic society.  Again I wish to refer to chapter 14 (6) of the report which says:</P>
    <P>Radio na Gaeltachta, which commenced transmissions in the West in 1972, and was extended to all who can receive it on VHF in 1973, was reviewed by the Authority in office in 1971 as an essential and timely element in its endeavour to promote the attainment of the national aim.</P>
    <P>What respect was given to that view during the last few months?  Everybody knows that if there was one successful element, one successful institution, tending towards a national aim, and more especially towards the national language, it was Radio na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>The Minister may protest but he can make his case later.  Radio na Gaeltachta has been accepted by everybody as the most vibrant and vital agency in respect of our national aims and our national language.  Since the Minister took an interest in it, it has been thwarted and frustrated.  Everybody knows the importance of a ceannaire as far as <Col N="132" /> Radio na Gaeltachta is concerned.  An effort was made to relegate Radio na Gaeltachta to broadcasting times in the morning.  Anybody who knows the Gaeltacht and the social life in Connemara knows that people are free and interested in listening and being involved in the evening rather than in the morning.  The effort to relegate Radio na Gaeltachta to morning broadcasting did not succeed, buíochas le Dia.  Subsequently, in the matter of replacing the ceannaire of Radio na Gaeltachta, under the appropriate legislation an interview board was set up&mdash;independent people who had a knowledge of and an interest in Radio na Gaeltachta were brought in&mdash;and made a choice. They submitted the name of a prospective director who was known as one of the outstanding personalities in what would be regarded as Irish culture, the national aim and kindred matters.  That person has not been appointed nor has there been any move to appoint anybody else.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the decapitated Radio na Gaeltachta is left there.  That is why I say to the Minister that the success Radio na Gaeltachta had when it had its ceannaire in the past must now be affected.  I want the Minister to assure me that this is not an effort by him, or anybody else, to make little of, to denigrate or downgrade Radio na Gaeltachta.  I am hoping he will see the relevance of Radio na Gaeltachta to section 14 and Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment and that he will indicate where I am mistaking his interest as the responsible Minister having regard to Radio na Gaeltachta. I am anxious to see how he will defend the position.  I do not think that what is happening in respect of the appointment of a director of Radio na Gaeltachta has been equalled in any other Department.  I see in it, particularly having read what is proposed, that watered down, superficial anaemic provision which is made in section 17, an effort to make sure that whatever happens in RTE the language or matters which are genuinely Irish and in accord with our tradition will not get their rightful place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> I should like to make a reference to views I have on the language and here I disagree with the observations or recommendations of the committee.  I am not too sure that what the Irish language wants is high quality programmes. For too long we have tolerated a situation where the preservation of the language was left exclusively in the hands of people who were over-zealous, over-enthusiastic, perfectionists who felt one did not have the right to speak the Irish language unless <i>ab initio</i> one could guarantee perfection.  In this regard I am critical of programmes broadcast in the past. A programme ran on radio for many years in which eminent men of professional rank indulged in chats on matters affecting the language which had little attraction for anybody other than themselves.  They were in no way helpful to people who were anxious to advance their knowledge of the language.  At that level I know mistakes have been made in the approach and I am critical of them but I cannot accept the downgrading of the position of the language as indicated in section 17.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Fitzpatrick serves to strengthen and give greater protection to the position of the national aims and of the language.  For that reason I welcome it although I would like to see it stronger. I will postpone other comments on this section to give the Minister an opportunity of expressing his views on what I have said.  I know that whether he is going to reject everything I say or not he will deal with my comments.  I know he will not do me the dishonour of completely disregarding my comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>At an earlier stage when we were considering this section I indicated the reasons why on the whole I prefer the wording of section 14 to the amendment tabled by the Opposition.  I made it clear, as I did in the Upper House where a similar amendment was introduced, that the wording of the two versions was not in fact very far apart and that I preferred the wording of the Bill because it was somewhat more precise and, I thought, preferable.  I do not intend to cover that ground again but I should like to refer to some of the points made in the <Col N="134" /> debate we have been having.  First, I should like to thank Deputy Brugha for his very thoughtful contribution.  He speaks, of course, with the experience of a former member of the Authority. I believe his views will be carefully considered by the existing authority.  Many of the views are appropriate for consideration by the authority and the director general rather than by the Minister of the day.  He referred, and it is an important subject, to the fact that the percentage of broadcasting generated in Ireland has fallen from the early years of television in particular, and he made the point, which is probably partly true, that in the earlier times there was a greater amount of experiment, that some things did not necessarily work and that a certain shrinkage may have followed from that. I think it also probable that the expansion of cable television, especially in the Dublin area, from 1966 on, and into our own time&mdash;the general demands of viewers have a bearing on that&mdash;undoubtedly has caused a tendency which the authority would wish to watch carefully, and I believe they will wish to keep the percentage of quality in Irish-generated programmes as high as possible.</P>
      <P>He also referred to an emphasis on content in Irish language programmes rather than on volume.  Here there was some difference in emphasis between him and his colleague, Deputy Tunney, who seemed to favour a more populistic approach, if you like.  I think there is probably something to be said for the two points of view.  There can be high quality in different kinds of programmes, in children's programmes and comic programmes just as in what might be termed high-brow programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brugha also referred to the wording of the section which refers to the EEC countries, and I agree with him that the values and traditions of other countries are of importance to us.  It is my understanding that the Authority also agrees with this.  He mentioned European countries not in the EEC and I agree that this is relevant. However, our ties with other countries in North America, Africa and Asia are not insignificant to Irish <Col N="135" /> people.  Ireland has played a part in the formation of some of these countries and it was never intended that the wording of this section should confine our interest to EEC countries.  The section requires the Authority to:</P>
    <P>have regard to the need for the formation of public awareness and understanding of the values and traditions or countries other than the State, including in particular those of such countries which are members of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>The need for the words &ldquo;in particular&rdquo; is clear enough in that the people decided by a very large majority that they wished to join that close association of countries.  Because we have to play a part in that association and because it affects our lives in many ways, our ties with those countries become particularly, but not exclusively, important to us.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Dowling's remarks, I do not wish to follow him into many of the areas he mentioned, which are those of political controversy. He is profoundly mistaken if he believes that the Government, and myself as Minister, genuinely wish to keep members of his party off the air. No such effort has ever been made. Indeed, I found when I became Minister that RTE had been reprimanded by the previous Government for allowing a member of the then Opposition to contribute to a programme.  Not long after I became Minister I pointed out to the Authority that there was no question then of any limitation on access by Members of the Oireachtas to the air.  It was entirely a matter of judgment for the broadcasters and I personally should be very happy to watch any member of the Opposition on television or listen to him broadcasting on radio.  I do not play any part at all in this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney made some important points.  He referred to the Broadcasting Review Committee's formulation. Like him, I have respect for the Broadcasting Review Committee and I very carefully considered the suggested wording but of course the setting up by a Government of a <Col N="136" /> commission does not and should not abrogate the responsibility of the Government of the day to present legislation in the form and wording which they think best to the Dáil or abrogate the responsibility of the Dáil to criticise that legislation, as Deputy Tunney has, quite legitimately, done. For the reasons I have indicated, I prefer the wording as it stands.  I know Deputy Tunney's sincere and strong feeling for the Irish language, demonstrated and practised by a great deal of use of that language.  I accept that, but when he refers to the part of the relevant section as being weak and watered down I would ask him to look at it again:</P>
    <P>In performing its functions the Authority shall in its programming&mdash;</P>
    <P>be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community, be mindful of the need for understanding and peace within the whole island of Ireland, ensure that the programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland, and have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular for the Irish language.</P>
    <P>What is so watered down about that? I confess sincerely I cannot see it.  I know Deputy Tunney to be a fairminded man, but he accused me&mdash; and I think he will regret it&mdash;of trying to kill Radio na Gaeltachta.  I can assure him that I have never in any way endeavoured to kill Radio na Gaeltachta and I harbour no hostile thoughts towards it&mdash;quite the contrary. I had the honour and privilege of opening the Radio na Gaeltachta station in the west.  I went there and I spoke at the time.  It was hardly the action of someone trying to kill this enterprise, unless I am fiendishly Machiavellian.  It has expanded its range and it had, and has, an advisory committee appointed by my predecessor. I reappointed all the members who were available for reappointment and added a few others.  That alone was the extent of my involvement with this as Minister.  Subsequently controversies arose into <Col N="137" /> which I do not wish to enter here. These were controversies within Radio na Gaeltachta involving some members of the advisory committee. Various matters were tried or contemplated about which I was not consulted.  They were matters about which it was not necessary to consult me&mdash;various time changes and so on.</P>
    <P>Very recently something else happened in respect of which I was not consulted either, nor did I have to be consulted about it.  I refer to the question of the appointment of a ceannaire for Radio na Gaeltachta.  This hardly arises under the section although, perhaps, it might be thought to arise under a liberal construction of the section.  In case there might be any misunderstanding regarding appointments in RTE, I should explain that under section 12 of the Broadcasting Act, 1960, which, of course, is the Act now in force pending the enactment of this legislation, the Authority are empowered to appoint any staff needed for the broadcasting service.  This situation will not change.  Therefore, I have no statutory function in the matter of appointments and it is not something in which it would be appropriate for me to become involved in any way.  However, if the Deputy so wishes I shall arrange to have his remarks brought to the notice of the Authority.</P>
    <P>In concluding my remarks here I should like to say that far from harbouring a desire to see the end of Radio na Gaeltachta I believe the venture has been successful and useful, that in particular as we are affected by it on this side of the country it has been a means of making available access to the world of the native speaker.  That access to the people generally is valuable.  Here, I am paying tribute to what was an innovation of the previous Government. The enterprise has been a genuine contribution to Irish culture in a serious and basic sense of that word.  In my time I have taken exception to certain elements of Irish revivalism which I have regarded as bogus.  Quite understandably I have been taken to task for that and I now find myself depicted as an enemy of <Col N="138" /> the Irish language.  I am not that, as Deputy Tunney knows.  It would be out of conformity with my wishes and attitudes to life to try to destroy or lower the importance of this important, successful and genuine cultural enterprise.  I am glad that the Deputy has given me the opportunity of putting that on the record and I trust he will accept it from me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>For my part, if the Official Report shows that I said I did not include the phrase &ldquo;appear to kill,&rdquo; I withdraw it unreservedly. Even if the word &ldquo;appears&rdquo; is included in the Official Report, I shall withdraw further.  I am very happy that this discussion has given to the Minister an opportunity of making clear his position.  In view of his attachment to Radio na Gaeltachta I am sure it is possible for him to make known his concern regarding the position whereby there is no ceannaire for the station.  Obviously if this situation continues the enterprise cannot continue to be successful.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for having indicated his intention to convey my views on the matter to the Authority. However, I am much more happy that the Official Report will make known his views.  I do not flatter myself with the thought that the Authority might attach any great importance to my opinion but I am sure that they will give to the opinions of the Minister the importance they deserve and that arising out of this they will proceed to the appointment of the person who has been considered ideal to continue the management of the affairs of Radio na Gaeltachta.</P>

If I have not said anything to the Authority concerning Radio na Gaeltachta it is because I have complete confidence in the Authority in relation to this matter as I have also complete confidence in the director general whose personal interest in such matters I am aware of.  Regarding the appointment of a ceannaire I know that the Authority are anxious to make the appointment as soon as they reasonably can. They, too, are concerned about this <Col N="139" /> matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This section is one of the most fundamental in the Bill.  It relates to the type of programmes that the people expect from RTE.  With the amendment before us we are discussing also amendment No. 21a.  Although last week we discussed the question of the reporting of the proceedings of the Dáil, my reason for tabling this amendment related to some speculation that the Authority intended changing the duration of such programmes.  If, at any time in the future coverage of the proceedings of either this House or the Seanad should be extended as a result, for instance, of the introduction of television into the Houses we should be happy to agree but that is a matter not so much for the Minister or me but for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  My views on this subject are already on record.  I believe it would be good for the institutions of the State generally that the people would be given the opportunity of seeing on their screens how we operate here.</P>
      <P>The quality of life is of paramount importance and to this extent we must have programmes that are of the right type.  Unfortunately it can be said of some television programmes that they do not enhance the quality of life in any way.  RTE have a vital role to play in this regard.  I have no wish to be considered a spoil sport in relation to programmes or to say that they should be laden with a cultural aspect. Now that we are a member of a Community of 300 million people it is inevitable that the forces which prevail in the larger countries particularly are bound to have a bearing on our way of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are surrounded on one side by the United Kingdom from which very powerful television programmes are beamed at our young people.  This is welcome to a certain degree, but I have reservations about the quality of some of those programmes.  On the <Col N="140" /> other side we have the United States of America.  We are sandwiched between those two powerful countries which can undoubtedly influence our way of life.  We must always be conscious of the trends in those countries, especially the economic trends.  It is vitally important that we should be alive to the development of their industries and how they are advancing along various lines.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that we should broaden the concept with regard to the EEC.  That does not mean we must not pay attention to developments within the European Community. We are now a trading partner which puts us in a different category from the other countries of Europe and the United States.  Because we are a trading partner, they depend on us and we depend on them for the development of our economy.  We receive funds from the social fund, the regional fund, and so on.  For that reason we must be conscious of developments within the EEC.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the quality of life that is developing and how we as members of Parliament and the RTE Authority can contribute to that quality of life.  Today television is a powerful medium of propaganda.  It can be used for good or for bad. Down through the years the Authority have done an excellent job.  We must remember they are operating within a very narrow concept.  It is practically impossible to provide a broad spread of programmes with a single channel. By and large, with a single channel they must cater for the masses of the people.  They must also have an eye on their TAM rating because of advertising, and so on.</P>
    <P>There are several minority groups in our society who are entitled to broadcast their views.  In the past, they were not properly catered for.  I am not blaming RTE for that.  Deputy Tunney mentioned the Irish language which is part of our basic national heritage.  Many other groups have played an important part on a voluntary basis.  We seldom hear of the excellent work they are doing.  We should try to give time on the air to groups such as those because they contribute to the quality of life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> Today our young people can view the type of programmes which were not seen 25 or 30 years ago.  Teenagers are faced with greater temptations today. Sometimes I worry about the trends in our young society.  There has been an enormous increase in the use of drugs and drink by our young people.  We must try to highlight the terrible tragedies which can occur. Many young people fall into this trap without any knowledge of the consequences. Under section 14, RTE can play their part by putting on certain programmes.  I should like to see them put on when the family are gathered together around tea time.  These programmes could show the terrible tragedies which can be inflicted on a family if teenagers indulge in drink and drugs.  As we develop into a much more enlarged community, these pressures will become greater.  The press, television and radio can play an important part in preserving our quality of life.</P>
    <P>We believe this amendment is in keeping with the report of the broadcasting committee.  I agree the Minister's section is an improvement on the section in the 1960 Bill.  It spells it out in more detail.  We believe our amendment would improve the Minister's Bill.  The broadcasting committee gave dedicated service to the RTE Authority over a very long period.  They are drawn from all walks of life, trade unions and business. You could not possibly get a broader spread.  Their contribution in their report can be a great help to the Authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept our amendment.  It would broaden the whole spectrum of the section and spell it out in more detail.  As I said, I am concerned about the quality of life of our young people.  I am concerned about the type of programme the authority can put on the air to strengthen their characters so that they will be able to stand up to the pressures they have to meet daily and which I believe will be intensified in the future.  Today's teenagers will be the men and women of the future. Anything we can do to strengthen this section will be helpful.</P>
    <Col N="142" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak for a moment on a matter which may appear far removed from the matter to which I referred earlier, but which I believe is very close to it. Section 17 (a) of the Principal Act provides that in performing their functions the authority shall be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community.  Perhaps the Minister would consider strengthening that to ensure that they would be representative of the different strata in our society.  On television, people are often inclined to equate attractiveness and ability with eloquence and proper articulation.  A fund of material is available to RTE.  There are countless people who perhaps are not in the intellectual class as accepted nowadays; they do not have degrees; nor have they got recognition from any of our third-level institutions of higher education. Nevertheless they have a contribution to make in philosophical matters.  For some reason unknown to me they figure only rarely in television programmes.</P>
      <P>Recently on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;, that ofttimes perhaps overcriticised programme, we have had the normal quotas of authors and would-be authors peddling their wares but again on one of those programmes there was a lady from what might be described as a backward part of Wexford, who presumably had never moved beyond the confines of her own county, but who, as far as I understand from other people was refreshing and satisfying and provided more food for thought than any of the other learned people on the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Television concerns itself with the dramatic.  Unfortunately the profound and the sensible or the everyday are not dramatic and at least for the moment are not perhaps attractive. However, in accordance with what might be envisaged here, there should be acceptance of the truism that eloquence is not ability, that there are people throughout the country who have a tremendous contribution to make to what is really important in life, what is really important to keeping <Col N="143" /> sanity in our society.  The accident is more newsworthy, and the unusual is invariably the more dramatic.  Nevertheless I am at a loss to understand why 80 per cent of our programmes, live and otherwise, seem to treat of misfortunes and unfortunate people in our country and in other countries.  It does not seem to lead to any suggestion or moral as to how the pitfalls of which these people have become victims might be avoided.  While people may have sympathy for and an interest in other people's adversities, other people's ill-founded judgments as to what they should do with their lives, unless their is some lesson to be learned, unless the finger points to how such can be avoided by other people, have no great merit.  I am saying that in passing, and people will understand what I refer to.</P>
    <P>Irish television should deal much more with the Irish way of life and with the successful way of life which so many people enjoy here.  Unfortunately we very seldom see representatives of that group on our television. It would be no harm if the Authority would understand that this House, being representative of all the people would wish that the personalities appearing on our television programmes would be representative of the people, not professionals presuming to speak for them.</P>
    <P>It will be said that these programmes are more costly than the others.  I do not think it is any more costly to bring an everyday farmer or a father of eight from Wexford or Tipperary or Mayo or Galway, to Dublin than it is to fly an up-and-coming author or a brokendown actress from London.  Such people have much more to contribute to what is envisaged in section 14.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought we might have got from the Minister some indication of how we would hope to increase the number of home-produced programmes being presented on Telefís Éireann.  I have been concerned for some time with the number of American canned films being shown. When such films begin to form the <Col N="144" /> basis of television viewing it is time to become worried.  I support this amendment because I believe it goes further than the section.  There are some horrible presentations on our television. I was watching a television programme last night portraying &ldquo;Mr. Steed&rdquo; who has been recently reintroduced from France or somewhere else.  It was revolting to watch the things that occurred in that film at a time when young children are viewing. This section does not go far enough to enable the Authority to move in and stop the showing of such films.</P>
      <P>As regards home-produced programmes, I think television has made us culturally lazy over the past few years.  There has been a great improvement in the standard of the amateur dramatic movement in recent years, but attendances and the interest of the people generally seem to have fallen off completely.  This is partly blamed on television.  Our national television station should give a boost to these activities.  In my own constituency there is a big development in the amateur dramatic movement.  We have some very successful festivals in Doonbeg and Scarriff, but they get very little coverage on Telefís Éireann.  As it might give us a cultural boost it is an area worth considering. The section is not strong enough to help in the development of television awareness.  I should like to know if the Minister has any views on the decrease in home-produced material.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This stage of the debate has covered a great deal of ground and a number of observations have been made about culture and programming.  Many of them, as I indicated earlier in relation to other remarks, while relevant to our debate, are more for the consideration of the authority than for mine.  Opposition Deputies do recognise that that is the principle we abide by and we understand the reasons and necessities for it.  The record of this debate will be transmitted to the Authority and they will have the opportunity of considering these comments on programming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few things which I should like to comment on very briefly without entering the general <Col N="145" /> cultural area, which has been adequately covered.  In regard to broadcasting the proceedings of the Dáil, I would be in favour of the Authority broadcasting full and adequate reports of debates but I do not consider it appropriate to provide for this in legislation.  As a general principle, particular programmes should not be legislated for.  Day-to-day programming should be left to the Authority, subject to general legislative guidelines and restraints.  I am sorry, therefore, that I cannot accept amendment No. 21a.  I should like to add that the Authority and the Director General are very interested in the question of broadcasting Dáil proceedings and Oireachtas proceedings generally in whatever form may eventually seem appropriate to the Oireachtas itself. As Opposition Deputies have pointed out, that decision is one for the Committee of Procedure and Privileges. The suggestion has been made occasionally that RTE may not be all that interested in broadcasting our proceedings.  That is not the case. They are at the disposal of the two Houses of the Oireachtas and of the Committee of Procedure and Privileges to broadcast the proceedings, or parts of the proceedings, either by radio or television, as the Oireachtas itself may find desirable.  They are ready and willing to do this and believe that it would be of interest to the people and of national importance as a service to our democracy; but it is not for them to take the decision, as Opposition Deputies have pointed out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney referred to that part of the wording which requires the Authority in their programming to be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community.  He urges the concept of representativeness. That is a significant comment which I will bring to the attention of the Authority.  We did not wish to include the word &ldquo;representative&rdquo; as it would seem to affect, as the section is worded, the actual composition of the Authority. It is not the view of this Government or of previous Governments that such a body should be representative of various interests, that the members should feel &ldquo;When I am deciding on <Col N="146" /> this I have to consult such and such an association which nominated me.&rdquo; The Authority are nominated as people who will, working together as a body, exercise their responsible collective independent judgment about broadcasts. Therefore the concept of representativeness is one which we did not want, although, like previous Governments, we did want the Authority as a whole to be representative of a broad gamut of Irish life; but we did not want to think of the individual members as representatives.</P>
    <P>The Authority and broadcasters generally are conscious of the desirability of bringing into broadcasting people outside what you might call the community of communications&mdash; authors, actors and so on.  In balance with that one has to weigh the fact that people who are listening to broadcasting or watching television are often looking for instruction and more often for entertainment.  That is a field into which professional entertainers of one kind or another are easily drawn. Sometimes people who are thoughtful, useful and good citizens are not particularly articulate when they are faced with these machines.  That is one of the sources of the kind of effect the Deputy had in mind.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Daly's point about the amount of home-produced programmes, we are all concerned about that.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick and others mentioned, there is a question of finance in this.  The more home produced, the more expensive is the rule, and the Authority have to take account of the need for economy.  We all have to consider how much the licence fee payer is willing to contribute in this area, because essentially he has to do that.  There would be a general consensus against any further drop, at least, in the amount of home-produced programmes.  We would hope that conditions may be such as to enable a rise in the number of home-produced programmes of quality.  Where the Authority have to balance numbers and quality, they are rightly concerned primarily with quality.  There is no point in raising the number of home-produced programmes if the extra ones are of low quality, although quality <Col N="147" /> applies in a number of fields, including some which would be regarded as lowbrow.</P>
    <P>I am sorry, therefore, that I am not in a position to accept amendments Nos. 21 and 21a.  I have accepted a number of amendments to this Bill, mainly in the Seanad, but for the reasons explained I am afraid I cannot accept these two amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">

      <P>In connection with the balancing of programmes, I wish to refer to a recent broadcast of &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; at which a young lady in the audience was asked for comments.  She commented on the Donegan affair, and Gay Byrne, the presenter of the programme, allowed her to be attacked by a young man in the audience.  Gay Byrne identified the young lady as being a member of Fianna Fáil, but he did not identify the attacker as a well-known member of Fine Gael.  The Authority should look at this type of tactic and try to ensure that there is a balance so that when the discussion would finish the public would know that both views were political.  It was obvious from Gay Byrne's comments on that programme that he was aware that she was a member of Fianna Fáil.  When a person is invited to participate in such a discussion it is unfair that he or she should be attacked in a political manner and that the attacker's political affiliations are not advertised as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister's views on Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion that the service should be made available as far as is practicable to all the people of Ireland.  For far too long we have had a paper wall around the Six Counties where penetration took quite a number of years.  We now have a situation where Irish men and women in the North are fed with BBC propaganda in relation to Irish affairs.  The time has come when we must ensure that our point of view is projected to the people who want it.  False impressions have been created in relation to our position, our outlook and in relation to information which is available. The people in the other portion of Ireland might wish to get a view of the <Col N="148" /> Irish way of life which in many cases is more wholesome than that which is being projected by the BBC television. Many of the films shown on BBC are concerned with sex and murder and the British and American ways of life are pronounced in the type of canned entertainment that is presented.  This type of entertainment is not desirable and it is time we made a breakthrough on this score.  It is desirable that the social and cultural activities of our country be projected.  Even here our young people are being subjected to a murder a week in the &ldquo;Kojak&rdquo; type of presentation.  As Deputy Daly stated, we have the capacity to produce programmes that can stimulate the values that we want to project.  I hope that there will soon be a balance in the type of programme people can see by having our point of view available and by giving factual impressions of the situation that exists here. Would the Minister indicate that the question of making the service available as far as practicable to the people of the whole of Ireland has been considered so that we can penetrate the homes of the people who desire it but cannot get it at the moment?</P>

      <P>As Deputy Dowling is aware, I cannot comment specifically on any particular programme. However, if any Deputy or citizen feels that there are serious grounds for complaint about the lack of balance in a given programme he can address a complaint directly to RTE and if not satisfied with the reply from RTE he may raise the matter with the existing complaints committee and, when this legislation is passed, with the statutory body of the complaints commission whose specific function is to look into matters of balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the bringing of RTE television and radio as far as is practicable to the population as a whole. As Deputy Brugha commented when he referred to this matter, the situation which has prevailed in Northern Ireland over the past few years has not been entirely propitious to any new agreements in this area, but we are anxious to secure such agreements. <Col N="149" /> The extent to which RTE is already available in Northern Ireland should not be underestimated.  Television is limited to about 14 per cent of the population, not including the Belfast region, for well-known topographical reasons.  RTE sound radio programmes are transmitted on VHF and on medium wave.</P>
    <P>The coverage in Northern Ireland of our VHF sound service is better than our present total television coverage there.  A low power VHF transmitter to improve coverage in County Donegal was brought into service in March, 1975 which will also improve the coverage in north Antrim, Derry and west Tyrone.  Coverage is of little value unless there is a reasonably high density of VHF receivers in the area covered.  We have no specific figures for the density of such receivers in Northern Ireland, but a recent United Kingdom report suggests that about 50 per cent of all homes in the United Kingdom have VHF sets and that the percentage is increasing steadily.  The report gives a proportion of the total number of radio sets sold in the United Kingdom which are equipped with VHF as 60 per cent.  The proportion in the case of sets costing £20 or more is possibly 95 per cent.  The new Tullamore transmitter which was brought into service in July, 1975 operates during daylight hours and gives excellent coverage throughout Northern Ireland.  The transmitter operates at 1,500 kilowatts at night. The Athlone transmitter operated at 1,000.  Improved coverage at night is being secured by the same transmitter, so there are modest but significant developments in that area.</P>

      <P>The periods fixed by the Authority for broadcasting shall be subject to the approval of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The new section gives more flexibility to the Authority to settle the hours of broadcasting and is thereby in line with the general tenor of the Bill.

Subsection (2) gives the Authority more flexibility in determining when advertisements will be broadcast. It replaces section 20 (3) of the principal Act which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The total daily times fixed by the Authority for broadcasting advertisements, and the distribution, determined by the Authority, of that time throughout the programmes, shall be subject to the approval of the Minister.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I have no objection to the section.  Probably the Authority are more qualified than the Minister or anyone else to know when there should be advertising.  Unfortunately, there is probably too much advertising but we must take the financial aspects into consideration and nothing can be done about it.  I am sure the Authority are more qualified to decide on the right time for advertising. However, it has often seemed to me that breaks for advertising could be timed somewhat better so that there would not be too much annoyance caused to the audience.  I accept that it is not possible to put on all the advertising at the end of a programme <Col N="151" /> but it would be desirable to eliminate as much as possible any annoyance that may be caused because of too much advertising.  It would be desirable not to have any advertising but until we can devise some other means of financing RTE there is very little that can be done.  Let us hope that the Authority will try to keep the advertising to a minimum and that it will be broadcast at a time when it will not cause too much annoyance.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) is an enabling provision only.  RTE have not indicated any immediate intention to avail themselves of the power under the section to borrow temporarily abroad to provide for current expenditure if the section is enacted.  This power may be exercised only with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>With regard to subsection (2), under the existing Act RTE may use their overdraft only to provide for current expenditure.  Under subsection (2), they may use their overdraft to provide for the general purposes of broadcasting, including capital works, but only with the consent of the Minister which may be given only in exceptional circumstances.  The reason for this limitation is that it is not in accordance with the best accounting practice to use an overdraft for the general purposes of broadcasting, including the financing of capital works, save in exceptional circumstances. However, the need to do so arises occasionally when the financial position of RTE is weak and when moneys normally due to them cannot be paid over.  For example, when an increase in the TV licence fee is authorised the receipts from the increase cannot be paid over to RTE until an increased grant-in-aid is approved by the Oireachtas.  Subsection (2) is designed to cover this kind of eventuality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> As in the case of section 11, the provision about borrowing abroad for current expenditure was included in the section at the initiative of RTE. It is an enabling provision only and, as I have indicated, the power to borrow can be used only with the approval of the Ministers for Finance and Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>While I know of no plans by RTE to arrange for temporary borrowing abroad at present, I do not think there is any real risk that to do so would jeopardise the independence of our broadcasting services.  I would expect that the RTE Authority would not propose to accept a loan from a foreign lending agency if any conditions attaching to the loan would inhibit them from exercising their function of providing a national broadcasting service in accordance with the provisions of the Acts dealing with the Broadcasting Authority. In the unlikely event of any Authority proposing that they be authorised to borrow temporarily under such conditions it may be taken that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs of the day would withhold his consent to such borrowing.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> In any expanding organisation it is important that sufficient finances be made available, especially when such finances are used for capital purposes.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that it is not the intention of the Authority to borrow abroad for current expenditure. Certainly I should not like to see such a practice develop.  Perhaps some of the other State bodies may have embarked on such a course but it is very difficult to get out of deficit budgeting in respect of current expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not like to see the Authority impeded in any way with regard to capital expansion.  I should prefer to see them get it from Irish sources through the Minister for Finance or the associated banks.  I am most concerned that any money provided for capital purposes is put to use as soon as possible.  Everyone knows it is not economic to build a factory and then to leave it idle for <Col N="153" /> three years.  With regard to the second channel, I hope that any plant or equipment that has been provided is put to use as quickly as possible.  It is well known that plant depreciates in the write-down&mdash;any business man can tell one how short is the life-span of plant and machinery and I am sure that this applies to the highly technical plant necessary for RTE.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the RTE Authority are currently engaged in the provision of the necessary plant and equipment so that all may be ready if and when the Minister makes his decision regarding RTE 2.  It is only when this is done that we will see the benefit arising out of this borrowing and for that reason I do not disagree with ensuring that money be made available to them.  When companies do not have sufficient finances it has a detrimental effect on them and it undermines confidence in them.  Similarly, the confidence of the Authority can be undermined if they do not have all the finances necessary.  This section is necessary.  I hope that the money spent on capital purposes will be put to use for the benefit of the Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This section gives the Minister power to direct the Authority not to broadcast certain types of programmes. Recently we had the example of the Minister issuing a directive to the Authority under this section, or, I should say, under the old section in the 1960 Act.  That takes me back to the amendment I put down on section 2 of this Bill.  The Minister issued the directive under section 31 of the 1960 Act.</P>
      <P>If we examine section 17&mdash;and I am not trying to be dictatorial as regards our attitude in this matter&mdash;it is important as far as the employees are concerned that they know exactly who is the head of the organisation, who is the boss or the man issuing the directions. I agree that under this section the Minister can issue a directive to the Authority not to broadcast certain matters.  But I contend that the Minister would not have power to back that up under this Bill.  I was wondering if the Minister has had any change of heart with regard to his thinking that he can operate this section without that power as regards the Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that the Authority can see my point of view with regard to directives under this section.  What would be the Minister's situation in regard to the last directive he issued on the 18th of October had the Authority said: &ldquo;No, we shall not refrain-from broadcasting this type of programme&rdquo;? He would then have to go through a cumbersome procedure to rectify that situation.  I am sure a responsible authority will always respect a Minister's decision but this did bring to light the position in which <Col N="155" /> the Minister will find himself where the Authority are concerned under this Bill.  Just as anybody else, the Authority like to know exactly how they stand.  In any future directives not adhered to the Minister will have to bring an order into this House with regard to taking definite steps.  That is a procedure I have always held is not in the best interests of the Authority. It is not in the best interest of the whole broadcasting organisation to have a long drawn-out debate in this House on the various communications that may have taken place between the Minister and the Authority.  I contend that the Minister weakened his position under this section by not accepting our amendment earlier in this debate.</P>
    <P>This section is not a workable one by virtue of section 2 of the Bill.  Of course, one can say: &ldquo;Do this&rdquo; or &ldquo;Do that&rdquo; but people may refuse. After all, a properly constituted authority have a right also; they might have a right to dispute the Minister's directive.  The Minister's interpretation and theirs of a particular programme might be different.  We must remembers that there are nine of them sitting in judgment on a particular programme with all the expertise at their disposal.  It is a very delicate situation as to who is right and who is wrong.  The Authority are a responsible body of people.  Naturally any Minister must give this serious consideration because he is dealing with people qualified in their own right.  We must prepare for all eventualities.  If the Minister's directive is not adhered to, in my opinion he is not in as strong a position as he was under the 1960 Act.  I should not like to be seen to be dictatorial about this matter, but everybody likes to know where he stands.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what is the position now where RTE are concerned regarding the particular type of programme they should broadcast, especially those of a very sensitive nature in respect of which he recently issued a directive.  If my memory serves me correctly&mdash;and I am subject to correction here&mdash;after <Col N="156" /> the previous directive was issued I thought the Authority drew up guidelines within which they could operate and would be safe in doing so.  I understood also&mdash;and again I am subject to correction&mdash;that those guidelines were drawn up, if not with the approval of the Minister, at least with his knowledge.  I do not want to be misunderstood in any way in this respect.  I presume that the Authority operated within those guidelines regarding the programmes the Minister asked them to refrain from broadcasting. Perhaps we might have clarification from the Minister in this respect. If they operated within the guidelines laid down, with the knowledge of the Minister, then no blame can be placed on them one way or the other.  I should like the Minister to explain how they stepped outside those guidelines or, if they did, to explain how they did so.</P>
    <P>The Minister's interpretation and that of the Authority must form common ground.  If they do not we will quite often have conflict over interpretation, the Minister's view of certain programmes and that of the Authority. We will have to establish some type of common ground where the Authority can feel safe and say: &ldquo;There are the guidelines.  Here is the programme we are putting on.  We are quite within the guidelines and are on safe ground.&rdquo;  It would not be fair that any Minister should have a right in relation to any particular matter being broadcast, that his personal definition of it might not be in keeping with the guidelines laid down already. It is better for the country to understand that those guidelines are there. They will have to be there if the Authority are to operate with any flexibility in this sensitive area.  I would like the Minister's comments on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to refer to the general purpose of the section.  I need only do so briefly here as the matter was covered fairly substantially in the Second Reading.  Section 17 replaces subsection (1) of section 13 of the 1960 Act which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> The Minister may direct the Authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting any particular matter or matter of any particular class and the Authority shall comply with the direction.</P>
    <P>Section 17 limits the power of the Minister to issue directions to matters which in his opinion if broadcast would be likely to promote or incite to crime or would tend to undermine the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>Directions under this section would be issued by statutory order which would be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and would remain in force for a period not exceeding 12 months.  An order could be extended by further periods not exceeding 12 months for any extension.  Such extensions could be either by statutory orders made by the Minister or by resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Every statutory order made under this section would be subject to annulment by resolution of either House of the Oireachtas within 21 sitting days of the matter being laid before it.</P>
    <P>As explained on Second Stage, the general thinking behind this and the related section is not to weaken the power of the authority of the Minister and the Government in relation to this important matter but to make that power more responsive to the authority as such.  That is to say, that all such matters have to come before the Oireachtas.  Deputies opposite have viewed that as perhaps unnecessary or as leaving the Minister, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, not in as strong a position as he was before.  In a sense the Minister and the Government are not in as strong and independent position in relation to the Oireachtas as they were before, but the authority of the Oireachtas and the Government responsible to it is not, in our view, weakened.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raises&mdash;it is a fair enough point&mdash;the question of what happens if an authority choose to disobey a direction given to them and then the Minister has to come before the Dáil regarding the removal of the Authority.  I agree with the <Col N="158" /> Deputy that that is, almost by definition, an undesirable situation to contemplate and distressing in its implications for broadcasting.  But I see no reason to suppose that any authority set up under the authority of this Oireachtas and appointed by the Government are likely to say: &ldquo;Well, we have your direction.  We propose to disregard it.&rdquo;  No Authority have ever done that.</P>
    <P>I want to approach this subject in a spirit of as little polemics as possible. I want to go over what happened.  In the case of the Authority removed by my predecessor in December, 1972, the Minister issued a direction, still in force, which I have maintained, in the form of general wording and, therefore, obviously subject to various interpretations. The Authority sought clarification on what the direction means.  They were already operating under certain guidelines which represented their interpretation.  The Minister did not feel himself obliged to clarify a direction, which he regarded as already sufficiently clear.  When a programme was broadcast which in terms of his interpretation of his direction, though not apparently in terms of their guidelines, violated the direction, he then dismissed the Authority, as he could and as can still be done until this legislation is passed, without reference to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>When I became Minister I asked to see the guidelines.  I then informed the Authority that the direction remained in force but that I, as Minister, regarded the guidelines, if observed, as constituting compliance with the direction.  To that extent the element of possible conflict of interpretations disappeared.  That raises the point of whether the guidelines may have been deemed to have been contravened by a recent broadcast&mdash;that of an interview with a spokesman for the Provisional Sinn Féin.  It appeared to me that the guidelines could be differently interpreted in relation to that matter. I, therefore, am not taking the view that the guidelines were contravened by this broadcast.  The conclusion I reached was that, if the existing guidelines can be so interpreted as to permit this particular form of broadcast, I am not faulting the Authority or <Col N="159" /> the broadcasters but I am going to make these guidelines more specific and more clear to make it clear that that kind of broadcast should not occur.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, issued the direction, of which the House is aware, prohibiting the broadcast of interviews or reports of interviews by members of the Provisional IRA, Official IRA, organisations which are illegal in Northern Ireland, including the UVF, UFF and so forth, and broadcasts by spokesmen for Provisional Sinn Féin.  I was not and am not charging the Authority with failing to see that the guidelines were complied with.  I added&mdash;this was a better and more suitable course of action&mdash;to the existing direction by way of clarification, as I see it, of its intention&mdash;and certainly of my intention and that of the Government in reference to this matter&mdash;this particular precise direction, which now makes it absolutely clear that interviews and reports of interviews of this kind may not be broadcast.</P>
    <P>The Authority at their first meeting after the direction had no difficulty whatever in accepting the direction and set itself to implement the direction by new guidelines.  I am satisfied that this Authority and any Authority likely to be appointed under the general responsibility of the Oireachtas is likely to take its responsibilities in law and in terms of its governing statute absolutely seriously. I believe that past authorities did so and I am aware that this Authority is doing so.  I know that there can be clashes under the legislation we are now passing conceptually or theoretically. I do not believe these are likely to arise and I think that the broad question of ensuring that where a Government feels it has to act in this delicate area it must be doing so as it were within sight of Parliament and acting as responsible to Parliament under parliamentary check.  I think that is so important as to outweigh the quite hypothetical danger of the kind of clash the Deputy describes. I am giving my view; I respect the Deputy's alternative view but that is <Col N="160" /> how I see it and how the Government see it.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This is an important section, important in the fact that it must be evident to the public that there is no great censorship in this field except where it is really necessary.  A badly informed public is probably the worst thing we could have in our democracy. RTE must be seen to be in a position to inform while keeping within the guidelines.  I am not sure how restrictive the Minister's guidelines now are.  I am not criticising the directive he gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some will say that it did not go far enough as regards some organisations in Northern Ireland.  They thought certain organisations in Northern Ireland which were probably perpetuating the same type of crime should have been included in the Minister's directive to RTE. It is important to ensure that we do not inhibit normal political development&mdash;that is the vital point. Legitimate political development must be seen not to be inhibited.  That <Col N="161" /> would be one of the worst things that could happen in regard to our democracy. I would be very conscious of how the Minister worded his directive with a view to ensuring that while the Authority realise their responsibility to the public, as they must do in this very sensitive area of communication, they are at the same time given latitude to report important matters.  I am not speaking of the particular matter on which the directive was given although some people will say that there were elected representatives on this particular group that may be impeded as regards their political activities. I think the Minister qualified that at a later date as regards the elected representatives attached to some of these organisations.  We do not want to tie down the Authority too much.  It is a very delicate area between the Minister's interpretation of certain programmes and the Authority's.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has found common ground with them so that if programmes come up in the future the Minister and the Authority will know whether they are inside or outside guidelines.  It is important to have that established and ensure that the freedom of expression of legitimate democratic organisations is in no way impeded.  I do not think that is the Minister's intention but I mention it to ensure that freedom of expression should not be impeded.  I sincerely hope that we shall have very few directives because it would not help the whole system of broadcasting if the Authority has to look over its shoulder on every occasion.  They should know exactly where they stand without any ambiguity.  This section is necessary but like everybody else in the House I hope it will not be necessary ever to use it.  I am glad the Authority have agreed with the Minister. Perhaps the new guidelines which have been drawn up are sufficiently comprehensive and give a certain amount of elasticity without going outside these guidelines.  We must see the flexibility within which the broadcasting Authority is operating. In any other type of business you can operate within a directive but this is a very sentitive area and at times <Col N="162" /> the Authority may step outside it&mdash; perhaps not deliberately&mdash;but in their interpretation of certain programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for giving me the opportunity of putting on the record of the House the actual wording of the direction issued by me to the Authority on 18th October, 1976.  It is quite a short direction and, I think, clear.</P>
      <P>In exercising the powers conferred on me by section 31 (1) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, I, Conor Cruise-O'Brien, TD, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, hereby direct you to refrain from broadcasting matter of the following class, i.e. interviews or reports of interviwes with the spokesman for:</P>
      <P>(a)  the Irish Republican Army (Provisional or Official),</P>
      <P>(b)  organisations classified as unlawful in Northern Ireland,</P>
      <P>(c)  Provisional Sinn Féin.</P>
      <P>This direction is to remain in force for six months from the date of issue, or until the passage of new broadcasting legislation, whichever be the sooner.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely with Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick (<i>Dublin Central</i>) when he says that the greatest care should be taken not to inhibit legitimate political development.  There is to my mind a firm line to be drawn.  For that purpose I have made the present draft legislation more specific than the old more general one, that a line be drawn as to where and in what area there may be such prohibitions and controls.  That area is the area of crime.  The Irish Republican Army, Provisional or Official, is an illegal organisation in this State.  The IRA collectively and in both of its branches is also illegal and criminal. Membership of that organisation is now a criminal offence visited with very severe penalties.  It would be hard to argue that known criminals should be given access to the airways and, if that were argued, which criminals.  Are common law criminals to give their opinions and to propagate the aims of their gangs or conspiracies?  That is not generally done.  I do not see why we should do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> The second group are organisations classified as unlawful in Northern Ireland.  These again are obviously illegal and criminal organisations whose members have claimed many barbarous, cruel and murderous acts.</P>
    <P>The third group is the one that is regarded as border-line, that Provisional Sinn Féin which in one of its aspects is a political party or presents itself as such; but in another of its aspects, which I suggest is the more operative one, is the front and propaganda arm for a criminal and violent conspiracy, that of the Provisional IRA.  There are those who do not take that view or affect not to take that view.  I think most people who are familiar with how these organisations work know that that is the case, and we know that persons belonging to and indeed convicted of belonging to the Provisional IRA can be elected to high office in this supposed political party. I, therefore, did not and do not feel that they can be regarded as a legitimate political party, not because of any objectives which they claim or hold or would avow but because, and solely because of their close organic connection with an illegal army.  That is why interviews with their spokesmen are being prohibited, by the same token, as are interviews with members of what may rightly be regarded as their parent organisation.  I would remind the House that the IRA split in 1969 into Provisional and Official wings; that immediately thereafter the organisation known as Sinn Féin split into Provisional and Official wings, each of them going with their parent wing of the original army.  Nothing could make more clear what the nature of these supposed political parties is.  I would like to emphasise that that is where we intend to draw the line round crime, and that is why we are making section 17 here more specific than the original section 31 so as to indicate that we cannot go beyond that line.  It is only there that the State should have such powers to prevent criminal conspirators making use of our airways.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin Central):</i> I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 31 and 32 to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  A licence under subsection (2) of this section shall set out a code governing standards and practice for local Programme matters.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is laying the guidelines for local television and various factors <Col N="165" /> to bring them into line with the rules and regulations which govern RTE at the moment.  I welcome the introduction of local radio and television in various parts of the country.  I have some experience in a community, in the Liberties, where local radio programmes were carried out over a number of years and I confess they have been a wonderful success. I was not sure at that time what rules were governing the local radio, whether they were governed by the same rules as RTE or not.  It is for this reason that I have brought in this amendment.  Naturally when we are dealing with this amendment we are dealing with new television programmes which will be run independently, like Ballyfermot and Tallaght. These are programmes which would be initiated by the community.  I know the programme regarding the Liberties was under direct supervision of RTE and they would be operating within the guidelines laid down.  We know these stations are developing. We have seen them.  Even the local television stations operated in Ballyfermot at least, or did operate very successfully for a time.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us an undertaking on the eve of the Dublin-South-West by-election as regards advertising. I do not know what happened to that permission which was being sought from the Minister at that time.  He conveniently gave leave on the eve of the South-West by-election, but I am not sure how it has developed since because Ballyfermot is not in my consituency.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with the purposes the Deputy has in mind but the situation does not require statutory provision here.  Section 6 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, provides:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by order make regulations prescribing in relation to all licences granted under this Act...</P>
      <P>and then states the terms and conditions to be observed by the holders of such licences and subject to which such licences are deemed to be granted under the statutory power.  This would apply also to licences issued under section 18 of the Bill.  Accordingly, the Minister will have the power to insist on licences conforming to such codes of programme practice and so on which seem desirable in the light of development of local programme origination.  However, we are still at the experimental stage in this type of development.  I do not consider it desirable to have a mandatory statutory provision in regard to the conditions to be attached to licences.  Accordingly, I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The groups which are operating such experimental systems&mdash;and they are experimental&mdash;are in touch with my Department. They are aware in a general way of the governing procedures affecting RTE and are specifically advised by my Department that they should comply with the provisions of the 1960 Act as it applies to RTE and the terms of this are drawn to their attention.  So far as I am aware, no difficulty has arisen in relation to compliance with that Act.  Whereas we do envisage that there shall be a code of programme practice, my Department feel, and I agree with their view, that it is early days yet to formulate such a code, that it is sufficient for it to be drawn to their attention that they have to comply with the terms of the Act and that essentially that they are <Col N="167" /> under the same rules as the national broadcasting station in this regard.</P>

      <P>Section 21 provides that apparatus used in the provision and distribution of local programmes shall come within the ambit of section 7, 8, 10 and 12 of the 1926 Act.  The effect of this would be that, first, a person who is served with a notice in writing by the Minister would be required to state whether he has such apparatus and, if he has, the nature of the apparatus and the place at which it is kept.  Second, a justice of the District Court could have power to grant a search warrant to enter a place suspected of containing unlicensed apparatus and to search for and seize any such apparatus.</P>
      <P>Under subsection (2) during a national emergency full control can be taken by the State of equipment used to provide or distribute local programmes. Under subsection (3) it would be illegal to work or use equipment for provision or distribution of local programmes in such a way as would cause interference with wireless telegraphy apparatus.  The Minister could direct the user of the apparatus to take such steps, including a complete stoppage of its use, to terminate the interference and failure to comply would be an offence.  In short, this section is concerned with the necessary stopping of loopholes in relation to abuses in local broadcasting.</P>

      <P>The figures contained in the relevant table of the Green Paper on Economic and Social Development 1976-80 relate to the annual estimate of the total labour force, compiled for mid-April of each year.  These estimates which contain, as a constituent, an estimate of the number of persons out of work are derived by annually updating the aggregates obtained from the most recent census of population using various current statistical series.</P>
      <P>The current estimates for the number of persons out of work are obtained by applying the trends in the live register data, excluding persons on short-time working&mdash;to the total persons out of work as given by the 1971 census.  In recent censuses this aggregate has tended to be somewhat lower than the live register total for a comparable date.  While the live register total is comprised almost entirely of applicants for unemployment benefit or assistance, in a census the classification of a person as out of work is determined in a completely independent way, mainly by the respondent's own assessment of his or her economic situation as indicated by the replies to the questions on the census questionaire.

One is that which is <Col N="170" /> most frequently heard in this House, to read off the people on the live register almost all of whom are applicants for unemployment assistance or benefit.  The method involved in the Green Paper to which the Deputy drew attention to is a different one and it is arrived at by observing the trends on the live register and applying those trends to the last solid figure based on a census enumeration of people who regarded themselves and described themselves as &ldquo;out of work&rdquo;.

That might be a reason which will account for some proportion of them.  I offer that simply as a guess.</P>

      <P>The important fact is that the Minister, who is accountable in these matters, can receive representations from any quarter at any time and he is the chairman of the committee.  Representations made to the Minister at any time can be put before the committee.  Ultimately, the Minister will be taking responsibility for the legislation.  This is merely a drafting committee advising him.  The Minister can bring before the committee any representations he considers relevant.  As the Minister is always open to representations the committee, through the Minister, are always open to representations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 15th March, 1974, the closing date for entry for the last Garda entrance competition held in May, 1974, the commissioner has received over 2,800 applications for entry to the force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when these 2,800 applicants applied for consideration for admission as trainee Garda recruits, they were given a leaflet at the local Garda station which contained the conditions for admission to the Garda? It clearly indicated to intending applicants that the leaving certificate with passes in English and Irish would exempt them from doing an entrance examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the details of what is in the leaflet.  I am generally aware that a leaflet is available for the assistance of intending applicants.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

If it was not to act as a guideline for these people in regard to their hopes, aims and ambitions to get into the Garda force, what was the purpose of giving it out at all?</P>

While primal therapy may be acceptable in the United States of America, it is not accepted by the medical profession here.  They do not purport to treat psychiatric ailments.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory criterion for eligibility for a medical card is inability to provide general practitioner services without hardship.  A person whose income is marginally outside the guidelines is not necessarily ineligible.  I would mention that the total number covered by medical cards, which was 1,162,386 at the end of 1975, is now 1,183,903.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the routine six-monthly review which is carried out into eligibility for medical cards was due to be held in July and did not take place?  Is he aware that that review takes cognisance of the consumer price index and as there was a substantial increase in the index, if that review had taken place many more people would have qualified for medical cards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware whether the latter part of the Deputy's statement is correct.  I do not think the Deputy has any need to complain in regard to the cover for people under the general medical service.  I went to the trouble of finding out the figures for Monaghan&mdash;the Deputy must be interested primarily in his own county &mdash;and I discovered that from 1st January, 1973, the number of cards issued was 7,811, and on 30th September this year it was 13,134.  On 1st January, 1973, there were 15,695 holders of medical cards, that is, 33.9 of the population.  On 30th September this year the number of people covered was 26,112, which represents 56.7 per cent of the population.  That is a very steep increase.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure us that the review will take place in January?  He knows himself that the present guidelines are completely unrealistic.  Again on the question of the number of people holding medical cards, surely the Minister is aware that the reason for the increase is not the ordinary families but the number of young people unemployed who immediately they leave school get medical cards?  The cards have been <Col N="190" /> taken from the families wholesale because the guidelines are completely out of touch with the situation.</P>

If there is somebody marginally above it and he is deemed as head of the family not to be able to provide for the services that would normally be provided under the GNS, he could qualify for a medical card. It does not necessarily mean that because somebody's income exceeds what is described as the guidelines by say, 50p, 10p or something like that, he is excluded.  If in the judgment of the CEO, despite the guidelines, this person cannot provide these services for himself and his family, he is by law entitled to a medical card.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no experience of being a member of any of these committees.  The Deputy will appreciate that there is a difference. The health boards are comprised of four or five counties.  I assume that when the regulations were made in 1972, in order to retain an appearance of autonomy the committees were established to ensure that the views of a particular county were put before the health boards.  They are not comparable with the agricultural committees because their functional area is in their particular county.  I said, and the Government have agreed in principle, that a committee will be established with certain terms of reference in regard to the health boards.  I suggest that the desirability or otherwise of the retention of these committees would be one of the matters discussed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>No order of the nature mentioned in the Deputy's question has been made by me.  The need for insurance cover for staff employed in the health services mainly arises in the case of the medical profession.  There are special bodies which provide cover of this nature for doctors.  I have asked the chief executive officers of the health boards to ensure that all <Col N="195" /> conditions of appointment for their medical staff provide that each doctor appointed must be insured against claims arising from malpractice or negligence.  I have also recommended this requirement to voluntary hospitals.</P>
      <P>Health boards and voluntary hospitals carry insurance cover which indemnifies these bodies against claims arising from the malpractice or negligence of their staff.  It is not considered necessary to make the same provision in relation to the other staff as has been made in the case of the medical staff.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Without hard information I would say that doctors are more vulnerable to allegations of negligence and malpractice than other members of the staff.  It would be a greater hazard for them than it would be for the ordinary staff.  The doctors knew there was overall cover for health board staff.  This was a recommendation of the Irish Medical Association and the Irish Medical Union.  As I said, special bodies provide cover of this nature for the doctors.  The normal practice in respect of staff in a case for damages is that the action would be taken against the health board concerned.  In the case of alleged malpractice or negligence against doctors it would be desirable for them to have proper coverage.  I understand from insurance companies dealing with such insurance that a hospital or health board employee other than a doctor would not be sued in his own right.  They say it has not been considered necessary for other staff to carry personal insurance, but there is nothing to prevent them from insuring themselves.</P>

      <P>Not only do we not want to be supplied with figures but I am prepared now to give the Deputy the factual situation with regard to social welfare.  In 1973 when this Government took over from Fianna Fáil the condition of social welfare recipients was to say the least pitiful. The increase in the cost of living which was disclosed in this House by a parliamentary question to the Taoiseach showed an increase of 75 per cent over the three-and-a-half years and the lowest increase in social welfare payments during that period was 105 per cent.  I am aware that not alone is the Deputy confused about what I have stated but other commentators also appear not to have done very simple arithmetic to establish the factual situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already discussed section 1 when we were discussing the Bill on Second Stage because, in effect, there is only one section in this Bill.  The section sets out to cure the position that arose following the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the Rice case, when the court held that alternative verdicts were not open to be found by a non-jury court.  In order to avoid the necessity for excessive pleadings in non-jury courts it was felt that they should be put on the same footing as jury courts with the right to bring in alternative verdicts. The courts in question are the Special Criminal Court and the District Court. The section also deals with the position in the Special Criminal Court where there is a plea of unfitness to plead and it also enables the court to give a verdict of guilty but insane. Paragraph (a) of subsection (1) deals with the Special Criminal Court and paragraph (b) is so drafted as to take into account the position of the District Court.  We felt it necessary to include the District Court because it is a non-jury court and up to now it was assumed, as it was assumed with the Special Court, that it had power to make alternative findings. However, the decision in the Rice case changed that position.</P>
      <P>There has been no decision with regard to the District Court specifically. It is quite clear that the finding in the Rice case would apply to the District Court and the position there has to be accounted for also in the Bill.  For example, if there were a finding of larceny on a charge of housebreaking when only housebreaking was alleged, certainly that could be set aside by virtue of the decision in the Rice case.  Consequently, the Bill is necessary to cure the position in the District Court as well as in the Special Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument was made on Second Stage that this was giving extra jurisdiction to the Special Court, something that was not intended when the courts were originally envisaged in 1939 in the Offences Against the State Act.  As I pointed out in my reply on Second Stage, the answer to that is that the <Col N="205" /> debates in 1939 do not give any substance whatever to the point that the courts were intended to have only very specific jurisdiction.  It was intended that they would have all the jurisdiction of the ordinary criminal courts, the only difference being that they would not have juries.  This was for the regrettable reason that juries were sometimes liable to be intimidated with regard to a particular type of criminal engaged in subversive activities.</P>
    <P>It was always assumed, as it was assumed in the case of the District Court also, that the court had power to make alternative findings, the practice of making alternative findings being a practice in frequent use and of very long standing.  It did not originate with any statute; it was there from the common law itself.  The argument that in some way this gives extra powers to the Special Court that were not originally intended is not an argument that stands up.  The intention was that the Special Criminal Court would have all the powers of the ordinary criminal courts.  It would be exactly the same in the mode of operation and in the procedures of evidential proof required, the one exception being the absence of juries. This is regrettably necessary because of the danger of intimidation.</P>

      <P>On examining the Bill one must come to the conclusion that it is not a Bill that can be amended as it comprises one net point dealing with the jurisdiction of the Special Court.  During the course of the debate on Second Stage we expressed our unhappiness with the way the Minister introduced the Bill. He tried to describe it as a mere procedure Bill.  We made our views well known at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is with us now as a result of the case of Rice v the DPP of last November.  This showed up a loophole in the legislation and six months afterwards the Minister came to this House with the Bill.  At the time we were told there was an immediate urgency in having the Bill passed and having the loopholes blocked.  This urgency, whether expressed by the Minister personally or more correctly expressed by <Col N="206" /> that fantastic source, &ldquo;the official Government spokesman&rdquo;, to correspondents of the House before the introduction of the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Minister may not like to admit it now, there was a certificate of urgency stamped on the introduction of the Bill.  The impression was conveyed that it was urgently required to close the loophole which appeared as a result of the Rice case.  I am pointing out that the Bill was introduced in April, approximately six months after the Rice case, and we are now back on Committee Stage approximately six months later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is not one that can be amended because it comprises one net point dealing with the jurisdiction of the Special Court.  During the course of the debate on Second Stage I expressed certain fears and worries, one in particular dealing with the powers in the Bill.  It appeared that there were powers that would allow a situation to arise whereby the Minister for Defence, Deputy Donegan, could have three Army officers on a court that could decide a person was unfit to plead.  If I am reading something into the Bill that is not there perhaps the Minister will correct me.  It appears to me that a person could be brought before a court comprised of three Army officers who might not have any legal training.  Under this Bill they could come to a decision that a person was unfit to plead and that person could be held until such time as they <Col N="207" /> thought he was fit to plead.  Perhaps the Minister would like to comment on that point for me?  If I am wrong I would like to be corrected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Special Court as presently constituted is composed of judges.  As I have pointed out, it has all the powers of the ordinary criminal courts&mdash;it is a criminal court.  There is provision in the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, for which I was not responsible, which permits the replacement of judges by Army officers in the event of the situation demanding it.  It would be a very extreme situation should that eventuality arise. Nevertheless that eventuality was anticipated in 1939 and it came to pass a number of years ago when the Special Court was composed of Army officers.</P>
      <P>The personnel comprising the court have nothing to do with its jurisdiction. That jurisdiction comes from the 1939 Act.  The intention of that Act was to give it all the powers of the ordinary criminal courts and the personnel comprising it is an incidental matter not related to the jurisdiction of the court but to the exigencies of the time in which it might happen to be sitting.  The exigencies are those relating to security and the incidence of terrorism then prevailing in the State.</P>
      <P>The position is that the Special Criminal Court at the moment is comprised of judges and hopefully it will continue to be comprised of judges of our ordinary courts.  However, there is provision under the 1939 Act for the Special Court to be composed of Army officers.  Should that eventuality arise they would have the same jurisdiction as judges&mdash;full jurisdiction throughout the full ambit of the criminal law.  By virtue of this amending Bill they would also have power to make a finding of &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; or power to find &ldquo;unfit to plead by virtue of insanity&rdquo;.  That is part of the normal procedure of any criminal court and there is nothing significant or sinister in it.  It is part of the normal jurisdiction of a criminal court which is what the Special Criminal Court is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Minister for his contribution and ask him further if, under the 1939 Act, a court comprised of three army officers would have the power to decide that a person was unfit to plead and that the person they decided was unfit to plead could be held at their pleasure. Was that power given to army officers under the 1939 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incorrect to say that any person would be held at the pleasure of the court.  If there is a finding of unfit to plead a person is detained until he becomes fit to plead. The position in 1939 was that it was intended to give full criminal jurisdiction and the full powers of an ordinary criminal court to the Special Court.  It has been assumed since 1939 that the Special Court had such powers until the Rice case, which decided that the court did not have the powers to make a finding of alternative verdicts.  The <i>ratio decidendi</i> in the Rice case was based on the fact that, because there was an absence of juries in the Special Court and the right to bring in alternative verdicts was always related to the presence of a jury, therefore the presence of a jury was necessary before there could be alternative verdicts.  Therefore, in the absence of a jury, alternative verdicts could not be brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a corollary to that, the matters of unfitness to plead, and guilty but insane are, in the statutes concerned, provided for by reference to findings by a jury.  Therefore, it would be a logical extension of the decision in the Rice case to assume there would be a gap in this regard also with regard to the Special Criminal Court which would have to be cured by legislation. The position is that, irrespective of whom the court is comprised, if the persons comprising the court have full criminal jurisdiction and there is a plea before them that the defendant is unfit to plead, they will have to decide on the evidence before them whether or not the plea is justified and, if justified, then arrange for the detention of the person until he becomes fit to plead.  This is the normal procedure in our criminal courts. If we did not have this measure in this <Col N="209" /> Bill, the position would be that the court would be unable to make such a finding and would have to give a discharge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I thank the Minister for his contribution and clarification. However, I hope the Minister will bear with me when I ask if, under the 1939 Act, a court comprised of three army officers had the power to say that a person was unfit to plead and that that person could be held until he was fit to plead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was assumed under the 1939 Act that the Special Court did have such power.  But it would appear from the Rice case that that assumption was ill-founded.  It is to cure that wrong assumption that this Bill is before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that the primary purpose of the Bill&mdash;which we know is here because of the Rice case&mdash;was to ensure that a person could be charged with a lesser charge, as it were.  Perhaps I misinterpreted the Minister last April and what he said since then but I thought that the prime motivation of the Minister and his Department in introducing this Bill was to see to it that in regard to a person charged with an offence&mdash;if that were not proved&mdash;the court could find for a lesser offence.  I did not think&mdash;or perhaps it is just now it is coming to light &mdash;that the reason just given by the Minister was the main one for introducing the Bill.  The Minister says he believes that under the 1939 Act it was assumed that Army officers did have power to hold a person until that person was fit to plead.  During the course of the Second Stage debate on this Bill I argued the case that that in itself would possibly lead to the establishment of a Special Court as a sort of feature because if a person was held to be unfit to plead, then the court would have to be there to decide when that person was fit to plead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very serious matter and is causing me and my party worry.  It is a method used in eastern European countries.  It is a method used for disposing of politically undesirable elements in the eyes of those who may be <Col N="210" /> in government.  I am not going to say that the Minister for Defence, for his next trick, is going to set up a court of three Army officers and decide to get rid of this side of the House in that fashion.  But the Minister can see that it is a very serious situation and one that certainly causes disquiet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>These points were made in the course of the Second Stage debate and were dealt with by me in my reply.  It may be necessary, to put the record straight and to avoid confusion, to recall what we are at. The 1939 Act which set up the Special Criminal Court intended that it would be an ordinary criminal court with the one exception, that it would not have a jury, for the very good reason I have already stated, that jurors have been intimidated, but that it would have the full powers of the ordinary criminal courts.  The ordinary powers of the criminal courts permit them to bring in alternative findings.  That is&mdash;if, for example a person was charged with murder, the court may find manslaughter. It is not necessary for the prosecution to specifically allege manslaughter as well; the lesser offence is encompassed in the greater and the court may bring in the alternative finding.  This has been a common practice and feature of criminal courts since they came into being.  It is something that arose in common law and is also being followed in statute law.</P>
      <P>In addition, ordinary criminal courts are entitled to find in particular cases that a person is unfit to plead, if the allegation to that effect is made on his behalf, and may order him to be detained until he becomes fit to plead. On the other hand, courts may find that a person is fit to plead but at the time he committed the offence was insane and they can bring in a finding of guilty but insane.  These were common powers exercised by the criminal courts from time to time over the years.  The intention was that the Special Criminal Court would have all these powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for interrupting the Minister.  Perhaps the Minister could cover in his reply now in what circumstances or when a <Col N="211" /> Minister would envisage that a court comprised of three Army officers might be set up and how it would be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will allow me to continue my train of thought, I will deal with that.  The 1939 Act set up the Special Criminal Court giving it the power of the ordinary criminal courts in relation to terrorist type crimes, the intention being that it would act in exactly the same manner as the ordinary criminal courts.  As regards its jurisdiction&mdash; and I want to separate its personnel from its jurisdiction&mdash;it had the full criminal law jurisdiction of the State. On the question of the personnel in the court, there was power to have the court comprised either of judges from the ordinary courts or&mdash;speaking from recollection; I have not the 1939 Act before me&mdash;Army officers.  The nature of the personnel comprising the court had no effect on its jurisdiction.  The same jurisdiction would be exercised by the court irrespective of who composed it.  Therefore, any jurisdiction that the Special Criminal Court had could be exercised by the persons comprising it, whether they be judges or Army officers.  That is the position in law.  It is important not to confuse jurisdiction with personnel.  The Act setting up the court did not make any distinction in that regard; it did not say that when the court was composed of Army officers it shall only have so much jurisdiction or that when it is composed of judges it shall only have so much jurisdiction. The legislature of 1939 made no such distinction.  The jurisdiction is exercisable by the court irrespective of whom it is composed of.  Section 39 of the 1939 Act permits the court to be composed of judges or of officers of the Defence Forces.  As I say, who composes the court at any particular time has nothing whatever to do with the jurisdiction of the court.  That is something separate, and the powers of the court something separate.  They have exactly the same powers irrespective of who composes the court at any particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was intended that the Special <Col N="212" /> Criminal Court would have the ordinary jurisdiction of the ordinary criminal courts.  Throughout the years it has acted as if it had such jurisdiction and the matter had never been called into question.  Last year, however, one particular matter was called into question.  On a charge of robbery, the court found a verdict of assault with intent to rob, which was a lesser offence than the actual offence charged.  An appeal was taken by the defence against that on the grounds that the court was not entitled to bring in this alternative verdict because such entitlement only applied to courts sitting with a jury.  The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld that contention. Therefore something which we had always assumed, that the full criminal jurisdiction applied to the Special Criminal Court, was not there in this regard and it had to be cured.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets out to cure that.  The prime motivation&mdash;I make no apology for this&mdash;for introducing this amending legislation was to enable the Special Criminal Court to bring in alternative findings.  In our analysis of the position arising from the Rice case it became quite clear that the same situation existed in the other area where the presence of a jury was referred to in the ordinary <i>corpus</i> of the law, that is in respect of a finding of guilty but insane or a finding of unfit to plead.  The law with regard to both of those matters is set out in the two Acts quoted in subsection (3), which refers to findings by a jury and to a jury being empanelled.  The references are to a jury.  The provisions are on all fours with the provisions relied on by the Special Criminal Court when it made its finding in the Rice case.</P>
    <P>It was quite clear on a preliminary analysis of the position that, if there came a case before the Special Criminal Court, where it found itself constrained to make a finding of guilty but insane that finding would be set aside by virtue of the reasoning in the Rice case.  There is no doubt about that and the person concerned would be acquitted.  Likewise, if the court, as a preliminary matter, made a finding that the defendant was unfit to plead, that also, following the reasoning in <Col N="213" /> the Rice case, would be set aside. There would be no acquittal there because there would be no verdict.  What would happen is that the particular person unfit to plead would be released into the community.  There would be no question of his detention until he became fit to plead.</P>
    <P>It was quite clear on the analysis made, consequent on the Rice case, that not merely would the position with regard to alternative verdicts have to be covered but we would have to go further and cover the position with regard to findings of guilty but insane or findings of unfitness to plead, because both of those in the ordinary <i>corpus</i> of the law only arise following jury decisions.  If the absence of a jury was a defect in respect of alternative verdicts so also would it be a defect in respect of issue of insanity.  That is why the amending legislation was extended to cover more than just the net point of the Rice case.  It was amended to cover this further point that would inevitably at some stage arise in the operation of the Special Court.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins raised a further point.  Suppose, for example, following the passing of this legislation, the Special Court makes a finding of unfit to plead.  The normal procedure is that a person is detained until found fit to plead.  Deputy Collins was worried as to where, if in the meantime the Special Court became disestablished, that person would be brought when he became fit to plead?  As I indicated in reply to the Second Stage debate, at column 549 of the Official Report of 4th May:</P>
    <P>If the Special Court should be disestablished, such a person would then, if his condition improved so that he was fit to stand trial, be brought before the ordinary courts.</P>
    <P>He would probably at that stage have to be brought before the District Court because the offence would probably be an indictable offence and the preliminary hearing would have to be gone through.  We have to remember that the Special Court is part of our courts.  It is special in the sense that there is no jury but it is a criminal <Col N="214" /> court like the other criminal courts. The fact that it is disestablished does not mean that the criminal courts are gone and there is no venue to bring a person found unfit to plead back for trial.  That person, obviously, would come back before the criminal courts of the land.  If the particular court that found him unfit to plead and ordered him to be detained was not there he would be brought to the appropriate criminal court.  It is really straining imagination, language and debate to suggest that in these provisions there was a hidden procedure for some sort of a Star Chamber business whereby the entire Opposition could be found unfit to plead and incarcerated indefinitely. It is making a debating point in such an exaggerated way that it is ludicrous.</P>

The Special Court was not entitled to make it.  Off you go&rdquo;.</P>

Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider widening it somewhat to include the two amendments which I have down and one of which, No. 3, I understand, is out of order and not confine it to the very limited class of societies which are covered by section 46 of the 1896 Acts because in fact there are only about a dozen of these societies which are in a very small way of business?

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 3, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3. &mdash;Part II of the Schedule to the Credit Union Act, 1966, is hereby amended by the substitution of &ldquo;£2,000&rdquo; for &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo; wherever the latter figure appears in the said Part.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes to amend the second part of the Schedule to the Credit Union Act, 1966.  The second part of that Schedule consists of references to and amendments of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896.  A credit union appears to me to be basically an industrial and provident society but it has many of the attributes of a friendly society also, including the limitations which are placed under the Friendly Societies Acts generally on the amount of insurance that a member can be covered for by the society and the amount of deposits or shares which he can hold.</P>
      <P>In talking about credit unions in effect I am talking about friendly societies as amended by the Credit Union Act, 1966 because as well as having some of the attributes of industrial and provident societies, credit unions have many of the restrictions and regulations governing friendly societies generally. Credit unions are by far the most important of this type of society in existence at present.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us previously that there are only 177 friendly societies in the country of which only something like 15 are engaged in actually taking deposits or lending to members or insuring members.  Therefore, what counts are credit unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A limitation is imposed in Part II of the Schedule of the 1966 Act on the amount of deposit or shares and on the amount of insurance that a credit union member may hold.  The figure chosen in 1966 by way of amendment <Col N="217" /> of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, was £1,000 which was probably a reasonable figure at the time but it is now inadequate.  That limit should now be increased.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty has arisen for a number of credit unions about which I should like to have the Parliamentary Secretary's guidance.  It is that while the limitation is expressed in the Credit Union Act to be £1,000 in respect of a member, it is now a frequent occurrence that a member has £1,000 in shares or deposits with the credit union and has also an insurance policy for £1,000 with the credit union in the manner in which he is entitled to have it under the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, and section 25&mdash;I think it is&mdash;of the Credit Union Act, 1966.</P>
    <P>A difficulty has arisen in interpretation as to whether a member is entitled to have both or whether the limitation of £1,000 covers the entire interest of the members in the credit union or friendly society concerned. Perhaps before I go on to the rest of what I have to say the Parliamentary Secretary would be good enough to intervene at this stage to tell me whether in the view of the Department a member is entitled to both or only to a maximum coverage, as it were, between deposits and policy of £1,000.  It would be easier to develop the remainder of the argument then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the reason I am reluctant to accept the amendment in the form in which it is drafted is that there is some doubt about the very point mentioned by the Deputy. To the best of our knowledge the limit applies to both but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>To both accumulatively?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but this is a matter which is still in doubt.  If the Deputy wishes I could outline my general attitude to his amendment at this stage.  It is that I agree with the purpose he has in mind in introducing this amendment but feel it would be more appropriate to deal with this problem by taking a power to make alterations in these limits by regulation in the same way as we are seeking <Col N="218" /> to deal with other matters under this legislation by regulation.  The reason I feel that that would be more appropriate is that it is a more flexible instrument and one can react more quickly to depreciation in the value of money by regulation, whereas if, as is not inconceivable, the new limits which would be put into effect by Deputy O'Malley's amendment were to become irrelevant within the terms of the amendment he has proposed, it would be necessary to bring in new legislation, with all that that implies, to amend those limits.  If we merely took power to deal with the problem, which he has rightly identified, by regulation I think we could cope with it more flexibly and effectively on an on-going basis.  I would propose therefore to introduce an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage in the Seanad which of course, being an amendment introduced at that juncture, would be discussed again in the Dáil if it is accepted by the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not unsatisfactory except that we have a Report Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better to see it there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In principle one used always object in this House to giving regulation power to make regulations of this kind, but when we are talking about monetary limits in things like this I am afraid that, since the advent of the present administration some years ago, it is unwise, because of the rate of inflation they have brought in their train, to limit oneself to even an optimistic forecast of what the value of money might be in a couple of years' time.  Therefore, I go with the Parliamentary Secretary and I thank him for his method of meeting the point I am making.  I go with him in relation to effecting this amendment by way of power to make regulation rather than by the fixed figure which I have here in my amendment.  I would simply make the suggestion that it would be preferable if the amendment was made here on the Report Stage, which could be done tomorrow or even after a short interval, as I <Col N="219" /> understand we have no business until Private Member's Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few difficulties in drafting this power and I would prefer to have enough time to have the amendment drafted properly by the parliamentary draftsman, as the Deputy will appreciate.  It is for that reason that I have suggested that possibly it would be better to introduce it on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  That would allow greater time to anticipate any difficulties there may be in meeting the point which the Deputy made in his original amendment.  If we were to wait for the Report Stage it might mean delaying the Report Stage here in the House for an undue length of time.  As I said, if it is accepted in the Seanad it will come back here anyway for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that under section 35 of the Credit Union Act, 1966, the limitations in the Industrial and Provident Society Acts which are amended by the first part of the Schedule to the 1966 Act are covered in section 35 (1) (i) and the alterations in the financial and monetary limits can be made there by regulation of the Minister.  The amendment we are talking about simply necessitates the adding of the words &ldquo;Part 2&rdquo; to the words &ldquo;Part 1&rdquo; there and we would appear to be able to get over the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I want to make that is associated with this and that was part of the reason for my putting down the amendment, which the Parliamentary Secretary has been good enough to meet in this way, was the fact that difficulty is being encountered at the moment by credit unions in regard to whether or not the insurance policies they carry on the lives of their members or which the members carry on their own lives through the credit unions can be cumulative to the deposits and shares which they have in the credit union. The Parliamentary Secretary has said that he is advised there is some doubt about this.  Unfortunately there is, and I would have hoped that we <Col N="220" /> might possibly have been able to clear this up.  I am aware of two cases where the credit union have been advised that because of doubts that exist they may be taking a risk in paying the money concerned to the people who are entitled to it.</P>
    <P>It is undesirable that that doubt should be there and it is undesirable that the credit unions should find they are inhibited from making payments which they wish to make but about which they are in some doubt about their powers to make.  In particular the problem seems to arise where there is a power of nomination exercised under the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, and where the nomination appears to cover only either the insurance policy, as is usual, or the shares. If a nomination covers one only, the credit unions are in some difficulty as to whom the non-nominated asset should be paid.  I wonder, before we leave the topic, if the Parliamentary Secretary could elucidate all that difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem, whereby we are discussing this matter on this Bill at all, arises from the fact that a regulation in relation to friendly societies was made in essentially very different legislation, under Part 2 of the Schedule of the credit union legislation. This Bill does not deal with credit unions at all and it is merely an accident of legal history that the matter we are dealing with in relation to friendly societies in the amendment which was suggested by the Deputy happens to have been in a credit union Act.  Therefore, in opening up a general discussion on a problem in relation to credit unions, he is extending the discussion well beyond the scope of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>Not really in the sense that the amendment is dealing with friendly societies although amending a Schedule to a Credit Union Act but the Schedule dealt solely with friendly societies not credit unions.  It was just tagged on to the Credit Union Act, 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> The best course of action would be if I could write to the Deputy in the near future giving him the best advice we can find on this matter.  I have not the means of giving a definite answer to any greater extent than I have already given on this problem.  Therefore, I think it would be best to wait and I will communicate with the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete subsection (2), and to substitute therefor:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The registrar of friendly societies may be removed from office by the Minister.  Such removal shall not take effect except on the passage of a motion by each House of the Oireachtas with a two-thirds majority of those voting in each House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I set out the purpose of this amendment in some detail on Second Stage in Volume 293, No. 4, of the Official Report for Wednesday, 27th October last.  The Parliamentary Secretary replied to it at the end of that debate. He did not accept the principle of the case I was making.  While I do not want to go into the full argument made the last day, it is essential that an amendment of this kind should be put down and, if at all possible, accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Registrar of Friendly Societies is not just the registrar of the 170 societies which are actually friendly societies themselves.  He is also the registrar of all building societies in this State, which are immensely important, wealthy and powerful institutions, with a tremendous degree of influence on social and economic affairs.  He is also the registrar of industrial and provident societies. Some of the largest undertakings in this country are industrial and provident societies, such as the Amalgamated Co-Ops where the turnover in the case of some of the big agricultural co-ops in County Cork and elsewhere approaches £100 million a year each.  He is also registrar of credit unions of which there are a great many and which perform a very important <Col N="224" /> function.  He is also registrar in relation to certain functions of trade unions.  While his importance in relation to friendly societies is very limited and it is not of significance who he is or what his powers or functions are, his functions in relation to building societies are immensely important. During the course of the debate on the Bill dealing with building societies in the Seanad, and in this House, our spokesmen tabled amendments on the lines of the one I have tabled to try and ensure that the registrar of building societies, who will have extremely important functions to perform under the building societies legislation, is somebody who is genuinely independent.</P>
    <P>The section does not say that he is independent.  Section 5 states:</P>
    <P>(1)  The registrar of friendly societies shall be paid such remuneration as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, determines.</P>
    <P>(2)  The registrar of friendly societies may be removed from office by the Minister.  The reasons for the removal shall be conveyed to the registrar.</P>
    <P>I have no objections to the rest of the section.  The nub of the problem as far as the registrar is concerned is contained in subsection (2) of that section, that he may be removed from office by the Minister and he must be told privately the reasons for his removal. Therefore, he is entirely a creature of the Minister in the sense that the Minister can appoint him and dismiss him at five minutes' notice.  In effect, he is a civil servant of the Minister, subject to the directions of the Minister.  The Parliamentary Secretary may tell me that legally he has some independence of the Minister in the exercise of his function but in the original Act, where the Minister is referred to as the &ldquo;Treasury&rdquo; it is clear in section 1 that the registrar is very much subservient to the functions of the Treasury which have now been taken over by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>That may well have been appropriate in 1896, when building societies <Col N="225" /> were small and were nothing like as important as they are now.  Industrial provident societies were small and the functions of the registrar were small and, as the Parliamentary Secretary said the last day, they were simply mechanical recordings, recording the information in relation to the societies. He had no real supervisory functions and had very limited inquisitorial functions.  We would envisage that his functions in relation to building societies, for example, would be very different and that he would have a direct control over building societies and the way they conduct their financial affairs.</P>
    <P>A person with that sort of function <i>vis-à-vis</i> enormously important financial institutions here should, in our view, not alone be independent of the Minister but be clearly seen to be that.  Nobody can be independent of a Minister if a Minister can tell that person at two minutes' notice that he is fired.  It is not real to suggest that a person in that situation who is subject to that ultimate sanction at any time is independent of the Minister.  The reason a judge, and a lot of other officials who perform work involving the exercise of independent discretion, cannot be fired except for stated misbehaviour and usually after a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas has been passed, is to ensure that they remain independent.  In approaching building societies and their affairs the registrar should be in a position to take a view that would not necessarily coincide with the personal or political view of the Minister of the day.  He should be able to stand back from the societies, look at them objectively, and deal with them as he felt the national interests, the interests of the public, the depositors and borrowers demanded rather than the conflicting way the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day might think appropriate.</P>
    <P>My amendment suggests that the registrar might be removed from office by the Minister as is provided for in the section but that such removal shall not take effect except on the passage of a motion of each House of the Oireachtas with a two-thirds <Col N="226" /> majority of those voting in each House.  That is to ensure that, if he is removed against his will, there is good reason for removing him.  It gives him the kind of independence that, for example, the Comptroller and Auditor General has.  I am not suggesting that the register of friendly societies will become as important in the State as the Comptroller and Auditor General, whose powers are defined in the Constitution; but, nevertheless, he will be very important.</P>
    <P>Nobody can say today that building societies are not important.  What building societies do has an enormous influence on the economic and social life of the country.  Recently they raised their interest rates to borrowers by 2 per cent and this had a profound effect on an enormous number of people.  They raised the rate of interest they pay to depositors by 1½ per cent when one might have expected that perhaps the two figures would have gone up by the same amount.  These are the questions a truly independent registrar of friendly societies, being in charge of building societies could inquire into.  He could meet the Irish Building Societies Association when they are faced with a situation similar to what they faced in the last couple of weeks when they had to make a decision about interest rates to depositors and borrowers and to discuss the implications of what they are going to do with them.  That could be done in the interests of borrowers and lenders and be independent of the views of the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day.</P>
    <P>How can any man with important functions of that kind to fulfil be independent of a Minister of the day when he may be removed from office by the Minister?  The fact that it has been always that way and that under the terms of section 1 of the 1896 Act he held his office during the pleasure of the Treasury is no argument that it should now be the same, that he should hold his office during the pleasure of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He should not.  These bodies, with the strange exception of <Col N="227" /> friendly societies, over which he exercises control to some extent as registrar, have all become immeasurably more important than they were in the 1890s, particularly the industrial and provident societies, trade unions and building societies.  In addition, there is a whole new area where he has control.  The credit unions are only ten years old but they have already made a very significant impact on social and economic life here.</P>
    <P>The kind of recording registrar who was significant in 1896 is, in my submission, no longer appropriate to the duties now thrust upon him because of the passage of time and the growth in size of the various bodies to which he acts as registrar.  A man holding an office as important as that should, in our view, be independent of the executive of the day.  I am not trying to allege that the present Minister, or any Minister, might try to influence him improperly, but he should not be in a position of a civil servant.  I understand the office has been held by an assistant secretary of the Department.  But this was very much a part-time office and the actual recording duties connected with it could have been delegated to junior officers in the Department and carried out quite competently by them.</P>
    <P>One can envisage this office, particularly in relation to building societies, as being considerably more important than simply recording information. The degree of control to be exercised should be in the context of the enormous turnover of such societies, something in the region of £100 million a year.  Such control should be in the public interest and in the interest of members and creditors of such societies, some of whom are very substantial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment which is a very important one.  I am mainly concerned because of the association the registrar would have with building societies in respect of whom there is a Bill before us which has had its Second Reading and which, I understand, we will be considering in Committee tomorrow.  We <Col N="228" /> would hope that if the Minister for Local Government accepts some of our amendments to that Bill the registrar would have an even more important role to play.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Malley said, the registrar is now dealing with bodies such as building societies, which are enormous financial institutions, and in relation to the Building Societies Bill we are concerned with the powers being given to Ministers.  We should like these powers to be transferred to the registrar, and our argument will be, when that Bill comes before us in Committee, that it is important the registrar should not only be independent but that his independence should be seen.  The inflow of money to building societies depends very much on confidence and we all know that any fears on the part of the public can easily result in an outflow of money from such societies.  Some of these fears might be related to what a Minister in certain circumstances might do.  Deputy O'Malley's amendment is not concerned with the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, but, of course, we do not know who might be Minister for Industry and Commerce at any future time and what such a man would do in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>For that reason we consider that the registrar should be outside the political arena and should not be subject in any way to political pressures&mdash;as Deputy O'Malley has said, that he should have and be seen to have independence.  The role of the registrar in the future will be much more important than in the past, and I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary not just to listen to the arguments put forward by us and rebut them from the point of view of past performances of registrars but to compare the future role of registrar with that of the past, particularly in relation to building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our concern is that, although allowing that the Minister should have the right to remove the registrar from office, such removal should not occur except by motion to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to take a careful look at the amendment <Col N="229" /> and to relate it to present day situations rather than to those obtaining when the original Bill was passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position as proposed by the Deputies opposite is that for some reason not only a majority but an overwhelming majority of Deputies in the House could be frustrated by a minority of Deputies&mdash;47, one-third plus one.  That would mean that not only the wish of the Minister, but of a majority of the House, to remove a registrar would be frustrated.  Giving such a power to a minority of Deputies would be unwise for the very reasons advanced by Deputy O'Malley when he spoke of the importance of these societies and the need to have an efficient, competent man dealing with the functions conferred on the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  If the amendment were accepted we could have a situation where there would not be a registrar functioning or if there was that he would be functioning in the eye of violent controversy.</P>
      <P>It is conceivable that it might be necessary to remove the registrar very quickly for some of the reasons advanced by the Deputies opposite. For instance, he might become affected by some mental illness or by alcoholism and consequently not be able to perform very important functions in relation to large amounts of money.  It might become necessary to remove him quickly without having a full-dress debate in the House as to the reasons for his removal, without having his medical history explained not to a majority of Deputies but to one-third of the Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Acceptance of the amendment would work very strongly against the objectives the Deputies have in mind. Their objectives would be served by the Minister who is accountable to this House at Question Time and during debate but who would have the power to remove the registrar at short notice in the sort of circumstances I have in mind.  I agree that it is very important that the Minister would not exercise this power or threaten to use it in any capricious or political manner. It is difficult to safeguard completely <Col N="230" /> against such eventuality apart from the ultimate control which lies in the fact that the Minister must answer to this House and ultimately to the electorate.  I would be prepared to consider some form of amendment whereby if the Minister decided to remove a registrar, he could do so immediately but would have to make a statement to the House or to lay some statement before the House subsequently, giving reasons for his action.  The time factor is one of the big problems of the Opposition's amendment.  In addition to the normal check on the exercise of power by Ministers, that check will be sufficient to ensure both the efficiency of the exercise of the powers of the office and to safeguard against political activity on the part of the Minister in regard to the registrar.</P>
    <P>At present the registrar is required to furnish to this House an annual report of his activities and if any Deputy considers that the registrar is being influenced unduly by a Minister, such Deputy can take steps to seek a discussion on the registrar's annual report in addition to questioning the Minister about the matter here.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley used a term which I would repudiate because it is a term which cannot be helpful.  He said that in effect the registrar would be a creature of the Minister.  Manifestly this is not the case.  The powers of the registrar are statutory.  Consequently, he is responsible to this House in relation to the exercise of the powers conferred on him by this House.  In no event are these powers susceptible to intervention by the Minister.  We can be satisfied that the best interests of the societies referred to by the Deputies opposite will be served by retaining the section basically as it is but possibly with some amendments along the lines I have indicated, that is, to provide that the Minister must account for any moves he makes in relation to the removal of the registrar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the Parliamentary Secretary has met the point we raised.  An ordinary civil servant has much greater tenure of office than has the Registrar of <Col N="231" /> Friendly Societies under subsection (2) of this section.  The Minister cannot approach a civil servant and tell him he is being removed from his job because the civil servant has enormous statutory protection under the various Acts relating to the civil service.  It is very difficult to dismiss a civil servant even when there is good reason for so doing.  His dismissal would require a decision of the Government under seal.  Therefore, why should the Registrar of Friendly Societies not be in a similar position in relation to his job which is more important than the jobs of the majority of civil servants?</P>

      <P>I sympathise fully with the point the Deputy is making in so far as it is intended to prevent this Minister or any successive Minister from exercising a political role in dismissing a registrar.  I am prepared to consider ways and means whereby this power can be restrained by providing that the Minister resort to a certain procedure which would be quick enough to deal with the problem. On reflection I do not think the Deputy would consider his amendment to be correct because it goes much too far and would be a handicap rather than a benefit.</P>

      <P>If he is a public servant and is appointed to this job I presume it will be by way of secondment and he will not lose his various benefits as a civil servant.  If, for example, the Minister wants to get rid of him for good reason, or otherwise, he can always be retained in the civil service.  He can be banished to some far distant place without losing his emoluments and other things civil servants have.  For example, he could be made adviser to the Kerry sheep dipping committee or some other post of equal responsibility in a distant part of Ireland.</P>
      <P>If he is not a public servant in that situation and he is just a member of the public who is recruited for this very important job and he falls foul of the Minister, he is out on the street.  He has no income.  He has no pension.  He has no lump sum.  He has nothing.  Because he falls foul of the Minister he is out on his ear.  He cannot be appointed to some sinecure in the public service in some place or other to protect his pension rights, his years of service, and so on.  He is out on the street.  While there might possibly be some justification for some of what the Parliamentary Secretary is saying if a public servant is appointed, I can only assume from this that it will not be a public servant and it need not always be a public servant.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I can help the Deputy by giving him a practical indication of our intentions which are to appoint somebody with professional accountancy experience.  It is pretty clear that the sort of work involved here is not the barrister of ten years' standing sort of work, that being the qualification hitherto.  As the Deputy probably knows, there are not that many professional accountants in the public service.  While one could not rule out the possibility that one of them might be appointed and, being appointed, he would retain his rights as would any public servant who is seconded to another post, it is likely that it will not be a public servant.  I still believe in the validity of the argument I made that the check which exists on the Minister in the exercise of these powers as a result of the necessity for him to answer questions on the matter here in the House far supercedes the negligible advantages which might arise from the proposed amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say it is proposed that the registrar will be independent. We visualised a person who would be independent and who would have a professional staff to advise him.  This relates in particular to the building societies.  We felt that because of changes of staff in the civil service who dealt with building societies in the past, the expertise which they gathered or accumulated during their time dealing with building societies was lost once they went into another area and somebody else had to start again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we are pleased with what the Parliamentary Secretary has told us, that makes it all the more important that he should have a safeguard and the Minister should not be able to remove him from office without any reference to the Oireachtas.  I want to emphasise that, apart from <Col N="234" /> what Deputy O'Malley said, that is, that a person could be removed from office and would not have a salary, a pension or any other emolument, it is of vital importance that the public should see&mdash;I am sure this relates to all the friendly societies but basically I am concerned with the building societies&mdash;that this individual was not in a position where he could be unduly influenced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, money flows in and out of the building societies.  It is important that people investing money should have confidence that the societies are governed by somebody who will be basically concerned with the interests of the societies, their members and borrowers and their objectives, rather than with some political objectives.  There have been considerable fluctuations in the intake of money into building societies over the years.  In itself this has done a certain amount of damage to confidence in the societies, and it has done damage to the building and construction industry.  Therefore, I would again suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should take another very thorough look at this amendment. If he is not satisfied to accept it in its present form, he could introduce an amendment which would be as close as possible in its effect to our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now established the position that it is extremely likely that the appointment of the Registrar of Friendly Societies will be that of a man who is not in the public service, who is a practising accountant with a good deal of experience and knowledge.  I am totally in favour of that, so much so that I should actually like to see it written into the Bill.  I am in total agreement with this proposal.  I most certainly hope it will be adhered to because it is the ideal type of appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> If the Parliamentary Secretary were a practising chartered accountant in Dublin, Cork or Limerick with a substantial practice and therefore, one would assume a substantial income, and if he were a man with the high level of competence one would wish for to fill this post, would he apply for the job on the terms of section 5 (2) which means he could be kicked out on the street at a minute's notice, without compensation of any kind, simply because he fell foul in some way, perhaps political, or perhaps personal, or perhaps in some irrelevant way, of the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his shortly to be appointed Fianna Fáil successor?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the unfortunate chartered accountant, or whatever kind of accountant he might be, who might consider applying for the job would think twice about it. The Parliamentary Secretary does not realise that by refusing to accept this amendment to give some security of tenure to the people who might apply for this job, he is ensuring that the best type of people will not apply.  No one who has a good income at the moment could afford to take the risk of going into a job which he can be thrown out of at five minutes' notice, provided he is given some kind of formal reason in respect of which there is no appeal. That is an impossible position.  We have established that the man will not be a public servant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has a high degree of likelihood, a fact with which I am in total agreement.  If he were a public servant he could be put into a sinecure or some other job for which he might be more suited, but he would not be in the position of the outsider, a nonpublic servant who would have no right to compensation of any kind on being thrown out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that is good enough.  I am not harping on this to protect the man who gets the job, because I do <Col N="236" /> not know who will get it.  I am harping on it to ensure that we get the right man for it.  We will not get a first-class man for a post like this under these terms.  A first-class man who would be suitable for such a position must by definition be earning a lot of money today.  He is probably a partner in a firm of chartered accountants with his whole future secure.  He is not going to put his whole financial future and that of his wife and children in jeopardy to take on a job the terms of which are set out here in subsection (2), that he can be fired at five minutes' notice.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider this matter and not put himself and all of us in the position of being forced to take someone less than the best available for this very important job because of the terms under which he will serve and, in particular, the total absence of security and tenure for him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is looking at this matter from the point of view solely of the registrar and his problems. We must look at it from the point of view of security of the people who are involved with all the societies which are subject to supervision by the registrar.  In a situation where a registrar is completely incompetent for one reason or another, he can cling on to office because he knows, if the Deputy's amendment were accepted, he could not be removed unless two-thirds&mdash;not a majority&mdash; but two-thirds of the House were prepared to agree to his removal.  If that were the only means whereby he could be removed and if all the sordid details had to be thrashed out in this House, under a motion for his removal which would have to be sufficiently strongly argued to persuade two-thirds of the House to accept, it is quite clear he would be retained in office much longer than he would normally be and much longer after he had become incompetent than would be desirable in the interests of the public, the people involved with the societies, the friendly societies, the building societies, the credit unions, the trade unions and so forth who are so significantly affected by the operations <Col N="237" /> of the registrar.  I believe the acceptance of the amendment put forward by the Opposition would be a very dangerous move and I would not be inclined to accept it at all.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that Ministers will exercise the greatest discretion in this matter.  They will not interfere in an improper way&mdash;and that applies to Ministers of the parties in this House who might hold office at any time&mdash; with the registrar in the exercise of his functions.  We have only to look at the experience in the past in relation to similar offices, for instance, the Registrar of Companies or the Examiner of Restrictive Practices. There has been no interference by any Minister with those people although, in theory, their position is the same as will be the position of the Registrar of Friendly Societies under this legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not expect it would carry much weight with any Deputies in this House if I put forward this argument, but nonetheless it has a practical validity and relevance, that is, that the similar officer in Britain, the chief registrar, is removable by the Treasury in the same way as it is proposed that this officer could be removed under this legislation.  There is no problem there any more than there is a problem here, and I do not think we should get involved in what is essentially an academic point being made by the Deputies opposite on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said, and I repeat, that I am prepared to consider any amendment which would make the Minister account more fully than he may have to do under the present legislation for any decision he makes to dismiss the registrar subsequent to the dismissal. However, it is essential in the interests of the people involved that, if it arises &mdash;and this is unlikely&mdash;that the registrar, because he is incompetent, has to be removed quickly from office, the Minister will have the power as a duly elected representative of the people to remove him quickly and account for it afterwards.  That is preferable to having him hanging on in office, not doing his job, while the Minister waits&mdash;and it may be a long wait&mdash;to get two-thirds of this House <Col N="238" /> to agree with the decision which, perhaps for reasons the Minister would not be inclined to disclose publicly, would be absolutely necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said we were concerning ourselves too much with the registrar. As Deputy O'Malley pointed out, we are not concerned with the registrar as a person; we are concerned with the position and those who fill that position later on, because of their vulnerability.  The Parliamentary Secretary then went on to say that what we ought to be concerned about were the interests of the people for whom the registrar would be responsible, like those who would be involved in the friendly societies and so on.  That is exactly what we are concerned about.  If a post is advertised and if the conditions are as laid down here, that the Minister can remove the registrar at will, then, quite obviously, the applications you will get for that post will come from people who are at a relatively low scale in salary and will be willing to take the chance for the increase they will get but, as we know from experience, really worth-while people, people who are possibly at the top of their profession will not apply.  I have seen this happen not just in relation to this post of registrar but in relation to management in industry.  I have seen cases where an industry was not doing as well as it might but which had potential, when it advertised for a manager it got a very large number of applications from people in the lower income bracket who, if they were put in charge of the industry would not be long finishing it off.  It was just fortunate that there were one or two applicants of quality who applied and one of them got the position and made an excellent job of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same thing applies here.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is not willing to make a worth-while, basic change in that section, then I am afraid those who will apply for this position will not be of the quality we want.  There is no doubt that we want a first-class person to be appointed as registrar. Deputy O'Malley pointed out the problems and difficulties in relation to <Col N="239" /> it and, as I said previously, if the Parliamentary Secretary was willing to introduce an amendment which would relate to the idea we have here and which would satisfy us, we would not continue to press this specific amendment. We would accept an amendment which would ensure that the Minister could not dismiss the registrar without referring the matter to somebody else.

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has been making the case that if this man were to be dismissed in the way we suggest it would entail a long involved procedure with a full and rather lurid debate in this House. That is not so.  Assuming it is a reasonable dismissal all it entails is privately to inform the Leader of the Opposition of the reasons for the dismissal. An unopposed motion would then be moved and it would take a short time to do it.</P>

      <P>One is entitled to assume that of the present Opposition. When the Parliamentary Secretary is around a bit longer he might realise that there is a big difference between this Opposition and some of its predecessors. In connection with the Parliamentary Secretary's comment that no Minister of this or of any other Government would dismiss a person out of hand, it is no harm to remind him of the treatment that was meted out by the present holder of the office of Minister for Defence to Lieutenant-General Seán Mac Eóin, a former Chief-of-Staff of our forces and of the United Nations Forces.  He was informed of his dismissal as Chairman of the Army Pensions Board by telephone.  It is no harm to remind the Parliamentary <Col N="240" /> Secretary of members of public boards who were informed that they were fired only when they arrived for the next meeting of their boards and were stopped by a porter from entering the rooms where the meetings were to take place.  The Parliamentary Secretary should remember these things when he talks about arbitrary dismissal.</P>

If, as a result of that reshuffle, the office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce were filled by the present occupant of the office of Minister for Defence, could the registrar have any hope that he would last longer than a day or two?  In view of the fact that a public servant is not to be appointed to this position it is clear that the appointee should have the kind of protection we are seeking for him.  We are not seeking it for his own personal protection.  We are seeking it for the office in order that the applicants will be of the highest calibre and of the highest standing in the practice of their profession of accountancy.  It is in the public interest that this amendment should be accepted.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider his attitude.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 18, to delete &ldquo;branch&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;branch,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This could be described as a syntactic amendment.  It seeks to insert a comma between the word &ldquo;branch&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in line 18.  As this part of section 84 stands, an offence is created by a &ldquo;branch officer&rdquo; under subparagraph (a). Clearly it should relate to a branch or to an officer and hence the insertion of the comma.  The prints of the Principal Act in use in the Registry of Friendly Societies are also erroneous in that they omit this comma but in the text of section 84 contained in the publication of that eminent authority on society law, Frank Baden Butler, barrister-at-law, the comma is appropriately included.  For these reasons it was felt wise to insert the <Col N="244" /> comma here and hence the amendment.</P>

      <P>Last evening I concluded by outlining the effects of the Coalition's continuing crime against the young and the not-so-young unemployed citizen, a crime which can be absolved only by the provision of housing.  I dealt in some considerable depth with the effects on the unemployed and with that aspect of the motion dealing with employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had just broken into the question of housing in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  I had begun by giving a number of figures in relation to applicants on the housing list from 1972 to 1976.  The number of applicants in the normal way in 1972 was 520 plus 58 old folk.  In 1973 the number of applicants for housing in the normal way was 576 plus 70 old folk.  In 1974 it was 620 plus 102 old folk.  In 1975, 540 plus 80 old folk, and in 1976, there are still 618 applicants awaiting housing in the borough plus 87 old folk.  Let us be clear about it&mdash;the number of applicants on the housing list in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire does not reveal immediately the number in each applicant's family.  I am taking it <Col N="245" /> that, once a couple have two children, their prospect of housing becomes a reality.  The average four-member family multiplied by 618 gives a figure of 2,472 people in immediate need of rehousing in that borough.  That is an appalling commentary on a Coalition Government who pride themselves on their housing record.  When I say 2,472 people I am probably grossly underestimating the number of people in urgent need of rehousing in that borough.</P>
    <P>The Coalition can take full credit for the building to date, in their four-year period of office, of 56 houses as yet uncompleted in the area.  Twenty-seven of those 56 houses fall due for occupation in December next and 29 in May of next year.  Of course, there is land in course of development for housing in the Ballybrack area. Nevertheless, the figures I have given are an appalling commentary on the Coalition's crime, as it were, against the people of that borough, in the first instance, on the employment front, the lack of job opportunity and, secondly, their entitlement, as a civic right, to housing.  In 1974-75 there were 34 flatlets completed at Brookfield Lawn, Blackrock, for old folk. In 1976 there were 18 flatlets completed at Rochestown House for old folk.  In relation to those two complexes, let me say that they are extremely well appointed.  The officials of the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, architects, builders and so on, are to be congratulated for the thought that went into them.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect worthy of repetition in the context of a discussion on housing, particularly during a housing crisis&mdash;and we have a housing crisis on our hands at present&mdash; there may be some people who pretend that they can get houses for applicants.  They may be public representatives or others but the facts do not bear that situation out.  In that respect let me pay tribute to the housing officials of the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and the Dublin County Council.  They are people of the very highest integrity.  Certainly they deal with public representatives' inquiries in the fairest possible way.  However, <Col N="246" /> all a public representative can do in relation to housing is make representations to the local authority involved. Then the points system operates&mdash;certainly in the Dún Laoghaire area&mdash; and when a person reaches an accumulated number of points he is entitled to a house.  That is the reality of public representation on the housing front.</P>
    <P>I hope the House and the people, who come to us looking for housing, will not be misled in relation to this very important principle.  A Dáil Deputy or a public representative has an obligation, when a person comes inquiring about housing, to outline, before representations are made exactly what part he or she can play in the provision of a house for the applicant.  That is the reality of the situation and it is as well to spell it out.</P>
    <P>A quarter of the total work force, 25,000, in the building industry are unemployed, plus workers in the ancillary industries that supply the building and construction industry, because of Coalition housing policy. That is an ascertainable and stated fact.  It is also an ascertainable fact that fewer houses were built in the public and private sectors in the first six months of 1976 compared with the same period in 1975.  My figures indicate that a total of 1,800 fewer houses were built in the first six months of this year, compared with the same period last year.  That also is an ascertainable fact.</P>
    <P>The situation is not all doom and gloom.  It is important to recognise that for the first time a man and a women can have their home in their joint names.  This is a very important matter and the Coalition must take credit for it.  We have heard of new instructions emanating from the Minister for Local Government in relation to housing maintenance grants.  We have been told that county councils will have to take responsibility for the maintenance of houses. This is an extremely retrograde step. I have considerable experience in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire in relation to this matter.  As well as the many people who come to me each <Col N="247" /> month inquiring for houses many people come to me inquiring about maintenance.  While it is important that we have new houses it is equally important that we do not let our older houses go into disrepair.  The policy maintained by the Minister for Local Government in cutting back maintenance grants to the local authorities is bringing about a situation in which housing repairs cannot be conducted in the fashion they were before this.</P>
    <P>I do not have to stress the social need of a house for a man, his wife and family.  It appears that before a young couple can even think of obtaining a house they have to produce a certain number of children. I know it is proper that they should have a family but the circumstances in some cases are such that a man or woman has to live with his or her father and during that time, which may be three, four or five years before they can get a house, they have a family of two, three or four children.  The new family, the man, his wife and children, are additional to the existing family in that house. In some instances in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire ten and even 12 people are living in some houses which are suitable only for a family of five or six.  The people of Dún Laoghaire are entitled, as of right, to both housing and work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be afforded the opportunity this evening to speak on this motion.  One must be amused at the hypocrisy of the Fianna Fáil Party in putting down this motion. One should examine our record in housing since we came into Government in March, 1973.  Housing in the centre of Dublin was completely ignored by Fianna Fáil.  In 1965-66 Dublin Corporation, after considerable expense, assembled a first-class site in City Quay, an area deprived of housing for many years. People felt that we would get life back into the centre of the city and things would start moving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the CPO came before the Minister in 1968 he flatly turned it down and said: &ldquo;No. No housing for <Col N="248" /> the centre city of Dublin, wherever else we might build them.&rdquo;  We must compare that with what is going on now.  The first thing the Minister did after taking office was to appoint&mdash;he saw the shambles left by the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;a housing co-ordinator for Dublin city, county and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  The present City Manager, Mr. Molloy, a first-class official, assembled the site in City Quay which, if it had been confirmed the year before, would have saved the Exchequer millions of pounds on development. The Minister, although he realised that the land was dear, recognised a great social need.  He confirmed that CPO.  That site is in the hands of the architects to design not sub-standard but first-class, well designed houses.  In this area in the centre of the city the doors were thrown open for the first time to all architects to play a meaningful role in housing development. A total of 85 architectural firms entered this competition.  As a result, we now have well designed and properly developed housing for the future.</P>
    <P>We must compare that with the type of housing provided by Fianna Fáil, which they called low cost housing.  It was low standard bad housing., on which we now have to spend a fortune repairing.  This is a typical example of cutting back in areas we should have been concerned about.  In Dublin city we got £11.7 million last year for local authority housing and this year we got £23.7 million.  I cannot understand how the Opposition have the gall to put down this type of motion.  I suppose when you are an inept Opposition and short of ideas you tend to grasp at any straw.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised 25,000 houses a year, a figure he has exceeded each year.  The facts and the figures are there.  Under this Government houses did not fall down on people and kill them because we are concerned.  The same cannot be said for the far side of this House.  There is talk about jobs in the centre city.  Who is responsible this House.  There is talk about jobs in the centre city.  Who is responsible for the down-turn, for the lack of investment in the city only the Fianna Government who denied any incentive to people to come in and develop employment? This Government saw the <Col N="249" /> need and there are now grants available and people can come in and it is worth their while to set up industry in Dublin.  The Leader of the Opposition as far as I am aware spoke against this when it was mooted; some members of the Opposition spoke in favour of it&mdash;to be fair.  There was a deliberate policy over the years to neglect Dublin city.  It was denuded of houses.  They were allowed to fall down or were knocked down with no attempt made to replace them except to let in their Tacateer friends to develop office blocks with no regard for community interests.  The same applied to industry.  That is why we have a serious unemployment situation in Dublin&mdash;because of neglect over the years.  Fianna Fáil could well ponder their mistakes but let them not try to encumber us with them.  We are at present in the process of rebuilding the centre of Dublin city.  Because of our grants scheme we are in the process of bringing back industry and giving the city centre real life again.  We must deplore the hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil. The present Government have served Dublin well.  They saw its needs and are looking after it.  I should like to speak for longer but my time is limited.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I am a very naive politician but I had hoped that when this motion was put down we would have had contributions from the Government side aimed at solving the problems facing Dublin and not merely trying to shift the blame to Fianna Fáil when they governed the country.  I am very much aware of the problems of this city but I share this concern with the Minister for Labour, Deputy O'Leary who has said that in terms of job loss Dublin city is a distressed area. Recently the Lord Mayor of Dublin who, no doubt, is aware of the city's problems said that Dublin is the new distress area with up to 20 per cent of the people out of work; the city centre dying and the housing problem getting worse.  Here we have the Minister for Labour, a colleague of the Minister for Local Government, saying this and the <Col N="250" /> Lord Mayor of Dublin also speaking on the same point.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that the city is dying but it is very ill.  Some of that illness is due to Government ineptitude on social problems.  Whether the Government accept my word or not they must take cognisance of statements by a Minister and by the Lord Mayor of Dublin.  I am sufficiently optimistic to hope that if the Government will now look at the problems we are trying to highlight and take immediate action the city can be made a place that is no longer a distressed area or a city of which the Lord Mayor will say that its centre is dying.  If there was sufficient goodwill on the Government's side we could have got together to work out solutions for this ailing city where thousands of youngsters leaving school cannot get jobs, where the housing list is growing, where young couples and old couples are on the waiting list without much hope of being rehoused in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>We have many social problems for which I do not blame the Government although these problems may be caused partly by poor housing.  Generally, the picture of the city is not improving and its problems are becoming greater.  Instead of getting a solution to these problems we have to sit here and take abuse from the Government side.  I shall not try to make political capital out of this situation but I want to show that we are concerned and we are showing that by raising that matter in the House. I do not want it to be thought that I am speaking only for those who believe in my party because the poverty of the city&mdash;poverty of houses and employment&mdash;is shared by all citizens, the under-privileged ones who have no proper housing or jobs or even proper educational opportunities, irrespective of their political allegiance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must take the Minister for Local Government to task.  He has a black mark against Dublin.  At the same time, I do not blame him entirely because the collective responsibility of the Cabinet is a big factor in a democratic government.  If the Minister <Col N="251" /> has failed to do certain things, we must also take his colleagues to task in the hope that they will impress on him the need to do something for the greater Dublin area which has one third of the total population and must, therefore, get some special treatment.  The Minister may say that he has sanctioned schemes here and here but the point is that enough has not been done.  The housing waiting list is growing according to official figures.</P>
    <P>The city council has been treated pretty badly by the Minister for Local Government.  A week ago last Saturday I read about a new directive given by the Minister on the capital moneys programme for Dublin city under which the Minister was withdrawing some £3 million we had expected. This would mean that the city council would have to seek a further increase of 75p in the rates. I could not get a copy of the Minister's statement anywhere as it was Saturday morning but I expected to get it in the post on Monday.  It was not in Monday's post either.  I went over to the City Hall to the Dublin Corporation housing department and asked for a copy of the Minister's statement.  I got it then.  I want to point out to the Minister that some members of his own party even up to Wednesday were not aware of the contents of his circular and I understand also that this circular was not sent to the City Hall before closing time.  How are we to run a city if we are not told what is going to happen unless we read it in the daily papers? If the Minister has to cut back on housing moneys or on any capital moneys for any city&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was the Minister's statement I mentioned, not subsidy. I will generalise and say OK, the Minister's statement was issued on Friday night.  Had the Minister been in trouble financially and brought us in and said: &ldquo;Look, the situation is bad.  I have got to cut back on all cities, towns and villages.  Let us see what we can do&rdquo;, that would have been all right, but we were told: &ldquo;No, you take that.  It worked out at 75p in the £.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister is making people cynical of the role that local government plays in running a city or county.  People are looking on the city council now as a mere tool of central Government.  The only power they had was to strike the rates and they felt they had some power.  They were able to strike a rate, or on one occasion not to strike a rate and pay the penalty.  Next Monday the city council meets to strike a rate or look at estimates.  We have not seen the new estimates yet and this is Wednesday evening, but we will probably get them in a day or two and we will make up our minds by Monday what we will do then.  The fact is that the Dublin City Council will not be striking the rate.  They will be striking the rate dictated by the Minister, and the Minister may well plead that because of the financial emergency of the time he has got to take steps to correct the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let him remember that we as elected members&mdash;and there are members of his own party on the city council and I pay tribute to all the members there&mdash;try to do a good job on this city of ours.  The Minister is preventing us from doing a proper job by his attitude in many cases.  We on the city council are being criticised by the country generally because we are owed £1½ million in rent. Unread again the Minister acts.  He does all the negotiations with the tenants' organisations.  We are not <Col N="253" /> consulted.  We have to accept the settlement made.  A lot of these arrears arose because when the Minister made a settlement two years ago&mdash;he can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;he gave the impression that arrears were not a thing of great priority with Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The impression in the city is that the Minister had intimated to the people that they could clear off their arrears in two years.  Of course the arrears went up and up. At the time I met some squatters whom I have opposed all the time and I said that under no circumstances would I aid them in any way, that they would have to leave the houses they squatted in.  One person told me the Minister also had the same view about squatting, that people would squat.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that this is the impression felt because of the Minister's attitude to Dublin city.  The people who quote him quote him wrongly at times and, indeed, they quote us all wrongly at times.  But even at this late stage the Minister can do a lot for Dublin by at least telling us of his intentions as regards the help we get from central funds in good time so that we can prepare a proper rate.  We are being attacked in lots of places because we have such huge arrears on our rents bill.  It is wrong that we have this, but it was not of our making.  Now we have to try to collect this money when a lot of our authority is gone in the eyes of the people because of the Minister's attitude to us.</P>
      <P>The Minister boasts then of the number of houses he has built.  How many houses were built?  I welcome every house that is built whether in the centre of the city or outside.  But I do say that on one occasion the Minister gave a planning permission which means that eight family groups are under notice of eviction because of that permission&mdash;not eight full families, there are one or two individuals in it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling the truth. I have been down very often in that area.  I represent it both here and on the city council and this is the truth. If the Minister could rescind that I would be behind him 100 per cent. This is the type of thing that is happening. Even though houses have been built we are losing houses by that kind of decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we give the Minister more figures he can examine them too.  Regarding SDA loans, I admit that in Dublin city there is very little land left from the sea boundary for SDA loans.  At the same time, in 1975 there were 182 loans given for new houses in the city area.  For nine months of 1976 there were 42&mdash;a big drop.  On old or previously occupied houses last year 590 loans were given.  For nine months of this year 200 loans were given.  In the county last year there were 446 loans for new houses and this year for the same period there were 290. I tell the Minister that we do not glory in these figures.  We are trying to bring home to him that there is something wrong in this city that people cannot for some reason avail of the money that is there.  The Minister said that <Col N="256" /> he is able to take money out of SDA funds and apply it to sanitary services. I accept his word on this but why was he able to do it?  Because people could not afford to take out loans because of the restriction on a loan up to £4,500 and the income limit of roughly £46 per week.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the Minister were to raise the loan and income limits he would give the building industry a shot in the arm which it needs and give couples and families generally the opportunity of acquiring a house, old or new.  If it is a new house so much the better.  In an industry where there are so many unemployed the Minister should convert his colleagues to the view that the construction industry in Dublin especially needs an injection of capital and initiative.  If he does that he will have done a good day's work for this city.  The building industry is not in the best of health.  It will not improve unless we, the national Parliament and the local authorities, bring about some improvements.  I believe the will is there to overcome our financial problems.  We should convince the people that we are in earnest in trying to improve the housing and employment situations.</P>
    <P>There are other problems for other agencies to solve.  I do not avail of every opportunity to attack the Government by saying that everything is wrong in this city.  Everything is not wrong.  We have our problems certainly, but we will overcome them. In my view, we should not have to go through a period of political attrition because the Coalition are in power.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the biggest part to play in giving this city a fair break. Although he may trot out official figures he should bear in mind the statement by the Minister for Labour that Dublin is a distress area in terms of job loss and the statement of the Lord Mayor that the housing problem is getting worse and the centre of the city is dying.  Fianna Fáil cannot be accused of saying that, although we may repeat it.  I do not believe the centre of the city is dying but I believe it is very ill.  Because our school leavers for the past three years have <Col N="257" /> not been able to get any jobs, and we may be sitting on a social bomb, I will not indulge tonight in any form of Government baiting.  I used official figures here and everything I said tonight was a plea, on behalf of the people who are not properly housed or who do not have jobs that the Government will recognise that they have a man-size problem on their doorstep.  They must do something to change their policy towards this city.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, next Monday night we will meet to review the new estimates brought about by the Minister's action.  Last week he promised that a further letter would issue to the corporation.  While I do not expect him to divulge the contents of that letter, I want to put on record that I am avidly awaiting a sight of that letter in the hope that it will mean extra help for this city, otherwise, many families will find the new impost on the rates impossible to bear.  So too will many small businesses.  A small businessman will immediately start to economise, perhaps by letting one or more workers go.  It will especially affect young people buying new houses. I know one young man who at the moment has a loan&mdash;not an SDA loan &mdash;and his repayments are £25 a week. That does not include rates or ground rent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was a previously occupied house.  This young man will now have to meet the new rate.  It gives me no pleasure to recite this litany of sadness about the people who have to meet the new impost which the Minister's decision will create.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even at this late hour the Minister should impress on his colleagues in Government the need to come forward with a bold policy of efficiency to cure the ills which his colleague, the Minister for Labour, and the Lord Mayor say exist in Dublin.  They were more critical of the Minister than I.  Both men have access to statistics which are not available to me.  As I said, I am quoting statistics received from the <Col N="258" /> Department of Local Government and the local authority.  They all add up to the fact that this old city&mdash;one of the oldest in Europe&mdash;is going through a very bad time.  When I say &ldquo;the city&rdquo; I mean of course the people.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give the people in the greater Dublin area some hope that we can tackle the major housing and unemployment problems. Each year 6,000 young people come to this city from the provinces and we welcome them.  Unless the Minister takes effective measures the illnesses of this city will grow worse and next year whoever takes his place will have to face the more difficult task of trying to cure the illnesses of Dublin city in particular and the greater Dublin area in general.</P>
    <P>Roughly one-third of the total population live in this area.  Therefore, whether it is agreeable or not, this area must get special treatment.  All the members of the city council, the corporation, the county council and the Borough Council of Dún Laoghaire are playing their part.  Unless we get generous Government help, or even fulfilment of their promises, the Minister will see social problems unlike any seen in Ireland heretofore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are wasting time. This is the third such motion in a short period and all I can say is that <Col N="259" /> Fianna Fáil must be gluttons for punishment.  Their record is so bad, particularly in respect of Dublin housing, that I did not think they would dare to come back with a motion of this kind.  As well, they sent in people who completely misstated the case.  Perhaps the Deputies who made these statements thought they were right.  Perhaps their think-tank went wrong again.  All I can say to them is that they should get a mechanic to look after it because some of the material they trotted out here was so ludicrous that it does not help their case one iota.</P>
      <P>It was with some reluctance that I decided to intervene in this debate and I should like to commiserate with the House for having to listen to the same old trite misstatements by Deputies opposite on the same old hackneyed topics&mdash;comments which have done, and can do, nothing to add one house to the national output or put one extra man into employment.</P>
      <P>I am speaking on this occasion only because I feel it is necessary once again to substitute the truth for some of the false statements made, particularly by Deputy Dowling, and to call his bluff on a number of topics. I will deal in detail with these statements.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling referred to 1,850 completions by Dublin Corporation in 1970.  This is not correct.  The official quarterly bulletin gives the 1970 calender year figure of local authority houses built by Dublin Corporation as 785, fewer than half, and a rather different picture.  Deputy Dowling has again been confused.  As far as I can see he has used a total figure-for the financial year 1969-70, not the calender year 1970&mdash;of both local authority and private package deal dwellings which were not corporation dwellings.  The latter included such private estates as Donaghmede, and the less said about these by Fianna Fáil spokesmen the better for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy said: &ldquo;The Minister stated that a record number of houses had been built.  Where are they?  Where are they to be found?&rdquo; Does the Deputy charge local authorities with <Col N="260" /> falsification of returns?  The record-breaking figure of 8,794 completions last year is the total of the dwelling completions recorded by local authorities in their official progress reports for the year 1975.  No doubt they would all be happy to direct the Deputy to the location of the individual houses in the 8,794 if he wants to count them house by house.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling might have been more correct if he had said that Dublin city centre was dying during the two 16-year periods of Fianna Fáil rule. Now hopefully the city centre can look forward to a new life.  Shortly after taking office as Minister, I arranged for the appointment of the Dublin housing co-ordinator, with particular responsibility for the rehabilitation of the central city area.  The housing co-ordinator and his successor developed plans for expanding housing output in the Dublin area as a whole in close personal consultation with me and paid particular attention to the restoration of living communities in the old central city area.</P>
    <P>On the recommendation of the housing co-ordinator, Dublin Corporation adopted the central city housing development programme in January, 1974.  The programme has been augmented since then and now provides for the acquisition of 150 acres of land on 36 centre city sites for redevelopment for housing purposes. Such redevelopment visualises the provision of new dwellings on cleared sites and the conservation, where possible, of all existing housing stock.</P>
    <P>There is already visible evidence of the advance of this programme.  In the Liberties area&mdash;Newmarket and the Coombe&mdash;work was started in March, 1976, on the first phase of 36 dwellings, five shops and a community centre.  The planning of the second phase of 120 dwellings in this area is progressing.  Also under the central city programme, work is expected to commence shortly on 149 dwellings at Pigeon Road, Ringsend, and on 139 dwellings at North Circular Road.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> I wonder if somebody could be found to talk to Deputies Dowling and Moore to draw to their attention in fact that in this city in 1972-73, apart from Dublin County and Dún Laoghaire, the total allocation from the State for local authority houses was £10,245,000, including an additional 10 per cent, bringing the gross amount £11,269,500.</P>
    <P>This year the figure is £33,332,000 for Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and County Dublin.  In Dublin city alone the figure was £11.7 million last year and this year it is £23.7 million.  Deputy Moore said the Minister for Local Government was neglecting Dublin, but I do not know what he expects.  I do not know whether he is under the impression that we are one of the oil producing states who can roll out fantastic sums of money whether they are needed or not. in the recession in western Europe housing production has been reduced in every country, but the number of houses being built here has increased and the number being built in the city has increased very substantially.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Dowling's comment about the number of people on the housing list, I should like to state that I do not know how he got the figure of 5,402.  I am sure quite a number of people are now looking for rehousing by the corporation in view of the immensely improved quality of the houses now being built.  Those on the waiting list know that with the National Coalition in power they can expect to be rehoused in a reasonable time.  Take the comparative figures for the last three years of Fianna Fáil rule and the subsequent three-year period up to March 1976.  In the three years 1970-71, 1971-72 and 1972-73 the corporation completed 821, 978 and 1,394 dwellings, a total of 3,193 dwellings. In the following three-year period under the present Government, they completed 4,318 dwellings&mdash;in 1973-74, 1,447, 1974-75, 1,544 and the 12 months to the 31st March 1976, 1,327, an increase of 35.2 per cent. I do not know where Deputy Dowling got his figures.  I am not blaming him for using them if he got them but he either got the wrong ones or if he <Col N="262" /> got the right ones he did not read them properly.  The figures that I have given have been taken from the Department's official records, based on Dublin Corporation's own returns. They present a very different picture to what Deputy Dowling was putting across last night.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling said that from the 1st January, 1976, to the 30th of September, 1976, 2,607 families applied for housing and only 857 houses were built.  He is hardly naive enough to think that houses are built and left waiting for applicants to apply for them.  His experience of corporation housing should mean that he knows that there is no co-relation between housing applications and completions. However, taking the Deputy's own figures as a basis it would be fair to deduce a very considerable improvement in the housing situation in Dublin.  If there was 5,307 in November, 1972 and 5,402 now, and if applications this year exceeded houses available by 1,750, we must have built a lot of houses to keep the waiting list more or less at the same figure in spite of the huge number of new applications. If this is what he intended to prove, I would, of course, agree with him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling said something else which rather surprised me, that the quality of the housing has not improved. He said that in spite of the disastrous Fianna Fáil low cost houses, including Ballymun.  Perhaps the simplest answer is to ask him to go and look at the Fianna Fáil low cost houses in the Tolka Valley, Finglas, and then to have a look at the recent completed corporation houses at Corduff, Blanchardstown, and the houses nearing completion for the corporation by the NBA at Cappagh Avenue, Finglas, and the schemes in progress in Ronanstown.</P>

      <P>Last night's speech, and I do not blame the Deputy for not remembering.  Deputy Dowling and Deputy Moore criticised me for discussing renting policies with NATO. I make no apologies to Deputy Dowling or anybody else for discussing with a national body representative of about 120,000 families either renting or purchasing local authority houses a subject matter which directly concerns them.  Why should I apologise for doing this?  Why should I answer to anybody?  They are people with a point to make and they made that point very plainly to me.  It was precisely because Fianna Fáil's Ministers for Local Government refused to have any meaningful discussions with the tenants' associations that the rent strike took place early in 1971 and continued until the present Government took office and introduced the new national differential rents scheme, an action which Deputy Dowling condemned yesterday as &ldquo;interfering in rent strikes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to suggest that, as a condition for settlement of the rents strike, I agreed that striking tenants would be permitted &ldquo;not to pay their rents for two years&rdquo;.  Deputy Moore did not say that; he said the correct thing: that those who had a lot of arrears could pay them within two years.  Deputy Dowling was not content with that and he had to say something which he must have known was wrong: that I told them they did not have to pay for two years.  The agreement made worked very well. Where substantial arrears were owed the agreement with NATO was that this should be paid off gradually over a period, but not longer than two years.  There was never a suggestion that no payment should be made off arrears until two years had elapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of April, 1973, rent arrears owed to Dublin Corporation <Col N="264" /> totalled £1.3 million.  On 1st November, 1976, £1.421 million was still owed.  This is far too high and I have told the city council that they owe a duty to the general body of ratepayers to recover as much of this as possible. There was a reference by Deputy Moore to squatters and a suggestion by Deputy Dowling about an unknown person.  The Deputies were careful about referring to people in a nice way without giving names so that there would be no way of tracking down whether what they said was correct or not.  I am not aware of any member of the Labour Party advising people to squat.  I have always condemned squatters but I found a ridiculous situation with Dublin Corporation some time ago.  They had people who were squatters, whom they freely admitted were entitled to a house, were on their housing list and would be rehoused but for the fact that they were squatters.  This situation, that they had to get out of the house they were in and go into some other house in order to satisfy some official, was wrong.  Dublin Corporation can do a lot more to rectify the position.</P>
    <P>It is nonsensical for Deputy Dowling to accuse me of failing to discuss renting or other matters with local elected representatives.  I have no hesitation in claiming that I am far more accessible as a Minister for Local Government than any of my predecessors.  In particular, I have rarely refused a request by any local authority to meet them.  In the past two months, for example, I have received representations from elected members of Dublin County Council, Dublin City Council&mdash;twice&mdash;Wexford Borough Council, Wexford County Council and Drogheda Borough Council. I have met and talked with representatives from Tipperary town, Tramore, Tullamore, Wexford, Dublin County, Cavan, Dundalk and Donegal and I attended the Annual Conference of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government I did <Col N="265" /> not go and hide and lock the door if a problem arose.  If a problem arises I prefer to talk to the elected representatives about it rather than hiding in the hope that it will go away.  I pride myself on being as familiar with thinking of elected representatives as anybody else and that is the way a Minister for Local Government should be.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling spoke about the different methods of calculating rent which were applied to tenants who were unemployed and continued on to 17th September, 1976, and those who became unemployed subsequent to that date.  I do not know whether I was correct in taking Deputy Dowling's complaint to be that those who become unemployed after the date concerned were continuing to pay the high rent while those who became unemployed before that date were paying a lower rate but it appeared to me that he was urging that everybody who was unemployed on 17th September should be on the one rate. I do not agree.  My opinion is that somebody who was unemployed for a period but who had been used to paying at a certain rate should be allowed continue at that rate but that somebody who was new to the scheme should, as announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget, be put on a figure that would give him 85 per cent of his pre-unemployment wages. Perhaps Deputy Dowling was a bit mixed up about that too.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dowling has no wish to hear comments on the bunkum that we had to listen to last evening. I must point out that the clawback was a Fianna Fáil invention, having been incorporated first in the Housing Act of 1966.  Fianna Fáil sought the surrender, not of one-third of the profit from the sale of a local authority house but one-third of the resale price.  Of course, those dwellings affected then by this provision were only labourers' cottages but the matter has become important now since it concerns some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies.  It was different when the ordinary fellows around the country were being asked to surrender a third of the price of their houses.</P>
      <P>Our provision relates to a sale within a five-year period whereas their provision was that the clawback applied right up to the time that the 44th year of tenancy was completed. They have the gall now to talk about what we are doing while what they are doing is allowing money to be retained by people who bought houses but sold them again, money which belongs rightly to Dublin Corporation. There is £250,000 there that the corporation may collect if they wish.</P>

      <P>The Deputies opposite cannot take their medicine.  Deputy Andrews spoke about the serious housing situation in Dún Laoghaire.  I agree that the position in that area is very bad although not as bad as the figures given by the Deputy would suggest. The general figure of need which he quoted represented the gross figure of applicants, not of those applicants who had been approved.  He was wrong, too, in his figure for accommodation for old folk.  He said that the number on the waiting list is 870 whereas the corporation tell me that the figure is 87.  The difference in approach as between Fianna Fáil and the Coalition is that when we find the housing situation is bad, we do something positive to right it.</P>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil left office in March, 1973 there were no corporation houses in progress in the whole of the Dún Laoghaire borough but 154 were at tender while the additional sites available amounted to 300.  No sites were being acquired then.  The gross total of the corporation's programme was 454 houses or sites.  Let us look at the position in October, 1976, when work was in progress on 167 houses and was about to be started on 476 houses.  Plans were being prepared for a further 370 houses while a reserve of about 1,800 had been acquired for future years. If Deputy Andrews finds something wrong with that situation I wonder what he is doing in Fianna Fáil at all because the situation in that area was much worse when that party were in office.  They ignored Dún Laoghaire completely.  Maybe the fact that the Taoiseach and Deputy Desmond live there had something to do with this situation.  Houses are being built there now which never would have been built had there not been a change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling referred to houses deteriorating because of cutbacks in expenditure on maintenance.  In 1972-73 expenditure by the local authorities in Dublin city and county on the repair and maintenance of rented houses amounted to £2.5 million whereas this year the expenditure at £5.34 million is more than double that. With an increase of this order there <Col N="268" /> should be no need for a cutback in employment on maintenance work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>It seems to please the Deputy to continue saying things that are not true.  Reference has been made to the unemployment situation in Dublin city.  Until about 12 months ago the position about new industries was that there was a special arrangement for those industries well outside of Dublin.  This was partly responsible for the fact that the unemployment figure was growing in Dublin.  When the question of this arrangement was before the House the Leader of the Opposition said it was wrong that it should be changed but Deputy Tunney, to his credit, agreed with changing it and said that Dublin should be treated the same as the rest of the country.  We agreed and changed the arrangement.  We know there is unemployment but we are in a world recession and we are doing much better than many of the other countries in western Europe.  At least we are doing something that Fianna Fáil would not have done&mdash;ensuring that those unfortunate enough to be unemployed will have enough to keep them going whereas when we think back on Fianna Fáil figures in this area we realise that had they been in power many people would have starved to death during this difficult time.  A few months ago their expert recommended that one way of cutting back was to reduce by a very substantial amount the sums paid in social welfare.  That suggestion has been noted by those people in receipt of social welfare payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>In February, 1973, the present Minister for Local Government joined with other people aspiring to power in this country and said that in respect of housing an emergency existed.  I presume that that emergency applied in their minds as much to Dublin as to any other place. I propose taking that as the basis to show that if such an emergency existed then, it exists to a much greater extent now.</P>
      <P>At that time there were 5,300 people seeking accommodation from the housing pool in Dublin.  The present figure in this regard is 5,400.  However, I shall not attempt to make any capital out of the fact that the number now is greater than it was then.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the pool of housing which was available then and which is available now.  These are factual figures.  Since April 1974, the Minister and the Government have constructed a total of 5,064 dwellings.  In the same period, Dublin Corporation have parted with 9,000 houses from the pool.  These are houses which have been sold.  If you subtract the 5,000 from the 9,000 you get a net loss to the pool of 4,000 dwellings.  That establishes beyond yea or nay, irrespective of money spent&mdash;money I call Oliver Flanagan money; money that is printed and you throw it out; it means nothing; houses, residences, accomodation are what we are talking about&mdash;that in the pool of housing available to Dublin Corporation 4,000 fewer dwellings are available for distribution.  At the same time, we have 5,000 looking for accommodation.</P>

      <P>The Minister talked about how he would give power to the local authority. In respect of the clawback, Dublin Corporation got legal opinion to the effect that the Minister could not direct them to apply a clawback. <Col N="274" /> Notwithstanding that, the Minister insists they must do it.  That is an example of the regard the Minister has for Dublin Corporation.  I regret that, having regard to the strategy applied by the Government side in anticipation of the weakness of their case, they have left me with no option but to resume my seat.</P>

      <P>Deputy George Colley gave me notice of his intention to raise on the adjournment the increases in social welfare payments in comparison with increases in the cost of living since 1973.  In accordance with Standing Orders the Dáil must adjourn not later than 9 p.m. By agreement, Deputy Colley may speak for two-thirds of the remaining time and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare will then reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Today at Question Time the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, referring to the situation since the Coalition came into office, said, among other things, that the increase in the cost of living which was disclosed in this House by a parliamentary question to the Taoiseach showed an increase of 75 per cent over three-and-a-half years and that the lowest increase in social welfare payments during that period was 105 per cent. This is repetition of a matter about which we have heard a great deal from the Coalition in general and the Parliamentary Secretary in particular. The clear implication was that there has been a real increase in social welfare payments of not less than 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>In order to arrive at the conclusion that there has been an enormous increase in real value in social welfare payments under the Coalition, certain basic assumptions are necessary.  First, it is necessary to compare two things which are not alike, a well-known way of arriving at the wrong result.  The two things to be compared are a base for the cost of living index in mid-February, 1973, with a different base for social welfare increases, different because whatever commencement date you take for social welfare payments it cannot be mid-February 1973.  If you take the previous increases in social welfare you go back to August and October of 1972.  If you take the subsequent ones you go to July, 1973.  Whichever way you look at it, mid-February 1973 has no relevance to the commencement date for calculation of the value of increases in social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to arrive at the Parliamentary Secretary's conclusion that Fianna Fáil, if returned to office, would not have increased social welfare payments in the budget of 1973, it is also necessary to assume that the present social welfare recipients will not have to suffer any increase in the cost of living subsequent to mid-August, 1976.  Such assumptions, clearly without foundation, produce a perversion of the truth.  This perversion of the truth is what we have been getting regularly from the Coalition in general and from the Parliamentary Secretary in particular.  The present social welfare figures for payments under various headings to the recipients must be viewed in light of the fact that they will remain in force at least up to 1st April, 1977.  I say that on the basis of the precedent of previous budgets under this Government.  I could, of course, refer to the precedent created by the Parliamentary Secretary when he promised on behalf of the Government a review of all the social welfare payments and their increase in <Col N="277" /> line with any increase in the cost of living as at 1st November, something which did not happen in respect of all the social welfare payments.  I am not relying on that.  I am simply going on the basis of what has been done in the past and on the assumption that a budget introduced some time in January, as in recent years, would contain increases in social welfare dating from 1st April next.  It must also be taken into account that inflation will continue up to 1st April, 1977.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has chosen mid-February, 1973, as a base. I say he has chosen it because today and on previous occasions he referred to a parliamentary question answered on behalf of the Taoiseach in which the base of mid-February, 1973, was taken and it was shown that £1 at mid-February, 1973, would purchase the same amount of goods as £1.75 would purchase in mid-August, 1976.  If we take that base, and if we are generous to the Coalition, we can project the inflation rate during the remaining seven months, that is, from mid-August, to 1st April.  If we project it at the average rate of inflation since the Government came into office, we can arrive at certain conclusions as to what social welfare recipients are likely to have to endure until the next increase.  I should point out that in calculating future inflation on that basis I am giving the benefit to the Coalition of the lower rate of inflation in their early months in office and also the benefit of the one-off effect of the subsidies and reductions in VAT which had a dramatic effect on the cost of living.  Given the benefit of those things, one can take the rate of inflation over the whole period of the Coalition and project it for the outstanding seven months.  This gives a value of £1 as at mid-February, 1973, as £2.05 at 1st April, 1977.</P>
    <P>The following examples will illustrate what has happened.  The rate which was payable in respect of the items I am about to mention was payable at mid-February, 1973, the base date chosen by the Parliamentary Secretary.  The equivalent rate is calculated in order to keep pace with <Col N="278" /> those figures and the actual rate now being paid and which will continue to be paid up to 1st April next.  The mid-February, 1973, unemployment benefit was £5.55.  The equivalent rate is £11.38 and the actual rate is £10.90. Unemployment assistance in mid-February, 1973 was £4.35, the equivalent rate £8.92, the actual rate £8.90.  Blind persons' pension, £5.15 is the mid-February, 1973 rate, £10.56 is the equivalent rate and £10.25 is the actual rate. Injury benefit, £8.10 is the mid-February, 1973 rate, £16.61 is the equivalent rate and £15.20 is the present actual payment rate.  Maternity allowance, £5.55 is the mid-February; 1973 rate, £11.38 is the equivalent rate and £10.90 is the actual rate.  If the Parliamentary Secretary thinks there is anything wrong in approaching it in that way, he could approach it on the basis of fixed dates and he could take a four year period of Fianna Fáil administration, mid-May, 1968 to mid-May, 1972, and mid-May, 1972 to mid-May, 1976.</P>
    <P>There are objections to doing this but if the Parliamentary Secretary objects to the method I have proposed, he could do that and in that case the Parliamentary Secretary will find that under Fianna Fáil the real increase after inflation in unemployment benefit was 26 per cent and under the Coalition Government 9 per cent, after inflation, in unemployment assistance 26 per cent under Fianna Fáil, 14 per cent under the Coalition; widows' contributory pension 22 per cent under Fianna Fáil, 12 per cent under the Coalition; widows' non-contributory pension 19 per cent under Fianna Fáil and 11 per cent under the Coalition, old age contributory pension 26 per cent under Fianna Fáil and 11 per cent under the Coalition and in the case of non-contributory old age pension 19 per cent under Fianna Fáil and 9 per cent under the Coalition. These are real increases after inflation for the periods I have outlined.  It is important to remember that the effect of price increases on social welfare recipients is much greater than on the average person affected by the cost of living.  In the light of these facts where is this enormous increase in the real value of social welfare <Col N="279" /> about which we have been hearing incessantly from the Coalition and the Parliamentary Secretary?  The facts are plain and only by making the deliberately wrong assumptions I have outlined at the beginning can one arrive at anything like the conclusion of the Parliamentary Secretary.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to take a fixed date to start with the cost of living, he must allow for that when he is calculating the amounts payable under social welfare.  Could we please have a little reality in these matters?</P>

      <P>I have seldom heard a more blatant and, indeed, pathetic attempt at misrepresentation than that I have just heard.  In the five minutes allowed me I will present the facts in relation to social welfare not on a selective basis as Deputy Colley has sought to do but on a factual basis and in its entirety.  Deputy Colley objects to the date mid-February, 1973.  I did not pick that date.  Deputy Colley and his colleague Deputy Lynch were foolish enough to pick that time to have the general election which made us responsible for social welfare.  That is the appropriate time to start because that is when we took office and it will be a record from when we took office up to now.  The consumer price index when we took up office in 1973 was 144.7, and in mid-August, 1976, was 254.4, an increase of 76 per cent.  In relation to the social welfare increases I will give three figures, the amount that Fianna Fáil were paying, the amount we are currently paying and a percentage increase over and above the cost of living.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy's question refers to persons on Arranmore Island to whom payment of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit was discontinued because of a deciding officer's decision that they were disqualified from receiving such payments on the statutory grounds that they were either not genuinely seeking work or had refused an offer of suitable employment.</P>
      <P>The persons concerned have the right to appeal against the deciding officer's decision and where they have done so arrangements are being made to have an oral hearing of their cases before an appeals officer.  Each appellant will be notified of the date, time and place of the hearing at which it will be open to him to attend and give evidence on his own behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> Deciding officers and appeals officers are statutorily appointed and the Deputy will appreciate that where persons have been disqualified from receiving payment of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit by these officers in the course of exercising their statutory functions I have no power to intervene in the matter.</P>

      <P>A claim for benefit under my Department's optical benefit scheme was received from the person in question on 29th October, 1976.  The claim was disallowed as the claimant did not fulfil the statutory condition which required him to have, at least, 26 employment contributions paid or credited on his behalf in the 1975 contribution year.  However, following information supplied by the claimant <Col N="203" /> my Department confirmed with his employer the duration of his employment in 1975 and credited him with employment contributions for this period.</P>
      <P>As a result, the claim for optical benefit has already been authorised and the claimant notified accordingly.</P>
