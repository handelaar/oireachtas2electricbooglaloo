    <Title>Local Government (Water Pollution) Bill, 1976 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, when dealing with this Bill, I spoke from my own personal interest in this matter and of my efforts to get a measure such as this introduced.  I come now to consideration of the position with regard to pollution.  We have an abundant supply of water in our rivers and lakes and around our coast.  While we are not entirely free <Col N="404" /> from pollution, not nearly as free, indeed, as we would wish to be, we are fortunate in that we are relatively freer than most other countries.  However, this is the opportune time to tackle any problems that may exist and we should waste no time in using all our resources to tackle them now. It is true that prevention is better than cure and our efforts should be directed now towards preventing pollution instead of waiting until we have to cure it.  Should pollution become a major problem we might be unable physically or financially to solve it.</P>
      <P>Waters used for domestic, recreational and industrial purposes should be free from pollution.  It is vitally important that rivers and lakes should be safeguarded from pollution because fishing is a major tourist attraction and our tourist industry will be jeopardised if this important amenity is adversely affected.  There was a time when tourists came here in large numbers because drink and cigarettes were cheap.  That is no longer the position and one of the major attractions now from the point of view of the tourist is our fishing amenity.  We should spare no effort in making it clear to those interested that our waters are free of pollution and they can enjoy ample sport if they come here.  At the moment people on the Continent are a little confused about the position as between North and South.  We have had our share of trouble down here but we should make it clear to potential tourists that, as well as our waters being free of pollution, we are also free more or less of the kind of situation that exists elsewhere in the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Seanad the Parliamentary Secretary gave figures from a survey carried out by An Foras Forbartha. According to that survey 121 rivers were examined, covering a total distance of 3,000 kilometres.  Of that number 7 per cent were bad and 10 per cent were doubtful.  How bad, I wonder, were the 7 per cent?  I am sure some were worse than others.  I do not know if the Liffey and the Tolka were surveyed.  I would hope none was as bad as the Tolka and the Liffey.  I understand the survey also showed that despite urban housing development there had been no serious <Col N="405" /> deterioration with regard to pollution. That, of course, is due to improved sanitary services and better planning.  Better planning is, I suppose, attributable to the 1963 Planning Act.  There were certain curbs on farming activities from the point of view of the siting of silage pits.  These could be a serious form of pollution. There are regulations now prohibiting the siting of those pits anywhere in the vicinity of rivers in case of any seepage into rivers.  There are also fairly strict regulations with regard to the keeping of pigs and in this connection, of course, pig slurry is regarded as a major form of pollution. Regulations have now curtailed this problem, if they have not eliminated it fully.</P>
    <P>In industry, present-day planning provisions seem to be adequate to ensure that there is proper disposal of waste emanating from factories.  It would appear, therefore, that modern works in connection with industry or the provision of new housing do not present a very serious threat.  In the main, the threat would come from older industries or older urban housing.  There are many small family industries sited in proximity to rivers and they may not have adequate provision made for disposal of industrial waste or sewage.  However, it would be wrong to compel the owners of such industries to put their house in order immediately because in many cases it might mean such a prohibitive cost that there would be loss of employment and some firms might even be forced out of business.  As well as giving them some time to rectify matters, I would advocate that the Government or the local authorities should provide some form of grant or loan, or possibly some form of tax incentive, in order to assist them and thereby encourage rather than compel them.  Compulsion should be a last resort and should be used only when appeals for voluntary effort have failed.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem in connection with a number of our towns from which raw sewage flows into rivers. This compares very badly with the situation in the North where in many <Col N="406" /> cases there are treatment plants.  Down here treatment plants exist only in a few places.</P>
    <P>We are all glad to see our industrial arm thriving but we should strike a note of warning so that we will not be caught up as other countries were by the industrial revolution, allowing pollution to develop without adequate provision being made for its control. It is very necessary, if we are to keep pace with present day world trade, to develop and expand industrially but this should not mean a deterioration of our environment.  We must take certain safeguards and make adequate provision for the disposal of domestic and industrial sewage.</P>
    <P>On the question of who the enforcement agency should be, different opinions have been expressed.  Some people have said it should be left to the boards of fishery conservators who naturally have a great interest in the preservation of fish life in our rivers. I think the local authorities are the proper people to have control, to be responsible for the enforcement of the provisions of this Bill.  Some people may say local authorities are the worst offenders, and unfortunately in some cases it is quite true.  It has been said that one local authority would be reluctant to prosecute another, or that certain difficulties could arise where, as in Dublin, you had adjoining local authorities under the control of one person.  In Dublin the manager also is manager of County Dublin and Dún Laoghaire.  A similar position exists in Longford-Westmeath, Carlow-Kilkenny and in the Parliamentary Secretary's own constituency of Laois-Offaly.</P>
    <P>In the past, local authorities may have been guilty of causing pollution but they are now very anxious to put things right by providing new sewerage systems and improving old ones. For instance, in Dublin £20 million has been spent on works completed or in the course of completion.  Local authorities are responsible for water supplies and they and sewage disposal are very closely linked with planning which is the responsibility of local authorities.  Even if one local authority are in any way reluctant to prosecute <Col N="407" /> another local authority, an outside authority have power under the Bill to prosecute if there is any interference with their water supply.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill for consultation with outside interests and in this connection boards of conservators play an important role.  There is provision for a water pollution advisory board to represent all interests concerned.  I hope this is not to be a name only.  I hope this consultation will be real.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to other provisions in the Bill.  First of all there is the definitions section and then sections 4 to 8 deal with the granting of licences and the conditions appertaining to them.  There is provision for appeals if licences are not granted.  It also allows for consultations, which is very important, every three years or more frequently if the occasion arises or if there is serious danger to health. Section 14 refers to the storage of any matter that may be regarded to be a serious danger.  Section 17 deals with accidental spillage and lays down the duty of anybody guilty of an accidental spillage to notify the local authority immediately.</P>
    <P>Section 21 might be slightly ahead of its time as it makes appeals to An Bord Pleanála, which we all know will be the Planning Appeals Board when the new Bill takes the power of appeal from the Minister.  Section 23 allows for consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or any other Minister, between the board of conservators and the local authority or the sanitary authority in each area.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers most aspects in relation to pollution.  I urge the Minister, in relation to its enforcement, to appeal for the goodwill of all sections of the community.  I ask him to look for a voluntary effort rather than a compulsory one.  The penalties laid down for non-compliance with the Bill are fairly stiff.  This deterrent of fines should only be used when all other efforts have been made and when there seems to be no result from them.  Our duty as citizens is to protect the environment <Col N="408" /> and to do everything in our power to improve it and thus ensure that future generations will appreciate our efforts in this direction.</P>
    <P>As a representative of a Dublin constituency where this matter is probably of more importance than it is in rural Ireland because housing density and industries are sited in urban areas, I would like to compliment the Minister for having brought in this Bill and shown his concern for the people and his determination to see that they have better standards of living.  He has already done this with regard to housing and now he has taken the matter a step further to ensure that if people have proper housing to live in they will also have a proper environment to enjoy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals in the Bill are based on the recommendations of an inter-departmental working group published in 1973.  When one takes into account the various happenings since, the Bantry Bay spillage, the progress in the search for offshore oil and gas, the various reports of An Foras Forbartha and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and new EEC regulations, it shows how inadequate this Bill is.  However, we have been promised further legislation. It is a pity that this could not have been incorporated in this Bill so that we could have dealt with pollution generally.</P>
      <P>During the past few years in reply to questions it has been stated that other countries have a higher level of pollution than we have.  Many of those countries are highly industrialised so it is reasonable to expect that they would have a higher level of pollution. We are not heavily industrialised, unfortunately for us at the present time, so we are well placed to benefit from clean air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons for fighting pollution is to preserve the environment for our people.  Up to the last few years, when we were relatively free of pollution, we were able to attract tourists. Much has been said by previous speakers about having a Minister in charge of the environment.  Our party have realised this and we appointed <Col N="409" /> Deputy O'Leary as spokesman on the environment.  It can be seen by his contribution on this Bill that he has taken his job seriously.  Mention is made in the Bill of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for the Public Service, but only once is the Minister responsible for tourism mentioned, that is in relation to the control of river and lake vessels with sanitary appliances which discharge into the waters.  When one looks through the Bill one sees that the tourist aspect did not rate very high with the Minister and his colleagues. They should have taken the lead from Fianna Fáil and appointed a Minister in charge of the environment.</P>
    <P>A report issued on 9th April last showed that there is pollution in 17 counties.  We have not the same problems in my county from an urban point of view, such as those mentioned by Deputy Belton in relation to Dublin, but we are very concerned from the tourist aspect because the lakes and rivers in the Cavan, Monaghan, Westmeath and Meath area are a great attraction for fishermen.  We are very much afraid that that attraction will disappear.  <i>The Irish Press</i> on 9th April reported that evidence of pollution was found in 63 stretches of water in 17 counties last year according to the annual report of the Inland Fisheries Trust, which announced that it had commenced legal action against pollutors in some cases.  The sources of pollution were mainly agricultural effluent, industrial waste and urban and domestic sewage.  The report also stated that for the first time in our experience a lake at Carrickmacross was completely de-oxygenated by pollution and that there had been a massive kill of coarse fish, many of specimen size, in the fishery.  The report also referred to pollution in Lough Conn and Lough Corrib.  One must realise the enormity of pollution in those areas and the real damage that this could do to our environment and to our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>One of the causes of river pollution in many areas is the lack of a proper <Col N="410" /> arterial drainage system.  Where there is no proper drainage system and where rivers get overgrown water remains stagnant and if arterial drainage could be speeded up it would help to a great extent to remove this type of pollution from rivers.  During the dry spell last year a lot of fish were killed and considering the amount of money that has been spent by the Fisheries Trust and by local angling organisations that was a great pity.  Pollution will not alone have to be tackled at national level but schools should bring to the attention of young people the danger of pollution to our environment generally. These dangers cannot be brought home forcibly enough.</P>
    <P>Pollution arising from intensive farm enterprises has been mentioned. Much pollution in the last decade has arisen from intensive farm enterprises. Lakes and rivers in my area have been severely polluted by them.  Pig slurry has been mentioned as one of the acute forms of pollution and recently a plant was opened in County Cavan to process pig slurry on the lines established by research workers of an Foras Talúntais.  If that project is as successful as anticipated it will constitute a breakthrough in dealing with at least one problem created by the use of intensive farming methods.  Much work has been done to date in this field by An Foras Talúntais.  What we want now is a comprehensive measure to deal with all types of pollution.  A number of countries on the Continent use fines to penalise pollutors and to finance measures necessary to combat pollution.  That this method is being used by a number of European countries shows how seriously they are concerned about pollution.  I am not suggesting that this would be one of the best methods of tackling pollution here.  The Minister should have included the local authorities sewerage system in the licensing provision, because up to now urban councils and local authorities have been a large source of pollution.  Until the last few years pollution was expected in heavily industrialised areas but the countryside was pollution free.  When campaigning in a recent by-election in County Mayo, where one would think the environment and the streams <Col N="411" /> would be pollution free, I called to a house where pollution was a problem and where even the water supply was affected.  A few years ago when a book entitled <i>The Silent Spring</i> was published many people did not take seriously the dreadful picture painted in that book of what uncontrolled pollution could do to a country. People have since come to realise the risk of seriously damaging the environment. There was damage to the lakes of Killarney last year and also damage to the lakes of Monaghan and Cavan. This brings home to people the real seriousness of the situation.  The threat of pollution can do serious damage to the country from the tourism and the environment point of view.  A comprehensive scheme to combat pollution should be introduced and schools should bring home to pupils the seriousness of the threat before it is too late, because time is not on our side in dealing with pollution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House are very concerned about the protection of the environment.  Our spokesman on the environment, Deputy O'Leary, and our spokesman on local government, Deputy Faulkner, have made a very deep study of this Bill and have made certain recommendations which I hope the Minister will be able to include in the Bill before it finally becomes law.  I congratulate them on the efforts they have made to make this a better Bill and to ensure that every effort is made to protect our environment.  So far we are fortunate in that our environment remains more or less unspoilt, but while there is still time we must endeavour to avoid the mistakes that are now obvious in other countries in this sphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us proposes to give to county councils and county borough councils a status of anti-pollution authorities.  At first glance this looks like a perverse proposition. Local authorities are oriented towards development rather than towards conservation so that the control of pollution will be a new concept for them and one in respect of which they will require some time to adjust.  Worse <Col N="412" /> still they are sewage authorities and as such, through no fault of their own, they are offenders often against water-quality standards.  One can visualise the possibilities of their being laughed out of court in the event of their prosecuting the public without putting their own house in order first.  At best this situation could result in an earlier solution to sewage pollution problems than might otherwise be the case, but at worst it could undermine the otherwise praiseworthy efforts to bring under effective control the whole question of water pollution.  Perhaps we should hope for the best.  It should be helpful that local authorities as planning bodies will be obliged to look hard at the pollution content of new projects for which planning approval is sought.  On the credit side, and unquestionably so, is the fact that the new proposals constitute a serious and a comprehensive effort to tackle the problems associated with the preserva tion of the environment.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes a prohibition or, the discharge into waters of noxious matter.  There is provision for a maxi mum penalty on summary convictior of £250 or six months' imprisonment or both and of £100 a day for a continuing offence, while there is provision for a fine of £5,000 for conviction on indictment or for two years' imprisonment or both.  These penalties are rather severe but if the Bill is to have the desired effect such harsh penalties are necessary.  Effluence from private sewers and trade effluence to waterways and public sewers are excluded from the prohibition but must be licensed individually.  They will be subject to inspection and control and breaches of the regulations will carry the same penalties as those to which I have referred.  Sewage effluence from local authority sewers and treatment plants are exempted both from prohibition and from licence but will be dealt with under ministerial regulations which will set quality standards.  These regulations will place on each sanitary authority a statutory duty to take steps as soon as practicable to ensure conformity.</P>
    <P>Other provisions include exemption of arterial drainage, turf development and electricity-generating activities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> There is provision to give power to the Minister to exempt other specific effluents from licensing, to prescribe water-quality standards and to require local authorities to provide water-quality management plans.  There is provision, too, for the making of arrangements for access to sampling and monitoring of water and for appeals from local authority decisions. Local authorities may be required to co-operate with one another and, should it be necessary, one or more control authority may be set up to assume the anti-pollution functions of groups of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a vast improvement on what has been the position up to now. The prohibition and licensing provisions comply with what has been sought by anglers and conservationists. We are glad that loopholes in present legislation in relation to powers of inspection and sampling are being plugged.  If the courts take the cue and impose maximum fines, the aims of the Bill should be achieved.  A very important feature of the Bill is that the public and the fisheries authorities&mdash; these include both conservationists and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheres&mdash;are given more or less the same powers to inspect, sample and prosecute as are being given to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill is based on a report of the inter-departmental committee on water pollution, a committee set up by the Minister.  Subject to one important reservation, the Bill goes much of the way towards meeting the criticisms of a report submitted to the Minister by the Inland Fisheries Commission, the Angling Federation and the anti-pollution groups.  These groups had reservations about entrusting anti-pollution functions to local authorities. Perhaps it is not surprising that the most notable weakness of the Bill is in relation to effluent from local authority sewers and sewage treatment plants.  The Bill provides that such matters be dealt with as soon as practicable, but there is no promise of financial assistance to local authorities for the provision of sewage treatment plants.  Neither are there set any time limits or any penalties in respect of this <Col N="414" /> form of pollution.  Admittedly it is unfair to look to the Bill for this type of provision.  However, the fact remains that in the past local authorities on the whole have been unable to impose on the rates the heavy cost of sewage treatment.  The Minister has not found it possible to assist them from central funds.</P>
    <P>If this situation is allowed to continue the provisions of the Bill are unlikely to achieve anything spectacular under this heading.  If this were to happen, the position of the local authorities <i>vis-à-vis</i> other polluters would be weakened and, as anti-pollution authorities, they would suffer a loss of credibility.  It is presumably a question of priorities in the allocation of funds.  In these stringent times one can sympathise with the Minister, but the plain truth is, if he cannot produce an acceptable plan and timetable for financing this treatment of public sewage effluent wherever it is necessary, his proposal will be seriously damaged.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that sufficient finance is made available to local authorities to carry out the proposals outlined in this Bill.  I am quite sure local authorities are fully capable of doing this work if they get sufficient finance.  Down through the years, they have been blamed on many occasions for pollution of one kind or another.  Pollution by local authorities was caused by the fact that they did not get sufficient finance to correct a situation which was developing because new industries were being created, new ventures were being sought, and new housing schemes were being built, all of which added to the pollution problems of the local authorities. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary, who has been a member of a local authority for a long number of years, will refer this very important matter to his Minister and press for sufficient finance for local authorities to carry out this type of work.</P>
    <P>Although the remainder of the Bill is likely to attract more approval than criticism, there are a few areas in which, I hope, helpful suggestions can be put forward.  It is a pity the opportunity was not taken either in this Bill or the Planning and Development <Col N="415" /> Act to bring other schemes within the ambit of the Planning Acts.  We all know that pollution from new ventures in factory farming, which is already a serious problem, seems likely to increase in future years at an accelerating pace.  It seems wrong that control is not introduced at the planning stage. It would be better and less costly to deal with the kernel of the matter at that stage rather than creating a problem and then trying to enforce the law when certain ventures have been carried out.  We know that under the EEC directives, and with the advent of the development farmers, a large number of those ventures will be planned throughout the country.  We know, too, that there can be considerable pollution from ventures of that nature. It would be better for the local authorities and the people involved to put things right at an early stage.  In that way they would not contribute to the pollution problem later on.</P>
    <P>In limited stretches of waterways within the boundaries of county councils or county borough councils, there are likely to be problems in maintaining an acceptable standard when the upstream feeding waters are extensive and lie entirely outside the authority's control.  Where a number of authorities are involved, the problems will multiply.  To meet this situation, in this Bill the Minister has included what the explanatory memorandum describes as reserved powers enabling him to appoint a joint water quality control authority in which two or more local authorities would combine and which would take over from the individual local authorities their anti-pollution functions.  One hopes that the Minister may be persuaded to identify the areas in which this is most likely to occur and to set up, at the initial stage, such a single body to look after them.  Given the paramount value of managing waterways on a river catchment basis, such a body might in time be expanded to take in additional areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to penalties, I wonder if the Scandinavian system was considered. It provides that when a limited company is convicted not only is the company, as such, penalised but the <Col N="416" /> chairman and the chief executive are liable individually to fines and even to imprisonment.  In inflationary times it might be helpful if the Minister had power to alter the level of fines in line with changes in the value of money. These are ideas which might be considered. Apparently they are acceptable in other countries.  They could be looked into here as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister's power to exempt specific effluents from licensing is exercisable after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. Consent would be more appropriate than consultation and more in line with the fact that the power of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to license effluents in his own right under the Fisheries Act is being repealed. In section 10, power is taken to require an offender to mitigate and remedy any effects of his infringement. I wonder does this include the replacement of damaged fish stocks and fish food, or merely the restoration of the water to an acceptable standard of purity.</P>
    <P>We have, I understand, 342 miles of beach.  When we take account of our bathing areas, which I understand are about 20 per cent of the total beach area, we are left with about 80 miles of beach.  As we are dependent to a great extent on our income from tourism, and on tourism to help our balance of payments, we should realise the importance of preserving our beaches and ensuring that no pollution is allowed on any of those beaches.  It is really important that we should make every effort to ensure that our beaches remain unpolluted.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the trouble is that too many Departments are responsible for the environment.  I understand about 13 agencies are responsible for the environment.  One could well visualise a situation where lines could be crossed and where one Department or one agency would infringe on the rights of another and in the long term it would be our environment that would suffer.  It would be far better if we had one Department totally responsible for the environment.  When we see what happens in other countries and how pollution has ruined things <Col N="417" /> there, we should spare no effort to ensure that we fulfil our responsibility and preserve for future generations the environment of our country.</P>
    <P>In my own county of Galway we have one of the finest lakes in the country, Lough Corrib, and fears have been expressed from time to time about the pollution problem in Lough Corrib.  This is something that we dread in County Galway where the many fine lakes and rivers are a source of income for the county and a great attraction to the tourists.  It would be very unfortunate if any pollution took place in those areas.  We should take every effort to preserve out waterways intact and to ensure that tourists are attracted by fishing exhibitions in our lakes and rivers.</P>
    <P>The final verdict on the Bill must be that it deserves a welcome.  It makes, I believe, an honest effort to tackle the pressing problem of pollution. There are ways in which it can be improved before it becomes law.  Above all there must be commitment of funds for the work needed, especially for treatment where required of local authority sewage effluence.  I urge on the Government that it is absolutely necessary that funds be provided for this purpose.  In County Galway last year offices were created by the county council for the appointment of personnel to monitor pollution in the county. The Minister's sanction to the creation of these offices is still awaited and I hope that the Minister will not delay that sanction.  Galway County Council have provided a sum in the estimates for this purpose and this shows that they are in earnest in their determination to co-operate with the central authorities in efforts to stamp out pollution in the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the object of this Bill to make more effective arrangements for the control of water pollution with a view to ensuring that the water resources are maintained to a satisfactory standard consistent with various beneficial uses.  I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary and our spokesman on the environment, Deputy J. O'Leary, for the very helpful opening remarks.  It is a reflection <Col N="418" /> of the concern of this side of the House that we have a spokesman on the environment.  The idea in this Bill is to take the necessary safeguards so that the environment and the development process can co-exist in harmony. In order to do this we have to try to achieve a balance between development and the protection of the environment.</P>
      <P>However, it is worth pointing out that there is a lot of inevitable pollution especially when development takes place.  Leaving development out of it, when rain falls on our bogland, as the Parliamentary Secretary is very well aware, this contributes to peat silt being deposited in our lakes and rivers. This is inevitable.  Every person born into this world is a polluter.  That might not be a pleasant thought, but it is true.</P>
      <P>What we are talking about in this Bill is protection against serious pollution that can arise under a number of headings.  I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary referred in his opening remarks to the need for the co-operation of the public, because we cannot legislate for this and it is vital if we are to make any serious attempt to control serious pollution.  For too long we have concentrated on the negative side of this problem, and maybe too much attention has been given to the penalties which are severe but necessary.  It is important that we have the co-operation of the public.  On a number of Bills which we discussed during the year this point was made, particularly in regard to the Tourist Bill and the Wildlife Bill, which we are discussing in Committee at the moment.  We also need co-operation between the various Departments dealing with pollution. There are too many Departments dealing with the problem at the moment, and I understand there are 13 agencies which could be called upon.  There is no overall responsibility with one Department. I hope the Department of Local Government, as the major Department in this area, through the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister, will say that the buck stops with them and that they will be dealing with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="419" /> I mentioned earlier the inevitable pollution that takes place when peat silt is deposited in lakes and rivers. This is a very serious problem in my constituency, and it is no wonder that the fishermen who fish in the Shannon and Lough Corrib are very concerned that steps will be taken to remedy this problem.  I understood that there was before the EEC a five-year plan to provide money for research to remedy the effects of peat silt being lodged in our waters.  I would like to know if money has been made available to any organisation or individual to found a research project on this very serious matter.  I have correspondence from the Galway Corrib fishermen who want an undertaking that the Minister will make funds available to enable all public sewage to be suitably treated within a stated number of years.  This is also to include tertiary treatment of effluence on waters.  I impress on the Parliamentary Secretary that, if this undertaking was given, it might stop the various comments about local authorities being the most serious offenders as regards pollution.</P>
    <P>Of course every county has a problem in the disposal of sewage.  Galway County Council have not the money to provide schemes for the many towns and villages in the county.  If realistic grants were given to organisers of group sewerage schemes they would be able to tackle this problem.  The county council cannot provide the money themselves.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware of the work of the group water schemes.  We have always said we need industries in the west and we are not being hypocritical in saying so now.  We consider that State bodies such as Bord na Móna and the ESB could do more to ease the minds of people with regard to the safeguards they could provide to prevent serious pollution.  We welcome the development near Ballyforan where Bord na Móna and the ESB plan to develop a large amount of bogland.  We hope that development will proceed and that they will adopt the safeguards I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I wish to support Deputy Hussey in the point he made regarding the pollution <Col N="420" /> officers Galway County Council provided for in their estimates last year. Four officers were to be appointed, money was provided in the estimates but, as yet, sanction has not been received from the Minister for Local Government.  Four officers to deal with pollution in County Galway would be only a drop in the ocean but at least they would be able to concentrate on areas where there is a serious problem, particularly the pollution in Lough Corrib and perhaps the pollution in the Shannon.  I hope those officers will be appointed very quickly.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that sufficient information is not available as yet regarding the causes of pollution in Lough Corrib. The Parliamentary Secretary is aware of the ill-feeling that can exist in an area where that information is not available.  If we had more information about the causes of pollution and, more important, information with regard to the remedies we would be doing a good service.</P>
    <P>I have had considerable correspondence regarding the pollution caused by local authorities.  There are arguments for and against this.  I was glad to see in the opening statement of the Parliamentary Secretary that he had given much thought to this question.  He pointed out that water pollution is largely a side-effect of development and that there are good arguments for integrating the arrangements for dealing with water pollution as closely as possible with the physical planning system.</P>
    <P>This is an important point because local authorities have functions in relation to housing, planning and sanitary services.  Since the local authorities are engaged in these areas they could develop their plans in such a way that due regard and high priority be given to the dangers of pollution.  Consultation between the various local authorities regarding catchment areas or river basins is another aspect.  The Shannon flows through 13 counties and it is obvious that consultation is necessary between the various local authorities.</P>
    <P>The only criticism I have is that this Bill does not go far enough.  It is limited to pollution of inland and tidal <Col N="421" /> waters.  I should like a Bill to include matters such as the collection and disposal of trade and domestic refuse, the fixing of acceptable levels of noise and heating in industry or in places of work, the dumping of waste and litter, the cleaning of our beaches and the disposal and recycling of all forms of waste.  The past summer was very dry and it showed us how serious pollution can be and how inadequately prepared we were to deal with the matter.  In welcoming the Bill I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to bear in mind that there are other areas that need immediate attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming the Bill.  The tone of the speeches made by Deputies show the concern felt by the people generally with regard to the menace of pollution.  We know that the word &ldquo;pollution&rdquo; has a highly emotive connotation and that the opinions given on this problem are subjective.  If one places a high value on amenities and on the conservation of the environment naturally one is most concerned about the problem but if a society does not care too much for the environment anything goes.  It is impossible to lay down a criterion with regard to pollution. It is a relative matter, depending on the standards we set out to attain and to maintain or on the lack of such standards.</P>
      <P>We welcome the Bill because it gives an opportunity of discussing this important matter but we must do it without being emotional, recognising that nature itself can pollute.  If a lake or river is polluted it may not always be caused by man, it can be caused by nature itself.  However, we must accept that most pollution is manmade and, therefore, it can be controlled by man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have quoted from a report issued recently and entitled &ldquo;A Survey of the Environmental Conditions in the Liffey Estuary and Dublin Bay&rdquo;.  It was brought out at the request of Dublin Corporation, Dublin Port and Docks Board and the ESB.  The actual work was carried out by Mr. Crisp of the University of North Wales, assisted by students of UCD and by other officials <Col N="422" /> in the city.  They have issued a very fine report and while they do not offer us all the solutions to the pollution problem&mdash;I do not think they could&mdash; I think the time has come when we can make some advances in checking pollution.</P>
    <P>I welcome the various measures contained in the Bill but I am rather sceptical that it will be effective.  I served for some years on a board of fishery conservators.  I remember at one time a large industrial concern admitted to the accidental discharge of effluent into a river and the effluent had a very high acid content. Further down that river hundreds if not thousands of fish were poisoned. We found it impossible to get a conviction as we could not prove that the effluent which came from the factory actually poisoned the fish.  In that case the factory management were very responsible people and did not try to deny that somebody had boobed and discharged the effluent into the river before it was treated.  However, we had to end up by saying to the management: &ldquo;Be more careful in future&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In these days respect for the law has not a very high place in our priorities. Therefore, the real test of the Bill will be, despite the good intentions of the draftsmen and of the movers, how effective a measure it will be in controlling and limiting the growth of further pollution.  The Parliamentary Secretary may well say that cannot be answered yet, which I appreciate. However, we in this House have a duty to examine the Bill in detail and see how we can make it a better and more effective measure.  People all over the country, whether in the city or in the smallest village, are aware of the menace of pollution.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland have a glorious opportunity to ensure that our atmosphere does not become as polluted as the atmosphere in more industrialised countries.  We cannot be too insular about this whole matter, because there are outside polluting influences on our seas and rivers.  While in Denmark a short while ago I spoke to a person there about pollution.  The Baltic sea was badly polluted and they blamed it <Col N="423" /> on a discharge from the sewers in Leningrad, which is quite a distance away.  We are very close to Britain.  At one point a mere 64 miles divides the two countries.  I look forward to the day when, having put our home situation in order by the effective application of legislation, we will join with the people of the surrounding islands in the fight against pollution, when we will co-operate with the authorities in the United Kingdom and even as far away as Iceland.  Under the various charters of the United Nations and the Council of Europe, we should initiate a great drive to curb pollution, to measure it by the very high standards obtaining in Ireland or in other countries.  If this is not done the future of our society could be very bleak indeed.  If we achieved such co-operation internationally, we could save the tremendous amount of money now spent on our health services and also be able to add to the sum of human happiness by allowing people to live in an unpolluted atmosphere.  Our rivers and beaches would be clean, the very fields where we produce our food would be clean and, on another plain, our city streets would be clean.</P>
    <P>We should regard people who deliberately pollute the atmosphere of our city streets as being undesirable members of our society.  While we do not call for any Draconian measures against them, I believe the key to the whole matter is education, whether in the school or in the home.  If we get across the message that pollution is something that must be corrected, we will then find that co-operation will come from the people.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting either that we should take the softly, softly approach. Our approach must be an intelligent one so that our legislation will have the greatest effect.  We cannot afford a police force that can patrol every river and every beach and every mile of our streets.  What we can afford is education in civics to make sure that we will have good citizens.  The mark of a good citizen is that he cares about the environment in which he and his fellow citizens must live.</P>

      <Col N="424" /> The following motion was moved by Deputy O'Kennedy on 26th October, 1976:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the vital importance of a developing fishing industry to Ireland's economic development and of Ireland's legal and equitable rights, declares its total opposition to any future European Community common fishery policy which does not reserve exclusively to Irish fishermen a coastal zone of fifty miles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was making the point that we could, in the last four years, have been making a good deal more use of our time in order to ensure that when the matter of the 50-mile exclusive limit was being discussed, our arguments would be much stronger and that we would be in a position to present unanswerable evidence to the member states in making the case on behalf of our fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the areas where we have been sadly lacking is in research.  While we know that stocks have been dwindling, we cannot back it up with solid evidence, apart from what we know from the fishermen themselves.  We have not the research facilities which countries like Iceland have.  In arguing for the 200-mile limit they were in a position to make unanswerable arguments for the extension of the limits in their case.  I pointed out last night that the value of fish landings had increased but the weight of fish landings had diminished.  When one sees what has been happening in recent months when <Col N="425" /> we had Russian, Bulgarian and Rumanian trawlers off our coasts, when we see the type of boats used and the huge amount of fish they are taking, we realise what is going on in regard to our fishing stocks.  I should like to join with the Parliamentary Secretary in complimenting Captain Kavanagh and his men on the great work they did in arresting these huge trawlers and taking them to port.</P>
    <P>At present very modern techniques and advanced methods as well as larger boats are used in fishing and we have reached the situation where the fish have no escape.  As time goes on that situation will become worse.  In the EEC member states we have huge companies with a large investment in trawlers and they are only interested in a quick return on their capital as against the situation at home with our fishermen fishing skipper-owned boats in which they have a considerable investment. They are interested in ensuring that stocks are not diminished because they want their earnings to continue on a regular basis and enable them to make their repayments.  The skippers are genuinely interested in this matter of conservation and the position is completely different from that on the Continent.</P>
    <P>The point is often made that, if we were given a 50-mile limit, we would not be in a position to exploit it.  At present we have the structures which can provide the basis for a properly developed industry.  We have the fishermen, boat yards which can be extended and developed.  We have a board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They should not be placed in a position where they would have to declare war on foreign trawlers on the open sea. This is certainly what we will be faced with if we do not get the 50-mile limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on EEC fishery policy, which is of great concern to this country.  My first point relates to remarks of Deputy O'Kennedy as quoted in the papers this morning from the debate yesterday when he sought a bipartisan stance within this country in relation to fisheries policy.  There is a slight contradiction here where the Opposition are concerned, if they arbitrarily choose to demand a 50-mile limit and at the same time seek a common stance.  There is a lack of flexibility in that which can tie the Government's hands in negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his extremely forceful stand recently in the EEC Council of Ministers in Brussels.  For somebody who is an ardent European and whose interests are European, I think he has adopted the most forceful stand adopted to date on any issue.  He was absolutely right and has the full support of the country in taking such a strong stand.  We have read comments suggesting that we should take unilateral action where fishing issues are concerned&mdash;and indeed others&mdash;<i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC.  Comparisons have been made with the position of Iceland which are not valid because Iceland is not a member of the EEC.  The unilateral action taken by Iceland against one other country is incomparably different from our taking unilateral action.  We are a member of the EEC and have obligations which to an extent restrict action of a unilateral nature.  In the industrial sector from time to time unilateral action is sought in the areas of footwear and textiles but, should this country decide on such <Col N="427" /> action, we run the risk of losing export tax relief and other major benefits from EEC membership.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Taoiseach spoke fairly forcefully on behalf of the Government supporting the stand taken by the Minister on this fishery issue.  He stated that the Government are committed to press the EEC in regard to fishing limits and to adopt a policy which would safeguard Irish fish stocks and help in expansion.  Deputy Gallagher rightly referred to the extent of over-fishing. There are some statistics that bear out his point.  The tonnage of sea fish has risen but when one looks at herring for instance, while there has been an increase in the Irish fleet, the catch from 1972 to 1975 dropped from 48,000 tons to 28,000 tons.  There may also be a problem with mackerel stocks if we are not more careful.</P>
    <P>The common fishery policy adopted by the EEC in 1970 was adopted by a six-country EEC.  Those six countries were entirely different in geography and outlook from the expanded Community of Nine involving the maritime interests of Ireland, Britain and Denmark. The original Six were, so to speak, land-lubber nations seeking outlets to the ocean.  It can be argued that the policy they adopted in 1970 might well have met their needs at that time but is completely unsuited to the needs of the larger Community of Nine and entirely contrary to the interests of this country.</P>
    <P>It is possible that some arrangement about quotas as a supplement to a fundamental policy might be useful but I think quotas as a basis for deciding this issue would be entirely unacceptable. Consequently the Community proposals had been unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Recently we were in Brussels as members of the EEC Committee of the Oireachtas.  We met senior people and had discussions concerning fishery issues.  There was a lack of understanding in Community circles of the special needs of this country.  We pointed out in no uncertain terms that fishing is vital.  In particular, we pointed out to them that at the time of accession there was a strong and effective regional policy which resulted in the transfer of <Col N="428" /> resources from the wealthier parts of Europe to the poorer parts.  The policy of some member states, particularly the Germans, has hardened.  At the time of accession we expected a strong commitment in the area of regional policy which has not emerged.  A strong regional policy would mitigate the difficulties, but funds are not coming in. We are being weakened for that reason. That point should also be stressed by the Taoiseach and the Minister in a broad sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief contribution to this motion which has been put down in the names of Deputies O'Kennedy, Gallagher and myself.  I want to emphasise as empathically as I can that Irish national economic interests are vitally concerned in this matter.  I believe that we also have a very special obligation and responsibility to ensure that our economic interest as a nation is protected on this occasion.  We would be guilty of grave and serious dereliction of duty if we did not confirm our right to an exclusive 50-mile limit for Irish fishermen in this evolving situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all I want to deal with the Community aspects of this matter.  We are, and I hope we will continue to be, good members of the EEC.  We have a great deal to gain from membership and have a contribution to make.  I hope this issue will not in any way interfere with our status as a member of the Community or in any way take from the contribution which we can make to Community affairs, in particular to building a European Community concept.  I want to direct the attention of the House, the public, and our friends in the Community to the preamble of the Treaty of Rome. It is clearly stated in that preamble that the member states were anxious to strengthen the unity of their economies and to ensure their harmonious development by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured regions.  That is an important Community objective.  Perhaps it is one to which insufficient attention has been paid by the member states of the Community.  Unless that fundamental <Col N="429" /> aim of the Community is adhered to to an increasing extent, the Community itself may well flounder and the whole European ideal may perish.  We cannot have a viable thriving Community unless that fundamental aim, set out so clearly in the preamble, is adhered to faithfully in practice and in spirit by the member states.</P>
    <P>In this part of Europe we are not overendowed with natural resources. We have some resources, but by a combination of circumstances we are at an underdeveloped stage.  It is vital that our natural resources be fully exploited for the benefit of the economy. It is recognised throughout the Community that the Irish economy needs assistance, needs urgent measures to lift it out of the depression into which it has fallen, and special measures to enable the Irish economy to come up to some level near the European standard. In these circumstances everybody must recognise that a developing fishing industry has a vital contribution to make towards our economy.  In endeavouring to develop our industry, we have poured large amounts of capital into it, but we now find that capital-intensive industries are not the answer to our economic problems.  The better economists are now beginning to think that what we need is employmentgiving industries more than capital-intensive industries, even though the capital-intensive industries might be more efficient and competitive on world markets.</P>
    <P>By every test one could apply to our economy at present a developing fishing industry from every point of view is more than desirable, it is essential.  It would be firmly based on a natural resource and would be employment intensive.  Clearly, it has a great future in a world which is short of protein. From every point of view any sensible person, whether he is in Ireland or other European countries, looking at the Irish economy must come to the conclusion that a priority of any Irish economic development is a sound, developing and expanding fishing industry.  Such a concept is almost made mandatory on the Community by the Article in the preamble to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> I should like to dismiss completely the suggestion made by the Parliamentary Secretary last night.  I found it difficult to follow his argument but if he was trying to make the argument that the Treaty of Accession to which we appended our signature in any way prevents us from seeking a 50-mile limit on this occasion I reject it.  The Treaty of Accession was signed in a certain context and in certain circumstances. The extension by the Community of the limit to 200 miles creates an entirely new physical and legal situation.  Nothing in the Treaty of Accession can affect our demand for some sort of sensible and rational approach to this new situation.  I am certain that my lawyer friends would agree with me that our case could be maintained in any international court, that the change brought about by an extension to 200 miles is of such fundamental significance that an entirely new legal and physical situation now obtains to which there must be an entirely new approach.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of natural resources.  It has always been recognised that the fishing potential around the coasts of any country is an inalienable natural resource of that country.  That is an historical concept and I believe that historical concept is being developed in favour of coastal states in the modern world.  When I was young a three-mile limit was the standard concept.  It was considered that a country had exclusive rights over three miles and that was subsequently extended to 12 miles.  Now it is 200 miles all over the world.  It cannot be denied that the concept of the waters around a country being a natural resource of that country is being affirmed and confirmed to an increasing extent daily.  The trend in the world today is to extend the limit of that natural resource as belonging to the coastal state.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I believe that the proposal that this 200 mile of sea and the fish in it is an Irish national resource is unanswerable.  Why then should we, this underdeveloped nation on the edge of Europe, be expected to contribute this natural resource of ours to our richer neighbours, as is proposed by the Commission, and <Col N="431" /> throw it into a common pool? Britain has recently added to her economic wealth a new resource, her North Sea oil.  Is Britain throwing that new natural resource into the Community pool?  Do the Germans throw their coal and steel resources into a Community pool for us all to divide up among ourselves and have a share in their developing and exploiting?  This is an untenable position that the Community and the Commission are trying to take in regard to Irish fishing interests and potential.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that apart from the fact that the Commission's proposals are based on a false promise, on a misconception of the rights and wrongs of the situation, on a misunderstanding of Ireland's economic position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other member states, the proposals in themselves are woolly, inoperable and will cause endless trouble.  They are of unworthy origin and they clearly emerge from the situation where certain European countries having ruthlessly overfished their own waters for generations are now seeking new areas to keep their capital intensive fleets occupied for another ten or 15 years before writing them off completely. That seems to be the origin of these proposals.  I have heard nothing that persuades me that that unworthy origin is not the real origin of these proposals.  Apart from that, the proposals are indefensible as proposals and if my livelihood depended on Irish fishing I would not like to place my trust in the arguments put forward by the Commission.  They talk about better policing, quotas, special provisions being made for Irish and Scottish fishermen and about all sorts of things which when examined are not realistic and do not convey any assurance to Irish fishermen for the future development of their industry.</P>
    <P>I find reprehensible the whole idea that the new quotas should be based on past performance.  In other words, the more a country raked and ravaged the resources in the past the more favourably are they going to be treated in the future.  That is a particularly <Col N="432" /> objectionable and reprehensible proposal and one that could not stand up before any objective panel of observers or judges.  I should like to commend the Irish Fishermen's Organisation on the stand they are taking on the issue.  More important, and I believe this has not received the attention it deserves, in response to an invitation from the Parliamentary Secretary, they went off, did their homework and quickly prepared a blueprint for the development of an Irish fishing industry which I find almost totally acceptable.  They prepared an excellent document and something which could serve as a basis for the future development of this important aspect of the Irish economy.  They are to be commended on that.  If the people who prepared that document say they want a 50-mile limit I would take a great deal of persuading that that is not an unanswerable case.</P>
    <P>An exclusive 50-mile limit is the only answer for the development of this industry.  The Commission officials make a point that what matters is conservation zones and policing and that territorial limits are really not important.  They made that case in answer to our demand for a 50-mile limit.  If mere geographical limits, as they call them, are not important, why are they asking the member states to have a 200-mile limit?  If there is a Community argument for a 200-mile limit there is an equally strong argument for a 50-mile limit for Ireland.  Naturally, I believe some sensible arrangement will have to be made with the countries who are at present fishing within that 50-mile limit.  Some equitable arrangement will have to be made whereby their activities will be phased out over a reasonable period.  Perhaps as the situation develops some arrangements could be made whereby they could continue indefinitely, if there was any inadequacy on the part of Irish fishing capacity to meet the European market.  They are side issues.</P>
    <P>I believe that our national interest, the development of the fishing industry, the livelihood of our fishermen, can only be secured for the <Col N="433" /> future by our insisting on a 50-mile fishing limit exclusive to Irish fishermen.  I have a sinking feeling when I see the amendment put down in the name of the Parliamentary Secretary that this Government are prepared to depart from that demand.  I hope they are not, because that amendment causes grave anxiety to us on this side of the House.  We intend to press this Dáil to make a clear and unequivocal demand for an exclusive 50-mile limit for Irish fishermen.</P>
    <P>I know a little about the fishing industry.  I had a fishing port in my former constituency.  I had the opportunity from time to time of going to sea with fishermen, studying their way of life and the hardships and risks involved in that way of life.  I do not think there is anything we can do in this House that would be sufficient to discharge the responsibility we owe these men. I have seen the way they suffered in the past at the hands of unscrupulous fishing fleets from other countries. We know what happens on the high seas.  The Irish fisherman knows that better than anybody else because of his experience and because he has seen the continental approach to fishing.  I believe they are absolutely and totally within their rights in insisting and demanding that the only protection they can have is an exclusive 50-mile limit completely under Irish control, policed by us, supervised by us and any arrangements about facilities for other nations inside those 50 miles must be entirely at the discretion of the Irish Government acting in the interests of our fishermen.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the delay in circulating the amendment yesterday. Until just before the debate I was unaware that it had not been circulated at lunch time and I apologise for any inconvenience caused to the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem we find ourselves in today derives from two things: the 1970 regulations of the Community on the common fisheries policy and the terms of the Accession Treaty.  The <Col N="434" /> 1970 regulations are at the root of the matter.  I recall coming to this House in Opposition to speak on this subject at very great length&mdash;two-and-a-half hours&mdash;because it seemed to me in 1970 that it was vital that the Government be alert to this problem and tackle it effectively or we would find ourselves in the kind of position we have found ourselves in in recent years, moving towards a deadline in 1982 at which point we have no legal protection under the 1970 regulations and the Accession Treaty against fishermen of other Community countries coming right up to our shores.</P>
    <P>Let us go back to 1970 and see how this situation developed and how the problems arose.  In April, 1970, the White Paper was issued by the previous Government.  It gave two-thirds of a page to fisheries and said that membership would be advantageous to this country as far as fisheries were concerned.  Following that somewhat inadequate statement it added:</P>
    <P>In addition, some difficulties could arise from any decision which might be adopted by the Community, within the framework of the proposed common policy for fisheries in regard to access to fishing grounds within the exclusive fishery limits of the member States.</P>
    <P>That was an extraordinarily mild statement of the situation we now face, but it is the way the previous Government saw it at that time.  When they applied for membership on 30th June, the reference to the common fishery policy was confined to the statement that:</P>
    <P>It may also be necessary to raise particular points in regard to other agricultural matters including future arrangements for fisheries... before the accession negotiations are complete.</P>
    <P>Did that convey a sense of urgency? Other countries, however, were deeply concerned and Norway and Britain took the matter up very strongly.  On 22nd November, Norway was told by the Council as a result of their very strong representations that the Council would never claim to impose unacceptable conditions on a member of the future Community, <Col N="435" /> even though they could not allow regulations to be entirely questioned and renegotiated.  Norway secured an assurance of a kind which was not incorporated in the Accession Treaty as finally agreed.  Admittedly, those negotiating the Accession Treaties were weakened greatly by the fact that Norway eventually opted out.  Is that relevant given the timing that when negotiations were going on it was thought that Norway would be in? Of course, the whole position was subsequently weakened by Norway's failure to join.  Norway's failure to join was due to the fact that although they got that assurance, stronger than anything we got, they were not satisfied and fishing was so important to them.</P>
    <P>However, the damage had effectively been done when, on 20th October, 1970, the regulation was adopted. The damage was particularly done because we had failed to persuade the Community&mdash;and I am not aware we even tried to; I do not want to be dogmatic about this because I am not clear what exactly happened in the negotiations&mdash;not to use the following words &ldquo;maritime waters under its sovereignty or coming within its jurisdiction&rdquo;. It is those words in the 1970 regulation which bring within the common fisheries policy, according to the jurisprudence of the Community, as advised by the Community legal services, the whole of the 200-mile zones that member states may declare. If those words &ldquo;or coming within its jurisdiction&rdquo; were not there, we would be in a somewhat different position.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that the dangers of those words were adverted to or taken up at the time or that any attempt was made to persuade the Community not to use them.  In the debate at the end of November there was the first evidence of concern on the part of the Government in the opening statement by the Parliamentary Secretary of the day, but at that stage the regulations had been adopted five or six weeks earlier.  Even then in reply to the debate the then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Fahey, <Col N="436" /> tried to persuade the Dáil that the Community were only now adopting this policy and that they would have to wait for implementing regulations to be adopted in February, 1971, to see precisely the implications which were absolutely clear in the wording of the regulations which had been adopted on 20th October.  Throughout, the record is not particularly brilliant. In my opinion, if we had fought the matter as strongly as the Norwegians we might be in a somewhat better position today, although it is hard to be certain of that.  One can talk of might-have-beens but I do not want to be unduly harsh.  The problem facing the then Government was very difficult because they had to ensure we got membership and, to some degree, they had to take the terms offered.  Nonetheless, there is no evidence in the record of an understanding from the beginning of how vital this was, or of the kind of battle that the British and Norwegians put up, the Norwegians with some success.</P>
    <P>We now come to the Accession Treaty.  I find it hard to believe that it was impossible to get anything better than the wording there, given Protocol No. 30 which gave us a basis on which to insist on something more than a review, the results of which offered no guarantee for the future. While there is to be a review based on a report, which we have not had, that does not guarantee that at the end there will be anything significantly better than free access.  It ought to have been possible to get more than that, to have got some reference at that point to what we are now seeking to get at this stage to cover the ground then lost, to the need to guarantee the future expansion of the Irish fishing industry.  That is the basic issue in this debate.  A review which did not refer to that and which contained no reference to the need for that guarantee is a review which has limited value for this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey is making comparisons with oil and coal.  The trouble is there is not a Community policy on those issues, but there is a Community policy on fish, adopted at that time, and which we accepted in the <Col N="437" /> treaty with a very minimal provision that offers no guarantee for the future.  This is the record.</P>
    <P>I do not say that with any great pleasure and neither am I seeking to be unduly harsh because I appreciate the difficulty of the Opposition trying to retrieve something from a situation where we start, until this 200 mile limit came up, with no bargaining power whatever and no guarantee of anything at the end of 1982 from this review.  The extent to which the review is inadequate and regarded in the community as having no great significance is indicated by the contempt that has been shown to it.  The Commission has not even thought it necessary as this stage to prepare the report referred to in Article 103 and that indicates how little is attached to this review and how little guarantee it offers us.</P>
    <P>Opposition Members raised several points.  Deputy O'Kennedy raised the question of the recital in, I think, Regulation 2141 of January, 1976.  He wanted to know was anything done to ensure the recital in some way reflected our interests better.  I understand that regulation is only a consolidation of 1970 regulations and, in consolidation of regulations, there is no opportunity to change and so the issue did not arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy also asked whether we had pressed the issue of Article 103 because he had the impression, talking to Commission officials, that he was the first one to mention this.  I do not know to what Commission officials he was talking but they must have been somewhat remote from current negotiations because we have been pressing Article 103.  One cannot, of course, ever be certain that it was not referred to earlier but, in fact, the discussions never got down to detail until the mid-summer.  Certainly on 2nd June there was a serious discussion on Article 103.  Article 103 was raised by us at that time without, I may say, getting any positive response from the Commission and we have pursued it since then. Any Community official who does <Col N="438" /> not know we are pressing Article 103 must be a long way from the negotiations that are going on.</P>

      <P>That may be but, when one goes to Brussels for briefings one is sometimes briefed by officials who are remote from reality.  Sometimes one meets the actual officials involved.  The fact is that since 2nd June this has been a priority on our part and no Commission official should be unaware of that, if he is in any way involved in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>Our position is that we are trying to get across, and this is what we tried to get across at the last council meeting, that there is, first of all, no basis for this concept of right of access in either the Rome Treaty or the Accession Treaty.  I shall furnish Deputy O'Kennedy with a copy I made at the last council meeting.  I think it is important it should get as much publicity as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an issue on which there is a great deal of confusion.  Denmark, for instance, finds it suits them to pretend that this common fishery policy has something to do with the Rome Treaty, is a principle of the Rome Treaty and is endorsed by the Accession Treaty.  This is completely false. There is nothing in the Rome Treaty which requires right of access.  The Rome Treaty requires two things&mdash; non-discrimination on grounds of nationality and the right of establishment. This has not yet been fully implemented in relevant sectors like agriculture and fisheries but ultimately it must be implemented.  Neither on the principle of non-discrimination nor the right of establishment is right of access required to another country's fisheries.  They certainly require ultimately, when the right of establishment is fully implemented, that anybody coming to settle in another country and willing to operate in accordance with the regulations for entry into the trade of that country cannot be excluded by virtue of being <Col N="439" /> a foreigner.  He must be allowed to establish himself and there can be no discrimination on grounds of nationality in regard to the economic activities of that country.  That does not in any way say that a member state has no right to control its fisheries, to conserve their use or to lay down conditions as to how they should be exploited, including that they should be exploited by fishermen based in ports of the state in question. There is nothing in the Rome Treaty that requires right of access to waters any more than it requires rights of access to farmers' fields for people from other countries to come in and pick the potatoes up.</P>
    <P>The Accession Treaty incorporates a derogation from the provisions of the 1970 Regulation for a limited period.  The fact that that derogation is incorporated in the Accession Treaty does not give any additional legal status to the original regulations. A derogation incorporated in a treaty cannot give treaty status to the thing it is derogated from and the implication that that is the case is one which we reject.</P>
    <P>An important part of the discussions at the meeting last week at the council was the presentation of our political case.  To be frank, I believe there are Ministers in other member countries who have either convinced themselves or been convinced by their own officials that they have a legal basis in the Rome Treaty or the Accession Treaty and it is important that they should understand this is not the case and that they have been wrongly advised in this respect.  The only basis for right of access lies in the 1970 regulations adopted by the council, amendable by the council, requiring a political decision simply that they should be amended in the common interest.  There is no legal impediment to that if the will is there to do it and that is what it is important to get across to other member countries.</P>
    <P>The fact is that these regulations have to be reviewed in the new <Col N="440" /> circumstances of the 200-mile limit because, while they are so worded as automatically to bring the new zones created by national declarations of 200-mile limits within the ambit and jurisdiction, if you like, of the regulation of 1970, nevertheless the regulations themselves do not adequately cope with the situation that arises from the 200-mile limit and it is necessary, therefore, to take certain measures.</P>
    <P>Our position is that in declaring our 200-mile zone we will be bringing into the Community almost a quarter, well over one-fifth, of the total waters that would be included within the Community 200-mile zones of member states and that is a very considerable accession of wealth and resources to the Community.  What the other members are seeking to do at this stage is to open negotiations to get a mandate from the Council to initiate negotiations with third countries, negotiations which, <i>inter alia</i>, would in some instances at least provide for an exchange of access between the 200-mile zones of the Community countries and 200-mile zones of the third countries involved.  This is urgent because there are deep sea, long distance fishing fleets in some member countries&mdash; not in ours&mdash;which are dependent for their livelihood to a significant degree on fishing in waters within the 200-mile zones of other countries, notably Iceland, Norway, the United States of America, Canada and the autonomous Faroe Islands.</P>
    <P>The urgency of these negotiations is evident and we accept that.  We have no desire to impede them.  We need them too.  Let us be frank about it.  It is important for us on the basis that a Community mandate opens negotiations with, for example, eastern European countries so as to secure agreement for the phasing out of their activities from our 200-mile zones as rapidly as possible.  It would be against our interests to be held up indefinitely because the only effect would be to make it easier, and possibly legal, for ships of other member countries to continue to fish within 12 miles of our shores on the grounds <Col N="441" /> that we had not ourselves opened negotiations for the phasing out process. We need these negotiations because they are important for us, but it is one thing to need them and it is another thing to agree them and go ahead without any indication of the basic principles upon which the internal regime rests.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in the Council of Ministers that we are being unreasonable in this matter, that the details could not be worked out in the time available, which now amounts to weeks at most.  We have not sought for a detailed working out of these arrangements.  We realise there is no time for that.  What we have sought is that the principles to be laid down will be clear and explicit and offer the necessary guarantees to our fishing industry for its expansion, and we reject the suggestion that there should be some artificial linkage between the two negotiations for external and internal regimes, which is untrue. There is no way in which they could start negotiations with Norway and Iceland to give access to Norwegian and Icelandic vessels in any of the 200-mile zones, that would not affect us.  Even if they confined that access to other than the Irish zone, the impact of fishing in the zones to which they gave that access would be such that Community states would be pushed out of that area towards Ireland and it would increase the weight of over-fishing in our area.</P>
    <P>Secondly, negotiations in respect of 200-mile zones cannot take place unless it is clear what the coastal bands will be and the inner limits of the area to which access is given are disclosed.  The idea that the two sets of negotiations can proceed separately, that without settling the internal regime one can negotiate the external one, is completely erroneous and I rejected it totally in the council meeting last week.  Despite that, other member states continue to propound that fallacy.</P>
    <P>We have given ample warnings of the gravity of the situation.  It is not our fault that the Commission's proposals have come so late.  We urged <Col N="442" /> the Commission to produce them earlier.  We pointed out the dangers of delay, the time that would be needed to discuss these matters, in good time before the negotiations had to start with Norway and other countries, and it is not our fault that the Commission left it so late. Why they did so I do not fully understand, but we cannot be put into the position that because they left it so late we must agree to external negotiations before we know what principles will underlie the internal regime.  To accept that would be unreasonable.  It would be an abandonment of a vital national right. We have to know what these proposals are.</P>
    <P>So far, the proposals made by the Commission are totally inadequate for this country.  There is no way in which anybody could reasonably contend that a 12-mile non-exclusive zone, combined with quotas based primarily on historic catches, with a reserve element, could have the effect of guaranteeing the future development of the Irish fishing industry.  The Commission proposals do not have that result and are, therefore, inevitably unacceptable to us.</P>
    <P>From the beginning we made it clear how we thought this matter could best be regulated.  The simplest way, the cleanest way, the way that would cause least difficulty in matters of administration would be a coastal band of up to 50 miles within the outer part of which&mdash;we have to be reasonable in this, and we have been eminently reasonable&mdash;the traditional fishermen who have been fishing off our shores, with suitable sized boats could in a restricted way fish in the outer part, but a 50-mile zone with these limitations.  Without that type of approach, we cannot see how future expansion of the Irish fishing industry can be guaranteed, and no one has suggested to us how it might be guaranteed.  Nobody has attempted to tell us that the Commission proposals will have this effect.  Propaganda in the newspapers of the eight other member states have done so, of course, but nothing has been said to attempt to demonstrate how these proposals <Col N="443" /> could guarantee expansion for our fishing industry, but nobody has attempted to suggest that our proposals do not have that effect.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that our proposals are unreasonable, that they go too far, that they involve far too big a volume of fish being held back from other member countries, more than our fishermen could fish.  Those criticisms have not been accompanied by any alternative proposals that would have the effect that would be necessary for us to accept any internal regime that would not guarantee the future development of the Irish fishing industry.  It may be such proposals will be made.  I cannot exclude that.  I cannot say as a matter of absolute certainty that there could not be other proposals than ours which would have that effect&mdash;to attempt to say that would be absurdly arrogant and would make any negotiations impossible.  It would be merely saying to our partners: &ldquo;We will not listen to you no matter what you say to us&rdquo;, whereas, in fact, our position is a very strong one.</P>
    <P>It is: &ldquo;We are willing to listen to you if you say anything relevant to the problem.  We are not willing to listen to proposals which do not guarantee the future expansion of the Irish fishing industry.  If you do not put forward alternative proposals, then our proposals stand until and unless you put forward proposals which have the effect our proposals have and which we regard as necessary to safeguard our vital interests&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is our position.  It is vital our position should be reasonable.  If we are to win back any of the ground conceded in 1970 we can only do so by being reasonable and by being seen to be reasonable.  We must not underestimate the extent to which other member states have convinced themselves of the justice of their cause. I have rarely seen people so convinced that what is in their self-interest is also a matter of imperative moral right.</P>

      <P>The other member states, particularly the original six. This conviction is in part genuine, even if it is a form of self-delusion. It is genuine enough to pose a real problem because their conviction that they are right&mdash;and I have tried to disturb that by attacking the juridical basis of their claim&mdash;makes them impatient of anything we say and unwilling to listen to the case we make.  Therefore, it is essential for us both to demolish the basis of their claim and to undermine their own convictions, to show that we are determined and that we are reasonable, that we will listen to any proposals they put forward which they claim will give the effect that we seek.  Whether we accept such proposals is something we will have to judge on their merits, if and when we get such proposals.  So far we have not had a hint of such proposals.</P>
      <P>The reason for our amendment is simple.  Had we accepted the motion in its original form we would be saying to the Commission: &ldquo;We are not prepared to listen to anything you say.  Either you give us what we want or we will not play ball&rdquo;.  That is not the way one negotiates and certainly not from the position we find ourselves in, starting from the very weak basis of the 1970 regulations of the Accession Treaty.  We must stand our ground in a situation in which we have made it clear where the answer is.  We must not, however, reject discussion.  We must be willing to listen.  We must not be unwilling to discuss any proposals that would guarantee the continuing expansion of our fishing industry, which is not only in the interests of the fishermen concerned but an important national interest.  It is on that basis that I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

Ní hé sin atá molta ag an Aire.  Táimid le fada <Col N="445" /> ag iarraidh tionscal na hiascaireachta a mhéidiú agus is cinnte go bhfuil dul chun chinn le feiceáil, ach leis na hathraithe ar theoranna iascaireachta atá ag tíortha eile le roinnt blianta, tá an dainséar ann nach mbeadh aon iasc fágtha ar chósta na hÉireann mura nglacfar leis an gcosc ar thíortha eile atá á mholadh ag Fianna Fáil sa rún atá ós comhair an Tí.</P>
      <P>Bheadh sé i bhfad níos fearr ach teorainn 200-míle a éileamh, cosúil leis an Ioslainn, leis an Ioruaidh agus le tíortha eile.  Os baill den Chomhargadh sinn, is dócha go gcaithfimid ár bpáirt a phlé agus ligint dóibh roinnt iascaireachta a dhéanamh taobh istigh den 200-mhíle sin.  Tá mé féin an-imníoch faoi seo. Sé mo thuairim nár chóir dúinn teorainn níos lú ná 200-mhíle a ghéilleadh.  Tá mé cinnte go mbeadh muintir na hÉireann an-mhí-shásta dá nglacfaimis le teorainn níos lú ná 200-mhíle.</P>
      <P>Bíodh sin mar atá, ó thaobh na gcainteanna atá ar siúl ag an Rialtas faoi láthair leis na tíortha eile sa Chomhargadh, tá sé soiléir nach bhfuil iarrtha ag an Rialtais ach teorann náisiúnta 50-míle agus sin í an chúis go bhfuil rún Fhianna Fáil os comhair an Tí.  Chuir sé an díomá ormsa aréir nuair a chuala mé nach raibh an tAire Gnóthaí Eachtracha chun glacadh leis an rún.  Mhol sé leasú a chuir in iúl go raibh sé féin agus an Rialtas sásta glacadh le socrú nach mbeadh trácht dá laghad ann don teorainn 50 míle.</P>
      <P>Ar son muintir mo Dháilcheantair féin agus go háirithe ar son iascairí an cheantair sin, tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire athrú intinne a bheith aige faoin seasamh atá aige nuair a thosnaíonn na cainteanna seo san mBruiséal arís.  Tá mé ag iarraidh air gan géilleadh don bhrú ó thíortha agsúla eile an Chomhargaidh.  Tá mé ag iarraidh air seasamh go láidir maidir leis an teorainn náisiúnta 50 míle.  Má dheineann sé amhlaidh is cinnte go mbeidh tacaíocht gach eagrais sa tír seo taobh thiar de agus beidh buíochas mhuintir na hÉireann tuillte aige.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> Tar éis ar chuala mé ón Aire ar maidin is trua liom nach bhfuil sé chun sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>It greatly concerns me that the Minister has given a clear indication to the House this morning that he is not taking the firm unequivocal stand that the country is asking him to take in seeking an inclusive national 50-mile fishery limit.  The terms of the amendment that have been placed before the House in the Minister's name give a very clear indication that our negotiating position is to be something less than what the country is demanding.  I am not too sure how aware the Minister is of the mood of the people at this time regarding this issue.  I hope he will reconsider his position and that he will take the stand the people are calling on him to take, the stand, in fact, which the people up to now understood he was taking.</P>
    <P>The legal arguments in favour of our case have been put forward very ably by Members of the Fianna Fáil Party who have already spoken.  It does little credit to Ireland's case for the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary to refer to past events when the original negotiations for our entry into the EEC were taking place.  If one reads the Minister's speech in Luxembourg at the EEC Council of Ministers meeting on the 18th and 19th October, one sees that in the first two paragraphs he justifies quite clearly the outcome of the negotiations entered into by the former Fianna Fáil Minister who was negotiating on behalf of the Irish Government at that time.  It does our case little credit to fall back to that political infighting and bringing forward questions and doubts as to whether we got what we could have got at that time.</P>
    <P>The country expects unity on this proposal.  It expects absolute unanimity between the three national political parties and between every section of the community.  The Minister is offered that by the Opposition party in the House.  It is a matter of great dismay that, having been offered that support and the opportunity taken in the House in this <Col N="447" /> motion to assure him publicly of that support, he now indicates the position is something less than what the country is asking for.  Great play was made of the value of possible deposits of offshore oil off the country and the many months spent in negotiations to ensure that Irish interests were protected because of the potential wealth of the minerals, although it had not yet been determined if they were there.</P>
    <P>In the case of fish we are fully aware of the vast wealth that lies within 200 miles of the western shores of this island.  The people will be less than happy if the same attempts are not made to protect that wealth.  The arguments have been made quite cogently that our industry as it stands is underdeveloped, that it has not reached its full potential, that the wealth in the seas off the country has not yet been fully exploited by our fishing industry.  We fully accept this. There are historical and traditional reasons why this is so.  This should not lead us into the trap of giving away part of the wealth of the nation.</P>
    <P>The political correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent</i> is a major source of Government leaks.  I refer to the article in this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i>, &ldquo;Chris Glennon's Political Arena&rdquo;, where we are leaked the information by this gentleman that:</P>
    <P>There is now almost no way that the Foreign Minister, Dr. FitzGerald, can get exclusive 50-mile fishing limits around Ireland.</P>
    <P>Does that not weaken our case?  It is obvious where this line came from. It is obvious that the people are now being conditioned to accept something less than they expected, than they demanded, and which they feel is the minimum right that should be claimed at these negotiations.</P>
    <P>The continued investment in our industry will be seriously affected if we do not achieve an exclusive band of 50-miles for our home fishing fleet.  Our fishing grounds have been raped through the years.  The Minister, quite rightly, in his speech in Luxembourg in October stated that <Col N="448" /> since our entry into the EEC the size of the foreign fleets moving into our fishing grounds has increased enormously and that the quantities they can now catch and take from our seas have increased vastly on the quantities being taken up to 1970. I, like some other Members of the House, have actually been aboard some of those vessels.  Most Irish people understand now the size of those vessels since the episode in Cork recently.  Many people were not aware that such huge vessels were actually used to fish.</P>
    <P>The decisions that are to be taken in the coming weeks or months are crucial to our fishing industry for the next 30 or 40 years.  Can anybody deny that the principles which will be established now will be long lasting?  What further opportunity will we get to adjust those limits and regulations in the future?  Now is the time.  The matter has been brought before our partners in the EEC and now is the time for Ireland to assert her case.  Now is the time for the Minister to prove that he can deliver what the people want.  Even if our industry is in an undeveloped state, the conservation of our stocks is a matter of very great importance.  It is absolutely essential that the plundering of those stocks, which has been undertaken in an indiscriminate way, comes to a halt. There is no other international forum which will allow a halt to be called other than the talks and the decisions which are imminent.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will reassert the original stand he has been asked to take by the Irish Fishermen's Association, by the hundreds of organisations up and down the country who have passed motions in support of the &ldquo;Save Our Seas&rdquo; call by the Irish Fishermen's Association.  Any weakness on our part will be exploited by our partners.  I do not understand the Minister's logic when he says that if he was to accept our motion he would not be in a negotiating position.  If the Minister felt that that was the real position, why did he not seek a larger exclusive area than the 50-miles, knowing that 50 is the minimum <Col N="449" /> our people are prepared to accept?  We have left ourselves in a position of weakness if that is the logic the Minister is applying when entering into talks.  The other member countries will exploit the statement made by the Minister this morning that he is not really serious in taking this hard stand, that he does not now have the support of the people for the 50-mile limit, which was originally stated was the position in this country.  On behalf of the people in my constituency we will not deviate from our insistence that a 50-mile limit exclusive to the Irish fishing fleet shall be established.  That is the attitude of my party in this House and we represent 50 per cent of the electorate.</P>

As the Minister acknowledged this morning, the country responded to a demand by the Minister and the fishery interests for a 50-mile limit as the minimum necessary to protect the present state of our fishing stocks and future development of our fishing industry.  We supported it.  As the Minister often says, there must be some confusion, because I cannot understand how, if we put down a motion supporting a position taken by the Minister in advance of this motion, we can be charged with tying the Minister's hands and of effectively limiting his scope for negotiation.</P>

      <P>The Minister's position, clearly stated, was for a 50-mile zone.  That is, in effect, what we are asking the House to support.  I cannot see why the Minister should accuse us of confusion simply because he now wishes to withdraw from a position previously taken by him.  The <Col N="450" /> Minister, the nation, the future of our economy, and we, want clear determined principles which will guarantee not just our fishery industry but our economy, which by comparison with the economies of the developed states of Europe is certainly an undeveloped economy.  It is quite clear that fishing limits are essential to these guarantees. If major countries such as the United States and Canada, or prosperous countries such as Norway, can recognise that a 200-mile limit is vital to their interests, surely it is flying in the face of the economic reality of the present day world that Ireland has to apologise for seeking, not 200 miles, but 50 miles.  Why should we apologise for agreeing to share with the Community partners what would otherwise not accrue to them&mdash;the exclusive rights between 50 and 200 miles within that coastal limit?  What right would Germany, Belgium or Holland have to those coastal zones off our shores up to 200 miles were it not for us?  Why should we apologise for making a quarter of the demand of other states, who in their knowledge of developing maritime law recognise that 200 miles is the concensus at the moment?</P>
      <P>The Minister this morning talked in terms of the need to be specific and clear, and I agree with that.  But the Minister's amendment is anything but specific and clear.  If the Minister would chide the European Community and the Commission for not giving clear, specific guarantees as to what their proposals are, then I have to chide the Minister, according to his own definitions and criteria, for being much less specific than the European Community.  How can the Minister ask us in this House to support an amendment to our proposal that called for a total opposition to any future European Community common fishery policy which did not reserve exclusively to Irish fishermen a coastal zone of 50 miles?  The Minister wants to add to that the words &ldquo;or otherwise guarantee the future development of the fishing industry&rdquo;.  The Minister has not given any indication this morning of what would otherwise guarantee the future development of the Irish fishing industry.</P>

Surely the Minister does not expect that the nation, recognising that we are in an undeveloped state and recognising that we have this great natural potential, could be satisfied with leaving something as loose and undefined as that as being a statement of our demand to the European Community.  The proposals of the European Commission, vague as they are, talking as they do about vital needs, are at least much more precise than the Minister's.</P>

In relation to the confusion which has been created, in order to refute entirely what the Parliamentary Secretary said yesterday, I intended referring to the opening paragraph of the Minister's speech to the Council of Ministers last week but I find now that I must refer to that speech in order to refute also what the Minister said here this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Parliamentary Secretary.  Only a week ago in that speech to the Council of Ministers the Minister said and I quote:</P>
      <P>It was seen by our people &mdash; and I may add by the then Government and the Opposition of that time&mdash; as involving the attempted imposition on the prospective community of nine of a policy that suited the interest of a community of six&mdash;a policy which, indeed, gave to the original six, who had largely fished out their own waters, a potential right of unlimited access to the waters of Ireland and the United Kingdom.  We had no practical alternative as applicant members but to accept this move, which, however, we viewed as being contrary to the whole spirit of the community as we had understood it to be up to that time: the alternative would have been to have remained excluded from the community....</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a direct rebuttal of what the Parliamentary Secretary said last evening.  However, the Minister was right a week ago in saying that, but he is wrong in what <Col N="453" /> he said this morning because he is trying to withdraw from the position. The Minister knows well that at the time of our accession the question of an economic zone was not an issue and there is no point in his trying to confuse the issue by giving a quick and garbled historical summary to imply that, because certain terms such as &ldquo;sovereignty&rdquo; or &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; were mentioned, his position now is weakened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;coming within the jurisdiction&rdquo; was a reference to the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>To say now that these phrases weaken his position in regard to a 200-mile economic zone is not to accord with any principle of law.  How could any negotiations have taken account of a 200-mile economic zone development when such was not even an issue at the time?  If the Minister is accusing us of not being gifted at the time with clairvoyance, I accept the accusation; but it does not come well from a Minister, a Minister whose hand could be strengthened in this matter, to accuse us of having weakened his position in advance.  He should be prepared to recognise, as he recognised a week ago, that the position was as strong as it could possibly have been.  The basis of that strength is to be found in the remainder of his speech to the Council of Ministers when he went on to refer to the juridical basis of our position.  For the past six months I have been calling on him to state clearly the legal international principle on which our case is based. In this context I can refer to numerous speeches I made during that period.  I shall not detain the House by quoting from the various speeches concerned.  Had the Minister heeded those pleas and taken up the position months ago regarding the issue he has introduced belatedly, we would be in a much stronger position than is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The weakness in our position, if there is such, is not related in any way to the Treaty of Accession, in which there was no mention of a 200-mile economic zone.  The weakness rather lies in the fact that the Minister <Col N="454" /> woke up too late to find that, from an international point of view as well as in the interest of fisheries, we need a 50-mile exclusive limit.  He had cogent arguments to ensure the achievement of that limit.  He has turned the argument in that direction and in so doing has strengthened our position.  Regrettably, though, what has been said here yesterday and this morning has weakened not only our position in general but his position in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <P>No amount of verbal sophistry can undermine the strengthening of position that a common stand from this House can give to the Minister on this question.  It is extraordinary for the Minister to imply that we are weakening his position.</P>
      <P>Regarding the amendment which was presented after I had begun the debate last evening, I could have invoked the Rules of Order and asked that the amendment not be allowed until I had concluded.  However, I chose to take as my priority the question of the national interest.  Since the amendment was tabled in the name of the Parliamentary Secretary I am asking him to withdraw it and to let our case proceed as it had been proceeding at all times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's position has been strengthened by the arguments we have made.  Let it be recognised that, while we wish to continue as full and active members of the Community, we must not be penalised because of the development of new concepts in international law which do not particularly suit the Community.  Why should we as an undeveloped state be penalised for this situation?  Obviously, the Community are proposing to guarantee the access to third country waters of the major fishing fleets.  Again, why should our interests be compromised to protect, for instance, the access of British fleets to Icelandic or Norwegian waters or to protect the French and <Col N="455" /> German fleets?  Having regard to the new developments in international law and to the new concepts now being supported universally, can it not be envisaged that we may become the fishermen of Europe and that the British, the Dutch and others may come to recognise that up to now they have enjoyed overfishing at the expense of other countries?  As a small maritime state should we not be allowed now to exploit to the full our fishery potential?</P>
      <P>Our motion is couched not only in terms of the fishing industry but of the national economy also.  In this context we are endeavouring to arrive at a common stance, whereas the Government's amendment would not have the effect of protecting either the industry or the national economy. That is why I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.  In that event we could endeavour to find a common basis to support the position which I understood all parties to have accepted up to now.</P>

I would have expected more concern from him in relation to whether there will be more refrigerators imported into the country this year than the home market can consume. Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the trade estimates that a refrigerator coming in from one of the Comecon countries would have to be manufactured at £15 to be sold at the price at which it is being sold in this country?

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if An Coimisiún Dumpála have investigated alleged dumping of footwear into this country; and, if so, the results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>An Coimisiún Dumpála has completed two formal investigations of dumping of footwear.  The first, in 1973 at the request of a manufacturer, related to men's working boots imported from Czechoslovakia and resulted in the imposition  <Col N="463" /> by the Government of an anti-dumping duty of 28 per cent <i>ad valorem</i> which has been in force since 18th December, 1973.  The second, in 1975 at the Minister's request, related to footwear imported from certain South-East Asian and other low-cost countries, found that, while there was no injurious dumping at that time, the matter should be kept under review. A third investigation, also at the Minister's request, is now in progress and, in effect, is a continuation of the 1975 investigation; it is not possible to forecast the result of this investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that whatever action has been taken to date has been of no value; that, in fact, the imports, like the imports of refrigerators, are now greater than the total home market consumption and would he state what he proposes to do in relation to this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the question addressed to me by the Deputy is concerned solely with the question of dumping, not with the general measures which may be taken in relation to footwear. Do I take it that his question is merely about the matter of dumping or is he asking a more general question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I have asked relates to dumping.  I assumed that the Parliamentary Secretary would be able to answer any questions in relation to a situation which is so serious that thousands of footwear workers have become unemployed and unemployment faces quite a considerable number of those at present employed in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general question, I would point out to the Deputy that this matter was the subject of parliamenary questions in the House only yesterday.  I can say that I completely repudiate the suggestion made by the Deputy which I think nobody who knows the situation could agree with to the effect that what has been done so far is of no value.  It is obvious that the rate of duty now obtaining on imports of footwear into this country <Col N="464" /> from within the Community is very considerably higher than it would otherwise have been had it not been for the intervention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to have an alteration made in the normal scaling-down of import duties which was to take place under the terms of the Treaty of Accession negotiated prior to the coming into office of the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that had it not been for the pressure from this side of the House the Minister would have done nothing; secondly, that import controls at the present level of tariffs is no higher than in 1975; thirdly, that the imports are flowing in at a much greater rate now than ever before? Surely the Parliamentary Secretary ought to concern himself with this matter rather than trying to score political points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is trying to score political points.  The situation is that the referral of the imports of footwear to the Dumping Commission on the Minister's own initiative was the first ever such initiative by a Minister since the present legislation was enacted to refer matters to the Dumping Commission.  Under previous Governments the situation was that all dumping inquiries were taken solely at the initiative of people in the trade itself.  The situation may be as the Deputy states, that the level of duty is no higher than it was in 1975.  But under the terms of the Treaty of Accession, if these had been adhered to the duties would have been far lower than they were in 1975&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Even for third countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it was the Minister's intervention which ensured that the alteration in the terms was effected.  There is certainly a serious problem in relation to the importation of footwear which is filling an increasing share of our market, and this is a matter about which the Minister has expressed serious concern on a number of occasions.  However, I would point out to the House that there has <Col N="465" /> been a decline in consumption of footwear from whatever source in 1975 as against 1974 of approximately 14 per cent and this is another factor operating in that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may be assured that I am very well aware of the situation in the footwear industry, there being quite a number of footwear factories in my constituency.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that footwear is being imported into this country from low-cost countries and at prices so low that it is obvious that it is dumping? As I did in relation to refrigerators, might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary when he expects a report from the Dumping Commission on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is as obvious as the Deputy says that the footwear in question is being dumped, then I presume the Dumping Commission, which is a technical body competent to make a decision in this matter, will so find but to date their finding has not been reported finally to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>One final question. In view of the fact that the situation has now reached crisis point where stockists are stocking up foreign footwear and where travellers from Irish firms will have very considerable difficulty in having their footwear purchased in the coming year, can the Parliamentary Secretary say what further steps he proposes to take in relation to this very serious situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give an indication as to when the report of the Dumping Commission will be made at this stage.  There is no final date in sight but the situation will be reviewed in the light of the result of this inquiry.  The Minister is in constant touch with the commission to ensure that they realise, as they do, the urgency of the situation and the need to report at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister and the Department <Col N="466" /> not realise that <i>ad valorem</i> duty is absolutely useless with regard to the very low-cost countries?  Would he not take some steps when he knows that shoes can be imported from Taiwan at 75p at Dublin Airport and that 100 per cent <i>ad valorem</i> duty would still bring them up to only £1.50?  Is this not the basic problem at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly is a problem that arises specifically from the low costs that obtained in other countries, as distinct from the question of dumping. To that extent the implication of the Deputy's question is correct. However, I think he is quite wrong in using the term &ldquo;absolutely useless&rdquo; in relation to <i>ad valorem</i> duties and I do not think that he would be prepared to stand over that statement when he reflects on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will stand over it so far as low-cost countries are concerned. That is not EEC trade and I would ask the Department to wake up to the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Parliamentary Secretary's reply and in the light of questions yesterday and today with regard to Irish footwear, does he not regard it as extra stringent to impose on new retailers such conditions as compelling them to buy a complete range of sizes and half-sizes of all their products, compelling them to take a large quantity each time and asking them of their ability to pay and to advise on the footwear industry generally?  Does he not consider this to be out of keeping with the efforts being made to retail Irish-manufactured shoes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very severe competition in the footwear market at the moment and quite clearly it is in the interests of the manufacturers to ensure that every profitable outlet is availed of.  I think that market forces are working in that direction at the moment.  The examiner of restrictive practices has investigated a small number of complaints of refusal to supply in relation to footwear and so far he has found that no unfair practice has been adopted by the manufacturer.  It must be borne in mind that for a manufacturer distribution costs will be higher if he increases the number of outlets to an unreasonable extent given the volume of his total business.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that recently on the programme &ldquo;Here and Now&rdquo; all those complaints were aired?  A retailer from Deputy Faulkner's constituency referred to his inability to get supplies from Irish manufacturers. He was told he was free to use the word &ldquo;blackmail&rdquo; with regard to some Irish manufacturers, and it was explained what would happen to them by the other retailers in the same town if they were to supply him. Does the Parliamentary Secretary not consider such action conducive to encouraging shops to sell foreign shoes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Richard Burke) Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Richard Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of a marine radio officers' course in Letterkenny regional technical college would not be in conformity with the agreed policy under which nautical education and training has been centralised and the necessary facilities provided in the regional technical college, Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the regional technical colleges were originally established to cater for regions?  Would he not also agree that Donegal is a special case in that it has flourishing fishing ports and a marine radio station in Malin Head, and that anybody who wants to pursue this course is a very far distance from the only place where it is being provided, namely, Cork city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects of this.  First of all, in relation to the regional aspect, the Deputy will be aware that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have purchased, or intend to purchase, considerable amounts of sonar, radar and electronic equipment for their installations at Greencastle.  Admittedly, that is some 40 miles or so away from Letterkenny regional technical college, but the <Col N="472" /> region in that sense may be catered for in that way.  On the more general question, the Deputy will realise that this matter was put before a survey team on nautical education in the 1960s&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>How many Donegal men were on the team?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;dealing with the question of nautical education generally.  I give some extracts from that report, and I quote from subparagraph (3) of the summary of recommendations on page 1 of the report:</P>
      <P>that a national nautical education centre should be established as part of a major technical institution providing the many auxiliary teaching services required by such a centre. The Regional Technical College to be constructed in Cork is regarded as the most suitable location.</P>
      <P>Again, on page 3, section 4, it says:</P>
      <P>In the team's view there is a clear case on overall educational grounds for the establishment of a single institution for nautical education in which, for reasons already indicated, the marine radio and electronics courses should be provided as well as those for deck and engineering trainees.  There are sound economic reasons for such a development also.</P>
      <P>I further quote from page 4, section 5, of the report:</P>
      <P>To obtain the services of the best teachers in these subjects (mathematics, science, economics and business studies, work study and personnel management) and to employ them economically requires in the present Irish circumstances that nautical educational courses be associated with major technical institutions where both staff and equipment capable of handling courses at the highest levels required can be provided.</P>
      <P>Since we had this out before in questions in the Dáil, installations in the Dublin area were withdrawn and put in Cork consequent on the report, and it would seem to be unwarranted now to put the equipment in Donegal having deprived Dún Laoghaire of the facilities.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that at present on the staff of the regional technical college in Letterkenny there are three fully qualified teachers in this field?  Would he not further agree that the total equipment cost to provide this course up to internationally recognised level would be about £10,000, and that, seeing that there is so much unemployment among young people at the moment, it is disheartening to know that the companies who employ these officers say they would take twice the number that qualify each year in the Irish schools?</P>

      <P>At this stage it is not possible to say precisely when the planning processes in relation to the extension to the Ursuline Convent secondary school, Waterford, are likely to be completed.  It is expected that the question of a capital allocation for the project will arise in the coming financial year, when it will be considered as sympathetically as possible in the <Col N="479" /> context of departmental committees and availability of resources.</P>

      <P>As I communicated to the Deputy in December, 1975, examination of a revised sketch scheme received in November of that year had just been completed by the Department's architects.  A major extension is to be provided to bring the capacity of the school to 700 places. The current enrolment is 641 girls.  I accept what the Deputy says about pressure being severe.  There has been no delay on the part of my Department. A developed sketch scheme comprising floor plans, sections and elevations, detailed layouts of special subject rooms and cost plans was requested on 10th February, 1976 and received in the Department on 19th July, 1976.  These plans and cost proposals are still under consideration. As I indicated in my answer, every effort will be made to clear them at an early date.  The next stage of planning will involve preparation of working drawings and specifications for both the building and the mechanical and electrical services.  The question of making a capital allocation will be considered when the tender stage of the planning process is reached next year.  At that point the extent of the commitments in relation to secondary school building projects under construction and the availability of capital will determine the date for the seeking of tenders.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Water Pollution) Bill, 1976 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has many good points in it and I am interested in knowing by what standards we judge the regulations.  The terms &ldquo;pollution&rdquo; and &ldquo;polluted&rdquo; have a highly emotive connotation which cannot be satisfactorily defined, let alone <Col N="491" /> measured.  Professor Crisp, of University College, North Wales, who recently carried out a survey of the River Liffey, uttered those words.  Certain standards are laid down in section 26, but are they sufficient?  Must we go through the experience of testing them before we know whether or not they are suitable regulations.  Subsection (2) of that section states:</P>
      <P>(2)  Regulations under this section may relate to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  all or specified, or specified classes of, waters, trade effluents or sewage effluents,</P>
      <P>(ii)  waters, trade effluents or sewage effluents in specified areas, or</P>
      <P>(iii)  waters specified by reference to their use.</P>
      <P>The standards laid down by them may be excellent, but this is such a serious problem for us that we will have to measure them correctly.  Do we measure them by Irish standards or by European or American standards?  In Europe, the United States and Great Britain they are more industrialised than us and, therefore, have greater problems.  This Bill affords us a great opportunity of setting new standards in the combating of pollution to ensure that our environment will be clean.  This can only happen if we lay down a proper set of standards.</P>
      <P>A slovenly or dirty society would accept pollution of a high order while most European cities would not accept this.  I see a hope of our improving our environment when this Bill is passed and that we will be able to keep our rivers, lakes and the sea around us clean.  That will happen only if we can apply the measures contained in the Bill.  We all know that at present the law is more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  We must show the public, who support us in our efforts to combat pollution, that we are serious.  We must insist that the penalties contained in the Bill will be applied whenever the law is broken.  We also need to educate our people in habits which will prevent pollution.  We want to educate our people so that they will guard jealously their local river, lake or piece of coastline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> There was great despondency in Europe some years ago on whether or not they could combat the pollution of rivers.  In this regard I should like to pay tribute to the authorities in London who have dealt with the pollution of the River Thames.  Some years ago to fall into that river and swallow some of the water would mean death for a human being.  All marine and fish life was destroyed in that river, but the authority involved have done such a magnificent job on the river that fish and marine life have returned.  I accept that millions were spent on this work and that we could not afford to spend such an amount. While the River Liffey may not be Anna Livia Plurabelle, as mentioned by Joyce, we are taking steps to combat the pollution problem by preparing the Dodder Valley drainage scheme and the Grand Canal scheme. I am optimistic that within the next three years rivers like the Liffey, the Dodder, the Tolka and the Camac will be clean rivers.</P>
    <P>No fewer than 28 rivers and streams run through Dublin city.  Some are underground and may be clean, but they all flow into the sea.  With regard to our beaches we are influenced a good deal by the fact that we are so close to Great Britain.  Anything discharged into the sea around Great Britain may affect our coastline, and if we are careless in discharging into the sea we could affect their coastline. We will all have to view the problem of the pollution of our seas in a more serious way.  I believe it will be necessary to establish an international sea authority to deal with this problem. My fear is that when this Bill is passed it will not be applied sufficiently to make it an effective weapon in combating pollution.  Some years ago when I served on a fisheries board a firm admitted an accidental discharge of effluent into a river and further downstream hundreds of fish were poisoned, but we could not get a conviction because we could not show that the effluent discharged was the cause of the death of the fish.  The firm were honourable and admitted that they discharged the effluent there accidentally but they did not admit that they poisoned fish.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> Under this Bill a local authority may prosecute not only within their own jurisdiction but outside also.  This is a step forward.  In Dublin there is an anomalous situation where the corporation limits end at Heuston Station and are joined by Kildare and a part of Wicklow.  Of course, Kildare and Wicklow County Councils may also prosecute outside their areas.  I would like to see this Bill providing a centralised office which would direct prosecutions.  This would make anti-pollution measures more effective.</P>
    <P>It has been said that, because of the importance of tourism, we should press forward with more anti-pollution measures.  Pollution is bad in itself, but we should pursue every possible measure which will give us cleaner rivers, lakes or seas, even irrespective of the tourist trade.  Of course, we must keep a sense of proportion when we are discussing this problem.  It must be remembered that nature herself can be a pollutant.  Pollution of a lake need not be caused by effluents; it can be caused by nature.  Pollution and pollutants are emotive words, but, as I said, we must keep a sense of proportion when discussing this matter.</P>
    <P>We have examples of fishing clubs and organisations, local improvement committees and so on who are very jealous of the state of their local rivers or lakes.  If we allow our environment to be damaged more, it will be impossible to live in that atmosphere. Nowadays self-respecting countries do not drop atom bombs&mdash;we hope their good sense will stop them dropping any more&mdash;and as a result the atmosphere is less polluted.  This Bill will help to keep pollution under control.  I am satisfied it will only be as effective as we wish it to be, because despite the legislation on our books in previous years, our rivers and lakes and beaches were polluted.</P>
    <P>In future years we will have a growing tourist trade.  People will come here because European beaches will be overcrowded and entry will be restricted.  So far we have very little of that in Ireland and we do not want it. Our beaches should be free for everybody. We must jealously guard our golden beaches from pollution.  Last <Col N="494" /> summer some of the most technologically advanced countries were almost brought to a standstill industrially because of a water shortage.  In certain areas in Britain they had to go back to the parish pump or put a hydrant in the road so that the people could draw water.  This brought a sophisticated society back more than 100 years, to the time before there was a centralised water service.  We did not have such a severe drought here but perhaps this was because we had more rain than other areas.  In the Dublin and Wicklow areas we were saved from drought by the men who planned the artificial lakes at Poulaphouca and ensured that this city would always have an ample supply of water.  These men should be remembered for their foresight.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been given a good reception by Fianna Fáil because we realise we are dealing with a very serious problem.  Our spokesman, Deputy J. O'Leary, has given great thought to this Bill.  We hope it will be used to keep our rivers, lakes and seas free from pollution.  As I said, the Bill has some good points but I fear that it will not be applied in a way that will preserve our drinking water.</P>
    <P>I compliment Dublin Corporation, the Dublin Port and Docks Board and the ESB who had a survey carried out on the Liffey estuary and Dublin Bay by the University College of North Wales.  They gave us a fine report.  I have not gone through this report word for word, but I am pleased that the water in Dublin Bay is better than was forecast.  Nobody should be complacent about this.  We must be vigilant and take all possible measures to keep our waters clean.  I would also like to pay a tribute to the students of University College, Dublin, who helped in this survey.  In my view, it would be a very good idea to have a survey of every bay carried out to ensure that our high standards of pure water will be maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the general principle behind this Bill but I have a few reservations.  This Bill was drafted on the basis of the report on water pollution to the Minister for <Col N="495" /> Local Government in 1972.  This was the inter-departmental working group and that group was set up to study not alone water pollution but air pollution as well.  I am sorry to see that there is nothing constructive in this Bill with regard to air pollution.  I shall expand on that later.</P>
      <P>Many general points have been made by Members on both sides on the provisions of this Bill.  I want to emphasise the problem of water pollution as it affects my constituency of North County Dublin.  That constituency includes the beach at Portmarnock, Malahide, Donabate, Portrane, Rogerstown, Rush, Loughshinny, Skerries, Ballingeera and Balbriggan.  These are golden beaches.  Despite the length of our coastline, there is a paucity of beaches and, from that point of view, Dublin is in a very happy position, indeed, because of the availability of beaches to the citizens.  These beaches are relatively unpolluted.  I say &ldquo;relatively&rdquo; because there is a certain amount of pollution.  I use the word &ldquo;pollution&rdquo; in the sense in which it is defined.  Indeed, I should like on Committee Stage more clarification as to what pollution actually means in relation to bathing places.  In North County Dublin we have some of the finest bathing places in the country and we are very fortunate in having this amenity in such close proximity to the capital.  These beaches serve too the spillover population residents in Portmarnock, Malahide, Swords, Portrane, Donabate, Rush, Lusk, Skerries, Balbriggan, Loughshinny, Donaghamede, Darndale, Grangemore and right across into Ballymun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we are going far enough in regard to pollution as defined here and as spelled out in the EEC report.  I should like to see acceptable standards set in regard to bathing places so that people who use these magnificent beaches will be protected in their use of them.  The report to which my colleague, Deputy Moore, referred gave a certain clearance to the Dublin Bay area and it was rigid enough in its definition but I should like a clear definition as to exactly what the situation is from the point of view of pollution of bathing areas.  Our <Col N="496" /> beaches are a God-given amenity and I do not want to see them damaged by pollution from oil refineries, sewerage or anything else.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that there will be adequate protection against large-scale estuarine dumping.  There was a proposal by our county engineer to include literally hundreds of acres along the coastline for estuarine dumping. This dumping would cover domestic refuse of both the city and county as well as commercial refuse.  It was referred to as &ldquo;controlled estuarine dumping&rdquo;.  But, even with control, how can one possibly avoid damaging these golden beaches?  I believe the legislation should be tightened up.  Nothing should be allowed which might damage in any way this amenity availed of so extensively by the growing population in North County Dublin, a young population very much aware of the amenity they have in such close proximity.  I want to see very tight controls against the possibility of further estuarine dumping.</P>
    <P>I do not see how this Bill can be considered in isolation from the problem of coast erosion.  Coast erosion is a big problem in my constituency. It probably constitutes a problem in other maritime constituencies as well. There is no really adequate coast protection. Two years ago we proposed to the Office of Public Works a solution to the problem in County Dublin.  The cost was about £1.75 million.  We have not even got to the stage of the necessary initial survey.  One must, whether one likes it or not, tie together pollution, estuarine dumping and coast erosion because the problems posed by these can only be solved adequately by proper protection.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to get something constructive under way to protect the few miles of beach from the problems they are facing at the moment from all sides, such as dumping, sewage disposal, erosion by the sea and the winds.</P>
    <P>Most of the points I am anxious to make are included in pages 64, 65 and 66 of the Water Pollution Report of the Inter-Departmental Working <Col N="497" /> Group, 1972, and are laid out there in detail.  Most of these points have also been highlighted in a localised fashion by many of my colleagues on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>However, I am bitterly disappointed that the Parliamentary Secretary, and the Minister in drafting the legislation, did not extend it to include the other item which was forwarded to this inter-departmental working group, and that is the question of air pollution.  Here we have a potentially serious situation and I should like to see the introduction of an air pollution Bill at this stage rather than in five or ten years' time when the damage has already been done.</P>
    <P>In principle I welcome the Bill. There are a number of problem areas which have not been adequately covered by this Bill and I hope to speak on these on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I welcome this Bill, but I am bold enough to make the suggestion that the Short Title should be changed to read &ldquo;Local Government (Water Pollution Control) Bill, 1976&rdquo; because in my view that is what this Bill is all about, the control of pollution, the abatement and rectification of any existing pollution.  Perhaps also there is a lesson that the Dáil and the Oireachtas generally could well learn from the fact that the report on which this Bill is generally based was commissioned in December, 1970 and now almost six years later it is coming before us.</P>
      <P>This is legislation that is very badly needed because since our entry into the EEC there has been a significant increase in the number of very large chemical and other industries with toxic waste.  There is an urgent need to set standards for this, and this is one area in which the Bill fails.  These standards are not set although I know that one section gives the Minister authority to do so.  I should like to see those standards set immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago in my constituency there was a considerable amount of controversy which threatened for a certain time to split the community.  This controversy concerned the establishment of a major industry but it should <Col N="498" /> not have taken place and would not have taken place if the standards of which I spoke had been set and were there for the industrialists to see before setting up industries.  At the time there was a considerable amount of confusion and some doubt still exists in the minds of some people, though not in my mind.  I am satisfied with the controls that have been suggested and with the methods being used to monitor the effluent that will come from the factory, but a considerable amount of ill-will was engendered over something that should have been set out clearly in the first instance.  Section 26 of this Bill should be made operative quickly because there will be, I hope, more industry and I do not want to see in any place the hostility or the anger and the suspicion that happened in my own area.</P>
    <P>Section 2 should also be taken into account and set up straight away.  That is the section which states that the Minister shall by order appoint a water pollution advisory council.  This is essential and should be done the moment the Bill becomes law so that standards can be established for everyone to see.</P>
    <P>In the report on water pollution special significance was laid on the fact that local authorities themselves were among the worst offenders and I ask the House what the position will be where a local authority are causing pollution. Will a board of conservators or an ordinary individual or the Minister take action against that local authority? By virtue of the fact that the local authority will, under this Bill, be given the power to control pollution, and the power to issue licences, the board of conservators might find themselves in a slightly invidious position.  Will the Minister or his agents take action against the local authority causing the pollution?</P>
    <P>I can clearly recollect a case some years ago where a board of conservators took a local authority to court for causing pollution.  As far as I can remember, the only outcome of that was a considerable financial loss to the board of conservators.  Although the Minister or the board of conservators can take legal action, the cost of such <Col N="499" /> proceedings is a real disincentive to such action.  Deputy Moore said that he had experience of an instance in which a firm admitted putting effluent into a river but denied that this effluent had caused the death of fish in the river.  This is a real difficulty in nearly all pollution cases.</P>
    <P>The report mentions this.  The people making that report feel that even when the investigation is carried out very early it is almost impossible to pin down definitely the actual source of the pollution.  There is a certain truth in the adage that the lack of money is the root of all evil.  If this legislation is not to be another collection of pious platitudes there is need for a substantial injection of cash to local authorities, industrialists and the farming community to make the transition from the haphazard arrangement which exists at the moment to the state the Bill envisages and which, hopefully, will be reached in the near future.  This could be done over a number of years.  If things were to turn out the way they have in other countries the expenditure of this money would be far cheaper in the long run than what they are now facing.  Some of those countries have to pay huge sums of money to clear up the mess they have allowed their rivers and lakes to fall into.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I watched a television programme about the great lakes in Canada.  It would be well worth while for the Parliamentary Secretary to try to get RTE to show that film once again.  It would bring home to everybody the need for this Bill and what pollution can mean because what occurred in those lakes changed what was a major, residential, tourist and holiday area into a collection of shanty towns.  It made one of the best known property areas into an area where it was impossible to sell a house.  It made a lake as big as Ireland into a place where it was only possible to bathe in the very centre.</P>
    <P>We have great resources of good, clean water but we have the habit of shrugging our shoulders when we hear of things like this happening.  We say with a great deal of complacency that <Col N="500" /> it could not happen here.  It will unless we take definite, positive action.  I hope when the Bill becomes law that it will be possible to do that.  Some of our best lakes have been badly polluted.  The report on pollution said that in 1972 approximately 10 per cent of our rivers and lakes were badly polluted. We should take care that others do not suffer the same fate.</P>
    <P>Section 22 is one of the cornerstones of the Bill because it matters little if local authorities issue licences and are unable to ensure that the effluent strength for which they issue the licences is being complied with. Money will be needed in this area.  The Parliamentary Secretary should ensure that where county councils appoint environmental officers those appointments will be sanctioned by the Department as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The deliberate poisoner is not mentioned in the Bill.  A section should have been devoted to him.  While the fines are high in the case of an industry, a farmer or even a local authority polluting a river, there should be a special place for such a person because he has caused great damage in most areas.  Such a person may be covered in other legislation.  There should be a mandatory jail sentence for somebody like that because he does not care for fishermen, tourists or anybody and only cares for his immediate gain.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to education and publicity.  If the film I spoke about was made available to schools and groups, like An Taisce, to be shown in provincial areas, and was made part of a good publicity campaign that would embrace schools, national, secondary and university we could get across to people how important it is to keep our rivers and waters clean.  I once heard of a town that entered the Tidy Towns competition which had trained the children so well that if a person dropped a piece of paper on the street the child came up and put it into a litter bin. Every town needs to do something like that to ensure that this Bill will work. There is a song that mentions cool, clear water.  We have it.  Let us make certain that we keep it because it will <Col N="501" /> be one of our greatest attractions and assets both in the industrial and tourist fields.  It is essential that we marry the opposite views and demands of those two industries to hold this and to make certain of it.  The point has been made by many speakers on this side of the House, and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree, that all the responsibility for pollution and for the environment should be in the hands of one department.  We on this side of the House have recognised the importance of this in appointing a spokesman for the environment and I urge the Government to do the same.</P>
    <P>There is an apparent contradiction in the summary of the report which on page 64, paragraph 8 states that existing administrative arrangements for dealing with water pollution controls are defective, largely because there is not a single, central co-ordinating authority charged with overall responsibility and because local authorities lack the necessary powers and resources. The report goes on to say that other Ministers and semi-State bodies should in general retain their existing responsibilities in relation to water pollution.  That suggestion is qualified somewhat by the addition of the words &ldquo;subject to adequate co-ordination&rdquo;. I feel that the recommendation that overall responsibility at central level for arrangements for the control of water pollution should be exercised by the Minister for Local Government. I do not agree with the suggestion that the Minister's responsibility should be mainly a co-ordinating and advisory responsibility.  I think a Department like the Department of Local Government should have the central control.</P>
    <P>We are now moving into an age of shorter working week and greater leisure periods.  With more time on our hands we are looking for more and more outlets and it is very important that a Department could make certain that the amenity areas that we as citizens are looking for would be provided and that they would be up to certain standards.  I look forward to the introduction of another Bill encompassing all aspects of pollution and the protection of the environment and which will bring up to date all the <Col N="502" /> existing legislation in relation to water pollution.  I welcome this Bill and I would like to see it in operation because I feel that it is long overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been under discussion in the House for some time and quite a number of points were raised and much ground covered in relation to pollution.  The extent of pollution which we have at the moment was not fully realised nor was it realised that the more we endeavour to extend social and economic activities the more we were endangering the environment.  Regrettably, the last speaker referred to pollution in general.  It is not generally recognised here that we are polluted in more ways than one.  One has only to look at the streets of any town to realise this and it will have to be brought home to the young generation and also to quite a number of adults that pollution exists in many guises and does not merely extend to water alone.  The value of water was brought home to us this summer and, indeed, during the last two summers and the winters in the sense that we have had a record run of dry seasons and the level of water in this country has been considerably lower than usual.  We are all aware of the fact that during the summer in Wales and in England the threat of pollution and the threat of water supplies was severe, pressing and immediate so much so that the Welsh authorities had thought of importing water.  Fortunately, it did not come to that stage but it was very near to it.  We have no guarantee that if we had a run of dry seasons and reasonably moderate winters that did not produce heavy rainfall we would not run the risk of a scarcity of water or run the greater risk of having increased water pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity that we could not have some documentaries on this subject. When one sees the waste of time and money involved in producing muck on television in the shape of violent films and so on one always regrets the fact that we are not able to reach a stage where we would be able to put across a few documentaries on this subject.  Well-produced documentaries would be much more effective than if <Col N="503" /> we were to talk in this House for time out of mind.  If we are serious about tackling the problem of pollution we should consider this aspect. Last summer and the summer before and, indeed, the summer before that, quite a number of beautiful lakes and rivers were polluted to the extent that marine life was nearly wiped out in a few of them.  On the one hand, we are engaged in spending money trying to attract people here on holidays and, on the other hand, we are spending great amounts of money in promoting industrial development and we are also engaged in trying to develop intensive farming.  The more intensified each of these arms of production becomes the greater the threat to our rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>We have had various studies and much advice on this subject, but it is my contention that there are too many Departments and too many units within the Departments involved in this whole question.  In my opinion local authorities are the people best suited and located to deal with the problem, but we would not appear to have become aware yet that this is the case.  The Department of Local Government could play a much greater role in the potential control of pollution and could become more aggressive in regard to the problem.  They should proceed to act in accordance with the laws available.  Up to now the question of pollution control has been treated in a benign way.  Pollution has the potential of destroying our tourist trade and of destroying aquatic life in our rivers and lakes.  If we allow such a situation to develop we can only blame ourselves for the consequences. The whole matter should be the subject of the executive powers of one Ministry.  Having regard to the amount of advice we have received from the various experts there is no reason for our not being able to tackle the problem now.</P>
    <P>There are no signs that local authorities are moving as fast as they might in this area.  The increasing number of septic tanks being installed in rural areas present an immediate danger of pollution although they make for higher living standards.  The use of nitrogenous <Col N="504" /> manures have resulted in much increased production from the land, but we must not overlook the dangers their use presents in the area of pollution in that they may cause spurious growth in waters which, in turn, kill fish life.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that one Department of State be used as an instrument for controlling pollution, not only from the point of view of the physical control of the problem but also from the point of view of propaganda.  So far there has been little propaganda in relation to this question.  Might not television be used as an instrument for bringing to the attention of the public the potential dangers that face us unless we are very careful now to guard against this evil. Perhaps the apathy in this regard stems from our having enjoyed pure waters in wells, rivers and lakes, but that situation is changing.  Apart from the consequences for ourselves, it would be regrettable, having regard to the crowded conditions that exist in Britain and on the Continent, if we were to allow any part of our water supply system to become polluted.  Consequently strict vigilance is necessary in this whole area.  Already it is somewhat late in the day that we have come to this realisation.</P>
    <P>In endeavouring to reach an assessment, albeit an elementary one, of this question of our water power I read somewhere that certain counties have greater water resources than have others.  This is something which is not generally recognised.  I believe, for instance, that Kildare is one such county and that if ever the time were reached when we would be bottling water for export this county, which is relatively well-off, would be also one of the richest in water resources.  The day may be reached when water is exported from here to the Continent, for instance.</P>
    <P>We have always taken it for granted that our waters are unpolluted but we can no longer afford to be apathetic in this regard because the activities of mankind have brought about a situation which, if not curtailed, will result in the human species being poisoned from the face of the earth.  Therefore it behoves all of us, not merely those of us in public life, to be vigilant in <Col N="505" /> regard to pollution.  As a member of a local authority my attention is drawn to the problems of pollution control to a much greater extent than I am made aware of them as a Member of this House.  That is why I say that local authorities are the agents best suited to deal with the problem in general and to develop bye-laws to deal with pollution.</P>
    <P>If a farmer develops an intensive stock fattening system and extends his farmyard from a relatively small area into an enormous complex, the parish or townland where he is located is much more in danger of pollution than it was if the unit is not laid out in such a way as to provide barriers against pollution.  I live in the country and I am very interested in this subject.  I have no idea how a system of barriers could be erected in any river to prevent the river polluting the nearby lakes. As members of local authorities, we should be thinking in those terms. Money is scarce enough, and we have not the wherewithal to build roads considering the price of materials, never mind to erect barriers in rivers or to take the other necessary steps to contain and control pollution.</P>
    <P>Pollution has to be controlled or it will get out of hand.  I mention these few points so that people who do not think too deeply about this matter may be brought to inquire about it.  It starts on the hearthstone.  Parents should not look to the teachers to inculcate anti-pollution ideas into the minds of the young.  Unless we start on the hearthstone, these ideas will not take root.  I am watching motorists in my own local authority area who, if they get the chance, will dump the contents of their backyard in somebody's lane.  So long as we have citizens like that, how far will we get with the control of pollution?  Until we take steps to prosecute people for dumping refuse illegally, we will not get anywhere.  Let us practise what we preach.  Local authorities should have a code.  We have enough legislation in this book to arm us with all the powers necessary to control and contain pollution.  How many local authorities avail of this?  Very few.</P>
    <P>I talked very briefly about intensified <Col N="506" /> farm production.  This is to be welcomed.  It is a wonderful move. Europe has conferred wonderful benefits on us in that we can now intensify and expand our activities in the farmyard. It is more like a factory now than a farmyard but, if it is, the danger of pollution is ever present.  What steps are we taking to keep ourselves abreast on the other side?  When I say &ldquo;the other side&rdquo; I mean anti-pollution measures.  Do we strictly supervise the outlets from factories? Have we the necessary barriers to prevent polluted water reaching the nearest river?  Are our sewerage systems, which are underground in the various towns, fully equipped to deal with the threat of untreated sewage going into the nearest river?  Those are the questions we should be asking ourselves not merely as Members of this House but as members of local authorities. We should not leave it all to the officials.  Undoubtedly, An Foras Forbartha have made great strides and provided wonderful information.  They are always ready to advise on this matter.  How many people telephone An Foras Forbartha for advice, people who are developing on an agricultural basis or an industrial basis?</P>
    <P>We even hear of pollution by Bord na Móna.  They do their best to avoid pollution.  The pollution spread by Bord na Móna is quite different from the poisonous pollution I am talking about.  Turf mould is lethal to fish.  I am sure Bord na Móna are striving might and main to avoid the varnishing of rivers.  The dust from the milled peat puts a kind of varnish on the bottom of the river and kills marine life.  I did not have the time to ask Bord na Móna what progress they have made, but I am quite sure the answer would be satisfactory.  They are working overtime on that aspect. We are not working overtime at central and local authority level.</P>
    <P>We should have a good educational system to deal with pollution.  Visual aids would be helpful.  Children and young people would be interested in visual aids.  They would like to see a good documentary.  How many documentaries have we on this matter? Very few.  One could go through the <Col N="507" /> book and talk about all aspects of this, but let us take it at its most elementary.  Let us take it in stages. Let us make some progress on some front.  I am not saying we have not made some progress.  We would be a very poor society if we had not.  We have not made sufficient progress.  We are not abreast of the times in dealing with pollution.  We should all pursue an educational programme which would be of considerable help in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to delay the House very long on this very welcome measure.  Many people have contributed to this debate in the Seanad and in this House, and the House will be anxious to reach the further Stages of the Bill.  Much has been said regarding water pollution and, indeed, other forms of pollution in recent years.  Society as it tends to become more affluent tends also to become a little more protective of its environment, whereas when economic pressures come on people they tend to loosen any standard they might have. Up to some time ago we had quite a lot of talk of pollution but in recent times we have been speaking in terms of economic difficulties and we have, as it were, let the environment slip into second place.  I regret that.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 1 of the explanatory memorandum states:</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to make more effective arrangements for control of water pollution with a view to ensuring that the quality of water resources is maintained to a satisfactory standard consistent with their various beneficial uses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Water pollution in Ireland could be considered in terms of rivers, lakes and what is known as fish kills.  As regard fish kills we are relatively fortunate. Each outbreak is lamented, of course, and is highlighted but we do not have this to the same high degree as takes place abroad.  Fish kills in Ireland tend to occur as a result of some form of accident but these are one indication of pollution.  I was reading a report regarding river pollution that states there would be 35 <Col N="508" /> stretches of river in the country that could be classified as polluted.  Ofttimes people if they see effluent going into a river say that that causes pollution but that is not necessarily so.  It depends on the river's ability of self-purification. Even so, some of these stretches are bad enough and we should strive to have better quality, clean water.  With lakes the problem of water pollution is worse.  One deals with inland lakes, and I believe that some of the factors there are pig slurry, agricultural waste and so on. Very often lakes do not have the same movements as rivers and hence the chance of self-purification would be less.</P>
    <P>We speak in terms of what people require nowadays.  People require clean water.  Industry requires clean water. Prior to the industrial revolution all water would have been relatively clean or completely clean.  As industry developed, we had pollution following in its track.  Also we know how, in the course of the long, dry spell, areas that normally had an ample supply of clean water were running short and measures were being taken to supply it.  Indeed, our nearest neighbour across the water set up some form of department to investigate the possibility of the transportation of water from areas of ample supply to areas of drought.  Discussion took place as to whether the natural or man-made waterways could be used to transport water which then could be skimmed off at a location where it would be required.</P>
    <P>But need the oncoming of industry bring about water pollution?  Need it bring about an erosion of natural resources that we like?  No, it need not, and if this Bill will help to see that we have a resource maintained it is to be welcomed.  We are comparatively lucky here when we consider what has happened abroad in areas where whole lakes and rivers have been destroyed to the point where it is impossible to salvage or restore them.</P>
    <P>In terms of other pollution, we have air pollution.  We in Ireland are lucky. We do not experience the problems of London or of New York.  Regarding water pollution, we had the disaster of the <i>Torry Canyon</i> many years ago.  We <Col N="509" /> tend to take a lot for granted in having water as a resource until such disaster comes along.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to delay the House.  People say we should have an Ireland which is clean and unpolluted, and they equate this with being an Ireland of freedom, of pastoral outlook as if it were a garden, a land of milk and honey without any of the difficulties.  Others see industrialisation coming along, and the harmony, peace and solitude all being pushed away and this is the contrast between the unspoiled and what is put down as progress.  However, we must make progress, but progress must be planned and controlled so as to be truly beneficial to the country and to the people who live in and enjoy the benefits of the country.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to place on record my very grateful thanks and sincere appreciation to all Deputies who have contributed to this debate.  The views expressed have been noted for their common sense and most intelligent approach to this Bill.  No one will agree more than Deputy C. Murphy that we live in a very fine country.  Our climate is neither too warm nor too cold.  We have rivers, lakes, valleys, mountains, barren land, extensive forests, beautiful walks and pleasantly laid-out villages and towns. In addition to all that, we are blessed with good fisheries, all forms of sporting amenities and, generally speaking, we have many great qualities and blessings that numerous other countries have not.</P>
      <P>For that reason there is a great responsibility on all of us to preserve what we have, to hold on to what we have, improve it and make it more attractive.  In the course of this debate we have heard many views expressed that were, perhaps, outside the scope of the Bill but, nevertheless, worthy of serious note and thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Opinions were expressed in relation to the environment in general.  The debate has served a very great and useful purpose because it has focused attention on the qualities or lack <Col N="510" /> thereof of the environment.  Many times in this House we have been usefully occupied in relation to all aspects of legislation involving every Department.  However, it is very seldom that we get an opportunity of having a common-sense debate free of politics on a matter that concerns all of us, namely, the environment.  This involves the scenery, the air we breath, the water we use.  In recent years throughout the world there has been greater emphasis on improving the environment.</P>
    <P>During the debate reference was made to co-operating with other countries with a view to improving environmental standards.  In this connection I will quote from the speech by the Taoiseach to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe held at Helsinki on 30th July and 1st August, 1975.  The Taoiseach made an outstanding speech on that occasion. He said:</P>
    <P>Throughout the conference, the European Economic Community played a significant role.  My country, in common with its partners in the Community, shares the aim of building peace and co-operation in Europe and working towards greater human contact and wider freedom.  For its own part, and as a member of the European Community, Ireland will work to implement fully the programme of action which the documents of this Conference set out; and it will be ready to try to develop and expand its scope if this should prove possible as time goes on.  We hope and believe that all the States participating here today will do no less.</P>
    <P>He was referring to the Final Act as set out for signature at that conference. He dealt in particular with the environment where commitments were entered into by all member states of the EEC.  I wish to quote from that conference where it was stated:</P>
    <P>To attain these aims, the participating States will make use of every suitable opportunity to co-operate in the field of environment and, in particular, within the areas described below as examples.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> One of the examples, although not covered in this Bill, was referred to in the course of the debate by a number of Deputies, particularly Deputy Ray Burke.  The example given was the control of air pollution.  The report of the conference stated:</P>
    <P>Desulphurisation of fossil fuels and exhaust gasses; pollution control of heavy metals, nitrogen oxides, in particular those emitted by transport, power stations and other industrial plants; system and methods of observation and control of air pollution and its effects, including longrange transport of air pollutants;</P>
    <P>With regard to water pollution control and fresh water utilisation the following steps were mentioned:</P>
    <P>Prevention and control of water pollution, in particular of trans-boundary rivers and international lakes; techniques for the improvement of the quality of water and further development of ways and means for industrial and municipal sewage effluent purification; methods of assessment of fresh water resources and the improvement of their utilisation, in particular by developing methods of production which are less polluting and lead to less consumption of fresh water.</P>
    <P>This has special references to the Bill before the House.  It is one of the practical steps being taken to fall into line and co-operate more fully with what is in progress in other European countries.</P>
    <P>At the Helsinki conference they dealt with protection of the marine environment which is a matter for another Minister.  They also dealt with land utilisation and soils, again a matter for another Minister, and they dealt with nature conservation and nature reserves and the improvement of environmental conditions in areas of human settlement.  They also dealt with environmental conditions associated with transport, housing, working areas, urban development and planning, water supply and sewage disposal systems, and the assessment of the <Col N="512" /> harmful effects of noise and noise control methods.  At that conference reference was made to the collection, treatment and utilisation of wastes, including the recovery and recycling of materials and research on substitutes for non-biodegradable substances. There was reference also to fundamental research, monitoring, forecasting and the assessment of environmental changes, to the study of changes in climate, to the landscape and to ecological balances under the impact of natural factors and human activity.  There was also reference to the forecasting of possible genetic changes in flora and fauna as a result of environmental pollution, to the harmonisation of statistical data, the development of scientific concepts and systems of monitoring networks, to the standardisation methods of observation, measurement and assessment of changes in the biosphere, assessment of the effect of environmental pollution levels upon human health, study and development of criteria and standards for various environmental pollutants and regulations regarding production and use of various products.</P>
    <P>It can be seen, therefore, that there is on the part of the Government a very keen desire to implement practical steps such as are provided in this Bill to improve the environment.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this Bill is only an instalment of environmental legislation. I have a very keen and personal interest in this matter, an interest which has been displayed not alone today in relation to this Bill but during the years in which I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries from 1954 to 1957 and when I was alarmed at what I considered to be a problem in regard to the pollution of our rivers and lakes. Twenty years ago there was no great outcry particularly in regard to the damage that was being done to our coarse fishing.  French anglers, who have been coming to this country in increasing numbers, were commencing at that time to express concern at the pollution of certain rivers and lakes which they frequented.  I felt at that time that we should, in the interests of tourism, lay the foundations for the <Col N="513" /> protection of coarse fishing, bearing in mind the importance which the Inland Fisheries Trust attached to coarse fishing as a tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>I am perhaps more agitated about this matter now than I was 20 years ago because I have seen the serious consequences of the damage to our fisheries through pollution&mdash;maybe not to the extent that causes us wide alarm, because we have had the report of the survey which has been carried out by An Foras Forbartha and to which I have referred in my opening speech. We may be better off in this regard than many other countries.  Nevertheless we should deal with this matter with courage and determination in order to protect our fisheries and our tourist industry, particularly for anglers who can enjoy facilities in this country that are not available in most other countries.</P>
    <P>I have made this reference to the Taoiseach's speech at Helsinki, because the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe gave a high priority to the environment.  The environment is no less important to this Government now than it was on the occasion of the conference in Helsinki on 30th July and 1st August, 1975.  It would be my desire that we in Ireland, because of our geographical situation because of the size of our population and because of the excellent facilities, beautiful scenery and so on of which we can boast, should set a headline for other European countries in regard to environmental legislation. I think the legislation we have before us will help us on the way to setting such an example.</P>
    <P>I want to express my appreciation of the manner in which this legislation has been received in the House.  The need for strengthening the control of pollution has been clearly accepted by every Deputy who spoke.  Many of the matters of principle were dealt with very fully and, I hope, very clearly in my opening speech.  The exercise of control of water pollution by local authorities is one of the main principles of the Bill, and I was pleased that this proposal was generally supported. I am convinced that local authorities are the proper bodies to <Col N="514" /> carry out this task, particularly having regard to their other functions in the field of water management, planning control and environmental protection. I want to put special emphasis on the responsibilities of the local authorities. It has always been the aim of the Minister for Local Government since he took office and&mdash;for the record&mdash;the aim of the Government to cherish the responsibilities vested in local authorities. The local authorities can truly be described as the immediate and local government where you have representatives elected by people in each electoral area whose main concern is generally to improve living standards, the quality of life and the environment in which they live.  That is the true and proper design of local government.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that members of local authorities have a great responsibility in local administration.  It has been the Minister's aim to vest them with responsibility and greater power and to encourage them to display keener and greater interest in bringing about greater involvement with the community and giving them that authority which only elected local councillors are capable of effectively and fully discharging.</P>
    <P>The proposal that local authorities should exercise control over discharges by means of a licensing system is one of the fundamental provisions of this Bill.  Local authorities are suitable bodies to exercise such control as they already have other water management functions&mdash;provision of water supplies, and sewage schemes and the extensions to these schemes which they can undertake locally.  The local councillor has a clear and intimate knowledge of the requirements of his area in this regard. They exercise planning control over most forms of development of which water pollution is a side effect.  They already have responsibility for a wide range of environmental functions such as control of air pollution, waste disposal, provision of area dumps and collection and disposal of litter.  Apart from this, they have suitable skills and expertise.  Every local authority has its own county engineer's department subdivided into area engineer's localities. They are in close touch with the needs <Col N="515" /> of the area.  There is this measure of close co-operation between the elected councillor who attends monthly council meetings and attends sub-committee meetings practically weekly and this brings him into very close and frequent liaison with the engineering staff of his council.  Councillors are in a good position to take a balanced view of the conflicting demands of various water users. This proposal is in keeping with the aim of devolving power to local authorities.</P>
    <P>Here I repeat what the Minister for Local Government has said on many occasions and which I think every member of the House must wholeheartedly endorse, that if you are to get greater support from and involvement by the local councillor you must give him functions and responsibilities. For that reason I think this Bill will mean a complete rejuvenation of responsibility in local councillors, engineering staffs and technical officers who have the necessary skills to advise and assist in the implementation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>There has been reference in the debate to the question of river boards. Setting up new organisations such as river boards or regional water authorities would not be justified at this stage, in my opinion.  The Bill provides for co-ordination and consultation between local authorities and other interests on a catchment basis.  Rural Deputies clearly realise that county boundaries exist and that you may have stretches of rivers which will be the responsibility of perhaps one, two or three county councils.  But the Bill provides for consultation between local authorities and all other interests in addition to the local authorities concerned. The setting up of river boards as suggested could possibly involve the transfer from local authorities of other water management functions such as provision of water and sewerage services.  This would not be acceptable: it would not be common sense or practical.  Any advantage such boards might have would be outweighed by the costs involved and the conflicts that would arise from lack of co-ordination with the planning process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> The Bill includes power to enable the Minister to set up special water pollution control authorities in the future if the need arises.  The Minister will always be prepared to receive recommendations, advice and expert opinion from local authorities on this matter.  The section permitting the Minister to establish these water quality control authorities is most desirable and it is one that could be used in the future by the Minister. This matter will be regularly reviewed.</P>
    <P>The need for co-ordination and consultation within river catchments was raised by a number of Deputies. I agree that arrangements for co-ordination and consultation will be necessary for the effective control of local authorities.  The Bill will enable this to be done.  Section 24 empowers the Minister, following consultation with interested Ministers, to make regulations requiring local authorities, sanitary authorities and boards of conservators to consult one another and other interested parties in relation to the functions under this Bill.  This is necessary and desirable.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the co-ordination of plans and the preparation of joint plans.  Another important issue is the question of action to ensure that discharges from local authority sewage schemes do not give rise to pollution.  In recent years local authorities have made significant improvements in the disposal of sewage at many locations.  Many schemes designed to eliminate pollution are in progress.  It is clear that local authorities are willing and anxious to put their own houses in order.  Many Deputies have remarked that local authorities are the worst polluters.  That is not a fair comment because it is clear that all local authorities have shown concern in regard to pollution.  The existence of unsatisfactory sewage disposal systems in some areas is due to the fact that over the years finance was not made available to local authorities to do this work.  I must put special emphasis on the words &ldquo;over the years&rdquo;. One would imagine that this problem had been spotlighted only in recent years.  Many Deputies referred to sewage disposal schemes in their <Col N="517" /> areas and said they could have been improved had finance been made available in the past.  I desire to place on record, knowing that it is reinforced by fact, that the Minister has made substantial capital funds available to local authorities for their sanitary services works.</P>
    <P>I want to place on record some statistics in relation to this matter. Some Opposition Deputies, without a blush, made reference to local authorities being willing to put their sewerage schemes and disposal units in order if funds were available. The pace of water and sewerage programmes was stepped up by increases in the capital provision in the last few years, particularly under the present Government.  The amount of capital allocated for the sanitary services programme in recent years is as follows: 1972-73, £8.23 million; 1973-74, £12.95 million; 1974, a 9-month period, £11.45 million; 1975, £17.75 million; 1976, £25 million.</P>
    <P>Never in the history of this country has there been such an outstanding contribution to local authorities in relation to sewerage systems.  From £8 million in 1972-73 the contribution has been increased to £25 million in 1976.  That capital allocation for work and sanitary services speaks for itself.  The Government have allocated sums in excess of previous provisions.  As a result of the increase from £8 million to £25 million many of the old schemes have been improved. In areas where there are enthusiastic and concerned local authorities there is clear evidence of improvements to old schemes.  All new development schemes are equipped with suitable treatment works to eliminate pollution. The great pity is that a greater effort was not made in 1972-73 and in previous years to provide local authorities with sufficient capital for sanitary services and works.  If local authorities had been given sufficient capital in the past we would not be faced with this problem today.</P>
    <P>The Government are meeting the <Col N="518" /> problem by increasing the allocation to help local authorities put their own house in order.  This will continue. I should like to express my appreciation to the county councils who submitted proposals to the Department. There is no comparison with the number of proposals submitted in 1972-73 when only £8 million was provided. This year there is a capital allocation of £25 million.  Local authorities have submitted proposals far in excess of the amount of capital provided.  These will be examined in the light of the current financial atmosphere.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks I explained that new sewerage schemes are designed to avoid the possibility of any pollution in the receiving waters. Remedial works have been carried out to many of the older schemes which were causing pollution and further works are in progress or at planning stage.  While I do not propose to go into detail about the particular schemes or the position of individual locations the fact is that the ongoing sanitary service programme includes a significant number of schemes involving remedial works to abate pollution. This policy will continue until all locations at which serious pollution problems are occurring or may occur are dealt with.</P>
    <P>I should like to state that an independent survey of pollution in Ireland was carried out by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and a report was published in April, 1976.  This report was to the effect that the local authority sewerage schemes were not as bad as some make them out to be.  That is encouraging news.  It does not take from the fact that a tremendous amount of work remains to be done.  The position will improve substantially when work on all the schemes under consideration is completed.  The report indicates that more than 88 per cent of the country's domestic sewage will then be disposed of without any threat to our natural water resources.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by some Members that the Bill does not include any provision for control over discharges from local authority sewers.  This is not the case.  While discharges from <Col N="519" /> local authority sewers will be exempt from the licensing provisions there is a provision in section 26 enabling the Minister to make regulations prescribing quality standards of effluents from local authority sewers and waters into which such effluents discharge.  The effect of any regulations made in respect of effluents from local authority sewers or waters into which such effluent discharges will be to place a statutory duty on the sanitary authority concerned to take steps to ensure that the effluent does not contravene the regulations.  I regard this provision as preferable to a system whereby local authorities would be required to obtain licences for their discharges from the Minister.  I am sure Members will agree that this is a better way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to deal with all the points raised.  There will be an opportunity to discuss them on Committee Stage.  I would, however, like to comment on the following points. Reference was made to the quality of bathing waters and arrangements for monitoring.  The Bill provides for the setting of standards for all waters and the monitoring of waters, including waters used for bathing.  Deputies are aware that a directive was issued by the EEC recently on bathing water quality and I can assure the House that the quality limits set out in the directive present little or no problem to us.  While only limited sampling of the type provided for in the directive has yet been carried out the general position is that bathing waters in Ireland are of a higher quality than that proposed in the directive.  We are in a more favourable position in this respect than most other member states. Local authorities were requested in July, 1976, to identify the bathing areas to which the directive might apply, to indicate how the water quality in these areas compares with the quality limits in the directive and to review their sampling arrangements in the light of the requirements of the directive.  I do not know if all local authorities have complied fully with this request but if they have not we will again direct their attention to <Col N="520" /> the importance of this matter.  It is well for those who engage in bathing to know that our bathing waters are of a more satisfactory quality than the bathing waters in many other member states.  That is encouraging. The implementation of this Bill will ensure that our bathing waters will be of the highest standard.</P>
    <P>Deputy John O'Leary asked for information on the EEC directive dealing with waste oils.  In this connection I should like to inform the House that my Department have written to all local authorities concerning the implementation of this directive.  They were asked to consider the most suitable ways to give effect to this directive and suggestions were made to assist them.  I am sure the local authorities have noted seriously the suggestions offered.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Kitt referred to various other environmental problems related to waste disposal, litter and so on.  I was present when a plaque was awarded at the Tidy Towns competition.  One of the speakers referred to the cost involved in preparing an area to compete in that competition.  I told the committee that it cost nothing to stoop, pick up litter and deposit it in refuse containers. We must convince the general public, young and old, that they have a civic responsibility to keep our streets, roads, avenues and paths free from litter.  If the local authorities provide dust bins and litter containers, it is no financial burden on the citizens to co-operate by putting the litter into the dust bins or litter containers which are available in most streets in our towns and villages.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to appeal to the Press, to schools, institutions and everybody in the country, and to stress the importance of picking up litter, putting it in containers and encouraging others to do the same.  We are all inclined to think that that is not our business, that it is the business of the local authorities, the street cleaners, county council staffs and so on.  We all have a duty to keep our streets, roads and avenues clean. I hope all local authorities will make a special effort to have meetings in every area, sponsored by the county <Col N="521" /> manager or the chairman of the local authority, to solicit the co-operation of the clergy of all denominations to bring home to our citizens that it is their duty to co-operate in keeping Ireland free from litter.</P>
    <P>While these matters are outside the scope of the Bill various measures are being taken to deal with them.  A detailed review of arrangements for waste collection and disposal has been undertaken and is receiving urgent consideration by my Department at the moment.  Of course, any water pollution arising from such activities would be subject to the controls of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner raised the question of financial assistance to deal with effluent.  There are already generous schemes of financial assistance available for pollution control, including subsidies paid by my Department to local authorities, grants by the IDA for treatment works for industrial effluents and various forms of assistance for farmers.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the need for involvement of industrial interests.  I agree with him and share his concern that it is highly desirable that such co-operation should exist. The Confederation of Irish Industries and the representative body for chemical industries are represented on the water pollution advisory council. The technical expert committee set up earlier this year to advise the Minister on water supply and effluent standards also includes representation of the industrial viewpoint.</P>
    <P>I want to express my appreciation of the manner in which the members of the water pollution advisory council have approached this legislation. I thank them for their advice and their views, which I consider are worthy of serious note, not only now but in the future, because of the wide range of interests they represent.  People from every walk of life&mdash;commercial, industrial, farming and scientific&mdash;are represented on that council.  I value the expressed views of these people and will take serious note of any recommendations they make.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the <Col N="522" /> technical expert committee.  Some of the people on this committee are the most highly-qualified in the country. They approach their job with thoroughness and sincerity and give the committee the full value of their technical skills.  The Minister and I are grateful to them for all they are doing for this committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Daly asked about the representation of the fishery interests on the water pollution advisory council.  When I met that council I expressed my personal interest in the fishery aspect because I was closely associated with fisheries some years ago.  The present informal council is composed of a wide spectrum of water pollution interests, which includes industrial, commercial, agricultural, fishery, professional, scientific, conservation and local authority interests, in addition to Government Departments and semi-State bodies.  On the fishery side alone it includes representatives of sea fisheries and inland anglers as well as the Inland Fisheries Trust and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The views expressed will be fully considered when the council is set up following the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Daly referred to the absence of a specific provision in regard to the recovery of damages. The Bill makes provision for a court order directing that the effects of certain contraventions are mitigated or remedied.  It also provides for the recovery of costs incurred by a local authority which takes steps to mitigate or remedy the effects of contraventions in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the number of State Departments and other bodies concerned with environmental matters.  Some time ago the Government set up an interdepartmental environment committee whose functions include the co-ordination of the various Departments and bodies concerned.  In so far as water pollution is concerned, the machinery is already available to secure the necessary co-ordination at national level.  This <Col N="523" /> is the best and most satisfactory way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the need to keep abreast of environmental studies and research in other countries. My Department keep abreast of international developments in water pollution control.  We also have the benefit of participation in the EEC programme on the environment and Members can rest assured that what is going on abroad is not going unnoticed or unheeded by my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan asked me to comment on the efficiency of sewerage treatment works in low flow conditions. I understand all modern treatment plants are so designed that they will function effectively during periods of low flow.  If Deputy Callanan requires any further information I shall be happy to meet him and discuss whatever the matter is with him.</P>
    <P>Most Members referred to the need for an educational programme directed at the protection of the environment. I agree wholeheartedly with the views expressed.  This was referred to specifically by the Minister when meeting the water pollution advisory council and, at the request of the Minister, they are developing proposals aimed at creating a greater public awareness of water pollution problems.  Here again Members can be of immense service. When I am speaking to students in the vocational schools in my constituency I make special reference to the problem of water pollution.  Wherever the public congregate in large numbers it should be possible to bring home the message.</P>
    <P>The water pollution advisory council have organised stands at both the Spring Show and the Horse Show where they illustrate the use and the abuse of water.  Those who have seen these stands have been impressed by the concern displayed and the volume of interest aroused in the general public. I compliment the council on the work they have done and are doing.  They recently promoted a highly successful anti-pollution poster competition for school children.  I understand they are currently investigating the possibilities in regard to anti-pollution films for <Col N="524" /> television.  Educational measures and publicity will, I believe, result in a greater understanding of the problem by the general public and will play an important part in combating water pollution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore raised the question of standards.  The Minister has set up a technical committee to advise him on water quality and effluent standards. Drinking water for human consumption should be of the highest possible standard. We cannot afford to take risks. One of the great blessings we enjoy is the number of outstanding water sources available to us.  Wells and springs supply clear, clean and pure water.  It is our task to keep that position and that is the purpose of this Bill and we all have a duty to co-operate in ensuring this desirable evolution.</P>
    <P>I have often regretted the disappearance of the village well and pump.  Where medical officers and local authorities are satisfied as to the quality of the water I believe these wells and pumps should be preserved as part of our heritage.  These played a very important part in bygone days and they should be preserved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Calleary referred to the need for standards.  Definition of standards is a very complex matter and here the Minister and I will be depending on the advice and recommendations of the experts on the advisory committee.</P>
    <P>I thank all Deputies who spoke for their commonsense approach to this matter.  I recommend the Bill to the House.  If there are any points of a technical nature made by Deputies which I have not answered I shall be only too glad to meet them personally and if there are still any points which I cannot explain I shall gladly ask the officials of my Department to elucidate them for the benefit of Deputies.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary listened patiently to the debate without interruption.  I should not like my silence to be interpreted as agreement with the Parliamentary Secretary that the Government have reason to be satisfied with their record in regard to the provision of sanitary services.  Perhaps we can deal with that at a more suitable time, but on this <Col N="525" /> occasion I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to rethink the problems in regard to the financing of the administration of this Bill.  It is evident that only the same amount of money will be made available for the extra work to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The activities of friendly societies are governed by the Friendly Societies Acts, 1896 to 1953.  The Registry of Friendly Societies Act, 1936, vests in the Minister among other matters power to appoint the registrar of friendly societies.  This Act also lays down the qualification necessary for the position of Registrar which is that he must be a barrister of not less than ten years' standing.</P>
      <P>The purposes of the Bill now before the House are first, having regard to the change in the value of money, to up-date the financial limitations imposed by the Acts; secondly, to improve the controls on the operation of societies; and thirdly, to replace the existing requirement that the registrar should be a barrister with a provision enabling the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prescribe the qualifications required for the appointment. I propose to deal with these matters separately, starting with the measures affecting the activities and responsibilities of friendly societies, and their branches.</P>
      <P>Societies registered under the Friendly Societies Acts may be divided into three main groups, which are one, friendly societies and branches, two, benevolent societies and three, specially authorised societies.</P>
      <P>The kind of activities carried out by these societies is not often understood, or indeed appreciated, in terms of their social overtones.  I will, therefore, provide a very brief outline of their functions.</P>

      <Col N="526" /> Before doing so, however, I should like to draw a clear distinction as between these societies and societies which are known as industrial and provident societies.  The latter are generally, though not always, co-operative enterprises formed under the industrial and provident societies code.  Agricultural co-operatives, for example, and indeed credit unions, are industrial and provident societies. These bodies have legal personality unlike societies registered under the Friendly Societies Acts.  Though, historically, co-operatives were rooted in legal provisions enacted for what were called friendly societies, a distinct division in law has evolved as between co-operatives and friendly societies, despite the fact that friendly societies often embody the social motivation that generally characterises co-operatives.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the three main groups of societies which are registered under the friendly societies legislation.  Friendly societies themselves are generally for the relief of members in sickness or in old age and for payment of sums to meet the funeral expenses of members and their wives and children.  Benevolent societies, too, provide benefits but they do so in respect of persons other than members.  Specially authorised societies are a different kind of operation but they, too, have a pronounced social awareness in their objects.  The biggest grouping within this class is that known as the specially authorised loan societies which were formed for the purpose of creating funds by monthly or other subscription to be lent out to or invested for the members or for their benefit. Examples of other kinds of specially authorised societies are those which have been registered for the promotion of literature, science and the fine art, and for the promotion of education.</P>
    <P>Although there is not what one would call a national awareness of the existence of these societies, the following details in relation to their operations may be informative.  As at 31st December, 1974, which is the last year for which completed annual returns are available, there <Col N="527" /> was a total of 177 of these societies on the register maintained by the Registrar of Friendly Societies. Total membership for the same period exceeded 150,000 persons and the total benefits paid out in respect of the year 1974, whether as sickness, mortality of other benefits, came to more than £600,000.  These figures will, I hope, act as indicators of the scale and usefulness of the societies we are dealing with under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The measures proposed in the Bill deal with two aspects of their operations for most societies and imposes a new obligation, under section 4 of the Bill, on the conduct of their business by specially authorised loan societies.  I will now proceed to enunciate the principles behind each section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>All of these societies and their branches are permitted, under section 46 of the Principal Act of 1896, to accept deposits from, and to make loans to, members, subject to certain restrictions.  Section 2 of the Bill now before the House is intended to allow the Minister to alter these restrictions, by regulation.</P>
    <P>The restrictions on the operation of a loan fund by a registered society are very limited.  Some of them take the form of financial limits, while others are more of a procedural nature.  All of them, however, were fixed on the making of the Principal Act in 1896, and they have not been changed since, mainly because until recently there was no evidence that changes were necessary.</P>
    <P>In recent times, however, it has been represented to the Minister that those restrictions which consist of financial limits, represent an unrealistic constraint on the operations of certain societies.  The money limits concerned are a maximum investment of £200 which a member may hold in a loan fund of a society, while, as regards its lending operations, a society may not make any loan which together with any money owing by a member to the society exceeds £50. Having regard to the decline in money values since 1896, when these limits <Col N="528" /> were fixed, they now bear no relationship to their original value and there is a justifiable case for their revision upwards.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, therefore, to increase the limits to more realistic levels and section 2 of the Bill now before the House will enable this to be done by regulation.  Rather than prescribe any specific new limits in the Bill, the value of which could again be undermined long before another legislative change is effected, the medium of regulation has been chosen to achieve this end, with a view to ensuring that any new limits now fixed can be reviewed at more regular intervals, and if appropriate, adjusted more frequently, in the future.</P>
    <P>There are two other restrictions which apply to the operation of a loan fund by societies.  These are, first, that a loan shall not at any time be made out of money contributed for any other purpose of the society and, second, that a society shall not hold at any one time on deposit from its members any money beyond the amount fixed by the rules and the amounts so fixed shall not exceed two-thirds of the total sums owing to the society by the members who have borrowed from the loan fund.</P>
    <P>When it is borne in mind that the loan funds operated by societies are constituted, in part, by the deposits of members, I think the House will agree that these restrictions alone, even when taken with the financial limits I have already mentioned, are very limited.  They may well have reflected the standard safeguards for depositors of their day but they fall far short of providing the kind of protection which depositors have come to expect of their investments.  It is proposed, therefore, to rectify this situation and to take this opportunity to tighten up the restrictions which operate in favour of depositors in societies registered under the friendly societies legislation. Section 2 of the Bill will also empower the Minister to act in this sphere.</P>
    <P>I might add that initially, the intention is to introduce regulations under section 2 of the Bill in respect of specially authorised loan societies only, because unlike other classes of friendly <Col N="529" /> societies which operate a loan fund as a secondary activity only, specially authorised loan societies are established expressly for the purpose of creating funds by monthly or other subscriptions to be lent to or invested for the members.  In other words, their sole business is borrowing and lending money.</P>
    <P>Only 15 of these societies now exist. This is because, by virtue of the special authority dated 15th August, 1917, the only specially authorised loan societies which may now be registered are societies formed to grant loans for the purpose of agriculture, horticulture or arboriculture.  Notwithstanding their small number, however, the fact that the business of these specially authorised loan societies is distinguished from the business of other friendly societies, by their exclusive concentration on a loan fund activity, emphasises the desirability that their operations should be regulated.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention here, of course, that the measures before the House have not been motivated by any suggestion of abuse or mismanagement by societies operating a loan fund.  On the contrary, I should like the House to be aware that I regard societies such as specially authorised loan societies as performing a useful social function in the credit field.  Very often, they fill that lacuna that sometimes exists for certain members of our community as regards credit availability.</P>
    <P>There will always be those members of the community who, for one reason or another, will not seek credit from, say, the conventional banking sector and this is where bodies such as specially authorised loan societies play their role.  I think that their growth in scale over the years since 1917, when authority for any new registrations was abolished, can reasonably be taken as a pointer to the continued use of, and need for, this kind of society.  This is particularly true in the Dublin area where the majority of specially authorised loan societies are concentrated.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill embodies a new control in relation to the activities of friendly societies and their branches.  It relates specifically to the maintaining and auditing of <Col N="530" /> accounts by these societies and their branches.  As the law stands at present, accounts of friendly societies can be audited by any two persons appointed by the societies, who need have no accountancy qualifications or background.  In addition, existing legal requirements are silent on the form of accounts for friendly societies and their branches and it is very desirable that these accounts should conform to recognised standards.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 of the Bill, therefore, it is proposed to take power to provide by regulation for the form of accounts and records to be kept by friendly societies and their branches, for matters relating to the audit of their accounts including the qualifications necessary for persons carrying out such auditing, and for the laying of accounts before the annual general meetings of societies by their committees of management.</P>
    <P>I should at this point look forward to section 8 of the Bill.  Sections 2 and 3 about which I have been speaking would give the Minister power to alter certain very important requirements by regulations, but the principle of Oireachtas control is fully preserved by providing, in section 8, that no regulation shall be made until a resolution approving of it shall have been passed by each House.  I think these arrangements avoid on the one hand the excessive rigidity which would result from embodying provisions in legislation, and on the other hand the danger that they might be given the force of law without full and democratic examination and debate.  Indeed I regard the bringing of such regulatory powers for approval before the House as of considerable importance.</P>
    <P>I feel that it is only right that members of a specially authorised loan society should have a positive say in the running of the society and section 4 of the Bill has been drafted to meet this objective.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with section 5 of the Bill which concerns the separate matter of the appointment of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, I should like to refer briefly to sections 6 and 7.  Under section 77 of the Principal <Col N="531" /> Act, the circumstances in which the Registrar of Friendly Societies may cancel the registration of a society and its branches are stipulated, while section 84 of the same Act relates to offences under the Act. It would be anomalous if, firstly, the circumstances under which the registrar may cancel the registration of a society and its branches and secondly the committing of an offence by a society or branch or an officer or member thereof did not include non-compliance with any regulations made under this Bill.  Accordingly, sections 6 and 7 of the Bill will remove the danger of such anomalies by making the necessary adjustments to sections 77 and 84 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill deals with the appointment of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  This section is relevant not just to friendly societies but to all other forms of societies, for example, industrial and provident societies and building societies that the registrar deals with.  At present, the power to appoint the Registrar of Friendly Societies is vested in the Minister by section 1 (3) of the 1896 Act as amended by section 2 (2) (b) of the 1936 Act, while section 4 (2) of the 1936 Act contains the present stipulation that the registrar must be a barrister of not less than ten years' standing.  I should emphasise, of course, that notwithstanding the Minister's power to appoint the registrar, the powers and functions of the registrar himself are statutorily conferred on him and are not at all subject to the Minister's influence.  Generally, however, these powers and functions are largely of a mechanical and recording nature.</P>
    <P>For example, the responsibilities of the registrar have mainly consisted of matters such as registration of rules, amendments to rules, resolutions for amalgamations and transfers of engagements, resolutions for conversion of societies into companies and <i>vice versa</i> and the acceptance of annual returns and other documents that must be filled.  The registrar has also been involved in the settlement of a limited category of disputes involving societies and members and has <Col N="532" /> in certain restricted circumstances, power to call special meetings of societies or to appoint inspectors to investigate their affairs.</P>
    <P>The registrar is responsible for ensuring that annual returns of socities are made and are available to the public who may wish to inspect them.  It has been found adequate, in the past, to fill this position on a part-time basis only.</P>
    <P>Recent developments, however, which are altering the fundamental nature of the registrar's role, will considerably strain the continuation of this working arrangement, if not, indeed, make it impossible to operate in the future.  The best example I can give of the changing nature of the registrar's role and his increased responsibilities, is the Building Societies Bill which is now before the House.  Members will be aware that this Bill will endow the registrar with extensive powers to supervise the building society sector. Indeed, in keeping with the general drift towards arming the registrar with active supervisory and investigatory muscle to ensure that both the rights of members and the public interest are continuously respected by various societies, the Department are considering the introduction of measures to empower the registrar to supervise actively, as well, the affairs of societies other than build ing societies.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt but that the registrar should be so equipped in modern times.  Societies in many areas have outgrown the limited dimensions that characterised them in the past.  For example, some industrial and provident societies, or co-operative societies as we know them best, would compare very favourably, in terms of, say, turnover with some of our largest companies.  Credit unions, too, are growing fast, in terms of the shareholdings and deposits of members. There is, therefore, an indisputable need for an active but independent office of registrar, firstly, to ensure that all societies conduct their business in a proper fashion, secondly, to better protect the rights of members who may well be interested <Col N="533" /> in the affairs of their society but who find their interest frustrated, and thirdly, to exercise greatly strengthened powers, with improved rights to oversee the affairs of societies.</P>
    <P>The changing nature of the registrar's work, as manifested at present in the Building Societies Bill, may well lead to the need for qualifications other than legal expertise for the post.  For example, the supervisory function envisaged for the registrar under the Building Societies Bill could conceivably call for a knowledge of accountancy and financial matters which could not normally be expected of a barrister. In other words, flexibility as regards the qualifications of the registrar is imperative in circumstances where the nature and demands of the position are undergoing substantial change.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill is, therefore, drafted with a view to providing the Minister with the desired flexibility in determining the qualifications for the position of registrar to meet the evolving responsibilities of the position. It will also enable him, with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, to pitch the remuneration for the position at a level which, if a full time official is eventually required, would attract a person of the requisite standing and experience.</P>
    <P>In summary, the purposes of the Bill are, firstly, having regard to the change in the value of money, to update the financial limitations imposed by the friendly societies Acts on the operation of a loan fund by societies, secondly, to improve the controls on the operation of societies, and, thirdly, to enable the Minister to determine the qualifications necessary for the position of Registrar of Friendly Societies so that, having regard to the evolving nature of the position, he will have the desired flexibility to appoint a person with the kind of qualifications that events will show are most suited to the position.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They are very fortunate societies that they are able to obtain a Bill here to improve the regulation of the societies when there are only 177 of them.  They are very small operations by anybody's standards and many people would, perhaps, be out of sympathy at the moment with modern thinking.  It puts them in perspective when you remember that there are over 50,000 companies registered in this country and there has not been an amendment of the Companies Act since the Consolidating Act was passed in 1963, although it is arguable that the need for an amendment to the Companies Act, 1963 is immeasurably greater than the admitted need for the alterations that are being proposed in the Friendly Societies Act of 1896.  One of the difficulties in talking about friendly societies is that they tend in the public mind and, indeed, in my mind to overlap with industrial and provident societies, and it is sometimes difficult to know which is which in some cases particularly as the same registrar deals with them and with friendly societies, building societies and trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a point in relation to the numbers of what are described here as specially authorised loan societies whose activities under section 46 of the 1896 Act will be changed by regulations which the Minister will be empowered to make under section 2 of this measure.  It is amazing that there are only 15 of them and since 1917 the only new societies which can be formed are those which would grant loans for the purpose of agriculture, horticulture or arboriculture.  There is no fear that anybody could try to start a specially authorised loan society for the purposes of agriculture, horticulture or arboriculture because the whole principle and system of people helping one another in respect of their endeavours in these fields is completely out of date now.  Everybody looks to the State for help and the ACC provides <Col N="535" /> the help now by way of loans for agriculture and so on which the 1896 Parliament of the time envisaged should be provided by the mutual assistance of people engaged in agriculture and other activities for one another.  While it is very commendable that people should be encouraged to exercise thrift, self-reliance, mutual co-operation and assistance, the very principle of that seems in practice to have gone completely and it is to the State and semi-State bodies that people now look for that assistance.</P>
    <P>While this Bill may be of some value to a very small number of groups of people it is not of great significance from a national point of view and while it improves the existing situation, the numbers who are affected by it are so minute that it is not of any great importance. Because it is not of any great importance, I do not propose to delay the House in relation to it except to say that I have no objection to the alteration that is proposed in respect of restrictions on those 15 specially authorised loan societies by section 46 of the 1896 Act.  I have no objection to proper accountants being appointed to audit societies' accounts since it is obviously necessary that they should be properly qualified accountants.  I have no objection to these supervisory committees for specially authorised loan societies on the lines of what was set up in the Credit Union Act of 1966.  I have no objection to the minor consequential amendments of sections 78 and 84 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>The only point on which I have any question is the proposal to change the law in relation to the Registrar of Friendly Societies, his qualifications and his appointment.  Subsection (2) of section 5 states that the registrar may be removed from office by the Minister with the reasons for removal being conveyed to the registrar.  In his speech the Parliamentary Secretary said that there is therefore an indisputable need for an active but an independent office of registrar.  I agree fully, but how can the Parliamentary <Col N="536" /> Secretary say that in introducing the Bill while at the same time saying that the registrar may be removed from office by the Minister?  While that provision is there, the registrar is not independent.  He may not be interfered with by the Minister in his day-to-day work; but if somebody, regardless of what position he holds, can be fired at will by a Minister or by anybody else, he cannot be said to be independent.  He may endeavour to act independently in the discharge of his duties but he cannot be seen by the public to be so acting if he is subject to dismissal at will, if he has not security of tenure in the office he holds.  The position of Registrar of Friendly Societies is important, not because of his being Registrar of Friendly Societies as such, of which there are about 100 or so; but, by virtue of the fact of his holding this office, he is registrar also of building societies, of industrial provident societies and, for certain purposes, registrar under the Trade Union Acts.</P>
    <P>All these considerations are very important.  During the debate in the Seanad on the Building Societies Bill the Fianna Fáil spokesman proposed that the registrar who would look after building societies and who is in fact the Registrar of Friendly Societies should be appointed by the Government and not removed from office other than on foot of a motion passed by a two-thirds majority of each House of the Oireachtas.  The purpose of that amendment was to ensure that the registrar maintained his independence in view of the politically sensitive nature of his work, particularly in relation to building societies.</P>
    <P>Consequently it is disappointing to note that in this Bill, which deals with the registrar's qualifications and appointment, there is provision for his removal at will.  In accordance with the 1886 Act the registrar held office during the pleasure of the Treasury. That wording was amended in the 1936 Act so as to substitute the Minister for Industry and Commerce for &ldquo;The Treasury&rdquo;.  However, the registrar's functions then were not important. As the Parliamentary Secretary has said, they were mainly of a mechanical nature and were so unimportant <Col N="537" /> as to have been capable of fulfilment by a part-time official.  The Parliamentary Secretary speaks here of the registrar playing a much more active and positive role in relation to the various societies under his control and of his having an investigatory function.  I am very much in support of all this.  Certainly, the registrar will have very important functions in relation to the building societies which, unlike the friendly societies that have been on the decline for years, are becoming an increasingly important facet of modern life.  They play a significant role in our financial and commercial affairs.  It is envisaged, and rightly so, in the Building Societies Bill that the registrar, whose office is the one we are talking of here, will have very much more extensive powers than was the case up to now, that he will have very important powers and powers which potentially are politically sensitive.  Therefore, he should be independent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>We believe that, if this officer is to carry out his work efficiently and is to adopt a more positive role than was the case in the past, he will need professional staff including accountants and possibly some lawyers.  In the past, apart from the registrar, the office has been staffed by career civil servants, many of whom were transferred on promotion from that area as soon as they had achieved a certain level of confidence and seniority.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case for setting up a separate office within which promotion could be achieved, an office which could be an executive branch of government similar to that envisaged in the Devlin Report on civil service reorganisation.</P>
    <P>For Committee Stage I intend tabling an amendment, similar to that proposed by our spokesman in the Seanad, to the Building Societies Bill and for the same reason, that is, the importance that will attach to this office in the future in the context of building societies and industrial provident societies.</P>
    <P>It is worth remembering that, while friendly societies are very minor institutions which in the 1896 Act were described as benevolent societies, <Col N="538" /> cattle insurance societies, workingmen's clubs, old people's homes societies and so on, the industrial and provident societies into which category most of the co-operatives fall are very important when one realises that the bigger co-operatives such as Golden Vale, Mitchelstown and others have turnovers in excess of £50 million per year.  The supervision of such vast societies will have to be carried out by the Registrar of Friendly Societies and that supervision should be undertaken by a man who is independent and who is seen to be independent, a man who does not hold office at the pleasure of the Minister but who is appointed for a specific period and can be removed from office only by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas in which there is a two-thirds majority.</P>
    <P>No mention has been made of the fact&mdash;I suppose this is understandable &mdash;that there was what can be referred to as an outbreak of the formation of friendly societies for the purpose of evading taxation, but those purposes have been set aside by successive Finance Acts.  However, the closing of such loopholes accounts perhaps for the now extraordinary low number of friendly societies.  The friendly society idea, as conceived and developed in the nineteenth century, was possibly very good from the point of view of thrift and of mutual help. It is an idea that could well be recommended to our people today but unfortunately there is less attraction to that idea now and people rely on the State to a much greater extent than that to which they rely on the concept of mutual help.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of the Bill which gives rise to some concern. This is the proposal that the amendment of sections 46 and 26 of the Principal Act should be effected by way of regulation rather than by way of legislation.  The Parliamentary Secretary makes the point that if he changes the existing figures to some higher figure we may be faced in a couple of years with the problem of having to increase them again.  I accept that is certainly a difficulty.</P>

      <P>Section 2, which is section 46 of the Principal Act, which limits the amount of the loans and the amount of the deposits that can be made by or taken by a specially authorised society.  As a matter of principle I would prefer not to see these powers given away to be made by regulation, but I suppose it is one of the less tragic by-products of inflation that money is depreciating so quickly that we would flood this House with legislation if we had to keep updating figures of this kind by way of legislation.</P>
      <P>Subject to the reservation I have about the Registrar of Friendly Societies who is very important, not because of the handful of little friendly societies he deals with, but because he deals with the building societies and will now have, I am very happy to say, a positive supervisory function, an active function in relation to them &mdash;and because he has that also in relation to some huge industrial and provident societies and in relation to certain aspects of trade unions he is very important&mdash;and subject to the reservation that he should not now hold office simply at the will of the Minister but should have and be seen to have a genuine independence, I have no objection to this Bill.  I welcome it for what it is.  It is worth bearing in mind that it deals only with a very small number of societies which are very small in their commercial and other significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope now that the Parliamentary Secretary has interested himself in the updating of some of this legislation, the important updating which is needed in relation particularly to industrial and provident societies and, above all, to companies, which will be undertaken in the Department. I know the Bill which led to the Companies Act of 1963 was a very major Bill and entailed an enormous amount of work in the Department on the part of many officials who may perhaps feel that the companies might well be left alone now for a reasonable period. Nonetheless 13 years have elapsed and the pace of commercial practice has quickened so much, and the various commercial developments have <Col N="540" /> changed so much even in that comparatively short period, that there is a strong need for a look at various aspects of the Companies Act, 1963, for the purpose of endeavouring to bring it up to date and preventing fraudulent or improper practices which it might now be possible to carry out in certain respects and practices have arisen which could not have been foreseen in 1963 at the time of the passage of that Act.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Opposition for having expressed, through their spokesman, their broad support for this Bill.  I should like to deal with some of the points the Deputy raised.  He may be under a slight misapprehension as to the importance of the friendly societies. They are not quite as unimportant as he may think.  This can best be illustrated by the fact that the 177 societies to which he referred have 150,000 members.  That is not an insignificant number of people in a country of this size.  The total benefits paid out by them in 1974 amounted to £600,000.  One could expect that in 1976 the figure would have risen in line with the depreciation in the value of money.  They are significant societies and any Bill which improves their situation is significant.</P>
      <P>As regards the specially authorised loan societies, which the Deputy also seemed to feel were not of very great significance, while I agree they are small in number, they perform more or less the function of credit unions in the centre city area of Dublin.  They have traditional support as a form of making credit available to people in that area which is very valuable and which is likely to be maintained despite the development of credit unions in other parts of the country.  For that reason and for the purpose of the making available of credit in the centre city area, this legislation is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the need to update the Companies Act.  This is a matter which I have in hand.  We <Col N="541" /> are hoping to bring forward a Bill dealing with this matter at least in some respects&mdash;perhaps not dealing with all the matters which need to be dealt with but dealing with certain important matters&mdash;perhaps this session or maybe early next session.  I would point out, however, that in relation to companies legislation in general, a lot of development is taking place in the European Community. For instance, we have the development of the concept of the European company.  We have a programme of harmonisation of national law in relation to companies which is being undertaken independently by the Commission.  To a certain degree, movement by us in relation to company law must await clarification of the Community's position on these matters.  One cannot move as quickly as one would like in certain areas if one is to avoid finding that one's work has to be undone as a result of a contrary provision being adopted at Community level.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was concerned about the independence of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  In my introductory statement I made it quite clear that the registrar in the conduct of his duties would be entirely independent and so statutorily guaranteed in the exercise of his functions.  The Deputy's concern was about the power contained in the Bill whereby the registrar may be removed from office by the Minister and that the reasons for such removal should be conveyed to the registrar.  He felt more severe restrictions should be placed on the Minister's discretion in this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the case made by the Deputy.  There has to be some provision and, if the registrar is not performing his functions adequately, a very speedy provision for his removal from office.  In view of the fact that the amount of money being dealt with by the various societies is quite significant, as the Deputy very clearly pointed out, it is important that the registrar should be a man who is competent and who is performing his duties fully.  If for one reason or another the registrar were to cease, <Col N="542" /> as he could do quite quickly, to have this competence, there must be a speedy provision for making the necessary change.  The amendment proposed by the Deputy would not be speedy enough and could allow an expensive duration of time to elapse before action could be taken.</P>
    <P>In matters such as this, there is no reason for the fear which may lie behind some of the Deputy's remarks of a sinister exercise of power by the Minister.  It is quite clear that, in dealing with this area of legislation, successive Ministers have acted at all times in the public interest.  It is very important to point out that the Minister, unlike any other agency who might be given a power to remove the registrar, is answerable to this House for actions.  He is directly responsible, in a way no other person is, to the Government and to the public at large.  It is appropriate, therefore, that the provisions contained in the Bill should be as they are.  That said however, I again thank the House for the welcome they have given to this legislation and I look forward to its speedy passage into law.</P>

I think such societies do exist and I would presume that this legislation would apply to them as it does to other societies.  There is certainly no capital society which if it comes within the broad definition of the Bill is specifically excluded.  If the Deputy has a specific query in relation to these societies he might raise it at Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The RTE superannuation scheme is a perpetual fund registered under the Perpetual Funds (Registration) Act, 1933.  The Schedule to that Act sets out the requirements of the Act as to the rules regulating perpetual funds.  In particular, paragraph 6 of the Schedule specifies that when the trustees of the fund are authorised by the rules of the fund to invest capital moneys belonging to the fund by depositing such moneys with the employer or persons employed in the undertaking in connection with which the fund is established, such moneys shall not be deposited unless (a) the employer is a body corporate, (b) the undertaking has paid dividends of not less than 3 per cent on its ordinary stocks and shares in each of the past ten years and (c) the deposit is secured by a charge on the whole or part of the assets of the undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the RTE superannuation scheme the trustees may make loans to the RTE Authority provided the loans comply with paragraph 6 of the Schedule to the Perpetual Funds (Registration) Act, 1933, but in fact it is not possible for RTE to comply with paragraph 6.  They do not declare a dividend on stocks and shares and the securing of a loan on the assets of the Authority could also cause problems.  The proposed amendment would remove this legal difficulty but it would also remove <Col N="544" /> the element of protection of the interests of the RTE employees contained in these provisions of the Perpetual Funds (Registration) Act. However, I wish to assure the House by way of this public commitment, and I have given a parallel assurance in the other House, that any advance made at any time by the RTE superannuation fund to the RTE Authority will be secure both as to interest and repayment of capital so that the interests of RTE employees will continue to be fully protected.</P>
    <P>That is the public commitment entered into by me.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I can appreciate the significance of this section.  As regards the funds of RTE and how they can be invested, I can see the complication which has arisen where the old section is concerned.  I would like to know how the fund stands at the moment. I understand from what the Minister has stated that they are in a position to give loans to RTE.  How much has the fund given to the Authority?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I fully appreciate that money belonging to the fund should not be left dormant.  It is the RTE employees' pension fund for the future and it is vitally important that it be properly invested.  The Minister states that they are prohibited from giving any loan unless they are paid 3 per cent.  When this Bill goes to the House I wonder what type of dividend or interest will be paid to the fund by the RTE Authority. With inflation as it is today the protection of the fund for the employees is of vital importance and investment should be at a very high rate.  Any moneys lent from the fund should carry the rate of interest which would be applicable if the moneys <Col N="545" /> were invested in any other financial institution.  It may be wise for the Minister not to reveal the amount of any existing loan, but I would like an assurance that the proper interest rates and the proper return will be paid to the fund.  A lot of financial institutions today go into equity on interest rates in order to keep up a standard.  I would like to think that the Authority will make that provision when returning their proper interest charge on the fund.  I see nothing wrong with the idea of the Authority borrowing from the fund. I am sure the employees themselves would not hesitate to say, &ldquo;If we have money in our fund let the Authority have it, provided the guarantees are there that this fund is protected and that the proper return on the investment is accruing to the fund each year&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister could give any indication as to what has happened since the establishment of RTE?  I am sure that a proper audit has been carried out but what is the fund like at this time or have the employees in RTE any access to the information which I believe should be available from now on for this type of superannuation? At least some of the employees should have some access to this information, and I believe that is going to happen, not alone in RTE but in other State and civic bodies.  It is right and proper that this should be.  I know that one semi-State body recently was talking along the lines that the proper account would be given to at least some members of the staff. It is most important that they satisfy their minds that their money&mdash;and it is their money&mdash;is properly protected.</P>
      <P>I would like an assurance from the Minister that there will be a proper return on the capital from the RTE Authority every six months or every year so that the employees will be satisfied that their pension fund is properly protected and is appreciating sufficiently to keep pace with inflation. I am sure the Minister can see my point regarding the protection of the fund and giving some members the right to supervise the accounts in the fund from time to time.</P>

      <P>I note the Deputy's remarks and appreciate the concern that lies behind them.  I will see that they are brought to the attention of the RTE Authority.  At the same time, I should say that I do not think there are grounds for anxiety in this area.  The fund is credited annually and the auditor has never suggested that interest rates paid by RTE were not adequate.  The trustees of the fund would insist on getting proper rates of interest as a condition of granting RTE a loan.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also spoke of the interests of employees.  The employees are represented on the management body of the fund and, therefore, that aspect is taken care of.  The great bulk of moneys invested by the fund are in Government securities and I would be happy to give the Deputy any information he requires in this matter.  I am not quite sure how much I should give by way of public statement here on such a matter and I am sure the Deputy appreciates that. The amendment sought is a technical one necessitated by the actual legal situation.  This legislation gives us an opportunity of correcting an anomaly and I hope the House will agree to it.</P>

      <P>It strikes me as most desirable that the employees would recognise the importance of having representatives as trustees who understood how the moneys are being invested. I have heard of instances, fortunately not in this country, where employees' pensions were handed over to management firms and invested unwisely and in high risk undertakings. Bernie Cornfield was involved in this type of undertaking.  The employees concerned suffered quite severely and were lucky to get out with any of their pension fund.  I am always happy to hear that funds are invested in gilt edge; even if the interest is not as great as might be obtained elsewhere at least it will keep in line with the rate of inflation.  The whole future of employees when they retire depends on <Col N="547" /> how the money is invested.  Perhaps the Minister could tell the House how many employees are represented as trustees and who are the other trustees?</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I am glad to hear that employees of RTE are among the trustees.  This is important because I know of some pension funds where employees do not have representation and this is bound to create a certain doubt in their minds.  Once the money is invested in gilt edge that is the best that can be done.  However, if there is a large surplus of fund within RTE, will the Authority be in a position to apply to the trustees for a loan from the fund?  With the extension of RTE 2, is it envisaged that the capital might be found in this way, at the going rate?</P>

      <P>I am not sure that the scale of capital available in this way would be commensurate with what the Deputy has in mind.  The funds so far are not very extensive but I am sure the RTE Authority will have more possible sources of capital in mind.  I understand it is unlikely that a further loan would be made available at this stage from the fund. I should like to repeat that the amendment sought is simply to dispose of an anomaly in the existing law.  We are taking advantage of this legislation to introduce it.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Would the Minister give information about the meetings he had recently in Limerick and various other places: what is his intention, how soon he expects to have cable television available to people in Cork, Limerick and Waterford, and what the cost would be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In a nutshell, I informed those who are interested in the linkage of cable systems in relation to Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford&mdash;this is a matter of course which applies only to centres of relatively high population density&mdash;that, as I understand the situation, the cable companies which originally showed some interest in this proposition have not shown active interest for some time past.  The idea seemed to have gone about that they were deterred by my Department's alleged unwillingness to license such systems.  I explained to them that no such unwillingness existed, that if sufficient interest existed, that is to say, if people in the areas concerned were willing to pay the cost of such systems, including the provision of the necessary microwave connections, my Department would be prepared to co-operate with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding is now that, first of all, there will be a working party consisting of the technical advisers of the multi-channel groups in these areas meeting with technicians of my Department to explore the possibilities and also the costings.  I was with the officials of my Department.  I pointed out that this was likely to be a fairly costly enterprise and one which could <Col N="551" /> not be entered into unless there was widespread support for the idea in the areas concerned and that the people there were prepared to pay for it.  I stressed that there was no question of the State, in present circumstances, providing any kind of subsidy for such an undertaking, that those who desired multi-channel viewing in these areas would have to be prepared to pay the full cost of that.  I must say that their representatives appeared entirely to accept that point of view.  These studies are now going ahead.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other question which the Deputy raised about the time scale, I understand that the provision of the necessary microwave links to these centres would take two-and-a-half to three years from the date of order, and rental would be about £200,000 a year at early 1976 prices.  That is expensive, and I wish to underline this: I am not saying this is something we can simply take out of the air and do easily.  It will take time even assuming that the effective demand exists, and it will also take money.  If the other problems could be resolved, the copyright issue, the setting up of local cabling systems and the financing of these, it would therefore be two to three years before the systems would be operational.</P>
    <P>I have given a general explanation of my conversations there, but continuing exploration is going on, and after the meeting between officials and technicians, I would expect to have a further meeting with those interested to which representatives of the cable companies would also be invited, and we could then explore the possibilities of further progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on his elaboration of this topic, because it is of tremendous importance to many people in the country.  I am not as familiar with this matter as my colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick, but do I take it from what the Minister has been saying that those who are interested in receiving multi-channel programmes are pressing the Minister to allow private companies, if necessary, to set up cabling systems?  Is that <Col N="552" /> what the lobby would be?  That the Minister is saying: &ldquo;You may if you want to, but you will not get any subsidy from my Department&rdquo;, that the costs are in the region of £200,000 to set up one system.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, yes.  I should explain that the people concerned are viewers and representatives of viewers primarily in four centres, Limerick, Cork, Galway and Waterford.  In relation certainly to Limerick, Cork and Galway&mdash; Waterford is marginal&mdash;the possibilities of multi-channel viewing depend on linking these centres by microwave. That is an expensive enough proposition on the figures I have quoted.</P>
      <P>The question is whether there is enough interest in this in the areas concerned to make it financially viable and whether the demands, which they very eloquently expressed, are strong enough in actual financial terms to make this work.  If so, there are possibilities for the establishment of co-operatives in the different centres which would guarantee the cable companies or a cable company.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise again that there can be no question of a State subsidy for this purpose.  I think the people concerned understand this.  If they are prepared to pay for it, if they think it is worth it, then we are prepared to try to overcome such obstacles as there are.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I am aware of the concern in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford in this respect.  The cost figure the Minister gave, £200,000 per annum, was disputed by some of the multi-channel <Col N="553" /> people who thought the Minister's figures were excessive.  I take it that it would depend entirely on the number of applicants.  In Limerick, for instance, if the entire population took the service, how much would it mean per head?  I am sure it would be very big.  The Minister's references were to cities.  Has he considered the larger towns and has he got applications from them?  If the cities get this service, I have no doubt the Minister will have applications from towns.  Has he any idea of how he would handle such applications?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>On the costings, the Deputy is quite right that the representatives of the multi-channel people in these centres challenged the figure of £200,000 per annum.  They will have opportunities to discuss this with officers of my Department, when they will be shown the basis for the figure.  I wish to emphasise again that we will not subsidise this.  Neither do we intend to make a profit out of it. I think those people will find that the figure mentioned is realistically based. It is for all the four centres and this would work out at about £5 per head per annum if 90 per cent took the service. It would be £4.50 per head per annum if all took the service and it would be <i>pro rata</i> down from that.  I understand that 20 provincial towns in the multi-channel areas on the east coast and along the Border are serviced.</P>
      <P>In their 1974 report, at page 75, the Broadcasting Review Committee have some relevant comments to make in relation to the point the Deputy has raised.  They say that even with microwave transmission from the point of entry of the external cable to the point of distribution, which is what we are dealing with here, cable television as a means of providing access to BBC and ITV programmes is effectively limited by economic considerations to the larger centres of population.  The development of cable television on a commercial basis would still leave some 300,000 homes, or more than 1 million persons, dependent on the single station, RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That point has to be made here. Therefore, provision of transmission to <Col N="554" /> these centres is not a panacea and will leave the rural areas still single-channel, in effect.  That is in-built in the situation. It is one of the reasons why I considered the rebroadcasting, which I have not discussed now because we have deleted it.  I have tried to give the Deputies as much information as possible about a matter which is still being studied.  It may be found that in present circumstances there simply is not sufficient financial interest and willingness, and if so that is it.  If there is, my Department will be prepared to help those concerned to overcome the other difficulties and eventually to grant the necessary licences.  Even if all this works out, it will still be two-and-a-half to three years away and it is still at the range of cost of £5 per head per annum.</P>

      <P>If a private company decided to float a public issue to raise money to set up a cable television network to bring multi-channel television to some area, will there be objection from the Department and will the Minister give the licence?  They would have to then pay a fee to RTE for the programmes they would be getting from RTE.  Would that be correct?  If no subsidy is being considered, where does the figure of £200,000 come in?</P>

      <P>My Department would be looking after that.  My Department would insist on providing the wavelinks and charging a rental fee for them, the point being that the Department have responsibility to the State for seeing that these services would be provided in such a way as not to interfere with other services and they would also be provided on an acceptable standard which requires a high cost of maintenance.  There could be an idea that this could be done on the cheap and that we could cut corners and provide this service a good deal more cheaply than the Department would be prepared to do.  There <Col N="555" /> are two objections: the question of interference, for which my Department cannot divest themselves of their responsibility, and also standards.  It would be a disaster if those concerned bought, as it were, a service and then saw it maintained at a level which meant it was unsatisfactory to them. We have considered that it is well that those concerned should know from the beginning that this is an expensive business.</P>

      <P>That is correct. Microwave links are needed to carry a signal from, say, Dublin to Cork so that Cork would get by this artificial extension, if you like, something that Dublin gets direct off the air by accident.  In addition in, say, Cork, a local network of cables would have been provided to carry the signals to individual homes.  That part, the cable, would not be of interest to my Department any more than it is here. That would be done by a contractor. The ultimate user, the viewer, would, if he decided it was worth while, have to pay for what the cable people did and also reimburse my Department for their expenditure.</P>

We must take it for granted that it would not be economical. It is of importance for the Minister to be able to give a choice of programmes. The rural areas will have to depend to a large extent on the second RTE channel.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that this could be operational sometime in <Col N="556" /> 1977.  It was debated by several people today and certain doubts have been cast on it.  The Minister should reassure us that it is his intention to have the second channel operating in 1977 or as soon as possible thereafter. There is no doubt that it is in the Minister's mind that RTE 2 will come into being.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Yes.  This programme normally went on the air in the afternoon but I was informed that it was changed to nine o'clock.  It is important that the proceedings of this House be reported by radio or television. People will tell you that Dáil Éireann is irrelevant.  This is a dangerous opinion and it is our duty to ensure that the dignity of this House is upheld.  I am not suggesting a prolonged programme but a certain time should be given for a report of the Dáil proceedings to let people know what is happening.  Quite a number of people may not read the daily newspaper reports.  I believe that there are quite a number of people who would listen to a more extensive radio programme of the Dáil proceedings. At some time in the future the Dáil proceedings could be televised. The Authority and the Department should be thinking along these lines.  I tabled this amendment for that reason. I am not suggesting that the Authority would deliberately preclude the proceedings of this House.  I should like to see future authorities being obliged to give time once or twice a week to a report of the proceedings in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with the spirit and the general tendency of what Deputy Fitzpatrick has just said.  I do not think it is necessary to provide for this in the legislation. As a general principle particular programmes should not be legislated for.  Day-to-day programming should be left to the Authority subject to general legislative guidelines and restraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> I am aware that the Authority, and the director general&mdash;in fact, RTE collectively&mdash;are very anxious to cover the proceedings of the Oireachtas, preferably by direct broadcasting, if they can get agreement to do that.  Of course, that depends on agreement by the Oireachtas and the parties making up the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not think they need to be urged on here.  If I felt they did I might think that legislation of this kind was necessary. But I doubt if it will ever be necessary in the sense that the Authority are appointed by the Government, and the Minister, who are responsible to the Oireachtas.  I would see no likelihood that any Government responsible to this Oireachtas would appoint an authority which would be disposed to treat the proceedings of the Oireachtas as of negligible interest.  For obvious reasons that is highly unlikely.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a point about a particular programme and its positioning in the programming of RTE.  This is not the kind of matter in which the House would wish a Minister to interfere in the normal course of events, but the fact that the Deputy has made the comment is of importance and I shall see to it that his comment is brought to the attention of the Authority.  I should again like to stress that at the moment it is not a question of our having to egg-on the Authority to be interested in our proceedings here.  They are very interested and would like to broadcast them.  I hope they will be able to do so, although this is outside my purview as a Minister.  I hope an Oireachtas agreement will be forthcoming to some form of direct broadcasting of the proceedings, or part of the proceedings&mdash; various formulae are available&mdash;of one or other of the Houses of the Oireachtas, eventually both Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment which calls for the broadcasting of full and adequate reports of debates in the Oireachtas.  I should like to compliment the personnel of RTE responsible for Dáil coverage.  In the limited time available they do a very efficient and effective job.  However, a full and adequate report is not being given.  Paragraph <Col N="559" /> (b) of this section calls for the upholding of the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution, especially those relating to rightful liberty of expression. In this regard I should like to state that there is a censorship in operation here.  It is a strict and positive censorship not brought about by the Authority in RTE but by the Government. It exists in relation to the covering of political affairs.  The Minister will recollect that before the Government took office there was wide and comprehensive coverage of political affairs in politicians' programmes but this was terminated by the Government. That is Government censorship because the Opposition are not allowed to debate and discuss various policies on political programmes.</P>

      <P>In that regard it is desirable that the amendment should be accepted.  Reports of our proceedings are to a large degree edited with the result that on occasions they lose their true meaning.  It is important that there should be a wide and comprehensive coverage of political affairs and that the Opposition should not be deprived of the opportunity of placing their views before the public.  It is right that the people should be politically informed of the progress of Parliament. The Government should relax their censorship and reintroduce the political programmes.  A limited amount of time is given at present and I have nothing but the height of praise for those who compile the programme involved.  However, the true value of rightful expression is lost.  The Opposition have the right of expression and the right to have their views projected in the same manner as the views of the Government were when they were in Opposition.  We all deplore Government censorship.  The Government have failed to live up to their responsibility to meet Opposition spokesmen and discuss current affairs and policy matters.  Until we have this wider coverage our people will be fed with statements from the GIS.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has called for full and adequate reports on RTE.  We only hear statements from a Government spokesman or the GIS and on many occasions these are cover-ups for the misdeeds of Ministers.  Our people have a right to hear the views of the Opposition. By maintaining this censorship the Government are ensuring that only their voice will be projected on radio or television.  The Government should come out from behind the cowardly cloak and measure up to their responsibilities. They should ensure that the people get the true facts of the situation facing the country and the manner in which they, or the Opposition, intend to correct it.  For that reason I believe Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment goes some of the way.  I challenge the Minister to ask his colleagues to release their grip on the television service, which they have exercised for the last three years, of censorship of the Opposition.

      <P>I am concerned and the public at large are concerned about this censorship which is imposed on politicians.  If a Minister wants to give his views, to substantiate, correct, or add to what he said in either House time is made available on television for him.  If this opportunity is afforded to only one section, the whole question of censorship comes into focus. Deputy Fitzpatrick is right when he asks for full and adequate reports because nothing short of that will project the true position of the affairs of this House.  Abbreviated reports can give <Col N="561" /> an erroneous impression to the public. For that reason, the time has come when the Government must face their responsibilities and for us to expose weaknesses or credits if they are there.</P>
      <P>I fully support the amendment and challenge the Minister and the Government to come clean and afford the nation the type of political discussion that takes place in every other country. Such discussion is taking place at the moment in America on the presidential election and in Britain almost daily on various programmes.  I hope Ministers will no longer hide behind the veil of secrecy that has surrounded them for so long and that the Government Information Services will not be in the superior position where their voice, and their voice alone, will be projected.  Irrespective of what point of view is put forward by an Opposition spokesman, only in exceptional circumstances will reference be made to it.</P>
      <P>This section indicates the upholding of the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution.  This is important. Recently there were occasions when those democratic values were not upheld, even by Ministers of this House.</P>

It is pathetic that even at this stage we had to insert in a Bill <Col N="562" /> that the Authority should be called upon to uphold those values.  I hope this will be fully and effectively applied.  I am certain members of the Authority will effectively apply it but apparently their masters feel immune from all ethical considerations in relation to upholding those democratic rights.

      <P>I want to be fairly brief in dealing with Deputy Dowling's intervention.  I regret its polemical character.  We were having a fairly good and businesslike Committee Stage until we had this intervention. Deputy Dowling referred to Government censorship of RTE.  I thought at first that what he might be referring to was the direction I issued recently prohibiting broadcasts by Provisional IRA, Official IRA, and Provisional Sinn Féin, but no, he was not worried about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It appeared, however, that he was using this in a highly special and tendentious way and that what he meant by censorship was that some political parties were not willing to take part in a particular programme which RTE used to broadcast. Nobody who looks at our television screens or listens to our radio can believe for a moment that Opposition spokesmen are being denied a voice.  Of course they have a voice.  Of course they are being heard.  They were heard loud and clear during the past week or so.  They had something of a field day.  I am not denying their entitlement to it, but to talk as Deputy Dowling has done as if the Government were surrounding themselves with a veil of secrecy and had clamped down on the unfortunate Opposition who were not allowed a chance of utterance on the airways is transparent nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the previous Government exception was taken by the then responsible Minister to a given member of <Col N="563" /> the Opposition being available for broadcasting.  In 1974 I made it clear to the Authority that if such a viewpoint ever prevailed it no longer prevailed, and that every Member of the Oireachtas could broadcast night and day as far as I was concerned.  There is no such censorship as Deputy Dowling has described and he knows that very well.  We have just had one of his tongue-in-cheek orations which are enjoyable in their own way but do not help us to get much forrader with the Committee Stage of a Bill.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> As regards my amendment which will put in the Bill that adequate time should be given to reporting Dáil Éireann, I believe there is merit in it. As I said, it is important that the dignity of this House should be upheld and we must remove the idea which is abroad that Dáil Éireann has no relevancy.  If we project ourselves, whether that be on television or in radio reports, I believe this will strengthen the institution of this House.  It was for that reason that I inserted that section.  It is unlikely any Authority would dream of diminishing the amount of time given at the moment but, even though that may be so, it would be no harm to insert this into the Bill.  It would not inhibit the authority in any way and it would be a protection in ensuring that adequate cover would be given to the proceedings here.  The Minister said he hoped that at some future date the proceedings here would be televised.  It is possible the proceedings might be boring but I am sure something could be organised so that a reasonable presentation would be given of important debates.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 21, our reason for tabling this amendment is because it is much closer to the recommendation of the Broadcasting Review Committee.</P>

      <P>Our purpose in tabling this amendment is to give greater emphasis to the recommendations of the Broadcasting Review <Col N="564" /> Committee.  The first paragraph of Chapter 3 says that broadcasting should be concerned with safeguarding, enriching and strengthening the cultural, social and economic fabric of the whole of Ireland.  This is intended in the broadest sense and not in a narrow sense which might act as an inhibiting factor from time to time. Without becoming obsessive about it we must bear in mind the weight of cultural influences poured into this country from our nearest neighbour and from across the Atlantic and it is in the strengthening of our own basic identity we can counterbalance these influences.</P>
      <P>I welcome the references to upholding the democratic values of the Constitution in section 14.  One might not have thought some weeks ago, but one can think it now, that we have to determine to maintain democracy. Democracy could be eroded by our own negligence and in that sense I welcome this introduction into the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is main liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leat, a Cheann Comhairle, as ucht an t-am seo a thabhairt dom chun an cheist seo a phlé.</P>
      <P>I put this question down and asked a number of supplementaries today and I must say the Minister gave a rather comprehensive reply.  However, I feel strongly about this particular question and consequently I asked for your indulgence to raise it on the adjournment.  I am grateful to you for giving me permission to do so.  First of all, I would like to say that the whole idea in regional technical colleges&mdash;I emphasise the word &ldquo;regional&rdquo;&mdash;was to cater for the particular region in which the college was situated.  There was a tendency to look for higher education away from the rural areas of the country, to look towards the capital city or some other city.  The idea of having a certain flavour of the region in the regional college was, in my opinion, a very good one.</P>
      <P>The particular establishment we are talking about is in Letterkenny in a county where there is a flourishing fishing industry and there is also a marine radio station.  I do not have to expand on that.  Killybegs, Burtonport, Greencastle and Malin Head are all important in the fishing industry and important in the marine field.  We pointed out today that there was not very much expense involved in this particular project for Letterkenny. My contention is, while this is an important consideration, it is not the sole one.  The people on the spot need this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three fully qualified teachers in the regional technical college in Letterkenny capable of conducting this course.  The course is an internationally recognised one and consequently should attract people <Col N="568" /> from the Six Counties, which is quite near and which also has an interest in the fishing industry and in the radio officer course.</P>
    <P>It is important to refer to the employment possibilities in this field.  We know that at the present moment one of the most serious problems facing the country is the provision of employment for young people.  This problem is particularly acute in the north-western area.  We know that the companies who employ marine radio officers are very anxious to have more people trained.  They are on record as having said that they could take exactly double the number who qualify in the country each year.  This is an important consideration.</P>
    <P>I know that AnCO have been putting on courses for young people but I am a little pessimistic about these courses.  There are courses being planned for young school leavers with no job prospects at the end of them, so it looks very much as if we may be using the sum of money from the European Social Fund merely to mark time.  I am not saying that the actual training that is given will be a dead loss but when you conduct a short course, no matter how good it is, no matter how intensive it is, if a long period elapses before the participant succeeds in getting a job the training certainly wears away.</P>
    <P>We are assured that there is no difficulty with regard to employment in this particular field.  I instanced the Marconi Company, who are anxious to recruit as many marine radio officers as possible.  As I have already stated, there are three qualified people ready to run this course in the technical college.  I am assured that the cost of equipment is as low as approximately £10,000.  I am also assured that at one period the college actually had that amount of money available had they been permitted to use it.  It is a strange thing that they should not be allowed to use it, arguing from the premise I started with, that the regional college should cater for the region, that those courses should have a flavour of the region in which the college is situated.</P>
    <P>With regard to the argument that the Government and the Minister for <Col N="569" /> Education are advised that it would be better to concentrate this type of training and education in one place, to a certain extent I go along with that argument.  In particular I would agree with it fully if it meant that there was to be large capital expenditure in many places.  As a consequence of this one could argue that the country would not be able to afford this, but in this particular instance there is not a large capital investment involved.  Consequently I see no merit at all in concentration of the course in the regional technical college in Cork only.  I know, as the Minister stated today in the House, that there was an effort to retain a school in Dún Laoghaire to cover the east coast and the arguments for that are substantial.  I would like to point out that, due to the decision that the course will be concentrated only in Cork city, there is no facility available to anybody north of the Dublin-Limerick line.</P>
    <P>This is a serious handicap to the people particularly in the Donegal area.  A great deal of euphoria has gone out of our hopes for off-shore gas and oil but I am still optimistic enough to think that this will develop as a major industry and will cause greater demand for these officers.  Recently we have been putting it on the line that a 50-mile fishing limit is very important for the development of the fishing industry in this country and it looks as if there will be a demand if we succeed.  The Fianna Fáil party and the Minister for Foreign Affairs seem to be in agreement that they want a 50-mile limit with no question of quotas.  This will demand an increase in middle water trawlers and consequently further demand for marine radio officers.  There is general agreement now that professional people should have in-service courses to keep them up to date with their specialities. It is a bit much to have people from Killybegs, Greencastle or some such place in a highly competitive industry like fishing taking off down to Cork for courses when, if the facility were available in Letterkenny, they would be able to fit it in with their ordinary work.  This is an important aspect of this case.  If the paltry sum of £10,000 <Col N="570" /> or £15,000 is not available at the moment, the equipment for this course could be provided at a rental of £4,000 or £4,500 per annum.  That is a paltry sum when we weigh it against the advantages which the course could provide.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I appeal to the Minister to have another look at the situation.  If we are to believe rumours, the Minister may be involved in the whole European sea question and it would be nice to think that if we succeeded in having a 50-mile limit declared under satisfactory conditions the Minister would have taken steps to see to it that we had trained technicians to cover the new increase in the middle water trawlers, the increase in demand at the type of station that we have at Malin Head in Donegal.  I would like to reiterate what I said about the possibility of support for the course from the Six Counties.  A very healthy development in recent years in Donegal and in Monaghan has been the number of people who are going for higher education to Coleraine.  It would be nice to think that a first class nationally and internationally recognised course for marine radio officers would be made available in Letterkenny through the action of this Government which would cater for increasing numbers from the Six Counties. I am appealing to the Minister to see to it that the regional element in the college is emphasised, that jobs for trained personnel that are there for the asking will be taken up by people from Donegal or from Derry, that the expertise available in the college be put to this use and I am asking the Minister, above all, to take into consideration the low cost to his Department of developing this course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Richard Burke) Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Richard Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said just now, I gave a comprehensive reply in the Dáil today to the question which is the subject of this matter on the Adjournment but in defence of the sincerity of the case advanced by him again this evening, I will try to put the arguments from my side of the House into some sequence.  This will necessitate a brief survey of what has happened in the last couple of years.  In <Col N="571" /> April, 1968 a survey team on nautical education was appointed by the then Minister for Education.  The impending establishment at the time of the new regional technical colleges throughout the country with the purpose of catering for national needs in all areas of technical education provided an opportunity of considering nautical education in the context of overall development in this sphere. Such education and training were then available in the Irish Nautical College in Dún Laoghaire.  The terms of reference of the survey team were to examine and make recommendations in regard to (a) the courses for which provision would be required in a new nautical school if established; (b) the estimated numbers for which such provision would be required; (c) the desirability of centralising facilities in the proposed new regional technical college in Cork; (d) the need for residential accommodation; (e) the accommodation which would be required to meet the projected numbers and (f) the estimated capital and running cost.</P>
      <P>Membership of the survey team was representative of Irish Shipping Limited, the Irish Shipowners' Association, the Irish Nautical College, the Department of Transport and Power and the Department of Education.  The survey team presented its report in December, 1969.  I have given some extracts from the report already today so I do not need to put them on record again.  Briefly, the report said that a national nautical education centre should be established and the educational grounds for a single institution. The report also said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To obtain the services of the best teachers in these subjects, (mathematics, science, economics, and business studies, work study and personnel management) and to employ them economically requires in the present Irish circumstances that nautical education courses be associated with major technical institutions where both staff and equipment capable of handling courses at the highest levels required can be provided.  For nautical educational purposes, the institution <Col N="572" /> concerned should be located at or very near to a major port facility.</P>
    <P>Dublin was considered as a potential centre but the Team's opinion is that the pattern of development in higher technical education there is not ideally suited to the integration of nautical courses in existing or projected institutions.</P>
    <P>The team went on to say:</P>
    <P>the new Regional Technical College in Cork will embrace comprehensive facilities for technical education at craft, technician and higher technician levels.  These facilities would be available to courses in nautical education in addition to specialised accommodation and equipment provided for such courses.  Cork college would, therefore, create a very favourable educational environment which should attract students and teachers of the highest calibre to the Nautical Department of the college as well as to other departments.</P>
    <P>Other points in Cork's favour is the presence of a shipbuilding industry there, and the university which could play an important part not only in the education of senior marine personnel but also in maritime and oceanographic research.  Obviously they were referring there to UCC.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>For all those reasons, the new Regional Technical College at Cork commends itself as the most suitable centre for the development of comprehensive nautical education on a national basis.</P>
    <P>The Team is, therefore, convinced that it is essential to replace our existing fragmented training facilities by a comprehensive nautical education department, properly staffed and integrated within a major technical institution.</P>
    <P>The Cork Regional Technical College was planned to incorporate facilities for nautical education and training in accordance with the team's requirements. Equipment in the Irish Nautical College, Dún Laoghaire, required for purposes of the courses in Cork was transferred there during the summer of 1975 and the teaching staff of <Col N="573" /> the Irish Nautical College took up duty in the Cork RTC as from 1st September, 1975.</P>
    <P>A course in maritime radio communications is provided in the Cork Regional Technical College.  This course, which leads to the award by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs of a General Certificate in Maritime Radio Communication, is of two years' duration and the subjects of instruction in both years are electricity, mathematics, electronics, maritime regulations and procedures, morse theory and practice, marine radio communications and general studies.</P>
    <P>The aim of the course is to educate and train students in the field of marine radio communications and to make them proficient in the sending and receiving of morse code messages and in marine regulations so that they may be employed as shipboard radio officers.  An extra course year may be offered proceeding to Radar Endorsements and City and Guilds of London Institute examinations.  The entry standard for the course is the leaving certificate with English and mathematics as preferable subjects.</P>
    <P>Since the facilities for nautical education and training generally have now been centralised in the Regional Technical College in Cork and since a course in maritime radio communications is already provided there, the establishment of a corresponding course at the Regional Technical College in Letterkenny would not, as I indicated in my reply to the Deputy's question earlier today, be in conformity with the now agreed policy of concentrating as far as feasible <Col N="574" /> specialist facilities in the most suitable locations.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I might refer to the National Fishery School at Greencastle, County Donegal which is administered by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and for which a grant of £72,000 has been provided in respect of the current financial year.  While the courses at the centre are orientated towards the training of trawler skippers and trawler deckhands and while it appears that there has been no decision as yet to incorporate a marine radio course as such in the school's activities, I understand that the school is in the process of obtaining equipment, specifically for the courses for skippers, which would enable a course in marine radio communications to be established if at any time such were to be considered necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>For these considerations I must refuse the cogent and sincere arguments of the Deputy and to say that I am not able to accede to his request for the installations of such a course at Letterkenny.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>Net income can refer to a number of different means of, and reasons for abating gross income.  In particular it can refer to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) basic income exclusive of overtime payments or other sources of income; (2) income exclusive of certain statutory payments, such as income tax and social welfare contributions; (3) making allowance for marital status for children and for adult dependants; (4) making allowance for essential recurring expenditure, such as fixed outgoings on a house.</P>
      <P>With regard to (1) the criterion for eligibility for a medical card is inability to provide general practitioner services without incurring undue hardship. Income from overtime can be substantial and can determine whether or not a person comes within this category. In assessing eligibility for a medical card, therefore, it cannot be ignored.</P>
      <P>With regard to (2), the income guidelines which have been adopted and are used by chief executive officers of the health boards to assist in deciding eligibility for medical cards have been fixed with due regard to the fact that no special allowance is made for income tax and other statutory payments.  If such allowance was made, the guidelines would need to be adjusted to provide for this change. There is also the consideration that the benefits of such a change would be felt mainly by persons on higher incomes and it would take away some of the relative advantage which is now given to married couples and to people with children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to (3), the medical card income guidelines make this allowance.  For example, the weekly <Col N="488" /> income within which medical cards are now given is £19.50 for a single person living alone and this is increased to £28.25 for a married couple. In addition, there is an allowance of £2.60 for every child under 16 years and £3.75 for every adult dependant.</P>
    <P>With regard to (4), this allowance is made in the medical card income guidelines.  All fixed outgoings (rent, rates and so on) on a house in excess of £2.60 a week are allowed for.  In addition, allowance is made for reasonable expenses necessarily incurred on travelling to work.</P>

If a single person with no dependants &mdash; for example, an unmarried school leaver&mdash;living in an urban area is receiving payment at the rate of 10p per day it is because his weekly means for unemployment assistance purposes have been assessed at £8.30.  Under the provisions of the Unemployment Assistance Acts such a person would be entitled to payment at the rate of 60p a week, that is the difference between the maximum weekly rate of unemployment assistance (£8.90) applicable in his case and his weekly rate of means (£8.30).</P>
