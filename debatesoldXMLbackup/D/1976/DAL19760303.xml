      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish a harbour Authority for Bantry Bay in pursuance of the Government decision announced on 29th October, 1974.  The Bill is, as Deputies will see, simple and straightforward.  It provides for the establishment of a harbour Authority to be known as the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners and for the addition of the new Authority to the Authorities in Part II of the First Schedule to the Harbours Act, 1946.  This means in effect that the new Authority will be subject to the provisions of the Harbours Acts, 1946 and 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also defines the area of jurisdiction of the proposed Authority which broadly speaking is the whole of Bantry Bay except the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre, over <Col N="1084" /> which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will retain control.  The pier at Bantry which is at present under the control of Cork County Council will be transferred to the new Authority, but responsibility for other piers in the bay will not be affected by the Bill.  The proposed Authority will have powers, functions and duties which I believe will be adequate to meet the situation at Bantry.  For Deputies' information, I will outline the considerations which led to the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In 1968, the Gulf Oil Corporation of America established, and have since operated there, a crude oil transhipment terminal at Whiddy Island in Bantry Bay, where they have provided an off-shore jetty and ancillary facilities.  The corporation hold, with effect from 2nd October, 1968, a 99-year lease of about 195 acres of foreshore at Whiddy Island at an annual rent of £7,000 per annum.  The lease was granted in accordance with the provisions of the Foreshore Act, 1933.</P>
    <P>At the time of establishment of the Gulf Oil terminal at Whiddy the need for a harbour authority was examined in my Department.  The conclusion reached at the time was that for the satisfactory operation of the terminal there a harbour authority was not required.  Pilotage was being provided on an own-user basis by Gulf whilst enforcement of requirements relating to safety of navigation generally in the bay, pollution control, and so on could be effectively supervised by the relevant authorities concerned, namely, the Commissioners of Irish Lights, my Department and the county council.  Gulf Oil had no objection in principle to the establishment of a harbour authority and to the payment of dues in respect of the services rendered by such body, but from their point of view, the whole project at Whiddy was only marginally economic and they should not be expected to make substantial payments over and above what would be necessary to defray the cost of the necessary facilities and services which a harbour authority would be expected to provide.  A harbour authority was not necessary in the circumstances then obtaining.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> As the terminal and adjacent waters did not fall within the jurisdiction of any existing harbour authority no dues fell to be paid by Gulf.  At the same time the right was reserved to set up a harbour authority at a later stage if that proved to be necessary or desirable and this condition was accepted by Gulf on the understanding that they would not be expected to pay dues incommensurate with the necessary services which such a harbour authority would provide. Since the terminal was opened Gulf have provided at their own expense the facilities and services which they would normally expect to obtain from a harbour authority in return for dues.  This position still remains.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the question of harbour dues, the Gulf Oil terminal at Bantry is of very considerable value both to the immediate locality and to the nation generally.  The original capital investment by the company in Ireland was substantial and very welcome.  Arising from the operation of their terminal Gulf are responsible for the spending of a considerable sum by way of wages, salaries, fees and so on, amounting in the aggregate to something in excess of £1 million per annum. Revenue arising directly or indirectly from each call of a large tanker is nearly £20,000.  In addition to these benefits, the Gulf Oil Corporation have entered into formal agreement to hold a reserve of one million barrels of crude oil at Whiddy which would be at the disposal of the Government in the event of an emergency. This stock represents approximately ten days' supply for the State and, as on the occasion of the oil crisis in 1973, would be available as iron rations which would be refined in Cork if that became necessary.  The current value of this agreement to the economy is indicated by the following figures.  The cost of providing the tankage for one million barrels would be about £3.5 million and the cost of the crude oil itself about £4 million, that is, a total capital cost of about £7.5 million.  The annual operating costs would be approximately £750,000.  It will be seen, therefore, that Gulf's operations are of considerable <Col N="1086" /> benefit to the local and national economies.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that local, and indeed national, appreciation of this value is increasing.  This is evidenced by the concern being expressed at the current down-turn in activity at the Gulf terminal.  I welcome recent assurances from Gulf of their intention to stay in Bantry Bay.  However, we must accept that the immediate future for the terminal is going to be very difficult. Many factors are contributing to this, the majority of which, for example, the stagnation in world oil consumption, the consequent recession in the crude oil shipping industry and overcapacity in European refineries&mdash;are outside our control.  It is all the more desirable, therefore, that those factors which are under our control should not aggravate the present difficulties of the terminal.</P>
    <P>It would be idle to pretend that the decision to establish a harbour authority at Bantry is not related to the unfortunate incidence of oil spillage in the bay.  While the two most recent spillages were very serious, it is important to retain a sense of proportion in the matter.  The total quantity of oil spilled in Bantry since the terminal was opened in 1968 is only a minute fraction&mdash;some 0.002 per cent of the total throughput of oil there.  By any standards, this is a good record.  I must stress, however, that I am emphatic, as indeed are Gulf themselves, that as far as is humanly possible, no spillage of oil should occur.</P>
    <P>Even if there had been no serious spillage, the logic of events was such that the establishment of a controlling authority for the bay was only a matter of time.  As is generally known, planning permission has been granted for a large oil refinery at Whiddy Island.  In addition there is a proposal for an off-shore oil platform construction project near Castletownbere.  There may well be other similar major industrial proposals.  The possibility that in the fairly near future more than one major user might be involved at Bantry Bay meant that some form of controlling authority would eventually be necessary.  In considering what form of authority would best suit, regard has been had to local conditions and to <Col N="1087" /> possible industrial developments, and so forth, there.  Following close consultation with local interests, and indeed some national interests with local application, I have come to the conclusion that what might be termed a traditional-type harbour authority under the Harbours Acts, 1946-47, would best suit for the following reasons:</P>
    <P>(a)  my primary concern is for the safety of navigation within the bay and for the provision and proper regulation of harbour facilities required there; a harbour authority as now proposed will have the necessary powers to ensure this,</P>
    <P>(b)  an equally important concern of mine is the prevention of oil pollution in the bay.  The relevant Acts governing oil pollution&mdash;the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956-65&mdash;are at present under review and I intend to promote legislation to provide for greater penalties for conviction on indictment of oil pollution,</P>
    <P>(c)  the conservation of natural amenities within the Bantry Bay area is a function proper to the planning authority, in this case the Cork County Council,</P>
    <P>(d)  the industrial development of the area is a function proper to the Industrial Development Authority and to my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, subject to planning approval.</P>
    <P>Under the Acts of 1946-47 a harbour authority is classified according to whether it is listed in Part I or Part II of the First Schedule to the 1946 Act.  The harbours colloquially known as Part I harbours are the major ports of Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford; harbour authorities for such harbours are composed of 23 members. As Bantry Bay is essentially a one-user harbour, I consider it would more appropriately be classified as a Part II harbour which, under the Acts, has an 11-man Authority.  Representation is provided under the Acts for four local authority nominees, two local chamber of commerce nominees, two elected members representing <Col N="1088" /> shipping interests and three Ministerial nominees, one of whom must represent labour interests.  I would like to emphasise that, apart from the representation provisions, the differences between Part I and Part II harbours are minimal.  A Part I harbour authority has, effectively, no additional powers or functions over a Part II harbour authority.</P>
    <P>The present Bill accordingly proposes to add Bantry Bay to the list of harbours in Part II of the First Schedule to the Harbours Act, 1946. All the provisions of the Acts of 1946 and 1947 will apply to the new Authority. The Authority will, therefore, have adequate powers to control navigation within the bay, to levy tonnage, goods and service rates to meet necessary expenditure on harbour facilities and to make bye-laws for the good management of their harbour.  I am satisfied that the new Authority, based as it is on the concept of local and independent control of Bantry Bay, will prove itself fully suited and adequate to meet the situation at Bantry and I therefore confidently commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We support the Minister in the setting up of the Bantry Harbour Authority.  As he said, the need for this became really apparent during the oil spillage a few years ago which happened because of the negligence of those involved in the Gulf operation.  We presume this Authority will have the powers under the 1946 Act which other harbour authorities have, powers to raise funds and collect dues and also compulsory purchase powers and all the other powers of harbour authorities set up under the 1946 Act.  We would like the Minister to tell us where the Authority will get its money in the main, whether they will get State grants to set them up or what the procedure will be.  Will they have to borrow straight away?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also wonder if the area should have been extended to take in places like Glengarriff and surrounding areas because this is a region which must develop as time goes on.  As has been said, there is planning permission for an oil refinery in the area and the possibility of building platforms has <Col N="1089" /> also been mentioned.  In view of the off-shore developments which we hopefully anticipate it is expected the area will develop faster than most other areas.  Therefore it might have been wise to give the Authority wider scope in regard to the area of its jurisdiction under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of pollution laws and further legislation.  We trust these will be strictly obeyed and that we shall have no further spillages such as the one we had which caused a good deal of trouble and concern at the time and gave a rather dirty name to the oil industry.  It is a pity it occurred; it should never have occurred.  In the past few years this Authority was considered not entirely necessary because there was only one large user of the harbour, but we support the Minister in bringing in the Bill now and we trust the harbour Authority now being established will be successful in every aspect of its activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, belated though it is.  The people of the area and everybody interested in Bantry Harbour have been pressing for this Authority for many years and it is only now it has been decided to introduce the Bill.  For that reason I thank the Minister for at least establishing this harbour Authority after such a long delay.</P>
      <P>A harbour authority is very badly needed in Bantry.  The tonnage imported to Bantry in the past years exceeded the total tonnage imported into all the other ports in the country and surely a harbour authority should have been set up there many years ago with appropriate powers and functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pier at Bantry and all the other piers in the area are in a very bad condition.  The county council have no money available, except out of their own funds, to make improvements in piers or harbours.  I am very sorry that the Minister did not include at least Glengarriff in this Bill and give authority to the harbour authority to look after this pier where improvements are badly needed at present.  The pier at Glengarriff serviced <Col N="1090" /> many cruise liners that came into the harbour in recent years.  Four or five years ago at least seven or eight of these cruise liners came to Glengarriff where the pier at present is in a very poor condition and that, I think, is interfering with prospects for cruise liners calling there.  Only one came last year.  This proves that something must be done for the Glengarriff pier.</P>
    <P>The county council are at present considering the position.  I think about £50,000 would be needed to put the pier in proper condition.  I think that the harbour authority should have been provided when Gulf Oil came into Bantry at first.  All interests combined with the local people to ask the previous Government and this Government also to set up a harbour authority at Bantry but nothing was done until now.  Now that the Authority has been provided I hope it will be able to do some of the improvements that are badly needed there.  I should like to know if the Authority has any funds available to undertake any work or when will they begin to collect funds.</P>
    <P>Now that the harbour authority is to be formed and the members have been spelled out I would like to know from the Minister, in relation to any spillages which might occur, if the harbour authority will now be responsible for the control of all tankers. How will they deal with any spillages which might occur?  Will they have funds available to clean up the harbour?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill which proposes to set up a harbour authority for Bantry Bay.  As a result of oil spillages during the past few years a demand came originally from the people of the district, and eventually from the nation as a whole, to set up a harbour authority.  The country is very much concerned with the preservation of our amenities. People are also very much concerned that no further spillages should occur. ity will have all the powers contained</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that this harbour author-in Part II of the Harbours Act, 1946. This means that it will also be subject to the provisions of the Harbours <Col N="1091" /> Act, 1947.  The Harbours Acts give great power to harbour authorities. They have powers to manage harbour developments within the confines of the harbour district as outlined in this Bill.  They have power to make bye-laws, to acquire land and property. They have power to borrow money and they have power to control development generally within their district.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister mentioned in his speech that at the time of the establishment of the Gulf Oil terminal at Whiddy the need for a harbour authority was examined in his Department but that the conclusion was reached then that for the satisfactory operation of the terminal in Bantry a harbour authority was not required.  I also note from the Minister's statement that the whole project at Whiddy by Gulf Oil is only marginally economical.  There seems to be a rumour going around that Gulf Oil are making fabulous profits out of Whiddy at the expense of the State and that they should be contributing in a large way towards development at Bantry and also towards other developments in the country.</P>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that Gulf Oil have provided good employment and also at their own expense that they provided the facilities and services which they would normally expect to obtain from a harbour authority in return for dues.  If the harbour authority had been set up at the outset Gulf Oil would have expected those facilities to be provided which would have cost the harbour authority and the State a considerable amount of money.  It is also worth nothing that Gulf Oil have agreed to hold a reserve of one million barrels of crude oil at Whiddy which will be at the disposal of the Government in the event of an emergency.  This is a very valuable reserve.  The very fact that Gulf Oil are in Whiddy is beneficial to the nation.</P>
    <P>It is quite in order for the Minister to state that the total quantity of oil spilt in Bantry since the terminal was opened in 1968 is only a minute fraction of the total output of oil there.  I consider any oil spillage, no <Col N="1092" /> matter how small it is, a very serious matter and I am sure the Minister also does but that he is only giving the facts here.  We saw the destruction which occurred in Bantry Bay at the time of the last spillage.  We saw what happened to fish life, birds, bathing and swimming resorts in the area.  It is really alarming, having regard to the small quantity of spillage in Bantry, to think of the damage that could be caused to the nation as a whole should any large spillage occur along our coastline.  Such damage would be out of all proportion to the cost of making good the damage, having regard to the serious effect it would have on the environment.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the Minister when he states it is likely that in the near future more than one major industry might be involved in Bantry Bay.  I hope this will happen and that industrial projects and industries created from the spin-off would be set up in other areas like Bantry.  But where there is industry there must be proper control by the planning authorities in regard to amenities.  In relation to Bantry Bay the planning authority is still Cork County Council. There are no positive planning powers in so far as the harbour authority is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Minister intends updating the legislation in relation to oil pollution.  This area is governed at present by the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 to 1965. We must provide for greater penalties in regard to oil spillages generally.</P>
    <P>The new harbour authority will be empowered to take positive action in carrying out desirable developments in Bantry Bay.  Although the present economic climate is not suitable in so far as the launching of a harbour authority is concerned, it is good that the machinery is being set up, and that the members are being appointed because they can get down to the business of the planning and development of the area.  I should like the Minister to tell us by what means the harbour authority are likely to get the initial capital that will be required to enable them to commence their work.  Perhaps, too, the Minister would let us <Col N="1093" /> know if he has power to allocate moneys to the harbour authority or whether there is power to grant them moneys through any Department.</P>
    <P>Again, I welcome the Bill and assert my confidence in the Authority availing of every opportunity to develop to the maximum Bantry Bay and the surrounding area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who have expressed a welcome for this Bill.  In particular, I thank Deputy O'Sullivan who for many years past has been promoting the cause of a harbour authority for Bantry Bay.  I am glad he is here at the time of the introduction of the relevant Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett raised the question of Glengarriff being included.  The waters of the whole of the area will be included under the proposed new authority except for Castletownbere Harbour which remains under the control of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  So far as the inclusion of the pier at Glengarriff is concerned, there is no such proposal because, since there is no income from this, it would be a liability for the harbour commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of piers in Bantry Bay and most of them do not return an income with the exception of Bantry pier itself.  There is an income in all of about £3,000 per annum and this money will fund the harbour authority initially but they will be free to borrow and free to charge dues in respect of ships using the harbour and this includes fishing ships, but they can charge dues only for what they provide.  I must emphasise this: there will be no question of the harbour commissioners charging dues so as to allow them to make capital investments or anything of that nature.  They are entitled to collect dues only for the services they provide.  That is the basis on which all harbour authorities operate.  They must be self-financed and this means that they must charge dues sufficient to give them enough to run their Authority.  If they charge less their harbour is in danger of going <Col N="1094" /> into bankruptcy or becoming insolvent.</P>
    <P>Such a situation must be avoided. The management will not be in a position to sit back and do nothing for five or six years.  Theirs will be a big responsibility.  Any harbour authority, whether it be this new one or one that has been in existence for as long as 100 years, should be extremely conscious of their responsibility in regard to the extension and development of the harbours under their control. I say that deliberately because in relation to some harbours in the country the board members do not take their responsibility seriously enough. However, I do not think this will happen in regard to Bantry because the people on the Authority will have a strong local interest.  Some harbour authorities, for instance, do not consult frequently enough with my Department as to what they may or may not do.  They should have my permission as Minister for the investment of money because in the event of borrowing I must be assured that expenditure indulged in does not become a burden on the taxpayer.  If the benefit concerned was to apply only to the relevant harbour authority it would be grossly unfair that the taxpayers would have to bear the burden.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the responsibility of the harbour authority who would have to arrange their finances to pay for such work.  In other words, they would have to up their fees accordingly.  In exceptional circumstances grants have been given where an operation was outside the ability of the Authority to finance.  Since the foundation of the State the policy regarding harbours has been that they must balance their books.</P>

      <P>Again that would be a matter for Cork County Council and the harbour commissioners.  The establishment of the harbour authority does not solve all the problems. There will be responsibilities after that and I am sure they will be taken seriously.  We will be speaking with the harbour authorities.  I am really speaking to harbour authorities now, not to Bantry Bay authority, but to other authorities.  There will be heavy responsibilities because there is very big money involved now so they should, as I said earlier, be very careful about the money they spend.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy O'Sullivan said Bantry Bay has a great number of piers in it and none is revenue earning.  If at any time in the future the harbour commissioners want to take over any of the piers I will facilitate them by making the necessary orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary mentioned oil pollution offences.  The position will be the same as it is in the other harbours like Cork, Dublin and Water-ford. The commissioners will be the competent prosecutors for small spillages but I will retain to myself the major spillages and prosecutions for those.  I intend to up-date and increase the fines quite severely for oil pollution. I hope to introduce that Bill within the next month.  It should provide Deputies with an opportunity of <Col N="1097" /> speaking on a subject which is engageing attention all over the world, namely, oil pollution.</P>
    <P>I hope that this authority, when established, will prove very successful and live up to the high hopes the local people have for them.  Deputy Barrett said that at the moment and for the past number of years there has been only one user of Bantry Bay.  There is a proposal to establish an oil rig building station outside Castletownbere. There is existing planning permission for an oil refinery on the island and one hears talk of other projects around the bay.  These will all be of benefit initially to the harbour commissioners and, more importantly, to the people generally in the area of west Cork and Kerry.  I thank the House for the reception they have given to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because Gulf provided all the facilities.  The harbour commissioners can take over some or all of the facilities, in which event they will be responsible for maintenance, such as ensuring the channel is kept free, properly lit and so on.  If they take them over they will be able to charge a fee.  If they do not take them over they cannot charge for something they are not supplying. That is only reasonable.</P>

      <P>They could come to an arrangement with Gulf but Gulf will naturally protect their own position and, if they are not getting value for money, they will be unwilling to <Col N="1099" /> come to an arrangement.  I do not want to dictate to the harbour commissioners but I imagine Gulf will retain the onshore facilities and the harbour commissioners will take over the buoys and so on and charge dues. In that way Gulf will maintain their position.  The only user at the moment is Gulf.  The harbour commissioners may not charge fees to any user without permission from my Department and the level will be controlled by my Department.  As well as seeing that the Bantry Bay Commissioners get a fair return for what they are providing, I will also be protecting the users to make sure they are not overcharged for what the Commissioners are providing.</P>

      <P>There are no dues charged in Bantry Bay because there is no harbour authority there.  The only payments that are made are the payments for the use of Bantry Pier, and the payment by Gulf of £7,000 a year for the foreshore at Whiddy.</P>

      <P>The first part of the Minister's opening remarks read:</P>
      <P>Revenue arising directly or indirectly from each call of a large tanker is nearly £20,000.</P>
      <P>Does that mean that if the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners were providing all the facilities and services required for dealing with tankers they would have an income of £20,000?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  When a big tanker comes into Bantry Bay, tugs have to be hired and men employed to handle it, and there are purchases of stores on shore and that amounts to £20,000.  It has nothing to do with dues except that each call could be allocated a proportion of the £7,000 foreshore licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give you the income of the oil charges by other harbour authorities around the coast, which is about 6p per ton, but you would have to see then whether they were giving value for that 6p per ton and whether there is dredging included in that.  There would not be dredging in Bantry Bay, so therefore you might say that the charges in Bantry Bay should be lower than that.  There are facilities in Bantry Bay, which is a much harder harbour to take, and if they were buying over the facilities on Whiddy Island they would have to charge the interest charged for that capital purchase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only four class I harbour authorities&mdash;Limerick, Waterford, Cork and Dublin.  The reason for that is that they have a huge variety of trade going into these ports.  There is only one type of trade being handled in Bantry.  If Bantry should develop into a huge international port, then it would become a Part 1 harbour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes no difference at all.  The only difference is in the composition of the board and the fact that they do not have a general manager.  Their expenses are less <Col N="1102" /> under this.  If they were a Class I harbour, they would have to have a general manager and a bigger staff.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I only know what I read in the papers about this.  The planning permission was applied for four or five years ago and was granted about two years ago.  You must remember that this was applied for in different circumstances.  This planning permission was applied for at a time when there was great difficulty in establishing oil refineries on the east coast of America.  The thinking behind this refinery was that it should be established in Bantry Bay.  It was structured to provide heating oil for homes, which would then be shipped from Bantry to the east coast of America for consumer use there.  But that was all prior to the oil crisis in 1973, when conditions changed.  The same restrictions did not apply to establishing oil refineries in America, there was not the same demand for home heating oil, and the general downturn in the use of oil throughout the world did not make it economically attractive as far as the promoters of this project were concerned. The planning permission still exists and they can come back at any time, and perhaps they will go ahead in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to oil spillages and oil pollution, which is a very emotional issue, and probably exaggerated, because I gather from the Minister's brief that the percentage of spillages is very small, I understand that the anxiety felt by many can now, at least to some degree, be put at ease with the creation of a harbour board in Bantry Bay.  Can the Minister say what sort of cost would be involved for the harbour board to equip themselves properly and fully to deal with any emergency that might arise as a result of spillage in the Bay?  I gather that one needs extensive equipment to deal with such a problem when it arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can foresee a situation, say at the <Col N="1103" /> first meeting of the harbour authority in Bantry, where estimates for £10,000 worth of equipment in boats and trucks would have to be dealt with.  We have a harbour authority whose income is only £3,000 or £7,000. Until such time as they negotiate new terms with Gulf to get themselves in a viable position, will the harbour board not be in a weak area for dealing with any spillage which might arise?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said the spillage was very small, and that is true in terms of the total throughput of the terminal since it was established, but I also said that I consider any spillage serious and can be very damaging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the harbour commissioners' expenses in cleaning up some future spillage, all the equipment is there on site now.  I do not think the harbour authority would consider buying a whole duplicate set of equipment for themselves but they would come to an arrangement with tug owners that in the event of a spillage they would hire their tugs and with lorry-fleet owners they would hire their lorries.  The Cork County Council keep a stock of detergents.  The authority would arrange that the county council would be responsible for keeping the estimated amounts of detergent the Cork County Council have for use in the Bantry area.  Under the Department of Local Government the Cork County Council have to keep a stock of detergent sufficient for the whole of the Cork county coast.  I presume the harbour commissioners would then come to an agreement with the county council to keep portion of that stock.  In relation to the total that might be used in Bantry it would probably be more because the danger of spillage would be greater in Bantry. They would come to such arrangements with the county council or with lorry owners or tug owners without making any capital investment in lorries or tugs or spraying equipment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the manner in which the spillage of two years ago occurred, leaving a valve open and letting the oil flow into the sea, does the Minister envisage the harbour authority having any powers of supervision or spot check when tankers are being unloaded?  It was sheer negligence that that happened the last time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, these powers exist.  At present the people in my Department are responsible for them. These will be transferred to the harbour commissioners.  They will prove more effective because they will be on the spot all the time and will be able to send down officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first spillage, as you say, was a human error in that a cock was left open and the oil flowed out.  The second one was a different type of spillage, the fracturing of a tanker by a tug lifting under it.  I should say, a Cheann Comhairle, that I was very annoyed about those two spillages because I felt they could have been avoided.  The Gulf Oil Company were very co-operative with my Department and accepted all the restrictions put on their activities and all the necessary safety measures for oil spillage that we felt were necessary to impose on them.  I should pay that tribute to them.  When the oil was spilt in Bantry they were very concerned and so showed themselves right up to the top of the Gulf <Col N="1105" /> Organisation in getting the spillages cleaned up and installing systems that would inhibit that happening again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important when one is talking about spillage and ensuring that it does not occur again, that the membership of the harbour board should be as representative as possible.  Glengarriff directly has no representation.  Would it not be a good idea to have a member from the tourist group and also a member from the boatmen's association as two extra members from Glengarriff on the harbour board?  I suggest that because in the event of a spillage the people who will not suffer the most but will suffer to a tremendous degree will be the people who derive their livelihood from tourists in the Glengarriff area.  I urge the Minister to take into account that Glengarriff at the moment are unrepresented.  If they have a representative it is purely accidental.  I want the Minister to consider specifically, say, somebody from the tourist association and somebody representing the boat owners.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The boatowners in the Glengarriff area.  There are a considerable number of them, and their livelihood is put very much in jeopardy in the event of any oil spillage because at least 70,000 tourists a year visit Garnish Island and the boatowners are concerned with the to-ing and fro-ing of those visitors.  It is important that representation be given to them.  Again, from the tourist point of view for the whole development of the area, somebody should be representing the tourist groups there.  I do not think there is anybody living in Glengarriff who does not derive some source, even probably a major source, of his or her livelihood from tourism. We know that there are certain flexibilities in the nominations of people, but it is in the interest generally of the proper working of the whole authority that this type of representation be brought to fruition.</P>

      <P>The Bill before the House amends the 1946 Act which lists the people who will be on the <Col N="1106" /> harbour commissioners and it will mean all we are doing here is adding to the list of the harbours under the Second Schedule of that Act the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners. We are not amending the whole Act as it gives administrative authority to commissioners throughout the country. Even if we did that we could not list particularly the Glengarriff tourist association or something like that. As the Deputy says, the county council have nominations, and I will have the nomination of three members to the board, one of whom must be of labour interest.  At this stage revamping the 1946 Act as regards membership of boards would lead to long delays in the implementation of this part of the Bill.  The best thing at the moment is to put in the Bantry Bay harbour authority and stick to the listed nomination powers and leave it to me.</P>

I have had long discussions with all the people involved and it is generally felt that the type of representation I am advocating is the most desirable and would be in the best interests of the harbour.  The chamber of commerce, if there is one there, will have two nominees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Shipowners among themselves elect two members.  There can be a canvass of shipowners.  The mechanics of this have not presented difficulties in other harbours.  The system has been generally acceptable to boat owners and we have not been getting complaints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister is talking this over with his officials will he discuss the point that fishermen as well as commercial shipowners should have representation?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  I have a motion down for the next county council meeting.  I do not know about the Minister's experience but we have become accustomed to the appointment of political hacks on such boards.  This <Col N="1108" /> is something we must protect ourselves against.  Some of the appointments in recent years have been disastrous.  They were appointed for no other reason than that they were political hacks.  I want assurance that no such people will be allowed to put pressure on the Minister in their own interest for membership on this board.  One other point is whether boat owners in Glengarriff would become liable for harbour dues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be up to the harbour commissioners but it has not been the custom of any harbour authority to charge dues.  However, boating and yachting have become so popular that harbour authorities may want to charge dues in respect of moorings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the harbour commissioners.  At this point I should like to say I do not know what Deputy Crowley meant when he spoke about political hacks.  I do not find anything to be ashamed of in being a politician.  Any appointment I have made to any board or authority has not been a political hack.  To give a blanket insult to these people, as Deputy Crowley did, because I presume he means the term &ldquo;political hack&rdquo; to be an insult, was wrong and he should withdraw his remarks.  Some of the finest people are nominated to various boards, including harbour boards.  For a Deputy to insult them all, as he intended to do, and infer that they were not competent to do their job&mdash;he used the words &ldquo;puppets on a string accepting their orders from elsewhere&rdquo;&mdash;is an allegation that they were in some way inferior, dishonest and were not using their own minds for the position for which they were nominated.  He inferred that they were carrying out the orders of some unnamed person at another level.  The Deputy should withdraw that remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is very naïve to think that there are not political hacks appointed by his colleagues, and maybe by himself, and he would be equally naïve to think that we would be so naïve as to think that all the men appointed on boards by the <Col N="1109" /> Coalition were put on them because they could do the job best of all.  We know well that the <i>sine qua non</i> of any appointment is membership of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to the Minister' subject in a moment.  As far as I am concerned I am not too worried about what goes on elsewhere; I am concerned about what happens in my constituency and about the proper development of Bantry.  I am concerned about the future of Bantry and I want to ensure that this is not turned into a political football. I want to ensure that those appointed to the board have a genuine interest in the development of the area and are not just political hacks. It is important that we get that on the record.  We are not so naïve as to think that all these appointments are on merit alone.  I am not withdrawing what I said.  In fact, I am reinforcing it from the point of view that I do not want a situation occurring in my constituency where there are these type of appointments.  I want men who are capable and interested enough to develop and create employment and industry.  I want men who are interested in creating conditions in west Cork for the development of the area.  It is because I am so concerned about Bantry, which is becoming a ghost town, that I want to ensure that the proper representation is insisted upon.  I want to ensure that those who are nominated have the proper qualifications, interest and heart in the place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister the reason for the hold up in establishing a harbour authority when Gulf came to Bantry? I should like to know why so many years elapsed before this Minister formed this authority?  Why was the authority not formed when we had a big revenue coming into Bantry through Gulf?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Crowley I should like to state that nobody will be debarred from being a member of Bantry Bay Harbour <Col N="1110" /> Commissioners because they are a member of my or any other political party.  If they are competent to do the job I do not care what party they belong to.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy O'Sullivan, I should like to state that the reason was there was only one user there at the time and Gulf were providing their own facilities.  The harbour had not an established harbour authority and, therefore, dues were not charged.  All the time Gulf said that if it was in the future found necessary to establish a harbour authority they would not object to this course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was any agreement made between Gulf and the Government at that time that a harbour authority would not be allowed in Bantry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No agreement was made with the Government at that time.  In fact, the previous Minister made it clear to Gulf that he reserved the right to himself at some future time to establish an authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>That kills the lie that was being put out by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and Deputy O'Sullivan, that there was some sort of agreement entered into by the last Government.  I hope the fact that he has heard from his own Minister that this was not so has killed the lie forever. I hope we will not hear this again thrown out at county council meetings in a most irresponsible fashion.  Any success that Bantry has had was due to a Fianna Fáil Government. No sort of veil of suspicion thrown out by Deputy O'Sullivan will take away from that.  He has tried it on several occasions and I am glad that the Minister for Transport and Power has the integrity, and the honesty, to say that publicly.</P>

As a member of Kinsale Harbour Commissioners I am aware that the major <Col N="1113" /> source of income to those commissioners is from yachting and I can see the reason for including them but I do not believe there is any yachting of any substance in Bantry.  I am talking about the people who would be bringing tourists to and fro from Garnish and they are concerned that their livelihood would be put in jeopardy by the imposition of dues.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Law Jurisdiction Bill, 1975 [Seanad]: Fifth Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The objectives of the Government in introducing this Bill which is now at its final Stage, are designed to punish crimes of violence and to ensure that the men who commit these crimes in Northern Ireland or in the Republic should have no refuge anywhere in the Republic.  These objectives my party and I totally support. Every person who lives on this island has an interest in seeing that the bombers, the gunmen and the assasins who have killed and maimed people in Northern Ireland, in the Republic and in Great Britain, who are trying to push the people of Northern Ireland towards civil war, and who have disgraced the people of Ireland in the eyes of the world, are brought to a halt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While supporting these objectives, we believe that what is contained in this Bill will not achieve those objectives. <Col N="1114" /> Every person who lives on this island fully understands that the Northern Ireland majority cannot and will not be bombed into a united Ireland and that the British people cannot be bombed into willing or supporting Irish unity.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately while this Bill was being discussed attempts were made to lead the public to believe that if this Bill was passed it would be a panacea for the ills that prevail in this country, that it would be a cure for violence both North and South, and that it would put to flight once and for all the men of violence.  Those of us in this party who honestly criticised the Bill&mdash;as we still do&mdash;were represented at times as giving solace to the men of violence.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We in this party treat with contempt the efforts of those who have tried to put the Fianna Fáil Party on the side of violence.</P>
    <P>We totally reject the charge that we deliberately delayed the passing of this Bill.  We have opposed the Bill on four grounds.  First, this Bill, which will be shortly leaving this House, will be politically disastrous in the sense that it will not help to bring peace in Northern Ireland or to promote reconciliation between the communities in Northern Ireland or between North and South.  Secondly, we have opposed the Bill because we believe it violates the Constitution of the Republic.  Thirdly, we have opposed it because we believe that this legislation, even if constitutionally valid, will not be practicable in its working, and even if it is, it will bring the criminal law of the Republic into contempt. Our fourth main objection to the Bill is that it will compromise our judicial system here in the South and thereby play into the hands of the men of violence who wish to disrupt the institutions of Government both North and South.</P>
    <P>We have often said in this House that violence in Northern Ireland should not be considered apart from the political causes which give rise to it.  Violence North and South is part of the price we all have to pay for the partition of our country.  It is our <Col N="1115" /> view that the only long term solution to the problems of violence North and South is to unite our people, Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter, in mutual trust and understanding.  We fully realise that such unity will take a long time to achieve and that in the interval we must do all we can to heal the wounds of the past frightful years and to restore peace to the people of Northern Ireland, to the people of all Ireland.  If we believed that this Bill would help to reconcile the communities in Northern Ireland or to promote goodwill and understanding among them then we would certainly have given it our support.  However, this Bill in its practical working will not promote peace and understanding in Northern Ireland.  It will be divisive in the worst possible sense.  It will divide North from South; it will divide the majority from the minority in Northern Ireland; it will divide the minority in Northern Ireland from the people of the Republic; and it will divide the people of the Republic.</P>
    <P>This Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill has to be seen in the context of policy towards Northern Ireland.  This Bill is part of the Sunningdale package negotiated in 1973, but unfortunately we must look at the different situation that exists now from that of the time of the Sunningdale package in 1973.  Sunningdale failed.  The power-sharing Executive is gone, blackmailed by the workers' strike.  We have seen since then the restoration of the old hard line Unionist stance which brought down the Executive at the time.  We supported Sunningdale because we believed it attempted to reconcile the conflicting aspirations of the various communities in Northern Ireland.  We believed Sunningdale offered partnership between the communities in Northern Ireland and that that partnership between North and South offered a guarantee of civil rights to every man and woman living on this island irrespective of political or religious convictions.  If these principles had been realised in effective political institutions I believe that would have laid the foundations of peace and prosperity of a kind which the people <Col N="1116" /> living on this island have not known in their tragic history.  Unfortunately, the power-sharing Executive in Northern Ireland has been destroyed, the Council of Ireland has not been established and the reforms promised in Sunningdale have not been carried through.  The Convention is now at an end and that in itself is sad.</P>
    <P>This Bill must be regarded as unconstitutional, unworkable and divisive.  It is a negative response from this Coalition Government in that it will do nothing to speed the day of reconciliation or lead to even a temporary solution.  In my opinion, it only widens the vacuum created by the failure of political progress.  It is now generally accepted, even by the Unionists, that the British have no desire for continued involvement in Irish affairs but find themselves trapped by the negative guarantees contained in British legislation about there being no change in the Northern Ireland situation unless the majority wish it.</P>
    <P>This might appear to be in accord with the tenets of democracy, but, given the history of majority rule in the North, we know that the ordinary tenets of democracy cannot be applied there.  Either way this guarantee only makes the intransigent more intransigent. When the British declare their interest in uniting the people, then I believe the intransigence will begin to disappear from the Irish scene.  It will be only then that discussions can commence on how we can move towards institutions and systems within which everyone on this island can work to our mutual advantage. We have not prescribed a formula nor have we set a time limit for this process. We envisage that our interim and intermediate positions will have to be negotiated.  The entire process should be engaged in against a background of peace and we should try to establish a means of ensuring and enforcing peace throughout the island.</P>
    <P>Recently we heard the Coalition boast of their commitment to law and order as if that is their only justification for three years in office.  There can be no doubt that a policy of law and <Col N="1117" /> order is one which any democratic Government are bound to follow. When the Taoiseach says: &ldquo;We do not bargain at the point of a gun&rdquo; he is merely asserting that the Coalition are prepared to do what they are morally bound to do under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The point must be made that a policy of law and order does not constitute a Northern policy.  Relying on it solely means either total abandonment of any concern for the Northern minority or abject surrender to undemocratic elements who for two years have been allowed to frustrate the wishes of the democratic majority.  If this Government have abandoned their commitment to Irish unity, they should have the courage to admit it now or accept the judgment of history on their failure to act.</P>
    <P>Sunningdale gave birth to the idea of a common law enforcement area.  I understand this to mean a situation on this island where every single person, Catholic or Protestant, Nationalist or Unionist, living in West Belfast or West Kerry, will be guaranteed the same basic civil and religious rights.  It envisaged that the European Convention on Human Rights should be made a part of the domestic law in Northern Ireland and the Republic.  It also envisaged that the police forces in the North and the Republic would operate under the same basic control and that violence and injustices which gave rise to it would be eliminated side by side.</P>
    <P>The concept of the common law enforcement area also envisaged the closest possible co-operation between the police forces in the North and the Republic, bringing to justice perpetrators of outrages both North and South. This total trust and co-operation between the two police forces could only take place, without either force being compromised, if all the citizens in Ireland had the same civil rights and all policemen were subject to the same control.  Unfortunately, that is not so.</P>
    <P>Many people, including elected representatives of the minority in the North, do not have confidence in the police force and Special Branch operating in that part of the country.  Until such time as they have, it is likely that, <Col N="1118" /> despite the fact that all the people who live on the island have a common interest in maintaining peace, and that we want time on our side, representatives of all communities should sit down together and devise institutions which will eliminate violence and guarantee peace and justice to every person.  We are still not in a situation where this can happen because of lack of trust in sections of the police force in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with the parts of the Bill which, in my view, are unconstitutional. The Long Title reads:</P>
    <P>An Act to extend the criminal law of the State to certain acts done in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Article 3 of the Constitution effectively limits the extent of laws passed by the Oireachtas.  It says:</P>
    <P>Pending the re-integration of the national territory...laws enacted by that Parliament shall have the like area and extent of application as the laws of Saorstát Éireann and the like extra-territorial effect.</P>
    <P>The question must now be asked: have laws enacted by the Oireachtas the same extent of application as is contemplated by this Bill, or the same extra-territorial effect?  I believe in both cases the answer must be no.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, if and when it becomes law, it appears to be contemplated that persons charged in the Republic with offences committed in Northern Ireland will be brought before the Special Criminal Court.  I believe this is thrusting on that court a job it was never designed to do. Article 38.3.1º of the Constitution provides:</P>
    <P>Special courts may be established by law for the trial of offences in cases where it may be determined in accordance with such law that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order.</P>
    <P>I take this to mean that the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order will be in the areas to which laws <Col N="1119" /> enacted by the Oireachtas are confined, that is, the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
    <P>When dealing with arguments put forward by speakers from this side of the House on the constitutionality of this Bill, the Minister is on record as saying that he is quite prepared to have it tested in the Supreme Court for constitutionality.  If this Bill is enacted, I hope it will be immediately referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution for an opinion as to whether it is repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>This Bill will have a very serious effect on people's respect for the criminal law of the country.  The system of trial by jury is a fundamental part of our criminal law.  Violence forced the last Fianna Fáil Government reluctantly to re-establish the Special Criminal Court and to make evidence such as the opinions of police superintendents acceptable in certain circumstances when we enacted the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972.  I do not wish to be controversial at this late stage but I might be forgiven for saying that it is ironic when we remember the antics of the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the present Minister for Justice during that debate, I am certain that the extremes of language they used at that time must be quite an embarrassment to them now.  Certainly, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who persisted in his opposition to the Act at that time pledged that the next Government would repeal it.  The Act is still there and the Government find nothing obnoxious in it.  The procedures in respect of the Special Criminal Court are the same as in other criminal courts.  The accused is present throughout the hearing; he is entitled to be represented by solicitor and counsel and to challenge witnesses for the prosecution by cross-examination and to give evidence himself.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of this Bill contemplates that in certain circumstances evidence may be taken in Northern Ireland for a criminal trial in this State.  If an accused person is charged in the State with an offence committed in <Col N="1120" /> Northern Ireland all the witnesses, except witnesses as regards procedural matters, will be in Northern Ireland. In many cases, therefore, virtually all the evidence will be taken in Northern Ireland under procedures and rules of evidence which differ from those in the Republic.  The accused will have the right to go to Northern Ireland and to be there in the custody of the police force there while evidence against him is being taken. It is unlikely that an accused person charged with a crime of violence committed in Northern Ireland or having escaped from lawful custody in Northern Ireland will voluntarily go there and place himself in the hands of authorities from which he may have escaped.  He is given this questionable &ldquo;right&rdquo; to attend for the taking of evidence on commission in the North provided he gives himself into the custody of the Northern police.  A right would appear to be conferred and then made impossible of exercise. Would it be better not to confer the right at all when it is impossible to exercise it, because the failure of an accused to do so may lead to the comment that he had his chance and did not use it?</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, it appears that in many cases all the vital evidence in the case will be taken in the absence of the accused.  I suggest that this is a travesty of what our people have come to regard as a fair criminal trial.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is enacted I believe it will have the effect of reducing respect for criminal law and in strengthening the hands of those who want to bring all institutions of Government in the Republic and Northern Ireland into contempt.  It is a very serious matter to trifle with the people's respect for the criminal law of the State.  I regard the Bill and what it contains as a danger to our legal institutions.  We are fortunate here in having courts in which the judges rightly command the respect and confidence of the people.  If this Bill becomes operational, I believe the judges of the Irish Republic will be placed in a very compromising position.  They will be invited to act on the evidence of police <Col N="1121" /> officers over whose activities they have no control.  They will be obliged to accept evidence procured by methods over which they have no power of investigation or control.  Moreover, while the police force in Northern Ireland remains as it is, unreformed, and while the harassment of the minority population there continues, judges from the Republic arriving in Northern Ireland for the purposes of section 2 of this Bill will be placed in a very awkward position.  They will have no powers to exercise in the courts in Northern Ireland.  They can only sit in silence and watch while the taking of evidence is conducted by another judge, perhaps in the absence of the accused.  Surely, the attitude of the minority in Northern Ireland will be influenced if judges from the Republic appear to be helping to enforce the Queen's writ in Northern Ireland acting on the evidence of an unreformed police force and Special Branch.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill will place the judges from the Irish Republic in an impossible situation.  They have been called on to act in a way the Constitution never contemplated and they will be exposed to the sneers and hostile propaganda of those who wish to discredit all institutions of Government, North and South.</P>
    <P>These are the reasons why if the Bill is enacted and put into operation it will certainly have disastrous effects for all concerned with upholding respect for legal institutions in the North and South.  The Bill has been described as trivial and superficial in relation to the nature of the problem with which we are confronted, the restoration of peace based on justice and respect for diverse aspirations in the North.  Respect for the combined aspirations of the different sections in the North will require a more fundamental reappraisal of our political and legal institutions than is contemplated by this Bill.  Such reappraisal will have to take account not only of the aspirations of the people living in the North but also of the almost insuperable practical difficulties such as that of patrolling the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Collins I thought I should intervene to draw the attention of the House to four or five points in regard to this Bill.  In the latter part of his speech Deputy Collins came back to the theme which was announced, as on a solo instrument, by the Leader of his party on the first day of the debate on the Second Stage of this Bill.  That theme was that the Bill was unconstitutional. If the Bill is referred by the President to the Supreme Court we shall have a decision by the Supreme Court on that point in due course, and anybody in this House is taking a great risk by being too definite on the point one way or another&mdash;or indeed on any legal point.  One can only take the best advice available and do the best one can with it.  I recall the Leader of the Opposition expressing his views on the Bill's constitutionality with great care and at great length.  The following day the Attorney General replied to him and in the course of a fairly short speech utterly demolished each and every point Deputy Lynch had made the previous day.</P>
      <P>I say &ldquo;demolished&rdquo; but that is only my opinion.  I read both speeches and I have absolutely no doubt that if there were no other argument than the arguments to be seen arising from both those speeches the score would be Attorney General, one, Deputy Lynch, nil.  So far as I could judge, not one of the arguments he put up was left in any condition but that of being in shreds by the time the Attorney General sat down.  Signs on it, from that day to this not a peep was heard from the Opposition about the alleged unconstitutionality of this Bill.  It may occasionally have cropped up during the Committee Stage but certainly during the remainder of the Second Stage debate it was never again alleged by the Opposition.  It could not have been alleged by them after the Attorney General's devastating reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Deputy Collins naturally must make his case as best he can, I want to draw the attention of the House, the Press and anyone else who watches the proceedings of the House to this fact.  Before they run away with the <Col N="1123" /> idea that this hare has again been revived and has got a new lease of life from somewhere&mdash;it has not, the only new life in it is what has been breathed into it in the last 15 minutes by Deputy Collins&mdash;not a word was heard on this theme since some time before Christmas when the Attorney General delivered a devastating reply to the allegations of a legal and constitutional kind made the previous day by Deputy Lynch.  That is not to say that I would bet every penny I have on the Bill surviving scrutiny by the Supreme Court. No one can foresee what may emerge in the course of argument.  It is possible that this Bill, like many other Bills, either in the shape of a Bill under Article 26 or subsequently in the shape of an Act, will be found to contain some infirmity of a consitutional kind which this House has not spotted.  I would be very surprised if that should happen, if the Bill should be shot down on any of the bases advanced by Deputy Lynch and so effectively dealt with the following day by the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The second important leg of Deputy Collins's argument was that the Bill was wide open to abuse.  He was afraid that we could not trust northern institutions, whether of a judicial kind or a police kind, that they were open to abuse, that rights which the Bill purported to confer would turn out not to be rights at all or, indeed, would expose accused persons to serious danger.  The reply I make to that is one which has been repeatedly made by the Minister and other speakers during the Second Stage debate.  It is that, tacitly built into this Bill, but as clear in the Bill as though it were written in black and white there, is a condition.  That condition is one of good faith.</P>
    <P>I do not need to tell the House what my feelings are about murderers, bombers, knee-cappers, kidnappers and intimidators.  While the House knows my feelings perfectly well about these things I will not stand over this Bill when it becomes law if it leads to any of the situations outlined by Deputy Collins.  I would share his apprehensions about and his <Col N="1124" /> condemnation of this Bill, when it becomes an Act, if it turns out to work like this.  I, for one, would be in favour of not operating the Act any longer.  The first accused person, witness, judge or anybody else who is put in peril or who is not treated with the most scrupulous good faith once he crosses the Border will be sufficient for me to suspend any further co-operation on foot of this Bill.  I said that before on the Second Stage.  I want to say it now and repeat that so far as I know that would be the attitude, not only of the Government but of all the Government supporters as well, who in the case of this Bill I believe comprise about 80 per cent of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I do not need to be told about the RUC, about the authorities in the North or the kind of regime which ran there for 50 years and which, although nothing can excuse barbarism, ultimately provided the soil in which the horrors of the last seven years grew.  I have no illusions about them whatsoever.  I have eyes in my head.  I was able to see what happened in 1968 when the RUC savagely beat up perfectly innocent and peaceful civil rights demonstrators, when the police were involved in the death of an innocent man in his own house, when they went riot with their auxiliaries through Belfast and killed children in their cots.  There was not a sign of the IRA in those days.  I have no illusions about the people who were then in the saddle, who allowed those things to happen, who stood over them and did their damnedest to prevent them ever being brought to light.  I have no illusions whatsoever about them; but if we are ever to have peace in this country we will have to make a start somewhere. We will have to make a gesture of even conditional or provisional confidence some time, even towards the people who have given us offence, even towards the people who have given us ample reason not to trust them.</P>
    <P>We will have to do that sooner or later and I believe this Bill offers that kind of opportunity.  I am only pushing the hand a few inches across the Border.  Once that hand is bitten <Col N="1125" /> I will withdraw it very fast.  I am speaking for myself but I believe I speak for the Government in saying that.  I would push it that distance across and hope for the best, hope that maybe God will take pity on this country and that for once something will get off the ground, for once we will have co-operation, for once there will be good faith and decency in dealing with one another and for once we will be able to say: &ldquo;We made a gesture which was not emotionally easy.  We made it in the teeth of opposition which was politically difficult for us and it worked.  The country is a more peaceful one and a less violent one in consequence.&rdquo; That would be my hope. If we ever despair about the success of gestures of this kind we can throw our hats at a decent future for ourselves, our children or their children.</P>
    <P>I know it is not in order to make lengthy quotations, but on 12th January Mr. Bob Cooper, one of the founder members of the Alliance Party in the North, the deputy leader of that party, published an article in <i>The Irish Press</i> about this Bill.  While I do not want to fall foul of the House's order I have to recommend every word of that article to the Members of this House.  Mr. Cooper is not a Nationalist.  I differ from him straightaway on that point.  So far as I know he is Protestant by faith.  I suppose in a general sense he could be described as &ldquo;unionist&rdquo; with a small &ldquo;u&rdquo; because his belief is that the welfare of the six counties of Northern Ireland is best assured inside the United Kingdom.  I differ with him on that point as well.  Every word he has written about this Bill deserves to be studied by Members of this House. I have very often found reason to criticise <i>The Irish Press</i> and I have not much regard for some of its aspects and some of its doings but I salute <i>The Irish Press</i> for taking the trouble to get this point of view from Mr. Cooper and for printing it in reasonable prominence.</P>
    <P>The leg on which he rests his case is that reconciliation is not a soft, easy option.  He says: &ldquo;It hurts and, unless it hurts, it is useless.&rdquo; He develops <Col N="1126" /> that theme by reference to Sunningdale and by reference to what we thought we were getting out of Sunningdale.  From the perspective of his people&mdash;they are the ones we are talking about, they are the ones we must shake hands with if we are ever to have peace in this country&mdash;it did not look like that at all.  They saw Sunningdale as a situation in which nothing hurt us, in which we were only getting benefit from it, in which our susceptibilities, ambitions and aspirations were being flattered, in which we were conceding absolutely nothing to anybody.</P>
    <P>I have to confess, like nearly everybody else in the country, I was thrilled out of my wits by Sunningdale.  I can remember very well the euphoria when the Taoiseach and his team came back and how delighted and thrilled every thinking person in the country was.  We were a bit premature in expressing that delight because it was very seriously misinterpreted in the North as being a kind of premature triumphalism.  Our delight at getting what looked like a Council of Ireland, even though a non-executive one, was seen in the North as being wild cheering from the South because the first of the bricks constituting the Border had been pulled away.  That is how it was seen.  I am sorry it was seen like that.  In retrospect, I believe that perhaps we looked for too much and we were too obviously delighted by what we got.  That is all water under the bridge now, but Mr. Cooper's point, which is a solid and valid one, is that a concession is not worth a damn unless it hurts the person who is making it.  A concession which does not cost you twopence is not worth having from the point of view of the person you are making it to.  The concession which he expects of us, and which he sees in this Bill, is something which is tough for us to do.  Just how tough was seen from the mouths of the Opposition when speaking here&mdash;I do not question their sincerity about this&mdash;over the last few months.  I do not like the idea of sending an accused person, little though the regard might be in which I hold his political associations, across <Col N="1127" /> to a police force in which I have no reason to have confidence.  I do not like that idea at all.  If that police force or those courts once behave with bad faith towards an accused person, a witness or a judge from the Republic that as far as I am concerned, would be the end of this Bill.</P>
    <P>But I think that idea will make an impression on the North, that it will be seen as something which is not all that easy to do and something for which we are not getting very much in return.  It is something which will not afford us any opportunity for waving the flag or clapping ourselves on the backs and, certainly, there will be no votes for us if the Bill goes wrong.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cooper says:</P>
    <P>I know that the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill poses genuine difficulties for many people in the South.  I know that it asks them to sacrifice many preconceived notions.  I know that for many of them, it is extremely difficult to accept the degree of co-operation with the police and the institutions of government in the North which is necessary if the Bill is to be implemented.  But I also know that unless there is an acceptance in the South that reconciliation hurts, then all the pious statements from Southern politicians about reconciliation are just that&mdash;pious statements.</P>
    <P>He goes on to refer to the late Mr. de Valera and I trust the gentlemen on the other side will take this reference to heart.  I quote:</P>
    <P>There is an old Irish tradition that when your neighbour is in trouble you gather round and help him out.  You don't ask whether he is an Orangeman or a Catholic. You don't remember past disagreements. You don't try and capitalise on his difficulties or take pleasure from seeing him suffer.</P>
    <P>It was a fulfilment of that tradition when in 1941, during the German blitz on Belfast, de Valera ordered Southern fire brigades up North to put out the fires.  He did <Col N="1128" /> not wonder whether his action would infringe his neutrality.  He did not haggle about terms.  He did what was right and that single action probably had a greater effect on reconciliation between North and South than any speech he ever made.</P>
    <P>I say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to that.  Although my judgment of the late Mr. de Valera is that he did this country infinitely more harm than good, I have to say that there were some shining points in his career, and that instance I have quoted was one of them.  I believe it was responsible for an enormous amount of good in regard to north-south relations.  It was a gesture which is remembered to this day, 35 years later, although there was no legal necessity for it.  Indeed, the legality of it was questionable in terms of whether it compromised our neutrality; but Mr. de Valera took that action because it was a decent and a neighbourly thing to do.  Mr. Cooper continued:</P>
    <P>....But the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill is the equivalent today of the Dundalk Fire Brigade.</P>
    <P>That is not my comparison but is the figure of speech of a Unionist, of a man who is different in faith and in political outlook and tradition from most of the people in this State but it is enough to prompt me to stretch my hand across the Border and find out whether I will find the hand of a decent and upright person on the other side and if I fail I will withdraw my hand and think again.  I recommend that other Members of the House should look at the situation in this way too.</P>
    <P>Regarding the technique which this Bill incorporates, although it is novel and unusual, it is only three weeks since I read that the German Foreign Minister Dr. Genscher who is leader of the liberal party there, said in the course of a speech about terrorism that he saw the time coming when all civilised countries would have to have legislation of a kind different from that to which they have been accustomed.  As an instance of the kind of legislation he had in mind for <Col N="1129" /> dealing with the terrorists who crossed boundaries, he gave legislation which would permit a State to try somebody alleged to be such a person where found, irrespective of where the offence was alleged to have been committed.  Admittedly, he did not instance the Irish Bill, but his opinion was that we were moving in Europe generally to a point where legislation such as that before us would be the order of the day.  I do not believe in looking over one's shoulder to see what the others are doing and only to take inspiration from them but these are the views of a man of considerable importance in Europe and in what is the largest and most powerful State in the EEC&mdash; there are some who say it is the pivot on which the Community rests.  However, I recall that on the Second Stage&mdash;that was before Dr. Genscher had spoken in those terms&mdash;I felt that we were moving into an era in which legislation like this, broadly speaking, would become more general throughout Europe and other parts of the civilised world.  I am not saying that what I said on that occasion has been taken up elsewhere but the same thought has been expressed by a man of infinitely greater importance and experience and who, on his own territory, has a very serious problem &mdash;not the same as we have&mdash;but the very serious problem of terrorism, not only of the native German kind but of other nationalities who play out their antagonisms on German soil.</P>
    <P>The leopard does not change his spots.  I am sorry to note that it is still the old Fianna Fáil we are dealing with.  At the point at which I first heard Deputy Collins today he was condemning any idea of allowing the Northern majority to decide for themselves the question of whether the country was to remain divided.  That is a valid point of view.  It is the original fundamentalist republican point of view that this Parliament is illegitimate, that the Northern Parliament was illegitimate, that any form of rule except that which can be traced directly to the 1916 Rising is illegitimate and that any partition or trucking with boundaries carried on <Col N="1130" /> since then or any diminution of sovereignty agreed to since then is equally illegitimate and traitorous. That is the old fundamentalist point of view.  It is a free country and Deputy Collins is entitled to subscribe to that point of view, but I must remind him that it is a view that is contrary to what his own leader said as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Repeatedly, Deputy Lynch said&mdash; and acquiesced in a vote to this effect here on two occasions&mdash;that what his party sought was unity by consent. How can one talk about unity in one breath and with the next breath deny the right of a local majority?  We know all the arguments about the illegitimacy of the boundary but it is something that has been there since before any of the people sitting opposite me now was born.  That point of view is not reconcilable with the other.  Neither the Minister for Justice nor I is worried about ambivalences in the Fianna Fáil point of view, but very lately Fianna Fáil were Government and they may be Government again.  But what is Mr. Cooper or anyone else to think of a party which, through the mouth of their Leader, say they will only seek unity by consent when in the very next breath, through the mouth of their Justice spokesman, they say they deny the right of a local majority to decide their future?  If I were a Northern Unionist I would not know what to make of Fianna Fáil.  A theologian would be required to make anything of what they say, and he would need to be a pretty dodgy theologian at that; but Fianna Fáil have sprouted some of those in their time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins said that law and order was not a sufficient policy in so far as the North is concerned.  I agree that it is not a Northern policy. I agree, too, with the point taken by his leader, that the Government are not entitled to consider their obligations fulfilled merely because they discharge their first duty which is to maintain law and order but at least this Government have done that, if nothing else.  While I agree that in itself law and order does not represent Northern policy it is a precondition <Col N="1131" /> of a Northern policy.  No Northern policy will make sense to the people in the North in its absence and, if this country is delivered up here in the South to the gentlemen with the black berets and black glasses and sour visages, no talk about unity by consent, or any other kind of unity, will cut any ice with the people in the North.  Law and order is not a Northern policy but there can be no Northern policy with a chance of success in its absence and I think this is the short answer to those who talk about law and order being the duty of the Government and not subject to a northern policy.</P>
    <P>I noticed only two weeks ago the Taoiseach said&mdash;we were a long time waiting for Fianna Fáil to say anything of the kind though I do not take credit from any of the gentlemen on the front bench who had, generally speaking, their hearts in the right places in regard to the North&mdash; on 20th February that this Government would support whatever regime emerged from a free consensus in the North.  Whatever regime they fixed amongst themselves that will satisfy both sides will be all right with us and we will let national aspirations take a back seat for a while as being of less importance than the rights of the ordinary people to live their lives without fear of being blown to smithereens.</P>
    <P>That statement by the Taoiseach was applauded by both sides in the North and yesterday Mr. Craig&mdash;I know he has a sinister past but many people have sinister pasts&mdash;said that that speech by the Taoiseach had given great encouragement to all sides in the North.  When were words like that ever used by a Unionist politician about anything coming from Fianna Fáil in or out of office?  Never.  I am firmly of the belief that the attitude, approach, policy and discharge of duty so essential in regard to Northern Ireland by this Government have been&mdash;not impeccable, because no human institution is impeccable; I am sure mistakes have been made&mdash;but have been the nearest thing to following the line I would imagine or see 15 men put into <Col N="1132" /> effect and I think the Government are entitled to reject and make very short work of criticisms along the lines we heard a moment ago from Deputy Collins.  I hope this Bill will work and I hope it will work well and, when it is seen to work well, I hope we will look back on this long and in parts fairly acrimonious debate as something that had to be got through and something from which it will be clearly seen who was right and who was wrong.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary does manage to engender a considerable amount of emotion.  He wanders into many fields.  I should like now to take up one point with him.  He spoke about Deputy Collins's remark as to the alleged constitutionality of this Bill and he implied that nobody had said anything about that since Deputy Lynch raised the matter on the Second Reading.  He also implied that the Attorney General had expressed a viewpoint and, because he had done so and presumably because it was a viewpoint as a result of advice, we should all accept that and shut up.  I would like to assure the Parliamentary Secretary that I was advised by some pretty substantial constitutional lawyers and I suppose so were other members of my party.  I am not a lawyer and I took the advice I was given on trust and that advice was that this Bill is unconstitutional in all probability under two Articles of the Constitution.  The fact that the Attorney General expressed a viewpoint is no reason why the Opposition should automatically accept what he says.  I do not know whether I spoke before or after the Attorney General's intervention but I believe the same matter was mentioned on at least a few occasions during the Committee Stage debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the Parliamentary Secretary has wandered into many fields and, if one were to take up all the points he made and reply to them, one would be here indefinitely and this debate would drag on indefinitely.  As I see it, this Bill is not a satisfactory means of achieving the purpose, which is a good purpose, intended.  I expressed this view before and nobody has convinced me so far to the contrary. The Bill appears to be unworkable <Col N="1133" /> and, on advice, unconstitutional.  I am in total agreement with the underlying purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Very many years ago I came to the conclusion that violence is not a means by which good political objectives can be achieved here.  Long before the present spate of violence commenced I expressed the view in public that force could not in my opinion achieve the purposes intended. In fact, the opposite reaction would in all probability be the result of efforts to achieve unity through violence.  I also expressed the view that the use of such methods was contrary to the ideals of earlier generations during a time when there was no national authority here and they asserted the right of Ireland against foreign control of and influence in Irish affairs.</P>
    <P>This Bill is now in its final Stage in exactly the same condition as it was when it was introduced.  Not one word has been changed.  Instead of being negative or obstructive we met the Bill by proposing a reasoned and reasonable amendment.  We did so because we believe we should not concur in what was involved, namely, involving our institutions with the Northern security forces and institutions, institutions which are not acceptable to many people in that area and which are not likely to have the support of the minority community so long as there is no political agreement in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I understand what the Parliamentary Secretary has been talking about. There is a problem and the problem lies not in the North but with other people across the water.  Britain has so far failed to find agreement on a political Executive because the Northern community is so sharply divided that one section at least is not willing to find a common interest in providing political stability, not even for itself, and it is in that situation we are being asked to involve ourselves. It is quite obvious that if there were political agreement in the North there would be little objection to this Bill. Indeed the Bill would probably not be necessary.  It is because of the objection <Col N="1134" /> we have that we put forward a reasoned amendment calling for a court for the entire island.  I explained before that the reason for such a court lay in the difference between partiality and impartiality and the way people felt about these things and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will understand what I am talking about when I talk about people.  You cannot make people trust security authorities who are not under your control.  The Government here cannot do that and the Opposition cannot do it.  I can understand the emotional way in which the Parliamentary Secretary has been talking about the horrors of the last seven years and I agree with him, but I would ask him to reflect on what his situation would be if he were living in that area and was being asked by an Irish Government to trust people he just cannot trust.  One can go a little bit too far.</P>
    <P>In failing to get agreement by raising an amendment, we then put down only a couple of amendments aimed at trying to build into this Bill an element of human rights and also a time limit.  These were not agreed to by the Government.  I have said that there is a lack of confidence in the northern security forces and that neither the Minister nor the Irish Government can make people outside this jurisdiction trust security forces over which neither we nor our courts have any control, or for whose actions the Minister cannot take responsibility. I have already said that much of the case against this Bill rests on the partiality, as distinct from the impartiality, of the security forces as seen by those against whom the Bill may be operated.</P>
    <P>It is because of that situation that we put forward the amendment in relation to a court for the entire island, because such a court would be seen to be impartial and the security forces would have to report to that court.  As I said, the Minister refused all amendments.  It appears that the form of this Bill was agreed to beforehand and that the Minister's hands must have been tied.  It also seems that the Minister and the Government <Col N="1135" /> did not give much time to the practicalities of the situation; that the aim was to produce a Bill of this kind.  Certainly, I heard nothing about the idea of a north/south court, and I think I put the question earlier: who was opposed to it?  Was Britain opposed to it or was it merely the intransigent element who are holding up this island and are literally blackmailing all the people who live on this island?  If that is the case then the responsibility is Britain's.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to speak at length. Deputy Collins, over a fairly lengthy speech, has covered any other points that I would wish to have made.  All I can say to the Minister is, first of all, we have not tried to obstruct this Bill.  I do not think that we have overtalked ourselves but the experience has been a thoroughly unsatisfactory one for me.</P>

      <P>We are at the final stage of a very long debate, both in this House and in the other House, a debate which has had many facets about it which have given rise to many emotions and many strange utterances and unusual ideas.  The first time the Bill was debated in this House on the motion to withdraw it with a view to introducing it in the Seanad, I recall the atmosphere of great tension and very high emotions with charges of sell-out being made from the other benches.  I could not understand or appreciate the depth of feeling which this Bill was arousing.  I could not understand it at that time, but it became clearer to me as the debate went on in the Seanad particularly, and in a more muted fashion in this House subsequently.  However, the Bill did go to the Seanad and the approach there was very definitely one of obstruction, not just opposition but obstruction.  Having regard to the emotional feeling which the Opposition appeared to have then, that was not so surprising.  They felt that the only way in which they could satisfy their feelings about this Bill was to obstruct it to the most extreme degree possible.  We had filibustering <Col N="1136" /> speeches in the Seanad, again repeating this theme that in some way this Bill was a sell-out and a betrayal.  I could never understand who was being sold out or who was being betrayed.  I could not reconcile these strong emotions with what was in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes to deal with something which everybody recognises to be a scandal, the problem of the fugitive offender escaping the consequences of his activities and bringing, in turn, further consequences inimical and damaging to this country, damaging to its future, because it damages the trust, or rather it prevents the creation of trust, between the two parts of the island.  It also brings with it a grave suspicion on the part of the majority in the North that deep down in the South there is sympathy for these offenders.  That brings with it the real danger of bombs in the South.  This is a consequence of the existence of fugitive offenders, so horrible, so terrible, that I was frankly puzzled by the emotional depth of the Opposition to a Bill designed to end that dreadful thing as far as this part of the island was concerned.  At that stage of the debate it seems that the Opposition were not prepared to accept the idea that this Parliament and the institutions of this Republic should be used against terrorist activities committed outside its boundaries.  This is the reason for that emotional early opposition and this is the reason behind the accusations of sell-out which were made here, principally by Deputy de Valera.  Somehow the Opposition were not ready for the using of the institutions of this State against terrorism committed in Northern Ireland.  As the debate went on, and as the actual operation of the Bill was spelled out, the novel features of the Bill became more acceptable to the members of the Opposition.  Certainly, the high degree of emotional objections which were made here when the Bill was being transferred to the other House and were made at very considerable length indeed in the Seanad, became muted and, happily, largely disappeared from the debate.  If the debate has done nothing more than make all the people <Col N="1137" /> of the Republic realise that they have a duty to allow their institutions to be used in the combating of terrorism in Northern Ireland, then it has done an immense amount of good.  I would hope that the ideas advanced by Deputy Kelly in his contribution a short while ago would begin to find a greater acceptance, and that there would be a greater awareness of them, and that with a greater acceptance and a greater awareness of them a whole new climate would grow on this island, a climate that would lead to not just the tipping of fingertips across the Border, as he elegantly phrased it, but to their being firm handshakes and embracing between the two divided parts. Of course none of that can be achieved until there is trust.  Deputy Kelly said, quoting from the statement of Mr. Bob Cooper, a well-known politician in the North of unionist persuasion, that that cannot be until such time as there are some concessions made towards a reconciliation. I have to repeat that idea; that this Bill must be seen as a concession towards reconciliation, a concession by us here, legislating for things we are not completely happy about, but nevertheless we think we must do it in order to achieve a greater good. That is the proper spirit in which to approach this Bill.  If the debate winds up with that idea being floated out of this debate the whole exercise has been worth while.</P>
    <P>This is a terribly important Bill.  If it works&mdash;and I hope it will&mdash;it will have a significant beneficial effect for the future of this island.  It will be a positive indication to the majority in the North&mdash;and they are the people with whom we have to be reconciled &mdash;that we are anxious to assist positively and actively in ending the evil of terrorism which besets them.  It will change the climate in the island. It was criticised as being divisive.  On the contrary this Bill will, because of its cross-Border dimension and the fact that it is going to have to be operated extra-territorially, have a unifying effect in the sense that it will bring the two parts of the island together in its operations.  That is good, that this idea of the fingertips touching for mutual benefit will be enhanced <Col N="1138" /> by this Bill and expanded and increased.  Far from being divisive, it will have a unifying effect because it will introduce a cross-Border dimension, and this I think is desirable.</P>
    <P>There has been too much dichotomy on this island.  We want to move towards each other, and this Bill gives an opportunity for such a movement. I do not see how it can divide the majority from the minority in the North, as was suggested, because it is aimed at dealing with the common enemy, the terrorist.  He is an enemy of both the majority and minority communities.  I do not see how it can divide North from South, because this same terrorism is the common enemy of both.  I do not see why it should divide people in the South from each other, because again it is aimed at ending a scandal which is bringing all the people of the South into disrepute, so I cannot see any logic in the argument that it is divisive.</P>
    <P>I would not be unfair in saying that there were no arguments put forward to sustain the proposition that it was divisive.  Allegations of divisiveness were made but no arguments to sustain those allegations.  An allegation is only as strong as the argument that supports it.  On the contrary, because of its cross-Border dimension, because it is going to bring the two jurisdictions into closer contact with each other in an attempt to deal with a major problem on this island, it is going to have a unifying effect, to break down barriers and antagonisms. It is going to be a significant contribution to the process of the two sides getting to know each other and to trust each other.  It is very important from that point of view.</P>
    <P>Its constitutionality was called into question from the moment it was born.  I felt that, having being called into question, that argument then had to be continued and sustained and reasons to support that allegation had to be found.  I felt all along that there was no great heart on the part of the Opposition in alleging unconstitutionality against this Bill.  It is novel.  That does not necessarily mean it is invalid. It is without precedent in common law jurisdictions, but neither <Col N="1139" /> does that necessarily mean it is invalid or unconstitutional.  I think there was a misunderstanding of the nature of the principle of extra-territoriality and this possibly contributed to a feeling that it could not be constitutional, that there must be something wrong about it in that regard. That initial, possibly facile, reaction brought with it an obligation to try to construct arguments to support it.  However, the debate has been useful in that these arguments have been put forward and substantially rebutted.  As Deputy Kelly said, one cannot be 100 per cent proof certain that one's view on the constitutionality of any measure will be absolutely correct.  We all have to wait on the decision of the courts to decide finally that point.  Should the matter go for decision in the courts I would be happy&mdash;and again one takes a risk in putting forward such a point of view&mdash;to await the outcome of such adjudication&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;happy in the sense that I would not fear the adjudication. If people who are interested in this aspect of it read the debate carefully, and read the contribution of Deputy Lynch, who made the main anti-constitutional argument, if I may put it that way, and the reply from the Attorney General, who defended the Bill's constitutionality, I think a disinterested observer would come to the conclusion that this Bill appears to be constitutional. However, we will await final adjudication. How that takes place is something we in this House cannot decide on.  It is a prerogative that lies elsewhere and the exercise of that prerogative is nothing that we should or can comment upon.  Whether it can be tested in that way or contested by a citizen affected by it is something we will just have to wait and see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, I am satisfied it is constitutional.  The two main arguments impugning its constitutionality related to implementation of the idea of extra-territoriality, that there was <Col N="1140" /> an inhibition by virtue of the phrasing of Articles 2 or 3 of the Constitution. I suggest that at the end of the debate there was general acceptance&mdash;I recall Deputy Colley very specifically accepting it&mdash;that there was power for a State to legislate extra-territorially in accordance with well-defined principles of international law.</P>
    <P>The other argument was that it would institutionalise the Special Criminal Court.  I think it has been shown that that is not so.  Trial for an extra-territorial offence may take place in any court in the land but the procedure for taking evidence on commission can only take place when the trial is before the Special Criminal Court. That is a distinction that I do no think was seen originally and having been exposed and exhibited it puts the matter beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>It was argued that there is something wrong about the Bill because it is, as it was described, &ldquo;the fag end of Sunningdale&rdquo;, that it was all that was left of it, and because that was so it was somehow inferior.  If Sunningdale had never happened a Bill of this type was essential because the scandal of the fugivite offender did not arise out of Sunningdale: it predated it and is with us still, and a Bill of this nature would have become necessary even without the Sunningdale Agreement&mdash;the pressures on us to end this scandal would have arisen irrespective of any Sunningdale meeting.  This Bill can stand on its own and Sunningdale is only incidental to the problem the Bill seeks to deal with.</P>
    <P>This argument about Sunningdale was meant to denigrate the Bill.  I totally reject it because the problem with which it has to deal has nothing whatever to do with Sunningdale.  It arises out of the campaign of terror in Northern Ireland and the fact that fugitives take refuge down here. Therefore, it was incidental to the Sunningdale Agreement.</P>
    <P>In that context it was said there was a better remedy than the Bill&mdash;and all-Ireland court.  Much play was made of the report of the Law Commission, that the reason they rejected the idea of an all-Ireland court was that there was an urgency about the problem.  At <Col N="1141" /> the same time the commission reported it was clear that it seemed to the commission that of the two options this Bill would be a quicker procedure than to try to establish an all-Ireland court which would have involved a referendum. Of course that would have been only the tip of the iceberg.  The people who comprised that commission, jurists and not politicians, were well aware of the political implications and it was not within their province to get into the political arguments for or against an all-Ireland court other than the considerations that would follow from a careful and deep study of the idea of an all-Ireland court.  Rather politely they said it would take too long and would require a referendum. Realism demands and acknowledgment that an all-Ireland court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is the last opportunity I will have to speak in this historic debate and having regard to all that has been said about the Bill, I think I am entitled to take a little time to deal with the many points that were made.  If the Deputies want to leave the House now I will hold the fort until 1.30.  Having regard to the myriad of points, rational and irrational, relevant, irrelevant, emotional, unemotional, made during the debate, I must take time to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition made a lot of play that they are as keen as we are on the idea of dealing with the fugitive offender but they say they would go about it would be to have an all-Ireland court.  There is an implication by Deputy Collins that this would involve an all-Ireland police force.  Of course that would involve, necessarily, some form of all-Ireland Government and in effect that would be the end of Partition because you would have a unified Ireland.  This is so unreal in the context of 1976 as to be ridiculous.  If that is being put forward to deal with the problem it must leave those who put it forward open to the charge of not being serious.  How can anyone here, having regard to the intransigence and fear in the North from the point of view of having anything to do with the South put forward as a <Col N="1142" /> realistic solution an all-Ireland court that by implication would command the allegiance of all sections on this island?  That pre-supposes that there must be a political structure, an executive or state of some sort to which that court would have to show allegiance.  There would have to be some form of an all-Ireland dimension to have such a court set up.</P>
    <P>How can anyone allege there could be an all-Ireland police force which would be needed to provide the means for detecting and bringing people before such a court?  I suggest that is a totally unreal argument, totally unreal opposition in the context of this island at the present time.  It follows that to suggest something that is totally unreal and has no more hope of becoming a reality than I have of joining Fianna Fáil must cause one to place question marks about the people making such a suggestion and their general attitude to this problem.</P>
    <P>That is why I say that the people who put forward this idea have an obligation to show how such things could be expected to be realised.  They should also give an indication of a timetable.  That has not been done. The idea was put forward as something that could be pursued and of course none of them gave an idea of how it should be pursued and how long its pursuit should take.  Because the Convention has failed and even a power-sharing arrangement could not be come to in Northern Ireland, how much more unlikely it is that a similar cross-Border arrangement will ever happen within our lifetime.  It seems to me that to argue that an all-Ireland court is the best solution is to make a totally unreal argument.</P>

      <P>Imports into the Community of agricultural products from third countries are subject to a variety of controls.  The most important of these are variable levies and import duties but particular products may also be subject to additional import measures such as observance of minimum import prices, quality standards and in some cases quantitative limitation.  In addition most agricultural imports are subject to the Community's safeguard clause system under which imports can be curtailed or suspended entirely when the Community market experiences or is threatened with serious disturbance.</P>
      <P>Preferential access terms, mainly by way of duty reductions or exemptions, are afforded to certain products imported from countries or groups of countries which have trade or association agreements with the Community and to imports from developing countries under the Community's generalised scheme of preferences.</P>

      <P>The variation in the price of fertilisers as between different areas of the country is primarily due to the fact that, following the marked decline in consumption <Col N="1146" /> last year, some merchants were left with considerable stocks on hands. These stocks had been bought in prior to the price increase last spring and could, therefore, be sold at more competitive prices than stocks purchased later in the year.  Apart from this, there can, of course, be considerable variations arising from trade factors such as bulk purchases, bagging, delivery charges, and so on.</P>

      <P>There is a free market for the sale of fertilisers.  The Department set out in the <i>Farm Bulletin</i> prices obtaining in the following centres: Carlow, Kilmallock, Killarney, Kilkee, New Ross, Clare and Thomastown.  Any farmer or retailer can examine this price list and see the variations mentioned by the Deputy.  It is up to the farmer who is buying fertiliser in, say, Thomastown to tell the merchant that in Carlow or Kilmallock the price is lower.  The Department have been providing this very useful service for many years.  It gives these people the opportunity of knowing the price variations throughout the country. There are a number of co-operative groups selling fertilisers, some of which had stocks on hands before the price increased.  It is only natural to assume that they are giving some of the benefits to their retailers, and so to the farming community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if his attention has been drawn to the wide variation in animal feedingstuff prices at different centres as shown in a publication (name supplied) in January, 1976; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the discontinuance of price control on the manufacturers' prices for compound feedingstuffs has resulted in more competition within the industry and consequently in a reduction in the overall cost to feeders.  In these circumstances, prices are liable to vary in different parts of the country.</P>
      <P>The prices to which the Deputy refers are retail prices of both compounds and straight feeds which are affected by many factors such as packaging in comparatively small quantities; the price of the raw materials at time of purchase; the level of the business carried on in these products by the retailers concerned and the varying costs of manufacture and transport of both the raw materials and the finished products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the same thing applies here as in fertilisers, that is, there is a variation in prices in adjoining counties for ground barley meal of £19 per ton, in soya bean meal of £11 per ton, of meat and bone meal of £21 per ton and compound layers mash of £16 per ton?  Is he further aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>When replying to the last question the Parliamentary Secretary's excuse was that the wholesalers <Col N="1148" /> had stocks on hand, but this is not so with barley meal.  Could he explain that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>A somewhat similar position applies to feedingstuffs as applies to fertilisers.  We set out in the Farm Bulletin the prices obtaining at 13 different centres: Wicklow, New Ross, Carrick-on-Suir, Athlone, Roscommon, Killeshandra, Monaghan, Letterkenny, Kilkee, Newcastle West, Killarney, Cork city and Dundalk.  We make this information available to retailers and farmers so that they can argue in, say, Dundalk, that that wholesaler is charging £2 a ton more than the wholesaler in Cork city.  As there is no fixed price, but a bargaining system operates, the Department are trying to provide information for everybody connected with feedingstuffs, whether manufacturers, retailers, or purchasers, about the position throughout the country. These statistics are compiled as carefully as possible by a large number of instructors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that when there was a price control on both animal feeds and fertilisers we had not anything like the same variation in prices between different centres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>When a price is fixed, a standard price is charged across the board.  That may not always be the minimum price.  Representations made&mdash;which were similar to those made about the sale of fertilisers&mdash;suggested that it would be better if the Department of Industry and Commerce did not fix prices for feedingstuffs but let the competitivness of the market do the job, and the purchasers would be likely to fare better.  That view was agreed on all sides of this House and approved by the farming organisations.  In the light of such approval it would be out of place for the Government to say: &ldquo;We are not satisfied with this free <Col N="1149" /> bargaining system.  We will give you a pricing system which has been laid down by the Department of Industry and Commerce&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>While there should be no significant change in total supplies of finished cattle over the next few weeks, producers, meat factories and exporters of live cattle are undoubtedly keeping a close watch on the price-fixing discussions at present taking place in the Council of Ministers in Brussels and developments in those discussions will obviously have a bearing on the supplies coming on the market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that it is a very bad time when so many of these cattle are coming on the market to have this confusion following the withdrawal of the slaughter premium and an interim period between that and the introduction of the EEC farm prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The slaughter premium was withdrawn by direction of the Commission on 29th February, as I said in reply to an earlier question. The Commission said that individual countries could continue it for two further weeks if they so decided. The Department did not decide to do so because we felt it would be unfair <Col N="1151" /> at present to ask Irish taxpayers to subsidise cattle to the extent of £15.04 per head for the first two weeks of March in view of prices obtaining for cattle generally.  The anticipated position, judging by the performance in January and February is that the supply of cattle to meat plants this year will be somewhat similar in number to that in 1974. We had a marked increase in 1975. Our anticipations are that we shall run at an average of about 17,000 head per week being supplied to factories.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if, in view of the information <Col N="1156" /> given to the Dáil over the past weeks that so many necessary articles are not manufactured in the State or are not available at a quality or price suitable to the purchaser, he has drawn the attention of AnCO to this situation; and if he has directed that training schemes be established to meet those needs.</P>

      <P>AnCO are in a position to respond to the training needs of manufacturing firms, including training to up-grade skills for such purposes as re-equipment, development of new products and improvement of production. AnCO maintain close contact with industry with regard to training needs.  There is also continuous consultation with the IDA, SFADCo, and Gaeltarra Éireann in the planning of programmes.</P>
      <P>It is the aim of AnCO to ensure that the level of skill of the Irish workforce is comparable to that of workers in countries with which we compete.  To this end the training programmes of AnCO are continuously monitored as to their relevance to the needs of existing as well as of new industries.</P>
      <P>This year our programme of training has again been expanded and the number of trainees will approach 1 per cent of the labour force&mdash;a target originally set up for 1978 was now to be achieved in 1976.</P>

      <P>The whole objective of the training programme, the training authority and the reason we have been expanding it in recent years is to ensure that in the recovery period 1977-78 we are not short of the skilled manpower that we were short of in previous recovery periods. We should be able to achieve that if we keep to the present training programme.</P>

The plans for that have already been announced. The arrangements are in course of preparation.  There will be an entirely new apprenticeship system and course in this country from September on which will reduce the period of apprenticeship.  It will also improve, we hope, the quality of the courses offered.  As the Deputy knows, the intentions in that area have been around for a long time.

      <P>Nobody likes dole queues.  As it relates to my own responsibilities, we have a placement office working in Newbridge which was set up there in 1974.  Since it was established in 1974, 590 people have been placed in jobs.  Admittedly the great majority of those jobs were not in Newbridge itself but were in areas adjoining, notably Kildare town, where the Black and Decker enterprise provided 150 new jobs.

      <P>The manpower and training implications of off-shore oil and gas finds have been under examination by the inter-departmental working party which was set up in May, 1975.  I understand that the first report of the working party is almost ready and will be submitted to me in the very near future.  I expect that the report will deal with matters referred to in the Deputy's question in respect of the gas already discovered and the exploration programmes to be undertaken in 1976 and later years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is up to the working party set up between the <Col N="1160" /> Departments to ensure that in relation to any new skills required we will have the training facilities for them and to see that we have those training arrangements put in train in sufficient time to ensure that Irish labour as well as Irish capital will get the utmost benefit out of the oil and gas finds off our coast.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very large question.  The exploitation of our natural resources, as the Deputy knows, is under the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the agreement of the Government, has charted our course, which is a partnership between the State and enterprise, preferably from native sources but if necessary from sources abroad, the objective being to get the greatest return possible for the Irish taxpayer and the State.  In the area of employment we are following a similar pattern to ensure that any new jobs which will result from this new and exciting development will result in additional Irish workers getting jobs, from the lowest to the topmost management jobs arising from that development. I would refer the Deputy to section 57 of the Department of Industry and Commerce's exclusive off-shore licensing terms.  Section 57 states that the Minister for Industry and Commerce may after consultation with the Minister for Labour specify requirements in regard to procedures for the recruitment of personnel by the licensee.  It will be our intention to ensure that Irish workers will be the main beneficiaries in terms of employment.</P>

      <P>Managerial expertise and petroleum engineers are among the skills that will be required. In that field, at the moment we have a training lack because we do not have in our universities any petroleum engineering courses.  There is the possibility of a shortage of riggers and other grades of that kind but I am confident we can fulfil that need from home sources provided we get the training programmes going as quickly as possible.  There are other grades of skills which would fall without the competence of AnCO but of which this working party will give us sufficient advance warning.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Indeed I am aware the Land Commission have been proceeding against the line of most resistance in this case since the beginning.  Proceedings commenced in 1959.  The owner objected and his objection was disallowed in 1963.  The price was not fixed until 12th February, 1970.  The owner appealed against the price but did not turn up and was not represented at the hearing, which was dismissed in October, 1972.  Since then the Land Commission have been endeavouring to obtain possession and the appointed day was fixed for 17th May, 1974.  The file was referred to the solicitor's branch on 5th May, 1975, with instructions to get possession with a minimum of delay.  Even at this stage the question of ownership is not clear.  The gentleman I have been talking about may not be the absolute owner: he has one sister out of the country and a sister in the country <Col N="1168" /> who may have interests in the estate. The Deputy will see this is a classic case of all sorts of obstacles and obstructions in the way of the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission, on my calculation, will receive approximately £1 million in respect of land they require for distribution.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> If there is such a period as 15 years it is a freak case.  The most usual period is eight or nine years.  The longest I would like to see land on hands is about two years.  It is reasonable for the Land Commission to let land when they have it on hands.  That goes without saying.  It is also reasonable that they should get a reasonable price for it.</P>

I am glad to say the land bonds we used last year are standing at £105 and people who were paid in land bonds last year have reason to be glad that they received land bonds.  I do not believe land should be kept on hands any longer than necessary and it is my desire that the Land Commission would expedite the division of land and, as I have said on numerous occasions here, I have strengthened the outdoor staff by over 20 since I became Minister with a view to expediting division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Richard Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, pursuant to Section 5(2) of the Irish Universities Act, 1908, Statute CV of University College, Galway, which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 26th January, 1976, be and is hereby disallowed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This motion is being introduced because the statute which seeks to create five new teaching posts in the college in 1976&mdash;one professorship and four statutory lectureships&mdash;would contravene the Government's embargo on the creation of new posts at present. As the House will be aware, the Government, in pursuance of their policy of keeping public expenditure within reasonable limits, have decided to continue in force during 1976 their decision to limit the creation of new posts in the teaching services to those required to maintain teacher/pupil ratios as in 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with this policy, which was communicated to An tÚdaras Um Ard Oideachas by my Department, no provision has been made in the Estimates for 1976 for the creation of new posts in the university <Col N="1181" /> sector.  The authorities of University College, Galway, were informed by An tÚdarás of the position.</P>
    <P>On 5th February, 1976, during the course of my reply to Deputy Wilson's question regarding the financial provision to be made for new teaching posts in the faculty of law in UCG, I said that I would need to have the considered views of An tÚdarás in the matter.</P>
    <P>I understand that the authorities of UCG first called the attention of An tÚdarás to the need for additional staff in the faculty of law in February, 1975.  Nevertheless at that time the college did not give first priority to the law department in the request for the approval of additional staff posts, but education and business studies were accorded a high priority.  A furtheir submission was made by the college to An tÚdarás in October, 1975, in which no mention was made of law posts.  An tÚdarás replied at that stage that the creation of new staff posts could not be considered.</P>
    <P>Subsequently statute CV was made by the Governing Body of UCG establishing a full-time professorship of law, two full-time lectureships in law and full lectureship in education and business studies.</P>
    <P>A meeting between the finance committee of An tÚdarás and representatives of UCG has been arranged for 12th March, 1976, and I understand that the whole question of the provision of new posts in 1976 will again receive consideration.  The question of the future development of the faculty of law will also be raised at that meeting.</P>
    <P>The position can be reviewed then in the light of whatever recommendations are made to me in the matter by An tÚdarás, within the limits allowed by the terms of the Government's decision in regard to the creation of new posts in the teaching services during 1976.  In the meantime I have no option but to introduce the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to oppose the disallowance of statute CV made by the Governing Body of University College, Galway.  I will deal now with <Col N="1182" /> what the Minister has just said.  First, the Minister has given as the reason for doing this the Government's embargo on the allocation of new posts at present.  That is, I would say, a deliberately vague statement, because the Minister would have to prove that the Government have the power of embargo on the creation of new posts in university colleges, and the Minister has not undertaken any such proof.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to take up that the Minister has just made is about the priority allotted to law in some negotiations.  Would the fact that the students and the temporary part-time staff revolted against the conditions in the faculty of law in University College, Galway, have anything to do with the added urgency of dealing with the disastrous law situation in that college?  &ldquo;An tÚdarás&rdquo;, the Minister says, &ldquo;replied at that stage that the creation of new staff posts could not be considered&rdquo;.  What does that sentence mean?  Does it mean that An tÚdarás cannot consider this if the Government say so?  If the Government say there will not be any new posts, are An tÚdarás so tied that they cannot even consider the situation? Thirdly, the Minister stated further on in his speech:</P>
      <P>The question of the future development of the faculty of law will also be raised at that meeting.</P>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister by whom will it be raised at that meeting.  Will it be raised by representatives of the Minister?  Will it be raised by An tÚdarás at the request of the Minister?  Where does the autonomy of An tÚdarás come in?</P>

    <P>I want to make a number of points on the actual statute.  First of all, the establishment by statute of a professorship and posts in law and, in this case, also one in education and one in business studies, does not carry with it a commitment to the actual creation of the posts as of now.  I am reliably informed&mdash;so reliably informed that there can be no doubt at all about it&mdash;that although 50 other statutory posts have been created in University College, Galway, they have not been filled, and such posts must <Col N="1183" /> await filling until the necessary money is available for financing them.</P>
    <P>There is an important principle which I mentioned already, the principle of the freedom of the university colleges.  There is also an important point to be made in regard to what I have just said: when we were discussing the question of third-level education, one of the strongest points to be made on this side of the House against the Minister's proposal for the reestablishment of a truncated National University of Ireland was that the procedures in such a federal university slow up decisions, slow up the making of appointments and so on.  It takes about two years for a governing body to get together a statute, to get sanction for a post and have the post established.  If there are already unfilled 50 posts that have been established statutorily and that will be filled when the money becomes available, why could the Minister not have allowed the statutory establishment of the professorship and the four lectureships concerned?</P>
    <P>The difficulty about the funding of the college, that is to say, the part of the funding for which the Government are responsible, is that this funding is done annually, but planning in such an important domain cannot be done annually, and consequently the Minister is making a serious mistake in what he is now doing.  The governing body of University College, as I read it, were going through an exercise in having the statutory sanction for these posts ready for An tÚdarás for the allocation of money.  I cannot see how that would not be possible in the light of what I have already stated.</P>
    <P>The history of the law department in University College, Galway, is interesting.  There was always a part-time statutory professor of law and jurisprudence in that college.  The late Professor Gallagher held that position until his death.  Since he died there has been no appointment. There has been somebody acting part-time and there have been lecturers acting part-time.  They are totally dissatisfied with this.  No <Col N="1184" /> matter what the Minister says, the most important considerations in this matter is an educational one.  There is an LLB course in University College, Galway, and it is self-evident that full-time staff is required.</P>
    <P>In outlining my argument at the beginning about the position of statutory posts having been made but not filled, I am not conceding that there is any justification for the Minister's action in this case, because there is not all that much money involved in it anyway.  As well as the LLB course these people were providing service teaching for the commerce and arts faculties.  I do not think it is necessary to elaborate on that point to show the House how the Minister in moving this motion to disallow is doing a serious disservice to third-level education.  The people in Galway had a working party with outside representation on it which did a careful study to consider the position.  The governing body prepared this statute with the views of that working party in mind and I think the statute is a perfectly justifiable and reasonable one.</P>
    <P>Another point is that the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland have laid down new rules about the necessary academic training of solicitors. One of their recommendations is that solicitors must have a degree. It does not necessarily have to be a degree in law, but a degree in law would be desirable and would make it a more logical kind of preparation for the career of solicitor.  What is going to happen in the west of Ireland, in Galway and area, if the Minister is going to allow this state of affairs to continue?  God knows, I am sick, sore and tired of listening to weeping and wailing from the far side of the House about the fate of the west of Ireland when it is politically suitable, but when it comes to putting money where mouths are I find a total reluctance by this Department and other Departments.</P>
    <P>If somebody wants to do a law degree it means that he or she will have to leave Galway and come to Dublin, and that is no inexpensive proposition at the moment.  So what <Col N="1185" /> is the Minister doing?  The Minister is doing what has been decried by many from his own side of the House in the past.  He is making the law situation for people in the west of Ireland a situation of privilege so that only those who have a great deal of money at their disposal can do a basic degree in law.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Senate of the National University of Ireland have approved a BL course for University College, Galway.  If proper staffing were arranged through this statute, together with backing from An tÚdarás, then that BL course could be got under way and a service would be provided for the west of Ireland. In effect, what the Minister is doing, despite all the talk about meetings and consultations, is killing law in University College, Galway.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the concern that was expressed from the Government benches about equality of opportunity.  Indeed, I am prepared to believe, and I know it to be true, that certain Members on the opposite side were not merely paying lip-service to this philosophy, but I am submitting to the Chair that there is a great deal of lip&mdash;service and cant in this talk of equality of opportunity. Regional discrimination against a potential student will result from this action of the Minister.  For example, I know that for many years the Attorney General&mdash;and I believe he is sincere&mdash;has talked about equalising opportunity for students from every part of the country.  I believe he should come in here and back me up in trying to have this motion defeated in the House.  If he did that, he would be acting in accordance with his own oft-expressed philosophy. Indeed, I remember being at a dinner of the National University of Ireland at which the Attorney General gave a very impressive speech along these lines, pointing out that everybody there who was a graduate of the National University at that time was a privileged person who had been subsidised to a great extent by the taxpayer and that consequently there was a duty on each and every one at that dinner to see that opportunity would be equalised for others.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> Here is an opportunity for the Minister to equalise at very little expense by allowing this statute and providing equal opportunity for the son of a poor man in the west of Ireland, or even a middling well-off man, because you would want to be pretty well off to send someone up from the west of Ireland to the city of Dublin and put them through a law degree at this time.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other Ministers, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who believe in equal opportunity.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the Peeping Tom of the departmental files, would be far better off in here at the moment defending the right of the poorer students in the west of Ireland to a course in law at their own university than at the activity he is indulging in in this House by reading out from departmental files.</P>
    <P>I asked at the beginning about the Government's embargo on the creation of new posts at present.  There is a reaching out for power implicit in that sentence, power which I do not think the Minister and the Government have.  I am not talking about accountability or the percentage of money that has to be spent from public funds to maintain the universities. I am talking about the reaching out for power by the Minister to deny educational development in a university department.</P>
    <P>We had a discussion in the House on technological education quite recently. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has stated his and the Government's objective.  He said by way of tailpiece that this was the only way he could work in our system.  He said that the big stick could not be used with regard to third-level education.</P>
    <P>I submit, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that this is using the big stick, the big money stick of the Department, that the Minister is waving the big stick over University College, Galway.  I thought I detected a note of regret in the voice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he was saying he could not use the big stick.  But there is this reaching out for power. <Col N="1187" /> I am not submitting that there should be any derogation of ministerial responsibility with regard to funding of education at any level.  What I am saying is where there is an educational lacuna, as there is here, that the Minister should not use his power in this House to block that gap.</P>
    <P>This is the big stick, I say, and I would like the Minister to disprove it. That kind of big stick was used by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries a few weeks ago when he pulled the mat from under the veterinary faculty in TCD.  It is a tendency which I deplore.  For that reason I am trying to highlight it.</P>
    <P>I concentrated to a great extent on the law, professorship and lectureships. The educational argument is strong in favour of the other two.  I know that the education department in University College, Galway, is particularly strong at the moment.  It is a department that has done very well. It has deserved well of its college and of its students.  I am thinking in particular about the number of students there who went to teach in the Six Counties.  When I was working in the north-west, in Donegal, I used to meet very many of them in the various schools and the colleges throughout the Six Counties.  I think it was extraordinarily beneficial for the Six Counties, for the university in Galway and for the mixing of students, qualified people as they were then, from the west of Ireland mainly, with their Northern brothers and sisters. There is a distinguished lecturer in that department of University College, Galway, at the moment from the North, and I hope that the link between University College, Galway, and the schools in the North will be strengthened over the years and that the quality of the education received in the education department in University College, Galway, will be of a continuing high standard.  Obviously, the governing body feel that one extra statutory lecturer is needed to maintain standards in that department. Again the Minister, by his action, is depriving the education department of a lecturer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> I want to say a brief word on the business studies lectureship.  If we are serious about maintaining and improving the wealth of the people <i>in situ</i> in Connacht then this department should also have the right to staff adequately.  I am convinced that a governing body of a college such as University College, Galway, is well equipped and sufficiently well informed to know when it needs an extra lecturer.  You can be quite sure, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that, as reasonable people not totally ignorant of the economic situation in the country, they would not make a demand for such an appointment unless it was necessary.  There has been a great to-do about the Gaeltacht and about maintaining it. What better way than to keep strong the university college that is nearest to it and that has served it?</P>
    <P>I had the privilege last year of speaking to University College, Galway, and I quoted to them an incident that happened at the time of the Spanish Civil War where the rector of a university was sitting at a public meeting when an attack was made on universities, on things of the intellect.  The shout was &ldquo;Abajo la inteligencia&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Down with the intellect&rdquo;; &ldquo;Viva la muerte&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Long live death&rdquo;.  This old, frail man, in a very dangerous situation, dangerous to himself, got up and severely criticised the person who made this remark.  He told the staff and students, who were by then almost intimidated, that in their university they had a temple of the intellect and that the people who were trying to beat it down would prevail by force because they had that type of force, but that in the end the university and its intelligence would prevail.</P>
    <P>I am not going to cast the Minister in the role of a Falangist leader or a fascist.  I know perfectly well that he is not such, but the people of Galway have in their university college distinctive status as a university, their temple of the intellect, and they should fight hard to maintain it as a temple of the intellect.</P>
    <P>I refer again to the section on <Col N="1189" /> the law, professorship and lecturers. According to the Government's arguments neither university&mdash;referring to Dublin&mdash;should be without a law faculty.  Then the argument is very strong that the law faculty in University College, Galway, should be maintained, adequately and professionally staffed, and that the niggardly, beggarly approach of the Minister for Finance in this regard should be decried.  I ask the House to refuse the Minister's request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly I support the case that has been made by Deputy Wilson and I would like to compliment him on the manner in which he has presented his case. It calls for very little further explanation. I hope that the Minister will accept the case made by Deputy Wilson and that he will withdraw this motion.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be aware of the demoralising effect his motion will have on the authorities in University College, Galway, who are charged with the responsibility for developing a university of very high standards and charged to do so in a western location where, as the Minister and the House know, there are always greater difficulties bearing upon those charged with special responsibility than there are on authorities in the more prosperous eastern coastline areas.  The decision by the governing body of University College, Galway, to take these positive steps in relation to the development of the law faculty in University College, Galway, were long awaited, much needed, and there was quite a strong demand for this development of the law faculty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any development of the kind required would of necessity need additional teaching staff.  It might be no harm to remind the Minister that his own political party have been well served by people who attended their first law lectures in University College, Galway, but had to go to other universities to complete their course. Surely there must be some sympathy within the ranks of the Fine Gael Party for the law faculty in UCG.  To <Col N="1190" /> hit with this heavy hammer the efforts being made is detrimental and most demoralising.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that we recently appointed a new president of the college.  If this is the way the Government are going to treat his moves to improve the courses at the university, it is a further demoralising step.  I appeal very strongly to the Minister to reconsider his decision in introducing this motion.  I would also ask him to consider well the point made by Deputy Wilson on the so-called embargo being placed by the Government on the creation of new teaching posts.  The creation of five new teaching posts and the filling of them are two different matters.  If the Minister feels that adequate moneys are not available this year to fill the posts, be that as it may.  The authority in UCG will be restricted from filling these posts until such time as financial provision is made.  That aspect should not influence the Minister to such an extent as to prohibit the creation of the posts.</P>
    <P>It would be wise and in the interests of UCG and university education in the western areas to allow the creation of these posts which have been needed for so long, particularly in the law faculty.  If some short delay has to take place in the filling of these vacancies, I am sure we can all accept it and appreciate the financial difficulties the Minister is in at the moment.  It will not cost the Minister a halfpenny to agree to the creation of the posts.  That is one point Deputy Wilson brought out and I would like to emphasise.  On that basis alone, I ask him to withdraw his motion and allow these new posts to be created, have discussions with the authorities in UCG and the Higher Education Authority and discuss the financing of these positions, if and when they are to be advertised.  But I appeal to the Minister not to proceed along the lines he is taking in this motion today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Richard Burke) Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Richard Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of questions were put to me in regard to this <Col N="1191" /> disallowing of Statute CV of University College, Galway.  The freedom of the universities cannot be pushed to the lengths Deputy Wilson suggests. There cannot be an unfettered freedom to make appointments and pass on automatic financial consequences to the Exchequer.  I would regard this simple statement as an adequate answer to his request to prove the power of embargo at this time.</P>
      <P>I have also noted his plea for the west.  Logic is a very hard taskmaster, and if Deputy Wilson's insistence on law in Galway were to be pursued in respect of other faculties, it would logically involve a faculty of everything everywhere.  There are other aspects of education which on the same basis could be demanded by students living in the west of Ireland.</P>
      <P>This is perhaps why the Deputy's own administration inserted section 6 of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, which said that An tÚdarás shall maintain a continuous review of the demand and need for higher education.  Are we automatically to follow every statute put up by a university college under the 1908 Act, regardless of the financial consequences? This, in effect, would seem to me to hand over to universities the powers which are, by statute, reserved for the Higher Education Authority.  May I remind the House again, as I said in my statement, that the question of future development of the faculty of law will be raised at the meeting which is to take place in the very near future, the 12th of this month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously by the Higher Education Authority under the terms of this Act.  It appears to me that Deputy Wilson, in suggesting that the passing of statutes does not convey commitment to the creation of the posts, is misunderstanding the terms &ldquo;creation&rdquo; and &ldquo;filling&rdquo;. Deputy Molloy answered him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are dealing with here today is not the filling of posts, which is a matter for the university college within the resources available to them, <Col N="1192" /> but the creation of these posts.  May I stress that I am not concerned with the filling of these or of any already created posts.  It has been mentioned in this House already that 50 plus posts are to be filled.  This is a matter for the university authorities.  I am concerned about the creation of these new posts and I have given reasons in my statement why the Government at this stage are putting an embargo on the creation of new posts.  Again I stress that I am not deciding here one way or the other whether there should be a law faculty in University College, Galway, because that is for the Higher Education Authority to advise me on at a later stage.</P>
    <P>May I remind Fianna Fáil that there was a time in this House when my predecessors showed a desire to rationalise the higher education system.  Do they conveniently forget 1967-68 when Deputy O'Malley, who held this post, was calling for rationalisation between the various universities?  Notwithstanding Deputy Wilson's reference to the big stick, I would like to emphasise the fact that it gives me no pleasure to introduce motions disallowing university statutes.  I do so only where it is absolutely necessary to preserve a balance, educational and financial.  I would be very glad, indeed, if the university colleges would think in terms of agreement in these matters and would accordingly send on their statutes, having first discussed the matter with the Higher Education Authority in draft form for clearance through my Department so that the legitimate interests of the Exchequer and the taxpayer may be properly safeguarded.</P>
    <P>In saying this I would like to refute strongly the suggestion of niggardliness towards the universities.  This year for the first time the universities were able to start off without any substantial deficits holding them back. Even in this difficult year we have not been unsympathetic to the colleges' current financial needs.  They have never been so well off for current finance as they have been this year.</P>

      <P>When I moved the adjournment I was discussing the Opposition's call for an all-Ireland court as being the best solution for dealing with the fugitive offender.  I was pointing out how unreal that call was in the current political context, so unreal as to be in effect a false call to raise question marks about the validity of it and the <i>bona fides</i> of the party making it.  I say raise question marks because I accept the Opposition's statements that they agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It raises question marks but nevertheless I accept the averments from the other side that they want to see the scandal of the fugitive offender ended.  I said, opening the Second Stage debate, that those who put forward such a point of view but yet are opposed to what we are proposing in this Bill had a duty to suggest an alternative method.  The alternative method suggested was the all-Ireland court.  I said, and say again, quite firmly, that to talk of an all-Ireland court and with it presumably some sort of an all-Ireland executive to which it would be responsible, in charge of an all-Ireland police, which would be the force operating under it, is totally unrealistic in the context of contemporary Ireland.  It is so totally unrealistic as, I think, to be verging on the ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Enforcement Commission, which was a commission of jurists and a technical commission, could not be expected to spell out the political reasons why such an institution would not be feasible in the short term.  They contented themselves by saying that it would take some time to set up and they pointed to the need to have a referendum.  I believe it would have been outside their remit for that particular body to have given consideration to the different political implications of an all-Ireland court.  They were men of realism and they were as well aware as I am, and as anybody in this House must be who faces the question honestly, that there can be no question of an all-Ireland court in the foreseeable future.  Of course, an all-Ireland court in the context of which the Opposition speak of it must include all the other things I speak of, some sort of an all-Ireland executive and an all-Ireland police force.  Again, we have only to look at the sad state of <Col N="1197" /> the Convention in Northern Ireland, and of the short distance the effort towards power-sharing got, to realise how far away we must be from the concept of an all-Ireland court.</P>
    <P>We are left then with the solution proposed in this Bill.  I again affirm unequivocally here that I consider this to be a good solution and one which, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach pointed out, we will see operated on a wider scale in European countries to deal with the problem of the fugitive terrorist in a a more general context than just on this island.  It is novel and it represents a novel departure in a common law country in that it provides for the talking of evidence in criminal trials on commission.  That is a novel procedure in our jurisprudence.  There is no doubt about that, but it is not an unknown procedure in the jurisprudence of Europe.  In fact, it is provided for by a European convention, the Convention on Mutual Aid in Criminal Matters, where provision is made for the taking of evidence in criminal cases on commission, so there is nothing novel or extraordinary about it.  It is new in the common law jurisprudence but that is as far as the novelty goes.</P>
    <P>The European convention does not provide any right for an accused person to be present at the taking of evidence on commission, but we in this Bill make such provision for an accused person to be present at the taking of evidence on commission.  We make provision for him to be present with immunity from all legal process whatsoever, civil or criminal.  That is spelt out in this Bill and in the reciprocating measure.  It has been put to me that this is an empty right because an accused, in the context in which he will probably be arraigned, will not want to go North even for that purpose and notwithstanding the immunity.</P>
    <P>That is something that necessarily must be a matter of speculation, but all we can do is to provide the right for him to go with total immunity. We have provided also the right for him to be represented by his lawyers from this jurisdiction who can attend <Col N="1198" /> at the commission and act on his behalf, with or without his presence. They will have full rights of examination and cross-examination of witnesses. We have also provided that the evidence on commission must be and can only be taken in the presence of the trial judges from the other jurisdiction.  Those judges have been given rights in this Bill and the reciprocating Act to put any questions they may feel necessary.</P>
    <P>I submit to the House that the rights of the accused are fully guaranteed. We will see to it by executive action that these rights will be completely vindicated in due course both in the letter and the spirit.  I repeat what I said earlier when the Opposition expressed apprehension about how an accused person, perhaps a notorious person, would fare at the hands of the security forces in the North in whose custody he would be for the purpose of taking evidence on commission.  I pointed to the immunity that is given to him by this Bill and that Act and said that unless that immunity is honoured in the spirit and the letter there is this sanction to ensure that if this immunity is not honoured the executive would discontinue the process of extra-territorial trials.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that no injustice can be done to an accused person.  He will be tried in our courts according to our laws.  He will have the benefit of a fair trial as it exists in this jurisdiction. His personal position will not be prejudiced.  It is a new procedure to deal with a particular difficulty and it would be impossible to devise a procedure that would leave every single interest involved completely satisfied. People will naturally question a new procedure.  There may be apprehensions about it but what we have to think about is whether there is justification for those apprehensions.  In my opinion there is not.  Because it is a new procedure we will not know who is right until such time as it is in operation.  I am satisfied, and I would not propose this Bill to the House if I were not, that when we see this Bill in operation the apprehensions of those on the other side will not be justified.</P>
    <P>There was one other topic touched <Col N="1199" /> on, principally by Deputy Blaney and to a lesser extent by Deputies Haughey and de Valera, about which I was disturbed. Deputy Blaney was the most explicit and he suggested that should this new procedure come into operation it could bring consequences harmful to this jurisdiction, to the Garda and the Army&mdash;that they could find themselves under attack from ill-motivated people.</P>
    <P>Let me say quite clearly, and I know I must be speaking for everybody in this House, that if this House passes a Bill into law it will be implemented without fear of the rats from any subversive organisations.  We will not be deterred from doing what we think is right to end a scandal on this island by any threats directed against any course of action by us, by this Government, to defend the institutions of the State.  That is what this Bill is all about; we want to defend our institutions because they are under attack by virtue of what is happening in Northern Ireland.  I am quite sure we have the full support of this House to ensure the implementation of the Bill without fear or in any way being inhibited by threats from unlawful organisations.  Deputy Haughey, reported at column 1246 of the Official Report for 10th December last, said:</P>
    <P>We cannot help the situation in the North in any way by inciting violence here.</P>
    <P>I must reject that proposition totally, that a scheme to provide for the ending of the scandal of fugitive offenders could in any way lead to violence here. The implementation of the law will have to be carried out irrespective of the consequences.  That is something that has been done by every Government since the foundation of this State.  Should the Government be confronted or challenged, that challenge must be met and not merely met but overcome.  I can assure everybody that that challenge will be overcome.  All the resources of the State will be available to implement the laws of the State and no challenge from any subversive organisation will be allowed to succeed.  I regret that the subject should have been mentioned <Col N="1200" /> and it is important to put it on record that as far as the Government are concerned any effort by people who might have it in mind to challenge the working of this Act will be resisted and conquered.</P>
    <P>I have very little more to say except to reiterate my confidence that this is a good measure to deal with a matter which has been a scandal.  It has scandalised our reputation in Northern Ireland and in the rest of Europe. We have a duty to end that scandal, to take steps to ensure that we will have a legal system here that will not permit our territory to be used as a refuge by people who have been guilty of the most awful crimes in Northern Ireland, because what happens in Northern Ireland affects us here.  We have a duty for our security, if for no wider reason&mdash;we have a duty for the wider reason of good neighbourliness and assisting the people in Northern Ireland &mdash; to ensure that terrorism does not succeed.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by Deputy O'Malley that there is no need for this Bill, that we have the Offences Against the State Act, 1972, and that that would be sufficient.  Again this is a gross misinterpretation of that Act, which was passed in the context of this jurisdiction only.  It was to deal with the prosecution of persons, allegedly members of the IRA, in this jurisdiction, for offences allegedly committed within this jurisdiction.  It is not open to this jurisdiction to use that Act to deal with fugitive offenders.  It would be very wrong if that Act were to be used to deal with all sorts of offences&mdash;so that if a hijacker or a bomber or a murderer same south he could be charged with membership of the IRA.  That is not the way the Act works and it would be a dishonest way to operate that Act.</P>
    <P>That Act is not comparable with this measure because that Act was meant to deal with an internal problem. The Bill before the House is to deal with an external problem but one which nevertheless affects us here. The 1972 Act was the result of failure to come to grips soon enough with the problem of the IRA.  The early <Col N="1201" /> ambivalence with regard to that organisation allowed them to grow to such a state that extreme measures had to be taken to deal with them. That was an internal matter; what we are dealing with here is the question of fugitive offenders who have committed acts of terrorism in another jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that when this Bill is passed the entire climate on this island will change.  This will be an earnest to the people in the North that we down here are anxious to assist them, that we are not prepared to allow our territory to be a haven for terrorists from up there, that we are anxious to ensure that the scourge of the IRA will be removed from this island.  I am hopeful too that, if there is any feeling among terrorists that there is a haven in one part of the island and that this encourages them to persist in their acts of terror, the fact that such a haven no longer exists may be an inhibiting factor and may cause them to desist.  I regard the Bill as being most important for the future peace of this island and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question on several occasions during the course of the debate and no satisfactory reply has yet been given, as far is I know. Since the Minister has gone to very great lengths in arranging for the travelling North of accused persons and immunity being granted in civil and criminal proceedings while there, has the Minister at any stage made any efforts to clear the air as to why those who would be essential to a prosecution of such a prisoner on this side of the Border cannot come down here and be given the same sort of immunity? Why should the prisoner be put at risk and those who accuse him be treated in a different way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be open to any witness to travel to the South to give evidence and I hope this is what will happen.  But we would be closing our eyes to the reality of contemporary Ireland if we were to ignore the possibility that there may be an occasional witness who, misunderstanding the South, might be apprehensive of what might happen to him in the South and would consequently resist coming to the South to give evidence and, because the southern courts' writ does not run in Northern Ireland, this witness could not be <i>subpoenaed.</i> To meet that situation it has been provided that evidence may be taken on commission and, if evidence is taken on commission, it is only proper to provide for the accused to go to Northern Ireland for the taking of evidence on commission, if he so wishes.  If he does not so wish he may be represented by counsel or a solicitor at the hearing.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not <Col N="1203" /> really answered my question.

The presence of the accused is in ease of the accused.  He is provided with the right to go to the North with all the immunities I have spelled out in great detail.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>As was pointed out yesterday, section 2 does not guarantee the removal of the Authority, even though both Houses of the Oireachtas may well have passed the necessary resolution.  The Minister agreed yesterday that section 2 was a defective section and needed to be rectified.  He indicated that he would have it looked at.  At a later stage the Minister stated that he may not be prepared to alter this section. Without alteration, section 2, which is the important section in the Bill, is meaningless, misleading and deceptive.  The statements made by the Minister inside and outside both Houses in relation to the Bill have been deceptive and misleading unless the Minister alters section 2.  A member of the Authority may be removed by the Government for stated reasons if, and only if, resolutions are passed by both Houses calling for his removal. That does not mean that the man will be removed.  It means that even though both Houses have, for stated reasons, decided to pass the resolution, it is then up to the Government <Col N="1207" /> to decide whether they will remove the member of the Authority.</P>
      <P>It was pointed out yesterday that this section was misleading, or that it may have been framed this way for some other reason&mdash;for instance, to protect the Government or the Minister from pressures that may be forced upon them from time to time. I hope that the Minister will be able to give an assurance to the House that the deception in section 2 will be eliminated so that we will have a clearcut section which will mean exactly what the Minister says is intended and what other members of the Government have said is intended by this section.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister indicated that he would have a word with the parliamentary draftsman to see if this important section could be rectified to meet the requirements of the House.  I would be rather amazed if the Minister has come back today with no further information for the House, because it is a most serious matter.  Section 2, as it stands, can be used in a variety of ways.  I pointed out yesterday that there was other legislation passed in this House which was never enacted.  The Government are now seeking a way around this situation without having to bring further legislation into the House. The Government have seen the mess which was made by the Minister for Labour in relation to equal pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am comparing one Bill with the other.  This deception must be rectified before this Bill goes through the House.  This section was deliberately framed in the manner stated.  When I first raised this matter the Minister was very quick on the uptake.  He knew exactly what was in my mind when I mentioned the interpretation of this section.  The Minister agreed that it was ambiguous and could be used in a variety of ways.  Deputy Lalor made a number of suggestions to the Minister.  He suggested <Col N="1208" /> that the Opposition could bring forward and get support for a motion from some dissidents on the Government's side.</P>
      <P>The Minister should tell us what he really means by section 2, as it is the most important section in this Bill.  I hope that, after a night of deep thought and having been found out, the Minister has consulted the parliamentary draftsman in an effort to rectify this gross deception which has been pushed in here and bulldozed through the Seanad.  We know that the Bill will be put through the House by the marching forces of the Coalition, even in this deceptive form.  The Minister has called for good legislation from time to time.  Surely he is not going to allow the principal section of a most important Bill to go through the House in this deceptive manner.  The Minister should now give us a clear indication of the action he proposes to take in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dowling raised quite an interesting point here yesterday and I am sorry he is spoiling it a bit today by such phrases as &ldquo;gross deception&rdquo;, which he used repeatedly here.  There is no deception here, gross or otherwise. I undertook to consult the parliamentary draftsman about the point which he raised, and what I undertook to do I have done.  I have consulted him and he has confirmed what I said during the debate yesterday: that section 2 is enabling, not mandatory. It lays down the procedure which the Government must comply with if it wishes to remove the Authority or a member of the Authority from office.  It provides that a Government may not dismiss an Authority arbitrarily.  If the Government wants to remove the Authority, they may do so for stated reasons and only if resolutions are passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The section does not provide for mandatory removal of the Authority.  It was not designed to do this nor do I consider it desirable that it should.  However, it does provide very real control by the Oirechtas in the sensitive area.  It gives the Oireachtas the power of veto over Government in the matter <Col N="1209" /> of the removal of the Authority from office.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lalor asked if an Opposition resolution calling for the removal of the Authority from office were passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas would the Government be obliged to remove them.  The answer which really follows from what I have just said is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The position will be the same as in the case of any Opposition motion.  It would be a matter for the Government to decide in the light of the circumstances of the time what action they would take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a complete difference between this and what the Minister told us yesterday.  The Minister told us yesterday that, if resolutions were passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, a person would be dismissed and that &ldquo;may&rdquo; could be construed as &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government would then at that stage yield to pressures if they so desired.  What the Minister states today is completely at variance with what he stated yesterday. The Minister stated yesterday that the Authority would be removed if both Houses of the Oireachtas passed the necessary measure here. This is gross deception.  It is a way Houses pass the necessary measure. Now it does not mean that a member of the Authority will be removed if the <Col N="1210" /> out, and the Minister and the Government are going to use this device.  As I said yesterday, the Minister should lead from the front, not push from behind.  If he has the courage of his convictions, he should do exactly what Deputy Collins and Deputy Fitzpatrick stated here yesterday.  The Minister has shown clearly that he is going to hide behind the ambiguity of this section, and so indeed are the Government.  They are not going to be held up in the future in the same way as Deputy O'Leary was on another Bill.  They are not going to be subjected to the type of pressures that Deputy O'Leary was.</P>

      <P>One must take appearances between one piece of legislation and another.  We have a principal section of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1975. We are told one day it means one thing and the next day it means another.  Would the Minister make up his mind and take his courage into his hands and do exactly what he stated would be done yesterday?  Why has the Minister changed his mind overnight?  He can no longer place blame on the parliamentary draftsman or on the civil servants.  This is a device to protect the Minister and the Government because they are a gutless and a spineless group.</P>

The image for those of us who see him in action is that this Minister's aim seems to be censorship.  Not alone is he trying to ensure it in RTE, but also this magnificent liberal image that he so nonchalantly displays when he is talking to students in universities and other selected gatherings is a totally false image.</P>

      <P>I am trying to say this in exactly the same context as the Minister put it yesterday.  I want to find out the connection between the editorial attitude of <i>The Irish Press</i> and section 2.  The Minister stands up and says that he disagrees with <i>The Irish Press</i>; yet when we talk about the removal of the authority or a member of the authority under section 2 he says we have not that right.  I want to find out what the connection is between his disapproval of the attitude of <i>The Irish Press</i> and <Col N="1218" /> section 2.  I also want to ask if he opposes censorship and, if so, to state that he does.  Does he believe in freedom of speech and the rights of others to disagree with him?  If so, let him stand up and say so.  I want to know if he, as Minister, will not allow himself to be associated in any way with those who are trying to subvert the philosophy of the State.  We have had too much innuendo and selection by the Minister not alone in relation to this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not take part in the debate yesterday.  The Minister gave the impression yesterday that in the interests of democracy, he being a real democrat, before he would dismiss the RTE Authority the matter would come before the Oireachtas and that would be the decision.  But today, if I heard aright, he tells us that even though the two Houses decide that he should or should not dismiss, he can still do as he wishes afterwards.  I was not so much in favour of the amendment because I thought this perhaps was a great exercise in democracy that the Minister should come here with his proposal on the basis that the decision would be made by the Oireachtas and would be taken out of the Minister's hands. Apparently this is only an exercise and an attempt to appear to be democratic and that it is actually the Minister who makes the final decision. Section 2 in that case is completely irrelevant and we have spent two days discussing it.  Deputy Dowling brought out this very forcibly when he said that, no matter what decision this House or the Seanad make, the Minister is the man who makes the final decision to remove the Authority or not.  If that is so what is the idea of section 2?  Why bring a proposal here and to the Seanad and then not agree with the decision on it?  The Minister on his own still makes the decision.</P>

      <P>I want to clarify the point raised.  The point about this section is that it obliges the Government, before they can dismiss an Authority, to put the matter to the Oireachtas and unless the Oireachtas pass resolutions approving that, they cannot remove them but it does not transfer to the Oireachtas <Col N="1221" /> the decision on removing the Authority. It gives the Oireachtas a veto; it does not give it an initiative in this matter.  I hope that is clear.  My only point in speaking is to clarify the matter for a Deputy who, I believe is genuinely seeking information.  I do not intend to reply to the tirade of vulgar and dull abuse we have just heard from Deputy Crowley.  I think his own party are probably a little ashamed of it.</P>

We know what he is like, that he will jump on any convenient band-waggon; whether it is Nkrumah in Ghana, Lumumba in the Congo or Dag Hammarskjöld, he will go along.  He talks about sincerity.  He has worn so many political hats that he must not have one ounce of sincerity and yet the Chair protects that man and does not give us a chance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a short answer to Deputy Callanan and questioned the sincerity of other Members.  The Minister has been firing a good deal of flak on this section in the past day or so.  He has been hawking letters around to support his case for section 2.  I can understand how Deputy Crowley has become agitated by the tactics of the Minister in trying to bulldoze section 2 through the House and at the level to which the Minister descended yesterday regarding the letters and the reading of correspondence.  I could read letters here today from the Minister to other <Col N="1222" /> people but I would not stoop to that level.  So could Deputy Crowley or any other Deputy.</P>
      <P>We have been told that in the first instance we had a Broadcasting Authority Act under which the Government could remove members of the Authority but the great liberal minds of the present Government and the Minister decided that the Authority be taken from the Government and that the two Houses of the Oireachtas should have the decision.  That impression was created in the Seanad and in this House in the discussions on this Bill. Now, under section 2, notwithstanding the fact that the Government for stated reasons come to the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas decide in favour of the Government's reasons for the removal of a member of the Authority, at that stage pressure can be applied to the Government which in the first instance deemed it necessary to bring before the Oireachtas a matter of grave public concern and to ask the House to pass a Bill that would give them authority to remove a member.  Having reached that stage they decide that they may not act if the pressures are great enough.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be positive in this section.  Yesterday he said he would consult the parliamentary draftsman to see if an alternative could be found. He agreed yesterday that there was a problem there, that the ambiguity of the section needed consideration and he was prepared to ask the parliamentary draftsman to devise a suitable form of words that would be more definite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today he tells us, probably having consulted the liberal minded personnel in Government, who want a safety valve of one type or another, that he is not prepared to do this.  He came into the House today and indicated in quite different terms altogether what is meant by section 2.  Section 2 must mean the same thing on a Wednesday as it does on a Tuesday but apparently from the Minister's point of view it can mean one thing on Tuesday, another thing on Wednesday and possibly something different on Thursday. The Minister will have to make up his mind where he stands, if he stands by his Tuesday pronouncement or by his <Col N="1223" /> Wednesday announcement.  We know that this Government operate from day to day with day-to-day policies. In relation to such a serious section in this Bill as the removal of the Authority the Minister must at least be positive in relation to this matter. Will the Minister stand by what he stated in the House yesterday, that he would consult the parliamentary draftsman to obtain a suitable form of words to ensure that the section is one with meaning and that it is left with no ambiguity whatsoever?  If he does not do that he is a fraud.  He says one thing one day and another thing the next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Some confusing statements have been made by Deputies opposite and I believe some people may be genuinely confused about this.  I would like to quote again what I said on the 28th October, 1975 in this House.  I quote from the Official Report, Volume 285, column 385, when I referred to this section. It is a very simple section, although people afterwards, who read this extraordinarily long debate on it, may be puzzled about it.  I said:</P>
      <P>The Bill contains a number of other provisions conferring additional powers and independence on the Authority.  Section 2 confers greater security of tenure on the Authority by providing that a member may be removed from office by the Government for stated reasons and only if resolutions are passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Under the existing Act, of course, members of the Authority can be removed by the Government without the necessity to state reasons.</P>
      <P>This section provides that a member may be removed from office by the Government for stated reasons and only if resolutions are passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is all the section does and that is all it claims to do.  Unless new matter of substance is raised I do not propose to contribute further to the discussion on this section.  I do not propose to go over extremely repetitive matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Minister's point and I understand the explanation that if the Houses of the Oireachtas do not give him the power he cannot sack.  I cannot for the life of me see what is the idea if the Minister has made up his mind to remove the Authority and brings the matter before the two Houses of the Oireachtas and both Houses say &ldquo;O.K.&rdquo;, the Government could still have power to change their mind through any kind of pressure or otherwise that might be brought on any Minister.  I cannot see why if it works one way that it does not work the other.  I cannot understand the section for that reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right and there has been some distraction from this.  These provisions will apply under any Minister and not just under the present Minister. The point is that what the Government have in mind is to give the Oireachtas a veto over the Government's power of dismissal of members of the authority.  That is all it means.  While I agree that in theory it remains possible under this section for a Government to come in and say: &ldquo;We want to dismiss the Authority,&rdquo; state the reasons, get the green light to do that and then for some reason change their mind.  It is politically extremely unlikely, the <Col N="1225" /> Deputy will agree, that that would be so.  If this were put in another form, if it were made mandatory, then it would in effect transfer the initiative in dismissing members of the Authority from the Government, where it rightly belongs&mdash;Deputies opposite have stressed that&mdash;to any <Col N="1226" /> Member of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central)</i>: I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Before section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution in section 4 (1) of &ldquo;ten&rdquo; for &ldquo;seven&rdquo; and &ldquo;twelve&rdquo; for &ldquo;nine&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (1) of the Principal Act states:</P>
      <P>The members of the Authority shall be appointed by the Government and shall be not less than seven and not more than nine in number.</P>
      <P>My reason for putting forward this amendment is that we will shortly establish a second channel.  It is argued that the Authority should be more representative than it is at the moment.  We propose, therefore, that it should be enlarged to 12.  In that way we believe far better representation would be given to that part of the country known as the single channel area.  This is in line with our policy of establishing a programming council with which we will be dealing later on.  We believe the additional representatives should represent the single channel areas.  We know from our experience of the survey that was carried out that people in the single channel areas were under the impression that RTE were Dublin orientated and eastern orientated. RTE 2 must be seen to be completely impartial.  It must reflect the views of those for whom it will cater.  The Minister's idea of rebroadcasting the BBC in its entirety has now been shelved.  It is important that we establish a proper framework within which the second channel will operate efficiently and effectively and we believe that enlarging the Authority will achieve that.</P>
      <P>Up to now the Authority were concerned with just one programme but, after the establishment of RTE 2, they will be concerned with a second channel.  We believe that second channel will give the people wider choice of programme as against the Minister's proposal to rebroadcast BBC.  Our view is that there can be a selection of programmes from BBC 1, BBC 2 and UTV in conjunction with regional programmes.  This will certainly provide a much wider choice of programme.  To ensure this the Authority must be given autonomy to ensure a proper expression of views and a proper representation of ideas.</P>
      <P>In the 1960 Act the number was confined to nine.  We propose to extend that to 12.  I am sure the Minister will accept our point of view because the Authority will play a vital role.  If there is proper representation from what is now the single channel area I believe that will enhance the Authority and contribute to a better second channel.  It is for that reason we put forward this amendment.</P>

      <P>There are two points involved here, specific numbers and composition or the thought behind the change in numbers.  The present minimum number is seven and the maximum number is nine.  They were laid down in the Broadcasting Act, 1960, and they have not given rise to any difficulties.  The size of the board is in line with comparable State-sponsored bodies.  As far as a magnitude of the board is concerned I do not, therefore, see any need for enlargement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> I can understand the idea behind the Deputy's amendment and it is with some regret that I feel I cannot after all accept it.  First of all, in the nature of things any Government appointing any Authority are likely to draw the members from different parts of the country.  No Government are likely to select an entire team of Dubliners or Corkmen or representatives of any single part of the country.  The idea of establishing what might be described as sectional representation seems to me to conflict with the collective principle to which we should subscribe.  In the present Authority the numbers, who may be from any part of the country, join in discussions affecting programming and so on.  Under the enlarged responsibility I envisage the general responsibility as essentially the same.  I do not envisage one section concerned primarily with one channel and another section concerned primarily with another channel.  I envisage the whole Authority as a widely representative group concerned with both channels and with the relationship of one to the other.  I believe that will be the most satisfactory way of proceeding. I do not think the extra channel warrants the change suggested.  I understand the Deputy's intention and I regret that, on consideration, I cannot agree with his view and cannot therefore accept his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister is not accepting this amendment.  The eastern part of the country will have several channels to choose from while the rest of the country will have only RTE 1 and RTE 2.  When the question of the second channel was being considered I consulted many people and they were all in favour of RTE 2 with the proviso that there should be more regional representation on the board and that the programme should be more regionalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all due respect to RTE 1, I must say that the people in the west think RTE leaves a lot to be desired and that the people down the country could do better.  While some of the programmes are good, the people in the single-channel areas are not very happy about the choice available to <Col N="1230" /> them.  That is why I support this amendment advocating that there should be greater representation on the board and that that representation should be from the single-channel areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. I believe it is very important, may be not so much to expand the one-channel area as to ensure that it is properly represented.  Naturally those people who live in the multi-channel area and who are on this Authority may not be interested in seeing again the programmes they have already seen on BBC 1, BBC 2, UTV or ITV.  Increased membership would ensure that those in the one-channel area would have people looking after their interests.</P>
      <P>How many people looking at Alexander Solzhenitsyn the night before last would not be impressed by the warning he gave to the world about the spread of Communism? Certainly the people of Ireland should have the opportunity of seeing such programmes.  Perhaps then the Minister's fellow travellers would not be riding on the crest of the wave as they are.  The Minister called me a liar a while ago when I accused him of membership of the Communist Party. He denied it categorically.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that such programmes as the Solzhenitsyn programme put out on BBC 2 the night before last would be shown on RTE 2 when we have it or, indeed, on RTE 1, but we have no way of enforcing that at the moment. That is why I am in complete agreement with the amendment, which proposes proper regional representation. If the Minister has his way in relation to representation the one-channel area will suffer, and again rural Ireland will not have the choice it desires.</P>
      <P>This is a very reasonable amendment. There is nothing political in it. It will ensure the broadest possible viewpoint in the selection of programmes, but most important of all, it will try to ensure that people in the one-channel area are adequately represented and that the type of programmes that are selected from the multi-channel area are ones that they themselves are interested in.  That can only be done if there is representation from the one-channel area.  The way to ensure that type of representation is not alone to increase the membership of the board but to write into the Bill, if necessary, the regional representation on the board.</P>
      <P>We have already seen examples of what can happen to people in rural Ireland when we have the metropolitan bias that is practised by the Government. To counteract the Minister and his fellow travellers we should have as many people as possible who understand what is needed in the country and who understand the type of programmes the people they represent would like.  Such members should be our representatives there, and it should not be left to a number of people in Dublin to decide for us the type of programme they think we should have.  The programme on BBC 2 the night before last is a typical programme that should be seen by the whole country, but if the Minister had his way that is the type of programme we would not see.  That is why I support the increased representation proposed by Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1232" />
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I said something on this in reply to Deputy Fitzpatrick that covers the matter in general.  I would like to add to it just this, that when we speak of putting extra, sectional representation on to the Authority to cover the needs of single-channel viewers in relation to RTE 2, it is important to bear in mind that the second RTE channel is not only to single-channel viewers but to all viewers, because it will have to be supported and a licence fee paid by all viewers.  Therefore all members of the authority should be responsive to the needs of all viewers.</P>
      <P>The second channel is a second national channel, not an extension to the single-channel area of a service already available in the multi-channel area.  Further, it is to be run as a complement to the existing channel, so that there is to be a single balanced national service on two channels. That concept of a single balanced national service on two channels requires a single authority, not sectionally divided.  For one who takes that view, like myself, a numerical expansion of the Authority is not then required. As I said, this Authority and, I imagine, all past Authorities and any future Authority are likely to be composed of a number of people familiar with the needs and views of the different regions of this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the present numbers have not given rise to any difficulties.  That may be so but the Minister is also aware that when you increase the role of any Department you must increase the staff.  This is a very reasonable amendment and one that the Minister should accept.  It is not a question of sectional representation.  It is a question of a broad base of opinion and where best that broad base of opinion can come from.  The Minister must take into consideration the existing situation in relation to the services which are available at the moment.  A very large broad base of opinion is necessary and desirable. On some occasions, as the Minister is well aware, in relation to increasing strength, it must be weighed one way or the other.  Deputies Callanan, <Col N="1233" /> Fitzpatrick and Crowley have indicated the question of weighting.  Where there is to be programme balancing of one type or another in which members of the Authority will have a say, the broader base of opinion would be of more value than any limitation to the present base of opinion.</P>
      <P>The Minister must also bear in mind that the present Authority are oriented towards a particular type of service and that the introduction of new personnel with new views would direct their attention to some greater degree to the extension of the service which we hope to have some time in the future.  With the advent of the second channel I hope that the Minister will agree to an extension.  Like everyone else I have certain reservations about the manner in which they would be appointed but I see no reason why there should not be an increase in the members of the Authority.  I would ask the Minister to have a second look at this matter before Report Stage and accept Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment.</P>
      <P>The increasing role of the Authority brings many additional responsibilities with it.  The balancing of programmes by the Authority themselves, as distinct from the controllers of programmes, is a matter that will be receiving the attention of the Authority in the future.  I do not know whether the Authority acts collectively all the time or whether they break up into sub-committees of one type or another to examine one or other aspect of RTE.  An extension of the service would give the Authority a desirable strength if they wished to set aside the use of specialists.  Having regard to the small Authority which we have at the moment it would be almost impossible for any division.  The Minister should have another look at this before Report Stage.  He should not completely reject it because the parliamentary draftsmen have not written this section themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it so often happens, however good the amendment may be it is dispensable because it comes from a Member of the Opposition.  On this occasion I would ask the Minister to <Col N="1234" /> be generous, to examine it, and to come back again rather than reject it out of hand.  The Minister has indicated that he has examined it to some degree.  Deputy Fitzpatrick examined it in great depth and has consulted, possibly, a greater number of people than the Minister who has made the decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say that Deputy Dowling's contention that amendments are rejected simply because they come from the Opposition is not correct and, indeed, I can demonstrate that it is not correct because if Deputies will refer to the proceedings of the Seanad they will see that there I accepted a goodly number of amendments coming from the Opposition, not only from the independent members of the Opposition, but from members of the Fianna Fáil Party there, including Senator Yeats, to whose work in improving the Bill as it stands I would like, if I may, to pay tribute here.  I find myself unable to accept the amendments which have been put in here, which may, perhaps, be due to the fact that the Bill received such a long and good going-over in the Seanad that the range of outside amendments, as you might say, which were at the same time acceptable to the Government, became exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the contention that because there is going to be a second channel there should be an increase in the numbers of the Authority, I think this rests on a fallacy.  The staff of RTE will be increased.  I do not know how large the increase called for will be, but there will be some increase necessary.  This does not necessitate an increase in the number of people on the board any more than it would be necessary to increase the numbers on the board of an expanding company. We can see this if we look at the practice of other State-sponsored bodies whose functions have increased over the years.  Some of these have far greater numbers of staff employed than has RTE and their activities are more diverse than are those of RTE, yet they have managed with the same size <Col N="1235" /> of board.  For example, the maximum size of the board of CIE, I understand, is eight.</P>

      <P>The ESB has seven and the IDA nine.  Deputy Dowling referred to this as a reasonable amendment.  I do not deny that like other amendments put down it is reasonable in its intention, but even against a reasonable proposition weightier reasons may sometimes be found on the other side and it appeared to me that this is the case in relation to this amendment.  For that reason I regretfully cannot accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a few words in favour of this amendment. I acknowledge that the Minister accepted some amendments in the Seanad.  This is a &ldquo;not more than&rdquo; situation&mdash;in other words, it is not more than ten where the existing membership of the Authority is nine:</P>
      <P>not less than seven and not more than nine</P>
      <P>to be amended to:</P>
      <P>not less than ten and more than twelve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to put this point to the Minister: I agree that the number nine, the existing number, is a reasonable spread.  Prior to having been appointed a member of the Authority I had the general idea that for anybody accustomed to business to have anything more than three would be a damn nuisance, but my experience of the Authority of nine was that it worked satisfactorily and that this spread seemed to be reasonable. However, there is the additional complication of RTE 2.  There is another aspect of it that the Minister might consider, bearing in mind the &ldquo;not less than ten&rdquo; formula in this amendment, which means the Government do not necessarily have to appoint 12, that this Authority, having the staff problem that I was aware of from time to time, could perhaps do with a couple more representatives from those working in RTE.  I suggest that as something the <Col N="1236" /> Minister might think about.  It is in my experience a very sensitive organisation. The Minister himself may have been described as in a sort of glass bowl.  Those working in it are subject to many pressures.  I know one of these executives is a member of the present Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might, with the Deputy's permission interrupt, at the time this member was appointed I do not think he could have accurately been described as a senior executive.  He is, of course, now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister might consider the true aspects, one of which is the additional responsibility of RTE 2, and the programming requirements, very important when one considers what can be done with RTE 2 on the one hand and the advantage that might be derived from having perhaps one or two members of those working in Telefís Éireann on the Authority.  I put that forward as an idea that may be useful in future.  RTE is, as I have said, a tension-filled organisation, and the greater the level of co-operation between the Authority and those working in it the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister mentioned various companies and I agree with him.  I know other commercial companies with smaller boards, but it is easier to make decisions in regard to commercial companies than it is in the RTE Authority.  What would be of vital importance here, especially when the second channel is established, is balancing&mdash;balancing programmes and balancing representation, especially where the second-channel area and all the various complementary programmes that will go with it are concerned.  That is why we consider enlargement of the Authority essential.  We have not written into the Bill that a particular new member should represent the second-channel area, but we would take it for granted that the Minister if he accepted that amendment would appoint these additional members from the single-channel area.  I <Col N="1237" /> would not like to think that we are sectionalising the Authority.  They must work as a team.</P>
      <P>However, the views reflected within the Authority are important.  As we have seen before regarding committees and boards, a person living in a particular part of the country or having knowledge of a special subject will always be consulted in regard to what he would think of a given subject.  If members of boards&mdash;maybe the majority&mdash;are from the east coast it would be difficult for them to get knowledge of what the requirements would be of people in the single-channel areas in the west and south.  These additional appointees, if the Minister accepts them, would represent the views from that area.  I do not say that there are not members on the board from that part of the country.  I am not sure where they come from.  Do the majority represent the east coast where at the moment we are in reception of the multi-channel service?  Is there a big proportion of the present Authority from the single-channel areas?  This is important if the views and requirements of people living in the single-channel area are to be satisfied.</P>
      <P>I have the fullest confidence in the present board.  I am not criticising them, but I believe that when the new channel is established, if it is to work properly and present the programmes I believe it is capable of doing, balancing and proper representation are of vital importance.  We must be seen to be doing something about it.  The first step is this enlargement of the Authority. When we go through the amendments we will be talking about the establishment of programme councils and various factors, but it is important that the Authority are first.  This is where we can start.  We are trying to ensure that the Authority can function properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see Deputy Dowling's point.  In every company and in every committee there are times when it is necessary for a small subcommittee to be formed. You do it in Government, you do it in cabinets, to decide certain issues.  There may be a time when a subcommittee <Col N="1238" /> within the Authority may be formed.</P>
    <P>It is on those lines that we are asking the Minister to accept the amendment.  I have referred already to the importance of the question of the balancing of programmes and proper regional representation in so far as the second channel is concerned.  This second channel will be of equal importance to those living in the multi-channel areas so we must approach the question in that light.  People on the east coast will be benefiting too from the second channel but we are trying at this early stage to ensure that we are proceeding in the right direction in relation to the Authority.</P>
    <P>The Authority should reflect the views of people in all areas but if the Minister is increasing the Authority he should be thinking in terms of people in the single-channel areas. Can the Minister give us any idea as to the number of people on the present Authority who represent (a) single-channel areas and (b) the multi-channel areas?  That information may not be available.  However, it is along these lines that we have submitted our amendment which is aimed at ensuring that the second channel will be successful and will be accepted.  One of the best ways of ensuring its acceptability is to have represented the views of all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard the set up of the present Authority as being relevant.  The problems we are talking of arise in relation to the new channel which will be the medium through which we hope to rebroadcast what we consider to be the better programmes of BBC 1, BBC 2 and ITV.</P>
      <P>The question that concerns us is the composition of the new board.  I say this because a person living outside a single-channel area could hardly be expected to understand the needs of that area.  Also, there is the factor that those who live in the multi-channel areas may be inclined to select programmes from the European networks because they would have seen already the programmes we have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>They take the ultimate responsibility for the selection of programmes but if they have no say in the matter why are we talking here about people living in single- or in multi-channel areas?  It is important that the Authority understand exactly the needs of the single-channel areas. The people in those areas are entitled to representation on the Authority. The Minister talked about a second channel being complementary to the existing channel but so far as we are concerned it is an extension because it means that those of us in the single-channel areas will be able to see programmes not broadcast on RTE 1, that we will be seeing the best programmes from other channels. Therefore, the residential qualification is very important.  The Minister spoke of not being in favour of a sectional bias.  Neither am I in favour of a sectional bias but I advocate a regional bias because one's outlook in relation to television is governed to a large extent by the area in which one lives.  Therefore, the more we discuss the matter the more obvious it becomes that we need an extension of the membership so that the Authority can break up into committees or sub-committees.  I cannot understand why the Minister cannot accept the amendment.  He has told us of amendments being accepted in the Seanad so I wonder why he is not prepared to accept this one.  It is an amendment which is non-controversial and non-political but which is very valid.  In particular, it would give much reassurance to those who live in the single-channel areas.  I ask the Minister to consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because much of this ground has been covered already.  However, there are one or two points that have been raised which are new.  First, I introduced the comparison in point of numbers between RTE and other State-sponsored bodies to show that the RTE board did not appear to be too small.  Deputy Fitzpatrick made the point that the complexity of the <Col N="1240" /> responsibilities of the RTE Authority is of a different kind, entails different sensitivities, from those choices which come before other State bodies.  I accept that entirely and I am not asserting that because RTE are smaller than other State bodies they are in any way inferior.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am agreeing with the Deputy but the suggestion that the RTE board were on a lower level could have been read into what I said.  I did not mean that and I am endeavouring to clarify it now</P>
      <P>The responsibilities of the RTE Authority are great and to some extent&mdash;though, perhaps, one could exaggerate the extent&mdash;are increased by the addition of a new channel. However, I do not think that increasing size, increasing the numerical strength of the Authority, would necessarily make them more capable of handling these complexities.  Deputy Brugha said something which suggested that at one point at least he shared the view that a State body might become too large.  That danger exists.  From his experience as a member of an authority I think Deputy Brugha will agree that nine is a good number.  If it works well, and I think it does, I would prefer not to change it.</P>
      <P>The question was raised by some Deputies opposite&mdash;though one Deputy held it not to be relevant&mdash;of the province of the present members of the Authority and if a majority represent eastern counties.  In appointing the Authority the Government did not appoint the members in any representative capacity.  The Government appointed them for their ability and capacity to make a contribution to the work of the Authority and bore in mind the usefulness of knowing and being aware of the problems of different parts of the country.  A majority of the members reside in Dublin, as one would expect and as may be true of other authorities.</P>

      <P>It is a very chastening experience to get somebody on the telephone.  Where a member of the Authority resides is of vital importance. I would not, with a stroke of the Minister's right hand, dismiss it as unimportant.  The point of the amendment is to ensure proper regional representation on the Authority.  I have serious misgivings about the composition of the new board when the Minister talks about connections with the single-channel areas as justification for appointing people who are resident in Dublin. I know the Minister is very careful with the words he uses on these occasions, like his contradiction a while ago.  On that occasion he was careful in the type of language he selected.  We seek an assurance from the Minister that we will have proper representation from the single-channel areas because we are the people who understand what it is like to have one channel.  It is important that we get programmes such as that seen on BBC 2 recently, an interview with Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who pointed out how the West was conceding to Communism and the various socialist groups emerging in <Col N="1242" /> Europe.  He said that we would end up with totalitarian states everywhere and Russia taking us all over.  This may please the Minister because anyone who went to Poland to attend a communist congress must have a certain sympathy for them.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> If the Minister was appointing the RTE Authority today he would have to give certain representation to the single-channel areas.  I have every confidence in the present board but the Minister should realise that representation from the single-channel area is necessary on the Authority, particularly in view of the fact that the second channel will come into operation soon.  In moving this amendment we were anxious to enlarge the membership of the authority.  With the establishment of the second channel I hope the Minister will give consideration to the place of residence of the members of the Authority and see to it that the west and south-west of the country are represented on the Authority.</P>
      <P>It is important that the second channel is accepted from the start.  We do not wish to make the Authority too cumbersome but we should take into consideration the sensitivity and balancing required on this type of authority.  RTE may not be a big concern in comparison with, for instance, CIE, the board of which consists of nine members, and I am aware that important decisions are taken by authorities with a small membership as efficiently as they are by authorities consisting of more than nine members.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to provide adequate funds in 1976 to enable regional health boards to maintain the health services at their existing level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In his speech last night, Deputy Haughey called on Labour backbenchers to demonstrate the sincerity of their concern for the medical welfare of our people, a concern he said which the Labour Party have always been quick to claim as an essential tenet of their philosophy.  As a Labour backbencher I welcome his call as I welcome any opportunity to contribute to an important debate concerning our health services.  However, Deputy Haughey, in my opinion, has committed a logical error in equating concern for the medical well-being of our people with support for his motion which, in my view, fails to manifest a grasp of the problems facing us.</P>
      <P>I agree the Labour Party are concerned about the present health situation, but they do not embrace the limited soultion proposed by Deputy Haughey in this motion.  He seems to imply that this solution is the only one possible for those who are honestly concerned about the health services.  We cannot propose an emergency reallocation of funds without rooting that proposal in a general context which displays a grasp of the role played by bureaucracy and inefficient administration.</P>
      <P>As I said last night, more money will not buy better health.  As Deputy S. Flanagan correctly pointed out, we have had a six-fold increase in funds allocated to the health services but we have not had a six-fold increase in the health of the country.  Therefore, pouring more money into the service is not necessarily the solution because we could be throwing good money after bad, without getting the desired results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the need for emergency funding.  There is a need to give adequate notice to health boards that there should be proper planning.  I appeal to <Col N="1245" /> the Minister to look at this aspect.  As I said some months ago, if we are to have a proper rationalisation of the health services, the Minister should set up an all-party committee of the House to examine the whole structure of the health boards.  Emergency funding can only be a temporary measure to assist those boards which are threatened with cutbacks.  The health boards have been in existence for almost five years and we have yet to undertake an analysis which would locate those areas where proper economies could be carried out.  Such an analysis would minimise the possibility of future crises where, due to lack of planning, foresight and efficient organisation, administrators are panicked into cutting back in essential areas.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an all-party committee would represent a giant step towards the goal of rational administration. The Minister could play a significant role in this advance by immediately establishing such a committee. I recognise the predicament of the administrators, the doctors and those involved in the health services, and strongly recommend that until the committee can get to work and introduce some order into the present chaos, no cuts in expenditure be made which would endanger essential services.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister take steps to alleviate this administrative nightmare by taking on himself the responsibility of protecting those essential services.  It is not right or proper that administrators should take political decisions.  I realise the great difficulty and responsibility involved in determining cuts which affect essential services but the job must be done.  This is not a pleasant situation and we must respond to immediate needs.  We cannot respond in a limited and deficient way or we will perpetuate the problem and make future crises of even greater proportions inevitable.</P>
    <P>The health boards have failed.  They have lacked planning and foresight.  I will propose at tomorrow night's meet-of the Eastern Health Board, of which I am a member, that planning and <Col N="1246" /> finance committees be set up.  I appeal to the Minister to request each health board to set up these committees.  The present structure of the health boards is top heavy and ponderous.  They are administratively cumbersome and have not achieved the objectives envisaged when they were set up.  Each operate on their own without any attempt by the Department to co-ordinate these efforts.  The Minister for Health should be responsible for co-ordinating these efforts and having frequent and regular consultations with them to see they have an objective in mind which, I fear is lacking at present.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the establishment of committees within each health board would help to bring order into them.  I also hope the Minister will give serious consideration to my proposal for an all-party committee because we are all genuinely concerned about the health services.  The all-party committee should consider every aspect of each health board and make recommendations to the Minister. This will not take away from the functions of the Department or the power of the Minister.  The committees would not interfere with the day-to-day running of the service.  It is time we examined and reviewed the operations of the health boards.</P>
    <P>I want to digress for a moment to tell the House that the health boards are operating in such a haphazard manner that a very essential preventive service is being temporarily stopped.  The programme manager of community care of the Eastern Health Board suggested that £105,000 could be saved by the temporary discontinuance of routine school child health examinations.  This would be a disastrous step and would have untold effects on the health services and our children would suffer.  This decision was taken by a programme manager without any regard to the nature or importance of this service.</P>
    <P>I will give an indication of what it can achieve.  It identifies children with physical defects and concentrates on finding children with learning difficulties, emotional and social deprivation, children with hidden handicaps, mental and physical.  These doctors <Col N="1247" /> identify children who are battered and abused and help is brought to these children by contact with other agencies. That is some indication of their work.  It is a preventive service performed by identifying these defects in time and it can considerably reduce costly and wasteful hospital expenditure which is involved if these defects are not detected in time.</P>
    <P>To curtail this service is a retrograde and suicidal step.  I could not condone it and because of that and because of the haphazard and unplanned approach, the panic measures that are being taken by programme managers, I am asking the Minister to consider calling in the chief executive officers of the health boards and analysing the areas where cutbacks can take place without necessarily imperilling vital services.</P>

      <P>You cannot necessarily buy better health.  Bevan in 1948 assumed that if he produced his special national health service the health of the people of Britain would be perfect.  Here we are in 1976 with queues for hospital beds and the health of the country is no better, perhaps much worse, than it was in 1948.  Unless the money is ploughed into the right areas you are wasting it.  The logic of my argument is that you will not necessarily buy better health with more money.  The fact that funds were curtailed at short notice has created a panic situation.</P>

By considering an all-party health committee I think he would contribute enormously to our health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The financial position of each of the country's health boards is very serious.  As a result of statements issued by CEOs to board members it is clear that the boards were told by the Minister to cut back considerably in their 1976 budgets. The Southern Health Board must cut the budget by £930,000 or nearly £1 million.  The Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary have said that there is no serious cutback; CEOs and board members say otherwise.  Medical and nursing professions, which have done tremendous work in difficult circumstances in recent years, have issued statements that the position is so serious that even emergency cases may find it difficult to obtain treatment after certain times at night and at weekends.  There is grave conflict of opinion about the reality of the situation. The Minister should have come out and told the House exactly what the position is and how serious the cutbacks are long before this motion was tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> Fianna Fáil are seriously concerned about the ruthlessness with which the less well-off section of the community is being hit; concerned that noncontributory old age pensioners and widows will no longer automatically qualify for health cards; concerned that the guide scale for eligibility for a health card laid down by the Minister is as low as £28.50 per week for a married couple; concerned that every effort is now being made by health boards to cancel health cards and reduce the number of holders in each board's area.  Fianna Fáil deplore the fact that health boards, with the Minister's approval until now have to be so low as to cancel health cards held by small farmers by taking grants paid through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries into consideration when calculating their means, grants required to enable these smallholders to develop their farms.  Does the Minister consider that a married man with an income of £29 per week could, in the case of illness, pay general medical practitioner fees and also pay for drugs for himself or for his wife or perhaps for both, particularly when the value of money is dropping rapidly as a direct result of the failure of the Coalition Government to control inflation and implement any form of price control for essential goods including drugs and medicines?</P>
    <P>The real cause of the collapse of the health services is the mismanagement of the country's financial affairs by this Government.  It is despicable that medical card-holders will no longer be entitled to free transport to clinics and hospitals.  Yesterday I met a man who had to get a day off from work and get a friend to do likewise to travel to Dublin and bring back by train at his own expense his retarded son in a wheelchair from a Dublin hospital to a home for handicapped children in County Kerry, having been told by the Southern Health Board that they were no longer allowed to send nurses or other trained staff on such business and that ambulances would no longer be travelling to Dublin as often in the months ahead as in the past five years.  This is a clear example of how Government policy in a panic <Col N="1250" /> financial situation leans heavily on the less well-off people.</P>
    <P>I reject the allegation that the transport scheme to clinics and hospitals was abused to the extent that it should be cancelled altogether.  Health boards have sufficient senior managerial employees to ensure that the very few abuses which exist are rectified.  I also reject completely allegations that the medical profession are negligent and are over-prescribing.  As a layman with a large young family I can easily visualise a situation where £500 worth of drugs could go into a particular home in any health board area in a case where through sheer bad luck one member of a family after another becomes ill in one year.  In fairness, such isolated cases should not be made in defence of Government failure to provide necessary funds for essential health services for those entitled to them.</P>
    <P>I would not expect new works to begin this year on projects being undertaken by health boards but I expect, and the people expect, a service this year which is at least equivalent to last year's level in respect of all services being provided for the lower and middle income groups.</P>
    <P>It is a dreadful state of affairs that geriatric units in homes and hospitals are about to be closed down and that patients are being evicted out of geriatric units attached to hospitals.  I cannot understand why health boards were not told last October or November that they should cut back on essential services in 1976.  Is it the case that the bubble did not really burst until mid-Jauary this year?  I strongly advocate that the Government provide the necessary funds for health boards by changing their priorities.  The Government have got their priorities all wrong.  This is the kernel of many of their problems.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is genuinely concerned about the plight of the less well-off section of our community: his problem is that he gets very little assistance or encouragement from some other strong members of the Government around the Cabinet table.  I appeal to him to go back to <Col N="1251" /> the Government for the necessary funds and avoid putting back the clock at this point in the development of the health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a limited discussion here.  I want to be as quick as I can and to say as much as I can in the limited time afforded to me.  First of all, I applaud the outspoken and constructive comments of Deputy Flanagan and the suggestions of Deputy O'Connell.  I certainly cannot say the same about Deputy Haughey in his carping speech in which there was gross exaggeration.  Everybody is concerned about the cost of the health services, but when one tries to provide economies without damaging the services one gets the sort of contributions made by Members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell said that the financing of the health services is a growing dilemma for practically every country in western Europe and what we have got to do is to try to get value for money.  However, Deputy Haughey talked about the economy. It must be obvious to everybody who spoke on this motion that the Government, as indeed Governments throughout the world, have not willingly&mdash;I include Great Britain in this &mdash;taken action to restrict the rate of growth in health expenditure.  Needless to remark, we would have liked to have seen significant progress recorded in our health services during the year, and particularly in 1976, but this is not possible because of the serious economic situation in which this country and other countries in Europe find themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need for me to spell out or to detail the gravity of this situation.  The cause of the recession is well known and, despite what has been said, is largely outside our control. We are sharing a recession which is experienced by most western countries and we are coming through that international downturn with greater confidence than many others. If it were not for the courageous and liberal monetary measures adopted by the Government our present position <Col N="1252" /> would be far worse than it is.  Indeed, if it were not for the fact that the Government have deliberately adopted a policy of large budgetary deficits combined with substantial borrowing not only would our overall economic position be much graver than it is now but our health services would have undergone restrictions in expenditure not only this year but last year as well.  I have no hesitation in saying that if Fianna Fáil were in power at the present time our economic position in general and our health services in particular would be considerably less healthy than they are under the present Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will hear me out for half an hour.  I did not interrupt him.  He will have his say later on and he can make his points then.  Deputy Colley, the colleague of Deputy Haughey and spokesman on Finance and former Minister for Finance, has said continuously, even during the Ard Fheis, and particularly over the past three years, that the Government's budget deficits should have been maintained at much lower levels than has been the case. He is an exponent of economic orthodoxy, as we all know from his years as Minister for Finance and subsequent to that.  The effect of this kind of budgetary conservatism would have been to plunge our economy into a far greater crisis than we now face.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not have to be an economic genius to know what the effects of this kind of balanced budgetary policy would have done to our social services.  Deputy Colley's call for more balanced budgets was combined with demands for cuts in public expenditure, not once but frequently.  I believe this disastrous recipe which he consistently advocates would have meant not only a deepening of the economic recession in Ireland during the past two years but also cuts in real terms in our social <Col N="1253" /> welfare services and in our health services as well.</P>
      <P>The Government did not take that road of economic repression.  We cast aside the economic orthodoxies of the past and worked instead for a balanced policy which sought to maintain the highest possible level of economic and social activity consistent with the international difficulties we faced.  Our policy of economic liberalism has enabled us to weather the acute economic storm with remarkably little damage considering the open nature of our economy and its vulnerability to international economic trends.</P>
      <P>One would imagine from statements from the Fianna Fáil Party that we were a complete island and could remain unaffected by outside events. As far as our social services are concerned the fiscal policy adopted by the Government has enabled consistent gains to be made throughout the period of recession.  That has been a remarkable and almost a unique achievement.  In the case of our health services there can be no doubt about the gains made during the past three years, two of which were years of extreme economic difficulty.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey does not like figures, or so he said last night, when one talks about health expenditure, but I want to give him some figures. The total public non-capital expenditure on health increased from £107.4 million in 1972-73 to an estimated £233 million in 1975.  This represents an increase of 117 per cent in money terms and approximately 16½ per cent in real terms.  The rise in the Exchequer's contribution to health expenditure has been even more dramatic during that period, rising from £67 million in 1972-73 to £213 million in 1975, an increase of 318 per cent. Therefore, nobody can allege that the Government have stinted on the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health expenditure as a percentage of gross national product rose dramatically during the period in question. It rose from just under 5 per cent in 1972-73 to over 6 per cent last year.  I believe this figure more than any other indicates the progress that <Col N="1254" /> has been made in health during the last two years of recession.  It demonstrates clearly the Government's commitment to this service since by deliberate policy we have enabled our health services to grow at a faster rate than the economy as a whole.  Deputy Haughey appeared to be generous last night, as generous as he was when we had a dispute with the doctors early last year and with the pharmacists later in the year.  His solution to the whole problem was to give them the money, no matter what they demanded.  Of course, he was not Minister for Finance then, but when he was he was not so lavish or so givish as far as the health services were concerned.  I think I will be right when I mention years during which Deputy Haughey was Minister for Finance.  In the year ended 31st March, 1967&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is ashamed of the record but I will quote it.  As a proportion of GNP, at 31st March, 1967, the health services got 3.2 per cent; at 31st March, 1968, it was still 3.2 per cent; in 1969, it was the same percentage and in March, 1970, it was 3.4 per cent, an increase, as a proportion of GNP, of 0.2 per cent.</P>

      <P>That is not a record to be proud of.  It emphasises our achievement compared with Fianna Fáil.  We <Col N="1255" /> deliberately set out to continue growth in our health services at a faster rate than growth in the economy as a whole.  This is the policy that is under attack by a party whose budgetary policies, if they had been in office during the past two years of recession, would have been to reduce budget deficits and to cut expenditure, including expenditure on health.  If we are to take the policy of Deputy Colley it means that though various services are demanded the policy is to borrow less, to have a smaller deficit and to have less taxation.  I am sure if he returns to the Department of Finance he will want to work that out and it will take him quite a long time to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The substantial increases in health expenditure to which I referred have enabled major progress to be made in our health services since this Government took office.  This progress has been recorded throughout the whole range of services for which I am responsible, and I propose to list some of the more outstanding examples.</P>
      <P>One of the main items has been the dramatic increase in employment in the health services.  In 1972-73, 42,000 persons were engaged in delivering health services at all levels.  Today that figure is 47,500, an increase of 5,500.  This increase has benefited our employment situation throughout the country in a time of recession and has also led to an undoubted qualitative improvement in all the health services offered to our people.  The percentage of the population covered by medical cards has increased from 28 per cent to 36 per cent since we took office in March, 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more poverty now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This was done in an attempt to ensure that the expense of primary medical care would be removed from as many people as possible who suffered hardship through medical expense.  There are <Col N="1256" /> also the illnesses for which drugs and medicines are provided free of charge to all patients, that is, without means tests.  A constant care allowance of £25 per month in respect of handicapped children was introduced, again regardless of the income of parents.  The number covered by disabled persons' maintenance allowances was increased from 25,700 in 1972-73 to 27,000 in 1975 largely as a result of the easing of the means test for eligibility for this allowance. Financial support and other assistance have been provided towards the establishment of a network of community advice centres throughout the country and our social work, home help and so on, have been improved dramatically. In the case of the home help service, expenditure has risen from £150,000 in 1972-73 to an estimated £1 million this year.  Training facilities for handicapped people have been improved at a rapid rate.</P>
      <P>I could continue with this list of improvements if time let me do so. I will content myself by stating that the significant increases in expenditure which I have outlined have led to substantial improvement in our health services overall.  The fact that 5,500 more people are employed in the services is an indication of this because in a labour-intensive service like health every additional person employed, particularly in the professional field, adds to the quality of the service provided.  There can be no doubt that the health services today are a significant improvement on the services we inherited when we took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These improvements have been brought about despite the economic recession.  Unfortunately this will not be possible in 1976 for sound economic and social reasons.  During the past two years because the economic recession was deepening internationally the Government deliberately pursued a policy of large budget deficits, the objective being twofold: one, to cushion our people against the potential ravages of recession by boosting public expenditure, including social service expenditure; and two, to maintain internal demand <Col N="1257" /> at the highest possible level. This, in effect, meant that the Government pursued a policy of considerable borrowing to pay for current services.  That policy has proved successful.  Our people have been cushioned against recession to a considerable degree, to a far greater degree than if Deputy Colley were Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>However, this year our policy had to be changed somewhat in relation to social services, with the exception of social welfare benefits, and I will be completely honest about the reason for this.  In the first place, I think it is generally agreed that with prudence we cannot allow our budget deficits to increase beyond the present level.  This would involve us in borrowing in excess of the level that would be prudent at this time. Secondly, within the limits imposed on us by the present level of deficit, the Government have decided to shift additional resources towards industrial development and job creation, something to which Deputy Haughey seemed to take exception last night.</P>
    <P>There has been a reason for this. It has been done because it appears an international upswing is on the way and because it is necessary to prepare ourselves for this and to move towards higher levels of economic growth as rapidly as possible, and so to produce the wealth which will finance further development in our social services, including services for health.  As far as health services are concerned it will not be possible to undertake any new development in 1976 for the reasons I have mentioned, which are that we have got near the prudent limit of deficit financing, and the social services, with the exception of social welfare, should stand still in 1976.</P>
    <P>The short-term objective of Government policy as far as health services are concerned is to maintain the 1975 service levels throughout 1976. This objective has been notified to health boards and will form the basis of their decision-making throughout the year.  It is an objective which I note from one of last Sunday's newspapers and from his own comments on <Col N="1258" /> the motion last night to which Deputy Haughey subscribes.  Now we ought to be honest with ourselves.  It is the only responsible objective any Government could have for our health services at this time.  No one with any knowledge of the economic facts of life facing the country could expect anything but a holding operation in our health services in 1976.</P>
    <P>In the time remaining to me I would like to spell out in as much detail as possible the steps we are taking to ensure that the 1975 service levels are maintained throughout the year.  Non-capital health expenditure will rise from an estimated £231 million in 1975 to an estimated £262 million in 1976. This represents an increase of approximately 13 per cent in non-capital overall expenditure.  Direct expenditure by each health board will rise by approximately the same percentage.  It is my view that given reasonable economies by health boards and given very tight control over every item of expenditure it should be possible for each board to maintain its 1975 service levels throughout the year with this level of increase in expenditure.  I must admit their task is not going to be an easy one.  The demands on them are great and they are increasing day by day, month by month and year by year.  I know it will be very difficult to effect economies in face of these demands but I believe our economic situation requires that every possible economy which does not affect the level of service should be made.</P>
    <P>When the 1976 allocations were notified to health boards in January last officials of my Department immediatley entered into consultations with officials of the boards both on the question of the kind of economies that could be made in each case and on the need for month by month monitoring of expenditure.  I am pleased to say that these consultations, although not yet completed, are working out extremely well.  As far as economies are concerned, my objective has been to see that these are made in areas which do not affect service levels or, as far as possible, the quality of the service. The consultations which have taken place have shown that considerable <Col N="1259" /> economies can in fact be achieved.  I think I should indicate what these are before I go on to refute the wild allegations made last night by Deputy Haughey concerning supposed cuts in services.  First of all, 63 per cent of non-capital expenditure is accounted for by the remuneration of staffs.  Inevitably therefore economies which would not affect the level of service had to be sought in this area of expenditure.  As a result of our examination I am satisfied that economics involving leaving non-essential vacancies unfilled and tightening up on the use of substitutes and locums, unnecessary overtime and similar economies can be made without affecting the service.  There is no question of reducing the number of permanent or temporary wholetime staff.  All that will be involved are measures to achieve greater productivity from existing pay expenditure. I am aware that the co-operation of professional staff organisations will be necessary in this regard.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I am satisfied that economies can be achieved in the purchase of supplies and equipment of all kinds. This has also been discussed with the health boards' officials and it appears this can be done although it will, of course, mean that a certain catching up will be necessary next year.  Thirdly, savings can be made on maintenance costs without affecting services and this too will be done.  In all a deduction of £1.26 million on maintenance budgets has been identified.  This involves leaving such things as painting and repair work until next year.  That is not a desirable thing to do but which of us would not put off work of this kind in our own homes in times that proved somewhat difficult?  I am satisfied in short that a wide range of economies can be achieved without affecting services and that these economies will enable existing service levels in the main to be maintained.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that consultations have been taking place between officials of my Department and officials of the various health boards on the question of the economies necessary for them to operate within their 1976 financial allocations.  These have not <Col N="1260" /> yet been completed in respect of all health boards.  They have been completed in respect of the Southern, MidWestern, North-Western and NorthEastern Health Boards.  In each case I am satisfied the economies of the kind mentioned which have been identified can be carried through without affecting 1975 service levels.  In the case of the Western, South-Eastern, Eastern and Midland Health Boards consultations have not yet been completed. In these cases also my objective will be to help secure economies which will enable the 1975 service levels to be maintained.  In the case of the South-Eastern and Western Health Boards I am confident that this objective is reasonable.  The Eastern Health Board present a somewhat more difficult programme.  Considerable progress has however already been made towards achieving a satisfactory solution here as well.</P>
    <P>Since Deputy Haughey dealt particularly with the Eastern Health Board last night I would like to comment in some detail on its position at this point. Deputy Haughey rightly pointed out there was a gap of £3.7 million between what the board estimated it would require to maintain the 1975 service levels and what it got by way of financial allocation.  I would like to remind him that he should be aware from his years as Minister for Finance that it is abnormal for any estimate of any subsidiary body to be accepted without examination and seldom to be accepted without reduction.  In the nature of things, the body providing the money, in this case the Department of Health which provides practically 100 per cent of the money, must have a say in the examination of estimates of cost prepared by the body looking for money, in this case the Eastern Health Board.  Examination between my Department and the board showed a number of instances where it was agreed items could be repriced.  For example, provision made by the board for overdraft interest was reduced by about £200,000 and it was agreed the estimate provision for miscellaneous receipts could be increased by £120,000. The board's budget for maintenance was looked at.  They sought £1.9 million. This is a very high figure which <Col N="1261" /> might be justifiable in normal times. However it was put to them that before they thought of cutting into services it would be better to reduce maintenance to a minimum.  Accordingly it was agreed to reduce this provision by £700,000, which brings it back to the allowance for 1975.</P>
    <P>These economies, together with economies associated with leaving nonessential vacancies unfilled, reducing but not eliminating locum cover, reducing overtime provision, and other economies of this kind, have resulted in an identified gap of about £700,000 in the case of the Eastern Health Board on a direct expenditure level in excess of £33 million.  Discussions between my Department and the board will continue to eliminate this.  In the meantime I understand the board will be considering the matter again at their meeting tomorrow night and I am sure that in the light of the studies now presented they will accept that their original figures and the possibility of particular service cuts were unfounded.</P>
    <P>All our efforts therefore have been directed towards making reasonable economies in health service costs without affecting 1975 service levels. I think it is unreasonable that anyone either in this House or outside it should not accept that economies of the kind I have mentioned are necessary in the present economic climate. I would submit that they are both necessary and reasonable.  It is unreasonable to expect that, at a time when every sector of our economy is under pressure, the health services should not be under similar pressure. It is not only unreasonable but also malicious.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey, in the course of his contribution last night, made a number of allegations in which he mentioned specific cutbacks in services which he felt were about to happen.  Almost all of these allegations are without foundation and I refute them here and now.  The general medical service will not be cut back, as he asserted here last night. I do not know on what grounds he made that assertion, but I am stating here and now that there is no truth in it whatsoever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey alleged cuts of up to 20 per cent in the budget and said in respect of the voluntary hospitals that if hospitals were to maintain staff they could not keep patients.  He said that the essential back-up service for accidents would be affected and that the Mater, Jervis Street and St. Laurence Hospital would each have to close down 50 beds.  There is no question that these hospitals will have to close down 50 beds.  The rumour he mentioned is only a rumour and a malicious one at that.</P>
      <P>The differences he mentioned between allocations and budgets in the case of the Dublin voluntary hospitals are grossly exaggerated.  In the case of the health boards, expectations of voluntary hospitals always differ from what they get, but discussions are going on between the voluntary hospitals and my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey also referred to certain proposals for savings listed by the CEO of the Eastern Health Board for consideration by the board members.  They were listed by the CEO, as Deputy Dr. O'Connell said, as possible ways of bridging the gap of £3.7 million which he then <Col N="1263" /> believed required to be bridged. These proposals which Deputy Haughey indicated, namely, a reduction in the limit from five to three years for free milk, the introduction of a means test in the constant care allowance scheme, and the discontinuance of the routine child health examination scheme were not accepted by the board and certainly have not been accepted by me.</P>

      <P>I thought I might have got a five-minute warning as other Deputies did.  However, there is quite an amount to be said as far as health expenditure is concerned. Deputy Haughey seemed to sneer at the fact that I was getting less than was my due.  I am getting 18 per cent of total expenditure and that is the same percentage as I got last year.</P>
      <P>People are concerned with the expenditure in the health services and I am also concerned.  I certainly would subscribe to the idea that has been mooted by Deputy Dr. O'Connell and by Deputy Séan Flanagan of a review body and the establishment of a finance board committee in the board.  I will certainly recommend that to the various health boards, and I will give consideration to the establishment of a committee which would consider expenditure on the health services. It was never my intention or the Government's intention to look for cuts, but in view of the fact that Fianna Fáil themselves have complained about over-expenditure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It was most interesting to hear the Minister for Health on this subject, because he went away back to 1967 and referred to <Col N="1264" /> the statistics at that time.  The two periods are not comparable, because there is a different situation now altogether.  All we are asking for in the motion is that the services that we had last year be maintained. In the Midland Health Board area there is a reduction of £900,000 involved.  At a meeting of the Midland Health board three weeks ago, all we were able to pare off that was £500,000.  They have to make various cuts in the personnel, and when it comes to personnel it is always the man or woman at the bottom of the ladder that is affected.  The Jubilee nurses, who are involved in relief work, will have to go.  That is the position in the Midland Health Board area and I am sure it is the same all over the country.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board need £400,000 to give the same service as last year, but they may not have the personnel to implement it.  Co-operation is needed from the personnel available and it will be recalled that when the Minister tried to bring in free hospitalisation&mdash;or should I say bulldoze it in&mdash;he had to abandon it because he did not get co-operation.  He is now depending on the co-operation of the personnel, and there is great concern among the staffs in the health board areas that redundancies or termination of employment may take place.  If the boards have to enforce cutbacks they will affect services, medical cards, meals on wheels, home help and so on.  How can we give the services we gave last year without an increase in finance?  Everybody knows that inflation has increased the cost of services.  I estimate that the total cut-back in all areas on the original estimates they submitted to the Department of Health is close on £10 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must take into consideration that the health board's estimate was only an estimate and it can fluctuate. There is always a short fall in estimates. If inflation increases by 10 per cent what will the position be?  Can the health boards then go back to the Department of Health and ask for more money when they are not able to get <Col N="1265" /> the money they are looking for now? Before the end of the year I can see the boards being caught up in a very serious situation unless additional money is made available.  Recently the Offaly Health Committee and other health committees all over the country had this community care booklet before them.  It is very elaborate and there is a lot of good material in it. At that board meeting I said that I knew what was in it and that most of it could not be implemented, because we needed money to implement it and I knew that the money would not be forthcoming from the Minister for Health.  What is happening now is that the patients in the Midland Health Board area who should be getting extern hospital treatment are being sent into what I call convalescent homes in the region, whereas previously if the various hospitals were not able to treat them they would be sent to the Mater, St. Vincent's, or other hospitals in Dublin, where they would get the right treatment.  I believe that is all being done away with due to the financial position.</P>
    <P>I have never known the Fianna Fáil Party to reduce the health services. Any Government that reduce the services are not worthy of the name of Government because they are attacking the health of the people and the children who will be running this country in the years to come.  This Government are also hitting the underprivileged, the people who are less well able to defend themselves. If heating breaks down in a hospital and there is expense involved, will the hospital be told that it must remain out of action?  It would be a sad day if that happened.  With regard to drug abuse, in the area I come from I could not say that this happens.  I could not say that the medical profession have been guilty of abuse in that line.  The only drug abuse I can think of is in the care of the mental patients who attend outpatient clinics.  As you all know, this is a very complex illness and there may have been some abuse in the drug line, but it was through no fault of any doctor.  Now there is talk also that the GPs have been exploiting <Col N="1266" /> medical cardholders by making calls that are not needed.  If a doctor fails to call on a medical cardholder, and that man gets a heart attack, who is going to take the blame then?  It will not be the Minister for Health nor the CEOs of the health board.  It will be the doctor.</P>
    <P>In regard to transport, I do not know of any transport being abused in the Midland Health Board area.  Only medical cardholders have transport in the Midland Health Board area.  I can assure the Minister that it was well checked out before transport was given to anybody.</P>
    <P>In regard to the care of the aged, the people who are looking after community care will have to go around the health board areas to see who is fit to go home.  Some of these people have no homes to go to because some of them are over 80, but if they are able to walk out of hospital they will have to go.  I do not want to paint a very black picture and I hope I am not doing that but that is the position in my area.  At a recent meeting the health board said they would not be able to give the same services as last year unless they received £400,000 more.  As I said earlier, it is only an estimate.  I can see expenditure increasing before the end of this year by another half a million and I would not be surprised if it went up to a million pounds.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Health and the officials of his Department, whatever cuts are brought about, will not tamper with the welfare of the patients. Money from other Departments should have been channelled into the Department of Health to keep the services up to last year's standard.  I hope that common sense will prevail and that no drastic cuts will be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this financial allocation for the health services, the Minister accused many of us at Question Time of political propaganda in relation to the cutbacks that may take place in the financial allocations made by him to health boards.  On the one hand the Minister is still stating that there will not be any cutbacks in services, and on the other hand that there will be and has to be <Col N="1267" /> an elimination of overtime, that people on holidays will not be allowed to have a locum, people who are sick will not be allowed to have locums provided for them.  Is that not in effect a cut-back in the level of service?  In some rural areas it will mean a complete elimination of medical cover in many respects.</P>
      <P>The Minister accused us initially of making political capital out of the fact that sufficient money was not being provided to have a level of service in 1976 compared with what was there in 1975.  We have had health board meetings all over the country and many of the CEOs have gone into print and stated quite clearly that with the allocations they have received they cannot survive and give the same kind of service in 1976 as in 1975.  Some of them, particulary in the north-west, say that there has to be a 6 per cent cutback in the 1975 level service.  Those are not my words but the words of the Minister's chief executive officers administering health services on the Minister's behalf.  The allocation, as it is known, is going to mean an effective 6 per cent cutback, and this does not take into account the rise in wages that may and will come according to the Minister for Labour's statement over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister not going to allow the health boards to pay the increased cost of wages if they come, which they must?  There is no provision either for any increase in commodity prices which the Minister knows well are going to rise at least 10 to 15 per cent in the course of this year.  What will our health boards do then?  Are they not to buy the required medical goods for distribution, let them be medicines or materials needed for all the hospital services?  The Minister in his circular letter to the health boards, HSG 354, stated that it was his intention to implement section 31 of the Health Act, 1970 so as to fix the limit of expenditure which may be incurred by health boards in 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the dictatorial attitude that has many people involved in the operation of the health services very worried.  If this section is operated, <Col N="1268" /> bearing in mind the fact that there must be wage increases and also commodity price increases, and the Minister knows well there will be, he is being dictatorial in relation to his side, that the health boards will not be allowed over-expend on the financial allocation given to them by him.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to give way to Deputy Haughey.  I would like to be allowed one final word.  We are all concerned about the unemployment level, and the Government have a £600 million capital programme allocation for this year.  The total amount for capital works allocated to health is £11 million.  Is the Minister satisfied?  I do not think he should be.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, attempts have been made to introduce irrelevancies into the discussion on this motion which we have put forward.  Three different sorts of irrelevancies have been introduced. First, the economic recession has been put forward as the scapegoat.  Indeed, the Minister for Health in replying to this motion on financial provision for the health services in 1976 talked a great deal about the world economic recession and the economic recession in this country.  I want to suggest that the economic recession, either in the world at large or in this country, has nothing whatsoever to do with this motion.  We are concerned in this motion with the financial disposition of the Exchequer for health during 1976.  We could deal with this problem in regard to the health services entirely within the context of the existing budgetary provisions.  If the proper priorities were adhered to by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health this problem that we are highlighting in this motion could be dealt with and settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also had trotted out the old reliable that the new regional health boards are unworldy, bureaucratic institutions and that is where <Col N="1269" /> all our troubles lie.  Allied to that is the argument that there is a great deal of abuse of the existing services and therefore our resources are being wasted.  Always in times of cutback of this sort you will find some Colonel Blimp type of person leaping to his feet and complaining that there is scandalous waste in the administration of the services, as we have in the case of the Southern Health Board's taxis. The whole trouble in our health board services apparently emanates from the over-use of a few taxis down in County Cork and County Kerry.  I think Deputy John O'Leary dealt satisfactorily with that.</P>
    <P>If there is excessive bureaucratic machinery, if there is abuse and waste of the health services, there should be a continuing, ongoing process to deal with that situation.  I suggest it has nothing whatsoever to do, except in a remote and indirect way, with the problem to which we are directing our attention in this motion.  We are not concerned with the fundamental restructuring of the health services. We are not concerned with the long-term financial implications of the health services as part of our budgetary problems.  They are important matters, and perhaps if this crisis does nothing except focus attention on the need for some thinking about them by the Minister and his Department, it will have served some purpose. They are matters which should engage the attention of this House and its Departments at another time in another way.  What this motion is concerned with is the immediate critical situation which confronts us now, in 1976, in regard to the specific financial implications for 1976, and nothing else.  It is no good Deputy O'Connell coming in here, decent, honest and sincere person though he is, and trying to divert the argument into these channels.  That is not what is relevant or what we are concerned with.  We are concerned with the cutting out in 1976, starting now, with urgent essential health services, basic services to which this community is entitled and must have, and which it is the duty of any competent Government to provide.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> By all means let us have all-party committees of the House to look into the health services, restructuring of the regional health boards, in-depth examination of the relationship between the cost of health services and the GNP, all very useful and important, but not concerned with the situation that is confronting Dáil Éireann now in 1976 in regard to fundamental community services and to the essential care of sick people in our hospitals, because that is what we are concerned with here.  What the hospitals want to know is, are they going to get adequate budgets to enable them to carry out a normal service during the coming year?  What the health boards and the programme managers want to know is, are they going to get the funds to enable them to carry through their basic programmes during 1976?  That is the key question and that is what this motion is all about, and nothing else.</P>
    <P>The secretary of the Department of Health stated categorically to the CEOs, and indirectly to the health boards, that section 31 is going to be invoked and not another penny is going to be forthcoming and that the moneys which are now allocated and made available are all that is going to be produced.  There is no good in the Minister waffling here and giving us all sorts of irrelevant statistics and percentages.  The fact is we know the figures of the allocation.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of the Department has said that those figures will be adhered to.  We know further that the basic essential services cannot be provided on the basis of those allocations.  Speaking about the CEO's and the regional health boards the Minister said that they should be able to maintain services at the existing levels with the allocations they have been given.</P>
    <P>In this context let me quote the CEO of the Eastern Health Board who said:</P>
    <P>...the Board is accordingly faced with the task of securing a major reduction of £3.72 million in expenditure in 1976 and it is clear that the level of services must be affected</P>
    <P>Either he or the Minister is correct and he is the man on the job.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> Paragraph 11 of the Department's letter stresses that adequate provision must be made to support certain items throughout the whole of 1976.  It is clear that it would not be possible to achieve a reduction of £3.72 million in our estimate of £10.29 million.  It is difficult, therefore, to see how the Board can avoid reducing the level of services including staff numbers and the payments to extern agencies.</P>
    <P>Is this man a fool or is he a competent reliable official?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is dated 19th January, 1976.  He is not alone in that.  The CEO of the Southern Health Board, who, presumably, is equally honest and competent says:</P>
      <P>The cut-back of expenditure of close on £1 million to meet the cost of existing services cannot be achieved by minor economies here and there....</P>
      <P>It is not merely a question of postponing some little bit of painting, for instance.  He continues:</P>
      <P>It will necessitate quite severe measures and no area of the Board's service can fully escape their consequences. It is necessary that this situation should be clearly understood by everyone....</P>
      <P>He might have added the words &ldquo;and the Minister for Health&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Board has been able with the moneys available to pursue a steady programme of improvement of services over a number of years.  The changed position in which it now finds itself is that not alone is there no money for new services of any kind but a severe cut-back in spending on present services must be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CEO of every other health board has made the same sort of report.  These are reports based on the figures before them.  Therefore it is totally dishonest for the Minister to pretend here that somehow or other this situation will be attended to.  I have heard nothing from the Minister which in any way would deflect Dáil <Col N="1272" /> Éireann from passing this motion.  The Minister has talked a great deal about the economic situation and about various irrelevant matters.  He has given us percentages for the years but these do not in any way affect the validity of the motion before us.  It is clear that our health services, on the basis of the allocations made, are facing a major dislocation this year.  The provisions that have been made are totally inadequate and there is no way in which they can permit the services being maintained at their present levels.</P>
    <P>The voluntary hospitals in this city and elsewhere are in a state of total disarray.  Medical staffs, nurses and lay staffs are all threatened either with dismissal notices or are facing serious interference in their working conditions and their hours of duty.  The budgets that have been put before the managements of these hospitals are clearly inadequate to meet the basic needs for the coming year.  That would not be too bad if they could be assured that somewhere during the year they would be rescued but we know from the Secretary of the Department that there will be no additional moneys provided.  We want the additional moneys provided now or, at least, promised now.</P>
    <P>Last night I gave details of the shortfalls in the operating budgets of each health board, starting with £3.72 million for the Eastern Health Board. We know that the various deficits are those which are only obvious on paper at this stage but with increasing VAT, increases in wages and taking into account all sorts of contingencies and emergencies these deficits will be increased considerably.  The allocations will result in curtailment, reductions and closedowns, as I indicated last night.</P>
    <P>I could elaborate again on the various aspects of the services that will be interfered with.  One such area will be the basic humanitarian community service such as meals-on-wheels, free milk for children and so on.  One of my colleagues here told me of an incident which occurred a couple of days ago in an old person's home in Ennis when an old person of 80 was ordered out by the authorities and <Col N="1273" /> had to go home to live in a cottage with an elderly unmarried brother.  This is the sort of thing we are talking about here.  We are not concerned with normal economies.  We agree with good budgeting and with effecting savings, but we are concerned at the cutbacks and the restrictions that will result in positive hardship and suffering and which will interfere with the standard of medical care that our people will receive.  This situation is resulting in those dedicated humanitarian people engaged in the health services being driven to engage in mean, despicable, shabby experiences, and in brutal and uncaring things in order to endeavour to operate within their budgets.</P>
    <P>I extend again an invitation to the Labour Party backbenchers, who down through the years have been telling us of their great humanitarian and social principles, of their concern for the poor and for the underprivileged.  In particular, when Fianna Fáil were in office we heard this hail of consideration for the poor and weaker sections. Now is their opportunity to show that they really meant those statements.  I know that there is none of them present at the moment, but at least that decent, honest man, Deputy O'Connell, had the courage to come in and talk about the motion.  We on this side of the House have not enough <Col N="1274" /> voting strength to make the Government do their duty, to make them provide simple, basic elementary health services for the people.</P>

We cannot do much because of our voting strength but if three or four of those Labour Deputies who always maintained their great humanity vote for us on this motion we would make the Government do their duty.  We would stop the Government putting out meals-on-wheels, closing down hospital wards and puttng old men out of homes.  If the Labour Deputies would stand by their principles Dáil Éireann would show that it is the protector of the weak and the disabled sections of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this question again because I was not satisfied with the answer I got from the Parliamentary Secretary.  In the first instance he stated that the signing centre was in a licensed premises. That is not correct.  It was a hall away from the licensed premises.  This hall is used for social functions, dances and so on, and obviously is not and could not be licensed.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated that the new centre was only half a mile from the old centre.  Again that is not right.  Perhaps it is, as the crow flies, but going along the road to the new centre is slightly more than a mile. I had this test carried out this afternoon and got the information later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old centre was on the main Glencar road in a most central position. Seventy-five per cent of the people <Col N="1277" /> signing there came from a point south of that line.  Now they are asked to go a further mile to the new centre.  At the old centre many people came from Cloone, seven miles away, Bridg, six miles, and Shronehree, five miles.  On the west side from Curravagha, seven miles, from Droumalonhert, six miles, and Dreenereigh, five miles.  To the east Derrinafena is six miles and Coose is four miles.  Those are the distances from the old centre and now a further mile has been added.</P>
    <P>Many years back I tried on various occasions to get a second signing centre on the south side at Boheseal, which would be much nearer for the majority of the people.  This centre at Lyranes was picked as the most central between north and south Glencar.  If the Parliamentary Secretary insists on having the new centre as the centre of operations we will have to press for another centre at Boheseal.  This will mean two centres.</P>
    <P>There is no waiting accommodation at the new centre.  People have to wait on the roadside for the Garda car to arrive.  This is a mountainous area, rough and rugged, and in winter time is subject to extreme storms and rain.  The old centre was heated and the people could wait inside until the gardaí came.  Many people have to walk to this centre and cannot arrange to arrive just as the Garda car comes.  They have to be there long before the car arrives because the gardaí do not spend very long there.  If the information I have is correct, these people are now being asked to stand on the roadway and wait for the gardaí to arrive.  To my mind this is scandalous.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this is a political move and nothing else.  If it is in order to add the words &ldquo;political chicanery&rdquo; that is what I would call it.  I represent those people in this House.  I am trying to get the best terms for them and this kind of manoeuvre is not helpful.  At this stage I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have another look at this matter and let the people sign at the old centre which was the most convenient.</P>
    <P>I am compelled to give it the publicity <Col N="1278" /> it deserves in the local papers because, as I said, it is a political move.  It is extraordinary that it followed a political meeting held about three weeks earlier.  It was an unwise move and made things difficult for the people concerned whose interests have not been taken into account.</P>
    <P>That is the reason I object to this move.  I do not often raise matters in this House.  I can accept most things once I see reason in them but this is and has been unreasonable.  No excuse can be made for it.  The statements made by the Parliamentary Secretary do not add up in this situation.  I think the matter deserves the widest possible publication; it is unwise and unfair to the people concerned, not in their interests, but to suit the interests of political people, something which should not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to relate the facts of this case after listening to the contribution of the Deputy representing this constituency because these facts bear little relation to what the Deputy said.  This is the first time since taking office that I have been here on the Adjournment.  I find it incredible that a Deputy should seek to have an issue of this nature raised on the Adjournment.  I think I should be here on the Adjournment for the reason that it took me nearly three years to discover that this type of operation was going on under the jurisdiction of the Department of Social Welfare.  That is why I should be here, not because Deputy O'Connor is trying to ensure the continuance of this operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are that this arrangement was made in 1959 and it has continued up to now when it came to the notice of the Department.  They immediately recommended that it should be discontinued and I agree entirely.  As regards the people who are signing there, there are approximately 70 unemployment assistance and nine unemployment benefit cases.  Most of them, as the Deputy has confirmed by giving distances that the majority will have to travel, will have to go to the post <Col N="1279" /> office because they are postal cases and would have to go there to cash their orders in any case.  So, there is no imposition on them and the Deputy must be aware of that.</P>
    <P>This hall is situated within 12 feet of a licensed premises and is owned by the owner of the licensed premises and connected with an overhead electric cable so that there is no doubt that it is all part of the one operation. When we notified the owner that we were discontinuing this operation, which was highly objectionable, he offered, in the interests of the local people, to allow it to continue rent-free. I appreciate his public minded attitude.  Deputy O'Connor has said that these people will now have to wait outside in inclement weather and this gentleman by offering this rent-free accommodation would save them from that.  There is no question of people having to stay out in inclement weather and Deputy O'Connor, with his obvious intimate knowledge of the whole arrangement must know that.  The arrangement which has been made will mean that the people will not now have to come and wait for the guards to arrive for the signing; they can go to the post office to which they must go in any case to cash their money orders. The postmistress is there during normal post office hours and there is no question of having to wait around for anybody.  Deputy O'Connor must know that.</P>
    <P>I had thought of just giving the bare facts of this case but Deputy O'Connor raised the question of political motivation and used the expression &ldquo;political chicanery&rdquo;.  If one examines how this arrangement came about and was allowed to continue over the years and the fact that Deputy O'Connor has me here on the Adjournment trying to ensure that it will continue in the future, I do not think one would be left in much doubt as to where the political chicanery, interest and motivation lie.  They do not lie with me.  I know none of the people concerned, neither the recipients nor the gentleman in question; I would not know him if I met him in the corridor. But I know that we saw fit to commemorate by a stamp this year <Col N="1280" /> the centenary of a man who did away with the practice of people being paid in pubs 60 years ago in this city.  Any responsible holder of my position, once an operation like this comes to his attention, must ensure that it is discontinued.  All that disturbs me this evening is the thought that there may be other operations of this type of which I am not aware, but I can assure the House and Deputy O'Connor that I shall make it my business to find out if there are other such operations and, if there are, they will be stopped irrespective of where they are.</P>
    <P>There is no inconvenience involved for the people concerned; the new arrangement can only be to their advantage. I checked this afternoon and I am assured that the distance involved is a half mile.  I am also assured that the physical separation between the public house and this hall is 12 feet; it is all part and parcel of the one complex.  To say the very least, it is highly undesirable that men should be brought into that situation in circumstances, as Deputy O'Connor says, where they may have to wait for the patrol car to come around.  All these drawbacks are being removed by the changing of this arrangement to the post office.  I am convinced that not only does it not cause any inconvenience but for the sake of the people themselves, their families and society as a whole, this type of operation, wherever it exists, should cease as soon as it is discovered.</P>
    <P>I have absolutely no apologies to make.  I regret very much that Deputy O'Connor saw fit to introduce the political chicanery element.  It was not my intention to deal with it on that basis but seeing that he did raise it I do not think he would have to go very far.  I would question his particular motives in bringing me here on the Adjournment tonight to try and perpetuate a system of that nature.</P>

      <P>Unemployment assistance was not refused in this case.  The person concerned is being paid such assistance at the rate appropriate to his weekly rate of means as assessed by a deciding officer.  He has appealed against the deciding officer's decision <Col N="1174" /> and in connection with his appeal it has been necessary to make further inquiries regarding his means.  Every effort is being made to have these inquiries completed following which the case will be submitted without delay to an appeals officer for consideration.</P>

      <P>, <i>Cavan</i>): With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 to 69 together.  A scheme to enable the 17 families named to transfer from Turbot Island to the mainland has been approved by the Government.  So far six suitable plots on which it is hoped to house seven or eight families have been located on the mainland and arrangements are currently being made to purchase these plots.  The particular families to be housed on these sites have not yet been selected. Efforts to locate other suitable sites are continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Construction of the houses will commence as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made after the execution of the legal transfer of the plots to Land Commission.  One of the islanders has purchased his own <Col N="1178" /> site on the mainland and has been authorised to commence building. Another is interested also in building his own house and definite proposals to this end are awaited.</P>

      <P>I presume that by &ldquo;parole&rdquo; the Deputy means &ldquo;temporary release&rdquo; as provided for in the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.</P>
      <P>Prisoners are allowed temporary release in a variety of circumstances. Thus, temporary releases have been allowed for such occasions as weddings, illnesses of near relatives and bereavements, Christenings and First Communions of children, to enable the offender to sit for examinations, to be interviewed for employment or to attend to urgent business.  The system is used most frequently, however, to enable offenders to take up employment, to help with the resocialisation programmes for long-term offenders and to permit offenders to be with their families at Christmas.</P>
      <P>Daily release to employment is frequently allowed for an offender towards the end of his sentence.  There must be reasonable grounds for expecting that the offender will be well conducted and the availability of suitable employment is an important factor.  Full temporary release whereby the offender lives outside the prison at home, in a hostel or in lodgings is a further phase to which a prisoner on day-to-day release for employment may progress.</P>
      <P>The general conditions which apply to offenders who are allowed temporary release are prescribed in the various statutory instruments listed hereunder.  The offender is also subject to supervision by a welfare officer and to such additional conditions as may be appropriate in each individual case.</P>
      <P>The statement herewith gives details of temporary releases under various headings for the years 1973-1975.</P>
