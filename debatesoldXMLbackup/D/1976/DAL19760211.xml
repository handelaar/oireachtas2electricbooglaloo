    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, provides that pay differences based on sex are eliminated from the 1st January of this year.  Wherever a case can be made that like work or work of equal value is being performed in an undertaking, equal pay as between the sexes must apply.  Despite the fact that we spent many days debating the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, in this House that fundamental feature of it, as described in the definition I have just given, has been widely misunderstood. Some commentators apparently think that the 1974 Act purports to legislate equal pay as a principle in itself that would operate in all conceivable circumstances.  I repeat, the Act purports to eliminate discrimination in pay between the sexes where such differences have no rationale other than sex differences and where the work is similar and of equal value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1645" /> The core of the present amendment provides the right where the employees of an undertaking are convinced that job loss would be a consequence of the implementation of the 1974 Act to agree to a postponement for a limited period of the full application of the 1974 legislation.  Even where there is this agreement on the part of trade unions in the workplace, the Labour Court must also accept that there is a genuine basis for exemption from the terms of the 1974 Act.</P>
    <P>To come within the scope of the amending Bill, three conditions will have to be fulfilled: firstly, the trade unions and employers will need to agree formally that the introduction of the principle of equal pay in the business would lead to unemployment; secondly, the workers involved will have to be employed in a business where the application of equal pay would lead to loss of employment or affect the financial viability of the undertaking; and thirdly, the Labour Court will, after investigation, have to authenticate the agreement of the trade unions and employers.</P>
    <P>The application of the stringent conditions included in this Bill will ensure that the 1974 Act will operate in all save a minority of cases.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the background to this amendment.  Early in 1975 when asked whether the recession would delay the implementation of our equal pay plans, I made it clear that I would take into consideration any representations of a joint character made by unions and managements relating to repercussions on employment arising out of the equal pay legislation. Such joint representations were not made to me until the 9th September, 1975.  On that date, management and unions in the footwear industry supported a joint request for a delay in the implementation of the 1974 measure based on their fear of its impact on the employment position of their industry.  Since there has been a good deal of controversy surrounding the appearance of this amendment, some based on genuine misunderstanding, I want to place it on the record once more what was <Col N="1646" /> requested in September and how the request was dealt with.</P>
    <P>In their letter of the 8th, the joint secretaries of the joint industrial council, writing for the unions and managements in that industry, having outlined the effect of the implementation of equal pay in their industry, went on to say: &ldquo;Therefore, it was unanimously agreed by all parties to defer discussion on this matter until July, 1976, and to request you to amend the legislation if necessary in order to permit the industry to take this action&rdquo;.  Their letter concluded: &ldquo;We would be glad to have your confirmation that our agreement can be implemented within the law&rdquo;.  The meeting of the joint industrial council which reached the conclusion referred to in this letter was chaired by the chief conciliation officer of the Labour Court, Mr. Diarmaid Mac Diarmada.</P>
    <P>The court on my request, with the aid of assessors, examined the joint request of the footwear industry.  The Labour Court's report, based on examination by the assessors, was received by me on 16th December.  The court found that between 500 and 700 jobs would be lost if the 1974 Act were to be implemented.  It was on the basis of this report that the Taoiseach announced our intention to introduce an amendment to take account of other similar situations that might arise to that of the footwear industry.</P>
    <P>The amendment makes no reference to the public service.  The terms of the 1974 Act can apply to the public service as from 1st January.  The Minister for the Public Service has indicated that he is anxious to enter into discussion with the public service unions to phase out existing marriage differentials in pay.</P>
    <P>An application has been submitted to the European Commission under the provisions of Article 135 of the Act of Accession.  This article provides that a member state may apply for authorisation to introduce protective measures if before 31st December, 1977, difficulties arise which &ldquo;are serious and liable to persist in any sector of the economy or which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a given area&rdquo;<Col N="1647" /> The Commission have been informed that in the Government's view the measures proposed in this Bill would prevent a worsening of the employment situation in certain undertakings. Should the Commission turn down our request for derogation, as they are fully entitled to do under the Treaty, I want to make it clear that the terms of the 1974 legislation will operate without qualification.</P>
    <P>This amending Bill makes it clear that no employer may avail of the amending process without the agreement of the organised workers.  There can be no question of an employer going it alone to get an exemption from the terms of the 1974 Act.  In addition, where an employer seeks to avail of the amending process there is provision in the amendment that this will constitute immediate recognition on his part that the workers in question are entitled to equal pay. Furthermore, should the Labour Court refuse exemption, then equal pay must be paid retrospective to the 1st January, 1976.</P>
    <P>An unfortunate consequence of many of the comments and arguments on the issue of equal pay has been the fact that the impression has been created that large sectors of Irish industry would be exempt from the provisions of the Equal Pay Act, 1974.  I think it will be clear, both from what I have said and an examination of the amendment before the House, that its conditions are such that the terms of the 1974 Act will operate save in those exceptional circumstances which the amending Bill is designed to meet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>Two years all but a few weeks have elapsed since the same Minister introduced what he called the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill, 1974.  We referred to that title at that time as not being acceptable. Today we have an Anti-Discrimination (Pay) (Amendment) Bill, 1975. The Minister's contribution was short and obviously his heart was not in it. Since last September or October we have had a shabby backwards and forwards topsy-turvy yo-yo situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is basing this postponement <Col N="1648" /> on the private sector.  He is using alleged difficulties, imagined difficulties, difficulties he has not investigated and of which he is not aware, to get the Government off the hook of their commitment to the public sector which is not covered in this amending Bill.  I will now endeavour to refute the only argument the Minister has offered, a hurriedly prepared one and one I have already challenged him to investigate.  Obviously up to now he has not done so.</P>
    <P>He said he had a report from the footwear industry.  For his benefit I will tell him a little bit about it.  He has used this report as an excuse for introducing this amending Bill.  This is not acceptable to us.  Even the Labour Court have reservations in their findings.  The situation in the footwear industry is that agreement was reached last June that discussions on equal pay would be postponed until June of this year.  This would not deter individuals from pursuing a claim if they felt justified.</P>
    <P>It should be noted&mdash;and this is where the Minister has fallen down &mdash;that in the footwear industry equal pay for equal work has existed for very many years, in fact for 20 years. If a woman does the same operation as a man she is paid the rate for that operation.  The area of negotiation which was left over until this year is a further extension which is not covered in this Bill.  I can prove to the Minister that the argument he is using is absolutely incorrect.  It was hurriedly rushed to him and to the Taoiseach on the morning of 18th December when it was decided that equal pay, on which we were all agreed in principle and in spirit almost two years ago, should be postponed.</P>
    <P>No research was done by the Minister on the report on the footwear industry which apparently is the only report available to him.  Surely that is further proof of the Minister's lack of knowledge of the entire situation in the private sector.  I expected the Minister to give statistics this morning of the number of people who would be affected by the introduction of equal pay in the private sector.  I expected him to say that so many women <Col N="1649" /> workers would qualify for increased payments.  In other words, I expected him to try to establish what it would cost in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Proof of this lack of research into the situation is the fact that, prior to making the announcement on 18th December, the Minister did not consult with the Women's Representative Committee of which my colleague, Deputy Desmond, is chairman.  He did not consult with the Congress of Trade Unions, and one would have felt that he might have.  Strangely enough, the only people we strongly suspect he did consult with were the employers' organisations.  If it was as a result of pressure from those organisations that he acted hurriedly on an ill-prepared report on the footwear industry to postpone equal pay and, of course, using it as an excuse for reneging on and betraying the spirit, the principle and the agreed content of the 1974 Bill with regard to the public sector then this Bill betrays in every respect the earlier committed legislation. This is a betrayal of the spirit of that Bill, a Bill passed without opposition, by both Houses of the Oireachtas away back in March, April and May of 1974.</P>
    <P>Political parties have from time to time been accused of reneging on election promises but this is possibly the first time in our history that legislation has been reneged on by a Minister and by the Government of the day and the irony of it is that this betrayal is being done 18 to 24 months after the 1974 measure was put on the Statute Book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt, but I want to inform the Deputy that the terms of the 1974 Act apply fully to the civil service.  I made that statement this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that and, since the Minister has interrupted me, perhaps I ought to clear it with him now.  Despite any white-washing the Minister, his Government or anybody outside this House may try to do, the tenet of the 1974 legislation was the elimination of the discrimination that existed in the public <Col N="1650" /> sector.  I defy anybody to contradict that this was what was agreed in that legislation.  The Minister had our support on it.  I will go further&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can imagine the Minister's discomfort and his dilemma this morning and his anxiety because of that to interrupt me.  He knows full well that he and his colleagues have turned a complete somersault in this respect and are using this amending legislation to try to whitewash the major betrayal being perpetrated.  It is a major betrayal whether the Minister likes it or not or whether he tries to convey another impression.  Not alone is the Minister not doing what he promised to do but he is now going back on his promise and creating a compromise.  Does Deputy Desmond like the sound of the word &ldquo;compromise&rdquo;?  Because of compromise the Minister is now creating far greater discrimination than existed in the public sector and I am putting that on the record.  The Minister is now trying to argue that the Bill we supported did not contain what I am talking about.  The fact is that the rate for the job was to be the rate.  I understand we are now establishing in the public sector three different rates.  Let there be no doubt one year's salary would be payable about that.  Let there be no contradiction <Col N="1651" /> of that.  This is the Minister's betrayal.</P>
      <P>The first question is why this is being done and the answer to all sensible people is patently obvious.  It is because of the inability and reluctance of the Government to formulate an economic plan to provide for the needs of the country.  It is not enough to say the country cannot afford the money required.  It is the duty of the elected Government to provide funds and create the economic climate to generate those funds in the public and private sector.  The failure of the Government to do so is becoming patently obvious in every area of government and not just in the area of equal pay.  It may be asked what we would do about it.  My reply is that, if we were over there, we would never have allowed this situation to have arisen.  Secondly, having introduced legislation, we would not have reneged on it.  We would not have shirked our responsibility.  We would not have sought to blame everybody else for the situation that has arisen because of the mismanagement of the economy by the Government.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that under this Government the weaker sections, if one may so describe them, are suffering in all areas at the moment.  One need only look at the areas of health and local government for further evidence to support the point I make. Equal pay is a moral right.  It is also a legal right.  It is binding on the Government under both European and international law.  Equal pay for work of equal value is the accepted criteria and Fianna Fáil will oppose any dilution or any abolition of this right.  If there is one area above another in which the present Government excel it is in the field of headline legislation but, when one reads the small print, it is not so appealing or so attractive as the headlines would lead one to believe and the late news is ofttimes damning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me now trace the events leading up to the introduction of the 1974 legislation.  Nobody was more debonair, except perhaps Deputy Desmond, than the Minister in alleging Fianna Fáil's indifference to the introduction <Col N="1652" /> of social reform.  On many occasions on many platforms, at Labour Party conferences and elsewhere, at conventions of all sorts, all sorts of goodies were promised.  All sorts of reforms were adumbrated in the 14-point plan. The women of Ireland came to regard the present Minister for Labour as their saviour and their champion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy:</NameTxt>
      <P>And that in leap year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>In leap year. How disappointing it must be for them and him now.  The first positive steps taken in this area were taken in 1970 when the Commission on the Status of Women was set up under a Fianna Fáil Government.  An interim report was requested and in 1971 this interim report was accepted by the then Fianna Fáil Government.  As a result of that the first positive steps were taken towards equal pay in the national wage agreement of 1972 and these were followed by more positive steps in subsequent wage agreements. It was a sound step by step approach laying the foundation for the achievement of something and it was, of course, therefore, understandable that we would subsequently support the Bill introduced by the Minister in 1974.  The Minister cannot deny that steps were being taken, and had been taken, in this direction long before he took his place in the present Ministry.  Contrast that step by step solid approach with the present comings and goings in the Minister's approach to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in this House this morning, both by his contribution and interruptions, tried to shirk the agreed and accepted commitment to the employees in the public sector.  When this Bill first came before the House Deputy Dowling pointed out many weaknesses in it.  He was promised that in a matter of weeks the Minister would introduce further legislation to buttress the 1974 Bill.  No more was heard of that Bill.  No more was heard of the buttressing and supporting legislation until, prior to the Mayo by-election in October last year when we heard the usual propaganda.  I appreciate the Minister for Posts and <Col N="1653" /> Telegraphs smiling because he is the director of this propaganda machine and he clearly remembers it.  The Minister introduced the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill, 1975&mdash;we have had so many Bills with Long Titles that it is getting very confusing&mdash;it has not been and probably will not be discussed again during the life of the present Government.  Approximately seven weeks later in this House a Minister on behalf of the Minister for Labour announced that there would be a postponement of equal pay.  In other words, the 1974 Bill was now being postponed, and the new Bill which had been introduced in 1975 was left on the stocks, as has so much other legislation, by the Minister concerned. As I said, there is a very sharp contrast between the step by step positive approach of Fianna Fáil and the backwards-forwards activities of the Minister.</P>
    <P>For the first time in our history legislation is being introduced by a Minister in this great Government which promised us reform but which will take us back two years, if not further.  Social reform is not just a matter of increased benefits and social welfare.  It also extends to the abolition of social and legal anomalies.  Much lip service has been paid to this by some of the Ministers and by at least one Deputy.  The continuation of pay discrimination and the creation of even more discrimination is an example of the type of anomaly which still exists.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister of what he said on 5th March, 1974, at column 2036 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I often have the impression that there is too little recognition as yet in the country of the social obligations of our membership of the European Community.  Every member country of the Community has legislation on equal pay.  The Netherlands, who were the only country without such legislation, have now decided to introduce it.  As a member country of the EEC it is in the national interest to work towards the development of a comprehensive social policy in the Community, a <Col N="1654" /> policy of a comprehensive kind that would animate all the other decisions of the Community.  Despite difficulties which the Community is presently encountering the Government will continue to work towards the objective of a Community which accords the same status to the requirements of social policy as to economic policy.  It would, therefore, be inconsistent on our part to delay implementation of legislation on this matter.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister listened carefully to that final sentence.  He said that two years ago, and now he is doing what he said should not be done. There are other quotes which were made at a later stage and which were also very interesting.  Deputy Mrs. Desmond raised a question of the reinstatement of a dismissed woman employee.  Subsequently the Minister informed the House that further legislation would be brought before us very quickly in order to close any loopholes or solve any problems which may be created for an employee in certain circumstances.  This legislation was introduced in October, 1975, but has now disappeared, for the life of the present Dáil at least.</P>
    <P>This amending Bill is merely a major bluff, a whitewashing and a covering over of the real issue.  I suspect that one of the more brilliant financial members of the Cabinet, looking around desperately for ways of saving pounds, saw that a major saving could be effected if they somersaulted on their commitment to the public sector and used the inadequacies, which the Minister admitted were in the Bill, to make the public sector accept less than was originally intended.  The fact that we will create further discrimination was not a matter of concern.  The concern was that here was a saving and in order to support the action of the Government some of the Ministers were let loose to make speeches in various places. Last week in this House we had a responsible Minister, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, commenting on the fact that the public sector had got too much of an increase, too many increases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> If that is the position the Government, as an employer involved in the national wage agreement negotiations, and particularly in recent times with the inflationary trends created by them, must accept full responsibility. Even if this was so it could not justify a change of attitude or a reneging on legislation.  It would not justify them depriving people of an agreed entitlement, of a commitment to them on pay or otherwise.  I could go into great detail on the anomalies that will be created in the public sector, and I am sure there is no need for me to explain to the enlightened Members the discriminations that have been created.  I can see the embarrassment on the face of Deputy Barry Desmond; I know he agrees with all I have to say in this regard.  We must realise that for the healthy functioning of a democracy it is essential that the Government retain the support and confidence of its administrative arm, the civil service.  Without such confidence and support the drive, energy, enthusiasm and dedication of this sector can be undermined.</P>
    <P>The amendment now proposed relates to the private sector and there is no reference in the Bill to reneging on the public sector.  However, it is my view that this is specifically designed as a white-washing operation; it is a postponement of the principle, the spirit and the agreed content of a Bill passed by this House.  Nobody, not even the members of the Minister's party, will accept the truth of the interruption made by him at an earlier stage this morning.  I feel sure that the Minister's statement will not be accepted by any members of his party because it is a denial of what we all accepted was contained in the Bill.  There was a necessity for further support legislation in order to strengthen that Bill.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see how the support any Government needs from the civil service can be retained when at every turn of the screw&mdash;I refer in particular to the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce&mdash;a Minister is prepared to use the public service as a scapegoat for the Government's failure.  Obviously, some members of <Col N="1656" /> the Labour Party feel it is necessary to pay lip service to their socialist ideology; the equal pay question offered such an opportunity.  On the one hand, they had to demonstrate that there was still a left wing in the Coalition while, on the other hand, they could not push an issue of principle too far lest they bring down the Government.  The role of knight in armour was cast upon the ample shoulders of Deputy Barry Desmond, the Government assistant Whip.  He grasped the opportunity eagerly although he must have known that he was only a pawn in a much broader Government strategy, to show the nation that this Government allow their members an opportunity to take their own stand in matters of principle, provided always that they agree to the compromise formula which lets the Government off the hook.</P>
    <P>Here we have nothing more than a compromise, and Deputy Barry Desmond must know that.  If he and his comrades are sincere then the only logical course for them is to vote with Fianna Fáil against the Bill and try to preserve a last vestige of integrity for the Labour Party.  I should like to refer to the discriminations created in and the anomalies in the public sector. We have many single people of both sexes who have given many years of service to the State and its institutions. More is demanded of them now than at any time previously.  Yet, people, perhaps long their juniors, because of a marital status, can now have more money than they and can probably also have more leave of absence, for various reasons.  If there is travelling involved the person in the lower wage bracket, because of his or her marital status, may have to travel instead of the married person.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said, the private sector is covered in the amendment.  The amendment is unworkable and impracticable and it was only introduced for the specific purpose I mentioned earlier.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have said it is unacceptable and that means there is no way in which it can work.</P>
      <P>Last week Deputy O'Kennedy put down a question on the Order Paper but despite the fact that there was an announcement regarding this amendment on 18th December it was only on Thursday last that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General went to Europe to discuss with the people there the turnabout by his Government.  They sought the permission of the Commission for a delay in the implementation of equal pay.  It is strange that it coincided with Deputy O'Kennedy's questions in this House&mdash;probably there is some connection.  One would have thought that the first steps to be taken before 18th December were, first, a meeting and discussion with the Women's Representative Committee; secondly, a discussion with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions pointing out the difficulties being faced; and, thirdly, a discussion with the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is very vague.  When it is being debated on Committee Stage we will point out in detail its inadequacies and vagueness.  If there are problems in the private sector it would have been advisable to consider ways and means of supporting the industries concerned. I see grave dangers here.  As the Minister knows, equal pay for work of equal value does not apply to every man and woman or to every boy or girl who work in the same factory. It may apply only to a small number even in a work place where numbers are high.  If a scare situation is created, if genuine fears are felt by some people who are not affected by equal pay, are <Col N="1661" /> they entitled to vote in a decision that possibly might mean withholding equal pay from ten or 20 people in that large work force?  These question have not been answered.</P>
    <P>This morning it appears there is a certain confusion between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Labour regarding the case being pursued in Brussels.  Will the Minister state what case has been made?  Has it been as badly prepared as the statement issued this morning by the Minister?  What industries have been mentioned to the Commission, how many people are concerned and what specific firms are involved?  I have already pointed out the inaccuracies in the report on the footwear industry, a report that should not have been used as a reason for the present amendment. Will the Minister state if an investigation was carried out into any other industry, either with regard to the area concerned or to individual companies employing large numbers? Was it the case that the Minister conceded because of the pressure exerted by the employers?  If there is a problem it is the duty of the State to assist in the matter.  As the Minister rightly said, the longer something like this is postponed the greater reluctance there will be on the part of employers, firms and companies to implement it and the more likely are they to seek avenues for opting out.  I agree with the Minister completely and for that reason I submit his approach should have been on a completely different line.</P>
    <P>I accept, of course, that the Minister was committed genuinely.  He has my sympathy for having to carry the can on behalf of a Government who have failed, something which nobody can deny, But could he not have the 1974 Act implemented through some scheme of assistance, an existing scheme or a new one?  In that way he could help firms who would be genuinely seriously affected.  Instead of going to Europe for permission to delay payment could he not have gone for assistance to help to buttress our own resources for the implementation of equal pay?  In that way he could maintain the principle of equal pay and there would be no need for this amending Bill.  Firms genuinely <Col N="1662" /> in trouble could be helped after investigation by the Department.</P>
    <P>Reference to Europe raises the serious major problem of whether we are wasting our time this morning because in the afternoon the people in Brussels may say this is not on, that they will not have it.  What will happen then?  This is one more example of the extraordinary timing of the Government in regard to major pieces of legislation.  I presume it is part of a window dressing programme, of a plan to impress the people in Europe this afternoon when they come to discuss our case.</P>
    <P>Even if the EEC Commission give their consent, can this still be contested in our Irish courts or in the European court?  If we pass this legislation can it be upset by either of these courts?  From the European point of view one must ask a number of questions.  It appears this amendment is completely contrary to the EEC directive which became law yesterday.  It is dated 19.2.75 and Article 3 states that member States shall abolish all discrimination between men and women arising from laws, regulations or administrative provisions contrary to the principle of equal pay.</P>
    <P>I can see no way in which we are not contravening that article.  Not only does it lay down that we shall abolish all discrimination between men and women and so forth but it implies that no Government can create further discrimination between men and women, as this Government have done, by putting a completely new interpretation on the 1974 Act for the public sector.  Not alone is there a breach of that article in the amendment before the House this morning but there is a very major and serious breach of it in the way the Bill is now being used to save money on the public sector.  To my mind Articles 4 and 5 are also being breached.  Strangely, the directive was signed for the Council of Ministers by none other than the President, G. FitzGerald.</P>

      <P>We have the signature of the President of the Council, &ldquo;G. FitzGerald&rdquo; and here we have a blatant, open violation of at least one and I submit three articles of that directive.  Article 4 states:</P>
      <P>Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that provisions appearing in collective agreements, wage scales, wage agreements or individual contracts of employment, which are contrary to the principle of equal pay shall be or may be declared null and void or may be amended.</P>
      <P>Article 5 states:</P>
      <P>Member States shall take the necessary measures to protect employees against dismissal by the employer as a reaction to a complaint in the undertaking or to any legal proceedings aimed at enforcement in compliance with the principle of equal pay.</P>
      <P>Not alone has Article 3 been violated but so also have the two following articles.  Why have there been so many changes of attitude in this effort to save £10 million?  I have no evidence to support or contradict that figure but I submit that, net, the expenditure would not be as high as that.  The point is that no Government because of an economic mess of their own creation can range on a commitment made to people entitled to assume that this would be the first major step in a programme of social reform.  This is a clear indication of how the conservative arm of Fine Gael hold the Minister for Labour hard and fast, hold the progressive, younger and more active elements in the Labour Party.  Fine Gael, of course, have none of the Labour Party aids, no Deputy Desmond to espouse the cause and to beat a track to Liberty Hall.</P>

Is that the indication we have from Brussels?  If so, are we still going ahead with this legislation in this House?  If we are, is it not a futile exercise? Is it not wide open to be challenged in the courts and beaten there? It appears to me that the Minister has a major opportunity, because we intend to oppose this Bill, and I suspect people like Deputy Barry Desmond, my own colleague, Deputy Eileen Desmond and perhaps Deputy O'Connell may vote with us to prevent an embarrassing situation for the Minister's own party and the Government. I think the Minister feels he has a commitment.  For that reason I would ask him to withdraw this question before the House.  It is futile, a waste of effort and Europe are not going to accept it.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> The Government's application for a derogation from the private sector regulations of the EEC Equal pay Directive&mdash;which came into force yesterday&mdash;is expected to receive a reply from the European Commission today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister were listening to me earlier I said that newspaper reports had conveyed this to us.  The report continues:</P>
      <P>Indications are that the application will be rejected and that Ireland will be taken before the European Court if the proposed amendments to the Equal Pay Act passes into Irish Law.</P>
      <P>That is the reason I am questioning the Minister this morning.  Again, I quote:</P>
      <P>There is a particular irony surrounding the case, since the man primarily responsible for taking the decision is the Commissioner for Social Affairs, Dr. Patrick Hillery, whose own reappointment to Brussels at the end of this year depends on the Government.</P>
      <P>That is the source I am quoting from, that report in Strasbourg.  It says that it is unlikely to be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked the Minister whether there were any indications given last week by the Commission as to whether this would be accepted.  Equal pay is a moral right, and now a legal right in both our law and the European law.  We are going to oppose this amendment.  We will oppose every line of it.  We have already said that it is absolutely unworkable.  It appears that the Minister is prepared to go to any extremes to override the Congress of Trade Unions and the Women's Representative Committee submissions in order to postpone this.  I think the Minister is making a mistake and taking a backward step.  Others on both sides of the House feel exactly as I do.  For the integrity and sincerity of this House it is essential that the <Col N="1666" /> Minister withdraw the amendment laid before us, because we were all agreed on the spirits and principle and the content of the Bill that was here in 1974.  No number of statements, no choice of words, will ever change the reality of that situation.  The Minister promised that within weeks he would cover any loopholes, close any doors, by introducing further legislation. There was no doubt in his mind then or in the minds of any members of that side of the House or this as to what was intended in that Bill.  It was equal pay for all in both the private and public sectors.  The marriage discrimination is being not only continued but reinforced as a means of saving money for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to explain how this amendment can work if not alone is it being opposed by the Congress of Trade Unions but the matter is also being taken to the EEC.  As a matter of fact, that point is referred to in another part of this morning's <i>Irish Times.</i>  In addition to that there is the question of contesting the public sector situation.  The change of heart in that direction is to be challenged by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It appears to me it is not going to be legislation.  It is unworkable; it is morally wrong.  There are so many things wrong with it that I would advise the Minister to withdraw it.</P>
    <P>This is retrospective legislation. Everyone had assumed that equal pay would be implemented on the 1st January, 1976, because the directive was becoming law on 10th February, 1976.  People had been entitled to assume that it would come in on 1st January.  On 18th December we had this infamous stepping back and withdrawal in the House.</P>
    <P>Equal pay is a natural right, recognised by all.  This amendment can give the opportunity to the person whom the Minister has often criticised and condemned in this House, namely, the slow or backward employer, or possibly the one who is looking for the opportunity of getting out of his obligations to meet commitments that we believe are moral and legal commitments and the rights <Col N="1667" /> of individuals.  Is there not an anomaly being created?  The vagueness of the Bill leaves one in a difficult situation. We may be able to go into more detail on Committee Stage, but I wish to ask the Minister about, say, two firms in the same line of business. One of them feels in a position to meet the demands of equal pay&mdash;the Minister, of course, is not showing an interest in this.  Can I repeat the question for him?  The second firm is not in a position to meet the obligation of equal pay, perhaps through no fault of its own our maybe through its own fault, but one way or another, it still probably employs quite a number of people.  Because it obtains an agreement sanctioned by the Labour Court the other firm can be placed in a position of unfair competition because it will have to pay more money than the one that is slow or backward or for some other reason is not able to pay the extra money.  In other words, the good firm, giving reasonably good jobs, will be penalised, discriminated against, under this legislation.</P>
    <P>That is the position of firms who have granted equal pay.  What will be the position of those two firms in any submissions they make to the Prices Commission for the same material? Will there not be an anomaly created again?  What can the Government's attitude be to persons who strike for equal pay?  As I said already, if they do, it appears to me that the legislation we are introducing here can be contested in the courts even if agreement is given by the Commission.  So it would appear that these people would be entitled to take a stand and win a fight for equal pay.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believe that the Minister's approach is the wrong one.  We are fully aware of and fully appreciate the position of an ailing industry. Our idea would be for Government assistance or subvention, or possibly seeking some of that assistance from the EEC.  I have said before that if we are breaking European laws on this question, not complying with Europeans directives, there are other far more important areas where <Col N="1668" /> we could have broken and should have broken EEC directives, and these were in the area of our industries in difficulty, such as textiles and footwear in order to stop some, or all if possible, of the imports from far off countries like Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just making the point that if we can break the law in one direction, then why did we not do it in areas that would have preserved far more jobs than are now being affected by equal pay? The means are entirely in the hands of the Government.  They can be used by the Government under the premium employment programme or anything else to give assistance to those industries.</P>
      <P>Do we have to revoke the ILO Convention as a result of this step? Has that been taken into consideration, or what is the position on that? There was no equal pay provision in the 1975 National Wage Agreement. It had been in the previous ones.  It had been started when the only sensible Government this country has ever known were in the power in 1972. The advantage we have on this side of the House over some of the dreamers and theorists on that side is the practical experience and knowledge of the problems facing the people, having lived, worked and struggled among them for so long. The dreamers on that side have little to offer when it comes to providing for the practical necessities, as in this case, despite the fact that steps had been taken, that the various percentages had been implemented in the agreements prior to 1975.  The reason it was not in the 1975 agreement was that it was felt there was no necessity in view of the fact that people thought we had a Minister who would stand by his legislation, would be introducing his legislation, would be complying with the promise that equal pay would become law on 1st January, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier I referred to the lack of consultation with the people concerned. <Col N="1669" /> This Government at the beginning spoke about open government, spoke about consultation, but that lasted for only a little while.

It was the just entitlement of that committee&mdash; it would have been only common courtesy&mdash;to have been consulted before the Minister or somebody else announced that an amendment was being introduced.</P>
      <P>There are just a few important points that should be made.  At the root of this is that right and entitlement of the individual to equal pay, a right that was legislated for by this House, both in the public and private sectors, and no words of the Minister can change what was introduced in the House on that occassion.  There is that right that was legislated for in the public and private sectors: equal pay for work of equal value.  There is the European directive which became law yesterday. We are becoming the laughing stock of Europe because of our efforts to postpone equal pay simply because the Government have mismanaged the economy and are not in a position to provide the necessary money to meet the public sector promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the principal points in the amendment for this postponement.  For no other reason has it been introduced. With regard to the private sector, no discussions were held with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The report on the shoe and leather industry does not stand up to investigation.  I defy the Minister to contradict what I said. He should be ashamed to introduce an <Col N="1670" /> amendment based on that report. There is a very serious weakness somewhere. If that is the only evidence the Minister can give for postponing equal pay in the weak area of the private sector and in the public sector, then it is time the Minister said, &ldquo;I am no longer entitled to be in charge of the Department of Labour&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows that the section which deals with the taking of evidence in Northern Ireland for a criminal trial in the State is a section which is causing extreme anxiety to many people.  Genuine fears are held that every effort is now being made particularly since Christmas to get this Bill out of the way as quickly as possible.  Some people believe this because at Christmas time the Government were given a synopsis of the report on the <i>Ireland v. England</i> case.  They believe that because of that information the Government are now anxious to get this Bill dealt with and have it neatly&mdash;from their point of view&mdash;wrapped up and out of the way as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Government made a statement to the effect that they have the report on the <i>Ireland v. England</i> case and people are now beginning to query certain details of this Bill more strongly than heretofore.  People are asking what the Government can do or what they should do on the findings in this case.  People know there are two courses of action open to the Government. They know that neither our Government nor the British Government can reveal the contents of the report for a certain period.  Later on, for section 22 of the Bill I have tabled an amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall not go into it in any great detail if that is worrying the Minister.  My amendment deals with the section which says that the Act shall come into operation on such date as the Minister for Justice may appoint by order.  I shall not go into the subject but genuine fears are held by many because of the position in the past and the way in which evidence was cooked and the way in which prisoners were treated.  The Minister says we should not go overboard about this; we should accept their <i>bona fides</i>&mdash;that is not good enough.  Even at this stage the Minister might suggest postponing discussion of this Bill for a number of months and put the Bill on the shelf until such time as the public at large know exactly what is in the report and findings on the <i>Ireland v. England</i> case and know the extent to which they could accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the Special Branch of the RUC.  The Minister may rightly suggest that this is more relevant to the amendment we shall be discussing in the near future but it is all involved in the same thing.</P>
      <P>Up to now in this House and in the other House the Minister made no effort to be realistic about the Bill. Perhaps at this stage, after a public admission by the Government that they have this report, they might put the whole thing on ice until everybody knows what is in the report.</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins suggested that the reason why the Government were anxious to proceed with this Bill was apprehension of what might be in this report.  I deny that completely.  This Bill is desirable to deal with a particular scandal which exists and that is that people are fleeding from the scene of most terrible crimes and by a legal quirk are obtaining immunity from the consequences of those crimes.  This Bill is designed to deal with those people and deal with that scandal and take away from this country the reputation that scandal is giving it of being a haven for terrorists.  That is what this Bill is about.  That is an urgent problem and that is why the Government are anxious to process this Bill quickly and urgently.  What <Col N="1672" /> Deputy Collins has been saying about the commission's report has nothing to do with the section we are dealing with.  He says he has an amendment down about it.  We can discuss it later if he so wishes but what I deprecate is the tone of his remarks, the repetition of what he was at yesterday, this British bashing.  A certain amount of criticism of another jurisdiction might be in order but this paranoid British bashing is not in order and I deprecate it on the part of the hundreds of thousands of fellow-Irishmen who were driven to exile in Britain over the past three or four decades and who got hospitality and work there. I deprecate this paranoid British bashing on the part of the Opposition, particularly Deputy Collins.</P>

Let the record clearly show that this Bill came into the Seanad on 11 occasions and no more.  If the Government are serious about getting the Bill through, the Minister should refresh his memory.  The Government deliberately dragged their feet on this Bill for about 18 months.  But now the panic is on and the Minister may become as emotional as he likes and make stupid and foolish accusations about us bashing the British.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is the section to which greatest objection can be taken because it seeks to establish a method of taking evidence in criminal trials, for which there is no precedent, and which, if it works at all, which is a matter of considerable doubt, will inevitably work in a way that must redound to the considerable disadvantage of many of the defendants who might be involved in the procedure that is proposed to be established in section 11.</P>
      <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that I have no sympathy whatever with the views of the sort of people who might be defendants or who might be involved under the procedure that is proposed to be established here but that is entirely beside the point.  As far as I am concerned, and as far as anyone, including the Minister, must be concerned, all those people are innocent until they have been proved guilty.  I object to this section, not because of what the Minister states is the overall objective of it, but because the method of seeking to achieve that objective is wrong. That does not mean that I have the faintest sympathy for those who might be involved with the procedure.  The Minister has endeavoured to suggest that in some way those of us on this side of the House who have spoken against the Bill have some form of sympathy of that kind.  That is totally untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as all the Opposition it has been publicly stated that there are <Col N="1674" /> several people on the Government benches who are equally opposed to this whole procedure.  The kernel of the procedure to my mind is section 11.  I preface my remarks by saying that if this section 11 procedure works at all it could not but redound to the serious disadvantage of many of the defendants.  It is only right to start by saying that I have grave doubts that it will work at all.  I have a number of reasons for that.</P>
    <P>The first one I want to deal with is that it is a requirement of section 11 that evidence taken on commission in Northern Ireland will have to be taken in the presence of the members of the court making the order.  That means the three members of the Special Court hearing the actual trial. The three of them will have to travel to Northern Ireland and will have to be present while the commission are taking the evidence.  Members of this party endeavoured over a long period in the House to try to ascertain from the Minister for Justice if any consultations were held with the Judiciary and, in particular, with the members of it who are members of the Special Criminal Court, before the publication of this Bill.  It was finally learned that there was no such consultation.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware&mdash;the Minister can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;there has not been any consultation since the publication of this Bill.  The views of the Judiciary in general and in particular of the members of the Special Court have not been ascertained officially by the Minister in relation to this proposal.  There is reason to believe that many members of the Judiciary in the Twenty-six Counties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the small but nonetheless significant interruption of the Minister for Justice&mdash;it is significant of the mentality which it portrays&mdash;I was about to say that, to put it no more strongly, there is no reason to believe that the members of the Judiciary here, established under the Constitution of Ireland, are in any way enamoured by section 11.  Indeed, quite a number of them are very much opposed to the proposals in that section in so far as this will compel in any given case three of their number to travel to Northern Ireland or the six counties of Ireland which comprise Northern Ireland for the purpose of listening to evidence being taken by a commissioner from the High Court in Northern Ireland.  The willingness or otherwise of judges to risk their lives&mdash;that is what it amounts to&mdash;in going to Northern Ireland in these circumstances is a very relevant factor in considering the whole feasibility of this section and of the procedure which it proposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent history of Northern Ireland in relation to judges and their safety is well known.  In recent years three judges have been murdered in Northern Ireland because they were judges.  They were Northern Ireland judges but there is no reason to believe that judges from this part of the country would enjoy any greater degree of immunity from violence than the Northern Ireland judges.  It might be argued that there might be reason to believe that judges going from the South to Northern Ireland in the particular circumstances of this Bill and this section might enjoy considerably less immunity than the resident <Col N="1676" /> judges in Northern Ireland have enjoyed in recent years.  I do not think that can be denied.</P>
    <P>We have to face the stark reality that if the judges for the time being of the Special Court down here travel to Northern Ireland they will travel in circumstances in which their lives will be in some danger at least.  I do not know if they are prepared in those circumstances to travel.  I understand they have not been consulted about this question.  I presume it will be suggested by the Minister that the RUC will arrange to give them protection.  I assume that over recent years, because of continuous attacks on judges in Northern Ireland, the RUC were endeavouring to the best of their ability to protect judges in Northern Ireland but still three of them are dead.  I do not think the RUC are in a position to guarantee the safety of judges from here who travel up there. In those circumstances I think it is not unreasonable of our Judiciary here to be extremely apprehensive about what is in store for them under the section and to be extremely doubtful about the advisability of the section or its practicality.  I am not encouraging our judges not to travel and I do not want to be accused of that by the Minister.  What I am saying is that, normal human prudence being what it is, there will not be too many volunteers, if any at all, from our Judiciary to undertake the task that would be set out for them under section 11.  If there are not too many volunteers for it, how does the Minister propose to operate the section?</P>
    <P>An appallingly onerous provision of this kind on our Judiciary should not have been put in a Bill introduced into the Oireachtas without the fullest consultation in advance by the Minister with the Judiciary and, in particular, with the members who are currently in the Special Criminal Court.  It is normal practice for a Minister for Justice, if he is introducing legislation in the Oireachtas which affects the Judiciary in any way, to have consultations with them or at least with their senior representatives, such as the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the President of the Circuit Court, as might be appropriate.  One does have <Col N="1677" /> and I have had such consultations many times in relation to matters of no great importance and certainly not of great importance by comparision with the provisions of section 11 here.</P>
    <P>While I am sure the present Minister and I and our predecessors, including Deputy Haughey here beside me, had many consultations with the Judiciary during our respective terms of office about matters of comparatively little consequence, it is startling that, in this matter which is of tremendous fundamental importance to the judges concerned on the Minister's own admission, there was no prior consultation and, as far as one can ascertain, no subsequent consultation either.</P>
    <P>If the members of our Judiciary concerned were to express their apprehension and their anxiety about the provisions of this section and were to express their anxiety not to have to travel to Northern Ireland in these circumstances, that would be perfectly understandable, and it would not be open to the Minister or to anyone else in this House or outside it to express any criticism of them for having that apprehension.  If it happens, therefore, that our judges or a significant number of them are not willing to travel in these circumstances, where inevitably their very lives must be put in danger, how is it expected that this section can operate, and if this section cannot operate, how is it expected that this Bill as a whole can operate?</P>
    <P>To my mind, that is one of the fundamental practical weaknesses of this Bill and the scheme that is proposed under it.  No matter how worthy the motives or alleged motives of the Government in relation to the whole question of terrorism may be, if there is a fundamental impracticality about the method proposed&mdash;and I believe there is and that I have demonstrated it&mdash; then all of this debate in this House and the other House is just so much waste of time, because, with this fundamental problem, it is very hard to see the whole scheme being brought into operation.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was originally published and when this party considered it, we made comments on what we thought was its general impracticality. One of the reasons for that is the <Col N="1678" /> reason I have just dealt with here now.  There are other reasons why we believe it is impracticable.  We compared it&mdash;and at the time our spokesman was Deputy Andrews&mdash;with the action of the Government in December, 1973, making an order under the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861, making murder committed in Northern Ireland triable down here. At the time Deputy Andrews said that although this provision was welcome so far as it went and was laudable in its intent, and was announced with a fanfare of trumpets by the Government as being something of great significance, we believe that that provision in December, 1973, would have little effect, and that it was likely that a few years later nobody would have been convicted under it.</P>
    <P>We are now two years and three months later.  Not alone has Deputy Andrews's forecast about the impracticality of that provision been proved right; not alone has nobody been convicted under it, but nobody has even been charged under it.  If there are fugitives down here, as is alleged, who have committed serious crimes in Northern Ireland&mdash;which I do not believe for reasons that I dealt with on Second Stage&mdash;then many of those alleged fugitives must have committed or allegedly committed the crime of murder, because God knows there have been enough murders in Northern Ireland over the past six years, something in the region of 1,400, if I am not mistaken.  Provision has always been there, but it is specifically there since December, 1973, to try those people for all these murders.  The only difference between the provision in December, 1973, and this Bill is that murder is just one of a large category in this Bill, but murder is, tragically, one of the most common offences or crimes in Northern Ireland in the context in which we are speaking now, 1,400 of them.  If nobody could have been charged with murder down here allegedly committed in Northern Ireland in two years and three months, how many others are going to be charged under this Bill?</P>
    <P>I said on Second Stage that the <Col N="1679" /> most effective piece of legislation passed in this House in relation to these present problems with which the country is beset is section 3 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972, and the reason that I believe there are few if any fugitives down here from Northern Ireland is that in the case of a great many of them, if they do come down here, they can be charged with membership of an illegal organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because a high proportion of them would almost inevitably be members of an illegal organisation.  One of the fundamental errors under which this Bill labours and in particular this section, is that there are two jurisdictions on this island, and that the respective writs of the respective Governments of these two jurisdictions run in the entirety of the territory of these two jurisdictions. That is not correct, Sir.  The writ of our Government and of this Parliament runs in the 26 Counties known as the Republic of Ireland, and in every part of the 26 Counties known as the Republic of Ireland, but the writ of the United Kingdom or the Northern Ireland authorities, or whatever you wish to call them, does not run in the entirety of the six counties called Northern Ireland.  The Minister must know that.  It has been so for quite a number of years and it is still so, and the indications are that it may well continue to be so.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, it is futile to suggest that if somebody is not in one effective jurisdiction then he is in the other, because there are many people on this island who are in neither jurisdiction.  The Minister knows the sort of places of which I am talking&mdash; south Armagh and other similar places where, in fact, there is no effective policing and has not been for several years, and where the Northern Ireland authorities or the United Kingdom Government are unable to exercise any effective jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1680" /> There is another aspect of this section which I want to deal with, that is, the very controversial proposal that if an accused person down here wants to go to Northern Ireland to attend his own or part of his own trial&mdash;the taking of evidence against him from people who probably are effectively the major witnesses against him&mdash;irrespective of whether or not he is on bail down here, he must go into custody down here and be transferred into the custody of the police of Northern Ireland. The words in subsection 2 (a) of this section are &ldquo;the police of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  I do not profess to be in any sense an expert on the law of Northern Ireland, but I did ascertain some years ago, when I was Minister for Justice, that for the purposes of the law of Northern Ireland, under orders made in council by the United Kingdom Government, the powers of the police in Northern Ireland are not confined to the RUC, and the British army, the Ulster Defence Regiment and other analagous military forces are given the same powers in Northern Ireland as the police and have the same powers as the police.  That is not so down here where a very clear distinction is made and maintained between the powers of our police and our Army.  Our Army are in a subsidiary position so far as any internal disturbances are concerned, because their only function is to be called in in aid of the civil power at the request of an officer of the Garda Síochána, and under his direction.</P>
    <P>The situation is quite otherwise in Northern Ireland where the military forces of the various ilks have the same primary powers as the police. Therefore, in the requirement of this Bill that defendants be handed over by the Garda Síochána to the police of Northern Ireland, what the Bill is in fact saying is that they need not be handed over to the RUC as such. Under the terms of this section, they can quite lawfully be handed over to the British army which includes such sections as the much celebrated and much talked of SAS.  They can be handed over to a force&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister can validly make that distinction between them for the purposes of the Bill.  I would remind the Minister that neither he, nor we as a Parliament here, have any control over what happens to defendants when they go into Northern Ireland.  He cannot ensure that if, on the Border between Dundalk and Newry, the Garda Síochána hand over an individual to the RUC, 50 yards further up the road the RUC cannot lawfully hand that individual over from their custody to that of the British Army, or some section of it. They will not have done anything illegal either by our law or by their own in doing that.  A defendant will then find himself in the position of being in the custody of a force who, so far as their own activities in Northern Ireland are concerned, have been found before the entire world to be seriously in default.</P>
      <P>Every time Deputy Collins, Deputy Haughey, Deputy O'Kennedy, or myself, or anybody else on this side of the House, makes any reference to the British army and their activities, we are accused, as it was put this morning, of British bashing, of having an ultra green view of things, of doubting the <i>bona fides</i> of the British army&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It may be unpalatable for the Minister to face them, but it is our duty as legislators to point out what the facts are.  If the House wants to pass this section, at least let us pass it with our eyes open and knowing what we are doing.  Over the past few days one had only to look at the front page of any of our newspapers to see what is currently happening, not in Northern Ireland but on the African Continent, what is being done there by people who only a few years ago were serving members of the British army in Northern Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;before his time, took himself off to the continent of Africa where he started to organise further activities of this kind.  Various allegations are made in relation to him which, apparently, have some foundation, but I am not interested in the details of these allegations.  All I know is that it was suggested by some of those recruiting for that force that one of the best qualifications for employment in African civil wars was the fact that a potential recruit or candidate had served in the British army in Northern Ireland.  That, in itself, is a very eloquent comment without anything further from me on the kind of situation which exists in relation to those <Col N="1683" /> who constitute &ldquo;the police of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins has dealt with the issue of the Commission on Human Rights in recent weeks and the summary of their report in relation to the case taken by the Government of Ireland against the British Government in December, 1971.  It is well-known now that the summary the Government have contains findings which, for the most part and in relation to the more important aspects of the case, support the charges or allegations made by us in December, 1971, in regard to torture, ill-treatment and so on.  If this House is going to legislate to hand over citizens, who must be presumed innocent until they are proved guilty, it is well that we should know to whom we are handing over these citizens and, if the Minister wants to stand over that section, he is at least standing over it with his eyes open and he knows where and to whom he is handing over citizens who are presumed innocent until they are proved guilty.</P>
      <P>There is a third point in relation to this proposed commission.  The normal reason for the establishment of a commission is that the circumstances are such that the judge trying the case cannot be present during the taking of evidence.  This occurs sometimes because a witness is abroad or is ill and cannot travel.  If a witness is ill it could be inappropriate and not in his interest for a judge, court officials and others to descend into a ward to his bedside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interests of accuracy, it is not that the judge cannot attend but that the witness cannot come to court.  That is the more accurate description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice the judge does not go.  I have been involved in a case where a commission was sent to take the evidence of some one who was ill.  It would have been feasible for the judge to go but he did not go. He appointed a barrister who was not involved in the case to take the evidence for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about the proposal here is the requirement that <Col N="1684" /> the three judges be present when the commissioner is taking the evidence. Originally we were told that the judges going up to Northern Ireland would be able to tell the commissioner what questions they wanted asked and able more or less to supervise the whole operation.  There is nothing in section 11 that purports to give them any power to do that and, as far as one can see, they will have no option but to sit mute.  It is not clear from the section, and I would like the Minister to clarify this, whether the counsel prosecuting down here on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions will himself travel to Northern Ireland to examine the witness concerned, either in chief, if he is on behalf of the prosecution, or by cross-examination if he is a witness on behalf of the defendant.  The rights of the defendant to have counsel and solicitor are set out.  What the position will be in regard to the prosecution is not stated at all.  The position of the three judges up there is not stated and it is not enough for the Minister to say, as he has already said, that they can direct what questions will be asked. Unless they are given some statutory power to do so, it is not enough for the Minister to say they can do that. He will have to write into the section, if he insists on keeping the section, something which will give them that right or, alternatively, it will have to be written into the corresponding British Act.  If they have no such rights and if their only obligation is to go up and sit mute they would be as well not to go at all because the only advantage they will have in being present over what they would have if they got back a written report from the commissioner is to observe the demeanour of the witness.</P>
    <P>It seems to me the demeanour of the witness giving evidence before a commission of this kind in Northern Ireland will be of little significance because in almost every case the witness will be giving evidence otherwise than in the presence of the accused and the demeanour of a witness giving evidence face to face with a man against whom he is giving it is and will be very different from the demeanour <Col N="1685" /> of a witness in the presence of that man.  One wonders therefore if there is any value at all in our judges being put to the traumatic experience of having to travel to Northern Ireland in their official capacity in circumstances in which they can have no guarantee of their safety.</P>
    <P>These are just three points in general that strike me in regard to this section.  There are matters of detail I could go into but I do not propose to do so at this stage.  I simply want to point out in general terms that this is the most important section in the Bill.  It is also the most dangerous. In my opinion it is the most impracticable.  I believe there is grave danger that it cannot be worked and, if it cannot be worked, I cannot see much justification for the Bill as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley made the case that he has reason to believe members of the Judiciary who would be concerned would not travel North because of a concern on their part for their safety.  I reject utterly any suggestion that our Judiciary are a pusillanimous body of men and I also reject utterly the implication that members of the Judiciary would not carry out or obey a law passed by this Oireachtas.  I shall say no more on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function and rights of a visiting judge are dealt with in the reciprocal statute which provides that any judge shall be entitled to attend the examination of witnesses and shall have a right to suggest to the commissioner questions to be put to the witness.  It also provides that the commissioner shall arrange the sittings so as to facilitate the attendance of any such judge and put to the witness any questions suggested to him.  The visiting judges, whether they are from the North attending down here or <i>vice versa,</i> are entitled by the two measures to ask any questions they want relevant to the proceedings.  Their powers and their presence are not something trivial.  They are given real powers and they have a real function at the taking of evidence on commission. <Col N="1686" /> Counsel can be present at the commission, the same counsel that appear at our Special Court.  They have full rights to examine and cross-examine the witnesses at the commission. If a person is handed over for the purpose of attending at the taking of evidence of the commission, he is handed over into the custody of the police of Northern Ireland.  That means the Royal Ulster Constabulary and not the British Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to define something which is already patent.  I am satisfied it cannot legally mean anything else other than the police of the jurisdiction.  For example, if we had to give police powers to our Army and people were to be handed over to the police force of this country, it would be straining the argument to say that they should be handed over to the Army.  The two bodies retain their separate identities.  They may have similar powers but they are two separate and identifiable bodies.  I have no doubt it is quite clear it is only to the police that a person can be handed over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Bill says &ldquo;the police force (Garda Síochána) in the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;.  They feel it necessary to spell it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why they do.  Perhaps it is a matter of ultra-careful drafting.  I am satisfied the police of Northern Ireland can only mean the police force of that area, that is the Royal Ulster Constabulary.</P>
      <P>The essential feature of this is that the accused person has immunity.  We have been over this subject on numerous occasions.  It is all the time overlooked by the Opposition that when a person goes North he goes North with immunity from all legal process, civil or criminal.  I am satisfied that this immunity is total and real.  If I had any doubt about that I would not promote this legislation.  I have no doubt that the immunity given in the two Bills will be real, honoured and observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1687" /> Deputy O'Malley raised those three points.  The question of our Judiciary I reject completely.  I reject with contempt the suggestion of pusillanimity on the part of our Judiciary.  I equally reject the implication that our judges would not be loyal to this Parliament in the operation of a law passed by this Parliament.  When a person is handed over he will be handed over to the police of Northern Ireland, and real and total immunity will be given and guaranteed to him.  The judges visiting for the purpose of attending that commission will have the right to have any questions they think fit and proper put to the witnesses.  Counsel present at the commission will have full rights to examine and cross-examine and will be the counsel who were appearing in the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley mentioned two other points which do not relate to the section but I do not think they should be let go uncontroverted.  First, he talked about the 1861 Act Adaptation Order and the fact that there had been no prosecutions under it, but that does not mean that it has not been a useful section.  The situation could arise tomorrow when a prosecution could be brought on foot of it.  A prosecution can be brought on foot of it only when there is a person against whom a charge can be sustained.  We may have suspicions about certain persons but we cannot charge people before the courts on suspicion.  In the absence of hard evidence, a prosecution under the Adaptation Order of the 1861 Act cannot be taken.  None has arisen and it could be for two reasons: (1) that no evidence was available, or (2) that there had not been any fugitive murderers.  The making of that order might have been a deterrent to any murderers who might have been tempted to flee.</P>
    <P>The other point Deputy O'Malley made was in relation to the 1972 Act. He said the most effective deterrent against people coming South was the operation of that Act.  He made this point on the Second Stage.  It was quite wrong and improper to suggest that this Act was to be operated at <Col N="1688" /> will against people from the North who might come to live in the South. That section gives very wide ranging powers, powers which should be exercised with circumspection and with equity by the people entitled to exercise them.  Deputy O'Malley is doing himself less than justice when he says it could be applied at will to people coming South.  In effect, he is implying that it could be used without proper consideration of the legal issues involved in a blanket, nondiscriminatory fashion.  I hope it was never intended that it would be used like that.  It is not being used like that and it is not an answer to the fugitive offender.  The only answer for the fugitive offender is to have him taken before a court of law on the specific charge for which he is wanted, and not on some other handy charge which will have the effect of putting him away for a certain length of time, while still leaving the main issue unresolved and untried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan:</NameTxt>
      <P>A point occurred to me when Deputy O'Malley was speaking: is the Minister satisfied that there is complete conformity between the rules of evidence, as to the admissibility of evidence, privilege and so on, in the two jurisdictions, here and Northern Ireland?  If there is not, is there any provision in this or the British Act to resolve any conflict? I have in mind the case of the admissibility of evidence of clergymen, particularly priests.  The situation in this State as I understand it, is that a priest can claim privilege in relation to any communication between himself and a parishioner.  That was laid down in the case of <i>Cook v. Carroll</i> and was reported in the <i>Irish Reports,</i> 1945 or 1946.  A priest can claim privilege in relation to any communication between himself and a parishioner not alone in the confessional but in relation to any communication. In England no such privilege attaches to evidence which a priest or clergyman might give.  He would be in contempt of court if he did not disclose even a communication in the confessional. I want to pose the situation of the commissioner in Northern Ireland <Col N="1689" /> taking evidence from a clergyman. Clergymen have been involved in the troubles which this Bill sets out to remedy, and we had clergymen of denominations other than Roman Catholic involved in the Feakle talks. Those men must know a lot of inside information.  What will be the position of a commissioner if a priest wishes to give evidence on behalf of the defence?  The Commissioner from Northern Ireland will apply, and insist on, the letter of the English law with the result that the clergyman or the priest cannot obtain privilege.  I presume it is the <i>lex loci</i> which will apply and the commissioner, in spite of the situation in which a defendant would find himself in in this State, will have to make these disclosures.  He would not be required to make them in this State.  Has that problem occurred to the Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The case which the Deputy referred to was a civil case and the rule laid down there would hardly be a rule of general application because it was a very net point related to that case which was a matrimonial issue.  The case was on the civil side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a seduction case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a civil case and there would be no rule relating to the admissibility of evidence in criminal trials of that kind.  No such claim of privilege as a general rule would lie.  The Deputy prefaced his remarks by asking if there would be uniformity of the rules of the admissibility of evidence.  What happens is that the trial takes place in this jurisdiction and it is the rules of evidence of this jurisdiction which apply.  Consequently the question of uniformity does not arise.  The commission takes place in another jurisdiction but the commission is not part of the trial; it is connected with the trial and the admissibility or otherwise of the evidence adduced at the commission falls to be subsequently considered when that evidence is presented to the court of trial.  It is at that stage that the admissibility is ruled upon by the <Col N="1690" /> judges of the Special Criminal Court and they will rule on it in accordance with the laws of evidence prevailing in this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is the commissioner&mdash;a Northern Ireland High Court judge&mdash;who should decide.  If a witness who is a clergyman is being cross-examined on behalf of the defence by the prosecution can the commissioner decide on whether he can claim privilege and whether he must make these disclosures?  I understand that under this Bill a defendant has the option of having his trial in or outside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be for our courts to decide on the admissibility of evidence.  Take for example, the clergyman who, we will assume, has privilege in this jurisdiction but does not have privilege in another jurisdiction. If he is a witness for the defence and his evidence in one jurisdiction would be privileged and in another not privileged he would have the option of giving his evidence down here where the Deputy suggests it would be privileged.  There would be no attraction for him in going before a commission in another jurisdiction where he could not make the same claim.  If he decided to go to the other jurisdiction and his claim of privilege was not allowed, that evidence would fall to be considered as to its admissibility by the court here when it would be subsequently read out during the course of the trial.  If there was a good claim for privilege the evidence would be excluded by the court notwithstanding the fact that the commission had allowed it.</P>
      <P>It is for the court here to decide on the admissibility of evidence which might be taken in Northern Ireland on commission.  If the court here held that privilege did lie it would exclude that evidence.  Again I should like to repeat that there is a distinction here. The commission is not part of the trial; it is connected with the trial and the evidence given on commission becomes part of the trial when it is subsequently given to the trial judges in the court here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that they were not consulted about this matter; that they should have been consulted and that they are frequently and regularly consulted about matters which are only trivial by comparison with this.  I repeat that they will be asked, if this section and this Bill is passed, to travel to Northern Ireland into a jurisdiction in which in the last couple of years three judges were murdered; that there can be no guarantee of their safety and that it would be a normal reaction of human prudence and self-preservation if they were extremely apprehensive about taking on this onerous task about which they were never consulted.  I <Col N="1692" /> do not withdraw one iota of what I said originally.  The Minister in endeavouring to make implications and suggestions is not going to get me to withdraw my remarks about a situation in relation to our judges in which I believe they should never be placed, or if they are going to be placed in it, it should only be after full consultation with them and with their consent.  There was no such consultation and, accordingly, no such consent.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he rejected any suggestion that our Judiciary would not do their duty under the Constitution. I have no doubt that they would do their duty under the Constitution but their duty under the Constitution does not extend to travelling to Northern Ireland in the circumstances envisaged in this Bill and hearing evidence taken on commission there in the context of the current situation in Northern Ireland and this Bill.  It is wrong of the Minister to suggest, as he did this morning, that if they did not operate this Bill they would be failing in their duty under the Constitution.  They would not.  If they so choose, and I am not advising them because it is entirely a matter for themselves and their own judgment, not to operate this they are in no way in default in regard to their constitutional obligations.  It is wrong of the Minister to suggest to this House or to the public that a refusal by them, in all the circumstances of this Bill, to operate section 11 would be a breach of duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made reference to what I said in relation to the value of section 3 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972.  I would have thought that the Minister, notwithstanding the fact that he spent many hours and days opposing that section, had, with the passage of time, gained an insight into the wisdom of enacting that section, that he had gained much personal and political <Col N="1693" /> benefit having that section available for use.  I would have thought that he would see its value and the problems it has overcome.  It is quite wrong to suggest that I suggested it should be used in a blanket way against every fugitive offender.  I did not suggest that.  I said quite a proportion of those who might be fugitive offenders might also be members of an illegal organisation and that if they were they could be charged under that section.  Quite clearly, if there are a large number of fugitive offenders&mdash; which I doubt&mdash;they are not all members of an illegal organisation.  I repeat, and it is a fact the Minister knows as well as I do, that quite a proportion of them are members of an illegal organisation.  If the Garda are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about this, the DPP is entitled to bring a prosecution and a chief superintendent is entitled to swear in court as to his opinion.  That is what I suggested.</P>
      <P>It is a hallmark of the Minister's attitude throughtout this debate, that the terrible weaknesses he now sees surrounding his whole position in relation to this Bill are such that he frequently has to pick on phrases used in the debate by members of the Opposition. He has to seek to ascribe to them meanings and motives they did not and could not have.  If the Minister were prepared to discuss with us the facts and the practicality of the section rather than seek to create, manufacture or imagine motives or reasons that are not there, we would have a more useful debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister resents criticism of the section, of the thinking in the section and of the fact that it is impracticable and quite possibly will never be put into operation even if it is passed by this House.  He resents that and, in some way regards it as a slight on himself.  He becomes very annoyed, he does not reply to the criticisms made but he seeks to ascribe motives to those who criticise.  It would speed up the matter and it would provide a more constructive and useful debate if the Minister declined from entering into that area of activity and if he simply discussed the merits, the practicalities <Col N="1694" /> or impracticalities of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the suggestion that there is any resentment on my part of criticism of the section. That is nonsense.  The Opposition are there to criticise the section and their right to do that is perfectly acceptable to me.  There is no question of personal resentment or of reading anything personal into this.</P>
      <P>In his original speech Deputy O'Malley made three points relating to the section; he made many other points that had nothing to do with it. He referred to the matter of the judges, the question of whom the person would be handed over to, the rights of the judges at the commission and the question of visiting counsel.  I answered all of those points as they were raised.  The Deputy has come back with one particular point, namely, with regard to the position of judges visiting.  I would refer him to the report of the Law Enforcement Commission on which there was high judicial representation.  That commission when recommending the taking of evidence outside the jurisdiction recommended that the members of the court should be present for the taking of evidence on commission outside the jurisdiction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 11, Deputy O'Malley&mdash;I am sure Deputy Collins has raised this matter also&mdash; asked why are the judges of this State, who have a constitutional obligation to uphold the law, being asked to travel out of this jurisdiction, to sit as observers in what is not a judicial function at evidence being given on commission outside this jurisdiction.  The judges have sworn to uphold our laws and I am quite sure they are fiercely determined to do this in accordance with that oath and with their responsibilities. The reason is that members of the security forces in Northern Ireland, the police and the Army would decline to come down here to give evidence at the hearing of a case in our jurisdiction.  Therefore, we have to respond to the reluctance and sensitivity of members of the security forces or the police in Northern Ireland who are not prepared to come here for one reason or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it that they would not respect the procedures in our courts?  Is it that they would fear for their lives?  If that is the case, surely the Minister must realise that the judges who are being asked to go to Northern Ireland have much greater reason for apprehension and fear for their lives than the people they are being asked to accommodate. Even on the basis of ordinary factual judgment or observation, leaving aside <Col N="1696" /> the legal principles, in the light of the terrible history and the unfortunate things that have happened to judges in Northern Ireland the Minister or anyone else must accept that the greater risk lies that way.</P>
    <P>Our Minister and his colleagues are responsible to a considerable extent; they have paraded themselves as making a virtue of their success in the area of law and order and security.  We have taken the view that this is a fundamental obligation of Government, an obligation that Fianna Fáil have always discharged and one they will discharge again.  We see no special virtue in discharged that obligation.  Nevertheless, the Minister now present in the House, as well as the Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs and Foreign Affairs, proclaimed on the same night some time ago the determination of the Government to maintain law and order.  It was rather like the three determined sheriffs heading out to the wild west or the three musketeers.  The impression was that everything was safe in the hands of this Government because they know all about law and order.  There might have been the implication that the wild men on the other side were less than trustworthy.</P>
    <P>If the Government are so determined, and proud about their record in the Dáil, surely the least they should be able to do is to guarantee the safety in our jurisdiction and in our courts of members of the security forces and other witnesses from the North who may come to give evidence here.  They have boasted about it <i>ad nauseam</i> but now they seem to be saying that our judges will be safer in Northern Ireland when they go there on commission than theirs would be in our jurisdiction.  Where is the reason and logic in that?</P>
    <P>Our approach to the Bill has been that all of us in this House, particularly the Government responsible for the time being&mdash;I stress &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo;&mdash;should see to it that we can control our own affairs.  It is our obligation to do so, with proper supervision through our police.  That obligation will not be discharged by relying on a prayer and a hope or <Col N="1697" /> some &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo;, the Minister is so fond of referring to.</P>
    <P>This represents the kernel of our objection.  The Minister is attempting to defend the indefensible.  He made an implication which I was not present to hear to the effect that judges here who do not wish to be involved in this procedure would not be fulfilling their constitutional obligations.  If he implied that it is disgraceful.  He should be the last man to do so.  He is Minister for Justice representing a separate wing of the Executive which should not interfere in any way with the Judiciary.  Deputies O'Malley or Collins or I might say it and it would be bad enough, but the Minister implying it is a gross interference with the independence of the Judiciary.  If there are members of the judiciary who take the view that they do not want to go and that even if they did they should not go because they do not agree with this procedure, the Minister has implied that they are not being true&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I have an obligation now to ask the Minister a question does he think I am discharging it by asking him through Deputy O'Malley&mdash;by asking Deputy O'Malley to ask the Minister?  This is inconsistent with our law and flies in the face of the judicial process in criminal procedures as we know it.  The Minister obviously knows he is in an intolerably weak position here.  If we are to have legislation of this kind we must have legislative guarantees over which we can stand and which we can operate because we cannot just transfer people to the North on the basis that everything will work and that if it does not, to quote the Minister, we will not do it again.  It is no use the Minister saying the purpose of this is to deal with terrorists who flee the scene of their crimes.  We are as determined as the Minister on that score but let us not begin to compete about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We proposed amendments in relation to an all-Ireland court and in relation to the European Convention on Human Rights because we wanted to ensure that through that court or convention we would have controls and guarantees under international law or through an all-Ireland court in order to enable us to operate this system.  We have no such right or control.  We are depending on the goodwill and the good behaviour of the police, for instance, in the North and unless we are to blind ourselves completely to their contemporary historical record, <Col N="1699" /> we knew the reliance we can place on that.</P>
    <P>One gathers from informed sources that the last people to be informed are the Opposition as to whether there is now a report available from the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg on the complaints lodged by us when in Government and continued by this Government.  The Press seem to know it and they are able to inform us what has happened, that the report involves a vindication of our complaint.  The Government obviously know it.  We in the Opposition are the only people who do not.  Apart from that, we are being asked to assume that the people against whom we made that complaint and against whom the Government continued the complaint&mdash;I do not know with how much enthusiasm&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A Dáil committee will be set up to oversee some of them in the future, and this matter might be relevant to that committee.  Essentially these bodies are autonomous.  Presumably, other things being equal, they will give their business to a local firm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Even on the security element, does the Minister not think there is a need to have some form of examination into these firms?  Anybody can set up without any form of control.  It is a very serious matter which should warrant urgent consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of anybody setting up in business.  Before a person can set up and put himself in the way of getting business, he has to be bonded.  This is a condition which I understand is insisted on by employers. If a person is not of sufficient status and cannot show himself to be so organised as to justify being bonded, he will not be able to set up at all.  There is a check there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, consideration is being given to the general area involved in the security firms, whether they should be licensed and, if so, what conditions should be attached to the licences, restrictions on who they employ and possibly their conditions of employment, their facilities, and the equipment they use.  All these matters fall to be considered and will be considered.  Some of them have been considered.  Quite frankly, it is not a matter of urgency so far as I am concerned. I have matters in my Department which require more urgent attention and, when these urgent matters are out of the way, further consideration will be given to this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>That would probably be answered by the realities of competition. If a firm tender for a particular job and cannot provide full facilities, they will not get the tender.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that most of the itinerants and roadside traders are on local authority property, areas left vacant following road improvement or land acquired for housing purposes?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke:</NameTxt>

      <P>I sympathise with people who are annoyed or who have to suffer unfair competition from roadside traders.  It might be a good thing if the law were strengthened to deal with that but it is a matter for the Minister for Local Government.  A prohibition under the Forcible Entry and Occupation Act would not be a suitable vehicle to deal with the problem. Wandering horses would be in a different category from roadside traders.

I hoped that during the deliberations of the committee and pending the recommendations and the acceptance or otherwise of those recommendations the parties would resume within the scheme, which would be normal practice.  I am disappointed the Bar has seen fit to continue to stay outside the scheme and in effect will not go back into the scheme until the committee reports.

The position about reinstatement in the prison service is the same as in the rest of the civil service and there is in fact no provision for the reinstatement of a person who resigns in the circumstances which obtained in this case.  It would of course be open to the person concerned to seek re-entry to the service by way of an open competitive examination conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the person was attending <Col N="1719" /> the prison doctor for depression as a result of which he did not make a responsible decision in tendering his resignation?  The doctor recommended psychiatric treatment and, because of this, he acted impulsively in tendering his resignation, which he withdrew 12 hours later, and does the Minister not think that in those circumstances his case warrants special consideration or even an independent assessment of his case?  It is not like the normal person tendering a resignation. This man withdrew his resignation within 12 hours.  He was actually receiving treatment from the prison doctor.

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Deputy Haughey's question of 17th April, 1975, Official Report, Volume 279, column 2061.  I explained at the <Col N="1722" /> time that each health board has prepared a major accident plan for its area, that exercises are carried out to ensure the preparedness of health board hospitals and voluntary hospitals to meet the demands of a major emergency, that the hospitals have in the past coped satisfactorily with special urgent demands made on them and, finally, that the arrangements are kept under constant review.</P>

      <P>On a previous occasion in this context I asked the Minister about the fire precautions in the hospitals themselves.  In his reply he gave me to understand that the situation was satisfactory.  Shortly afterwards from the report of the Eastern Health Board it was learned that the situation there was not satisfactory. Would the Minister care to comment in general on the situation in regard to fire precautions in our hospitals?</P>

At their request, I propose to receive a deputation from the Eastern Health Board in the near future about proposals they have in respect of fire precautions. I am personally deeply concerned about this, but this situation has been there for a long time.  There have been some improvements but not the improvements I would like.  It will cost a great deal of money to ensure adequate fire precautions in all the hospitals throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of mentally retarded children awaiting accommodation in institutions; and the proposals he has to provide accommodation for such children, with special reference to the children in the North Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the country as a whole there are approximately 580 children awaiting placement in special residential centres for mentally handicapped children.  About 65 of these are from the North Eastern Health Board area.  Both figures exclude children who are yet too young for placement as well as <Col N="1728" /> children whose parents have refused vacancies where offered them.</P>
      <P>Except for a day care unit being planned for St. Mary's, Drumcar, I have no specific proposals before me for the provision of additional accommodation for children from the North Eastern Health Board area.</P>
      <P>There are schemes under construction or in planning for other areas at present which will provide about 1,000 places in residential centres. About 730 of these places will be for adults but many of them will release accommodation for children on the waiting lists.  A number of other proposals are at an early stage of consideration.</P>
      <P>Since admissions to residential centres are not strictly related to particular areas or regions, I would expect the additional provisions to which I have referred to provide some further places for children from the north east.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this is a serious situation and that there is a lot of hardship involved when so many parents are unable to have those children admitted to an institution?  Does the Minister not agree that something should be done to relieve that backlog?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that the free travel passes which are issued to old age pensioners were withdrawn for the Christmas holiday period, 23rd to 27th December, 1975 inclusive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that free travel passes were withdrawn as stated by the Deputy.  However, under a restriction which has applied to the free travel scheme administered by my Department since its introduction in 1967, free travel is not available on the long-distance bus and rail services of Córas Iompair Éireann during the Christmas holiday period from 23rd to 27th December inclusive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey:</NameTxt>
      <P>It only applies from 23rd to 27th December to the long-distance services.  It would be reasonable to expect that where an elderly person intends visiting a son or daughter some distance away he would be doing so far a period of days.  It would be feasible that he would be able to travel on 22nd and return on 28th, or on any date other than between 23rd and 27th December. I do not think it poses any major difficulty for an elderly person.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will take immediate steps to restore free transportation for patients from the Bandon area to Cork hospitals especially for those medical card holders who have to travel three times a week for kidney machine treatment and who are affected by the Southern Health Board circular of 5th February, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish):</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Southern Health Board are introducing an economy measure whereby the use of taxis in the health services will be restricted. Spending on transport for patients, apart from ambulances, by the board has been running at £250,000 a year. While patients will, as a general rule, be expected to use public transport, taxis can still be used in exceptional cases.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1737" /> I understand that the board are considering special steps for co-ordinated transport of patients who are brought to St. Finbar's Hospital, Cork, for regular renal dialysis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are two people in my immediate area who need to go to Cork three times a week to go on a kidney machine because otherwise they will die and does he know that the assistance officer called on these people and told them that transport will no longer be available for them?  In view of the fact that unless they have the use of the kidney machine they will die, will the Minister instruct the health board to look after these urgent cases at the very least?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>The CEO suggested the system had been abused&mdash;perhaps not deliberately.  In this area the cost was £250,000 a year and I am sure Deputies will agree that is an exceptionally large amount.  So far as I am concerned, it is not intended that any patient will suffer in transportation to a hospital whether in his own area, for instance, from Bandon to Cork as in the present case.  Incidentally, the North Cork Health Committee did not disagree with the views expressed by the CEO.  One member&mdash;I forget his name&mdash;suggested that the recommendation be rejected but he did not find anyone to second him.  This is not a cutback.  It is a case of over-expenditure in respect of a service that can be provided at lesser cost.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1975 [Seanad]: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 11 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the interval we were discussing section 11.  I want to emphasise that this section is pivotal to the entire piece of legislation. Section 11 and the corresponding section in the United Kingdom Criminal Jurisdiction Act, 1975, will be essential to the operation of the whole system this legislation is going to create.  For that reason alone, because it is fundamental to the whole machinery, it is important that we give this section meticulous, detailed and careful examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is in many respects the most important section in the entire legislation.  The first thing we want to note about it is that in so far as persons who would be prosecuted in this <Col N="1739" /> jurisdiction are concerned, section 11 and our legislation is of minor importance. What is important are the corresponding provisions in the British legislation.  They are enshrined in Schedule IV of the United Kingdom Criminal Jurisdiction Act, 1975.  It is important for us to keep in mind that in so far as a person is accused in the Republic it is the British Act and the provisions of that Act that will govern the situation with regard to the taking of evidence on commission in Northern Ireland.  It is clear that section 11 merely sets out the background under which this provision will come into operation but the manner in which it will operate is set out in the British Act, not in our legislation.  If we want to look at the position of an accused going to Northern Ireland and being present at the taking of evidence on commission, it is the British Act we must study carefully in that connection.</P>
    <P>One of the things that must be noted at the outset about section 11 is that this machinery which sections 11 and 12 deal with will only operate in so far as the Special Criminal Court is involved. If the Special Criminal Court goes out of existence then these powers cease to exist.  To that extent it operates to make the Government or the Minister anxious to keep the Special Criminal Court in existence. We must take note of that fact.</P>
    <P>The phrase has come into being that these provisions institutionalise the Special Criminal Court.  Whatever about the validity of that phrase, we must recognise clearly that the Executive here, in so far as they want this sort of legislation at their disposal, will have a vested interest in keeping that court in existence because the machinery instituted under sections 11 and 12, and the corresponding sections of the British Act, will operate only in so far as the Special Criminal Court is there to operate them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a very difficult task in attempting to defend this piece of legislation and to make it appear acceptable to us in the House and to the general public.  I think he would admit that it is a difficult task, that it is not a very palatable or attractive <Col N="1740" /> piece of legislation, and very often he has to rely on very tenuous arguments and has to strain logic and words a great deal from time to time to justify the different provisions.  In that sort of situation he from time to time succumbs to the temptation to make a variety of allegations against us, the Opposition, rather than attempting to meet and to defeat the criticisms which we are putting forward in all sincerity and honesty.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is enough for him to criticise or to impugn our motives in our opposition to particular sections of the Bill.  This morning Deputy O'Malley referred to the fact that the Minister on his side has been using certain emotive phrases in regard to us on this side.  We should, as a Legislature debating a very important measure, be above that sort of thing. We must discuss these proposals on their merits, their likely implications and effects.  I confess I find it difficult not to be emotional about this type of legislation.  I have very close ties, kinship and ties of other sorts all over Northern Ireland and many of us on this side and on the Government side find ourselves in the same kind of position. I hope we will try not to be emotional, that we will try to discuss on its merits the machinery the Minister wishes to construct in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Some mornings ago I found myself listening to the radio and hearing the man who was responsible for recruiting mercenaries for Angola state clearly and positively on BBC Radio, in response to an interviewer's question, that it was recognised today that British soldiers who had served in the North were the most desirable and the best type of mercenary for this sort of work.  That man made that positive and definite statement.  It is difficult for us not to be emotional when we hear that sort of thing, when we realise that is the sort of situation that exists in the six North-Eastern counties of this land of ours.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is very constructive of the Minister to open up those areas and I think the purpose of this legislation would be much better served if we all endeavoured to be as objective and impartial as we can about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1741" /> I am concerned about the Bill as a whole but especially in regard to section 11&mdash;that the position of innocent accused persons be protected.  It is fairly common ground among us all here that the provisions of this legislation in the main will operate or come into operation in regard to persons from a particular section of the community in Northern Ireland who flee from there into what they regard as the safety of the Republic of Ireland. I do not think it is likely now or in the future that members of Loyalist paramilitary organisations or people of such categories will to any extent seek asylum in the Republic, and therefore it is most unlikely that the provisions of this legislation will be used in their case.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in these provisions we are dealing with persons from, for want of a better word, the Nationalist community who for one reason or another will feel compelled to come here to seek asylum and security.  I think we will make an historic mistake if we assume that all the people who will do that will be terrorists, men of violence, people who will be guilty of terrorism and violence.  On that basis, the Minister must open his mind to the fact that it is quite likely a greater or lesser number who will get caught up in the mechanisms of this legislation will be perfectly innocent people who will have fled Northern Ireland for perfectly valid legitimate reasons, persons who will have been driven out because of persecution, intimidation or brutality.  We must accept that it is likely to happen and we must go on from there and say that if such persons get caught up in that way we must do everything in our power to ensure they will get a fair trial, that the dice will not be loaded against them.</P>
    <P>There will be persons on the run, persons who will have had to leave their homes and flee into strange circumstances and conditions, and we have a very special onus on us, special responsibility, to make sure that in so far as the provisions of this legislation are applied to those people they will be scrupulously honest and fair.  That would be only in keeping with the best of our traditions in this part of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1742" /> That is all we are seeking in our criticisms of section 11&mdash;that is our concern.  We are not interested in protecting any criminals from the consequences of their crimes, but we want to see that just because a person is accused of something under this legislation it does not mean he will be presumed to be guilty until he has been proved to be innocent.  We want this legislation to be so framed that, if an innocent person is caught up in its operation, it is almost certain that his innocence will be established and he will be acquitted.</P>
    <P>Bearing all these considerations in mind and resisting any natural impulse to be emotional about this situation, I would like to look as calmly and objectively as I can at the provisions of section 11, or more particularly at the provisions of Schedule 4 of the British Act, because that is most important in this respect.  I made this point earlier and I will come back to it again.  This Bill derives from the report of the Law Enforcement Commission. It is important for us to look at exactly what that commission said in their report on this matter.  The first thing I quote from the report is the following, dealing with witnesses. The commission said:</P>
    <P>We have given long and anxious thought to the problem of witnesses.</P>
    <P>Those are serious and weighty words &mdash;the commission gave long and anxious thought to the problem.  That immediately establishes for us the fact that this is not a simple, straightforward matter.  It is complex and difficult.  The commission clearly recognised that fact.  They went on then to examine different ways of dealing with the problem as they saw it, and they came down in favour of the process which is now enshrined in both pieces of legislation.  However, we would be very wrong to think that the commission were completely happy about these proposals.  I hope the Minister will not attempt to invoke, as he has done in other instances, the weight and distinction and the legal standing of this commission <Col N="1743" /> to endorse his proposals, because he cannot do that.  What the commission said was:</P>
    <P>We are therefore of the opinion that a more satisfactory and just method of taking evidence on commission is the one outlined in paragraph 22 (b).  In the absence of a jury this should not create any very great difficulty.</P>
    <P>Note that.  The most they can say is that it should not&mdash;they do not say it will not&mdash;create any great difficulty, and they also used the words &ldquo;any very great difficulty&rdquo;.  Therefore the commission recognise that even the solution for which they opt is not necessarily one which is perfect, straightforward, and simple, and which does not involve any inherent dangers.</P>
    <P>The machinery of this is going to be very cumbersome.  It is something new, to which neither our judges nor our lawyers are accustomed, something of which they have no experience whatever. Indeed, none of us can visualise how exactly it is going to operate; but we can be certain it will be an awkward, cumbersome mechanism, and it is going to be time-consuming.  I hope in that situation there will not be any temptation to cut administrative or legal corners.  Cumbersome and time-consuming, and indeed wearisome as it is going to be, nevertheless the Minister and Executive must take a firm decision that if they are going to operate these provisions they will operate them in a mature, careful and considered manner and they are not going to succumb to any temptation to short-circuit procedures at, of course, the expense of the accused.</P>
    <P>There are a number of aspects of the Bill about which I would be glad to hear from the Minister.  First of all, the machinery it is proposed to establish deals, it seems, exclusively with the taking of evidence, that taking of evidence on commission, and the bringing of that evidence down here with a view to its production at the trial in the Irish courts.  What is the position about documents and exhibits?  Surely in criminal proceedings documents of <Col N="1744" /> one sort or another, exhibits of one sort or another, can be just as important as the evidence given by an individual. As far as I can see, neither our Bill nor the British Act make any reference whatsoever to the procuring or the presentation of documents or exhibits at the trial.  It seems that these procedures are restricted exclusively to evidence by persons or individuals.</P>
    <P>I also raise the question of what happens when an accused person decides not to go North to be present at the taking of the evidence on commission. That is a very likely possibility in many cases.  It is not difficult to visualise an accused person not wishing to avail of the option which this legislation gives him of going North to hear the evidence, to be present at the taking of the evidence on commission. If the accused decides not to go, as far as one can see from the provisions, the taking of evidence on commission will go ahead notwithstanding.  Will that fact be reported to the courts here?  Will it be mandatory on anybody to bring that fact to the attention of the courts here?  Admittedly the judges will know that the accused was not there&mdash;or will they?  One would hope they will know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, will that fact be taken into account in the assessment of the case, and will it be a relevant fact?  Will some implication be read into the fact that the accused chose not to go North?  The Bill is completely silent on that whole area. It merely says that the court will explain to the accused his rights about going North, and then leaves it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the commission, coming down in favour of the provisions which have been adopted, mentioned in favour of this particular <Col N="1745" /> procedure that the court of trial would retain effective control of its own proceedings to this extent.  It would decide whether evidence should be taken on commission and, when the transcript of evidence taken on commission was available, it would decide whether such evidence should be admitted.  There is a very important point here.  The Law Enforcement Commission saw that as a favourable factor in regard to this procedure, but I find that the Bill itself in dealing with that particular aspect is again very vague.  It reads:</P>
    <P>A statement of evidence of a witness taking in compliance with a letter of request under this section, and certified by the judge of the High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland who took it to be a true and accurate statement of the evidence so taken, shall, if all the members of the Court were present throughout the taking of the evidence, be admissible at the trial or appeal concerned as evidence of any facts stated therein of which evidence would be admissible at the trial or appeal.</P>
    <P>First of all, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out this morning, the judges of our courts who would be involved in the trial must be present at the taking of evidence of the commission. I suppose we would welcome that, but undoubtedly it will make the proceedings cumbersome, as I have said &mdash;the fact that we will have to get three judges up there present at the taking of evidence of the commission and so on.  Apart from that there are no other stipulations in section 11 as to the admissibility of this evidence which has been taken on commission. Could it be rejected by the courts here even though the three judges, having gone up and having listened to the evidence being given on commission, were totally dissatisfied about the whole atmosphere of the thing and if they had doubts about the whole circumstances?</P>
    <P>When the evidence as taken and certified by the Northern Ireland High Court judge would be sent down here, <Col N="1746" /> would it be open to the court here to reject it, or would it have to be taken into account?  I do not think it is clear from section 11 that it could be thrown out by the court after their having been present at the taking of the evidence, even though they were completely dissatisfied about the whole situation.  This is another thing in section 11 which is vague.</P>
    <P>Another unsatisfactory aspect, of course, is that the judges of our courts who travel North to be present at these proceedings would not be empowered to ask questions themselves directly. They can only suggest to the presiding Northern Ireland High Court judge questions which he should ask, and that must leave a most unsatisfactory procedure from the point of view of these judges.  We all know it is very difficult to conduct any sort of interview or examination at second hand. If you are only interviewing somebody for a job it is essential that you be able to ask the questions directly and that you can follow up one question with a natural follow-up.  I cannot see how our judges in these circumstances can possibly get satisfaction if they are confined to questioning the accused or questioning the witness through the Northern Ireland presiding judge.  It could be a very stilted, artificial performance, particularly as we know that in many cases these Northern prosecution witnesses are going to be very dodgy characters indeed.  It is wrong for the Minister to try and suggest to us that this is going to be a very satisfactory procedure and is going to be almost the same as a witness coming directly before the trial court here and being cross examined by counsel and judges.</P>
    <P>In regard to our courts, again we keep coming back to this unhappy factor in this whole legislation in so far as somebody is going from our jurisdiction.  It is on the UK legislation that we have to rely for the protection of their position and the British Bill states:</P>
    <P>4.  (1) The accused shall have&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a right to attend the examination of the witness, and</P>
    <P>(b)  a right to be represented by <Col N="1747" /> counsel or solicitor in the proceedings (whether or not the accused is present), and</P>
    <P>(c)  a right, if not represented by counsel or solicitor, to question the witness, and to make submissions or representations to the Commissioner.</P>
    <P>It seems that the accused is himself given certain powers there.  Do those powers apply to his counsel?  It is certainly not clear from reading Schedule 4 whether the counsel or the solicitor representing the accused is able to put questions to the witness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>He has the right to be represented by counsel and it implies that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Implies it.  That is my point.  It may be implied, but it is not made clear, particularly as it is made clear that the accused himself can put questions and make submissions.  The fact that it is spelt out in his case would throw a doubt on the fact that it is also available to his counsel or solicitor to make these representations. If the accused can make submissions, representations and ask questions, can the visiting judges do the same?  Can they make submissions or representations, or is their function solely confined to asking the Northern Ireland High Court Judge to put certain questions? These are all matters which are of fundamental importance and they are not spelt out clearly in either our legislation or the British legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the taking of the evidence on commission has concluded a statement of that evidence will be sent to the court here and will be produced here as evidence.  Both pieces of legislation are very vague about this report.  Will it be confined completely to the evidence given by the witness?  Will it be a simple statement of that evidence and nothing more?  Will there be any additional information?  Will the Northern Ireland judge be able to say that in his opinion the witness was a scoundrel and that the Irish court should not give the slightest credence to anything he says?  Will there be any additional information given in the report?  Will the background be given?  Will it be said that Mr. X, who was the witness <Col N="1748" /> giving the evidence in the court, was in fact a convicted criminal, was a former member of the UVF or any of these things?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know the facility for cross-examination will be restricted.  If the accused does not go north, if he is not represented by counsel, I can see that the evidence taken on commission will very often be only a half or a quarter of the story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>If he does not go north and is not represented by a solicitor or counsel he cannot complain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, he can complain.  He might not be able to go north.  In trying to defend these indefensible provisions the Minister is forcing himself into a untenable situation. What the Minister has just said does not stand up.  It is unworthy of him.  He has cause for complaint and that is not swept away because he had a very good reason for not going north. These provisions spelled out in our legislation and the British legislation are very vague and imprecise on the very important fundamental matters and this is one of them.  The statement which will come down here to our courts will be very bare and because it is so will give a very misleading impression of the situation.  Do we not all know that when a witness comes before a court, particularly in a criminal prosecution, that it is the appearance of the witness, his behaviour, his conduct, the manner in which he stands up to cross-examination, his background, his relationship to the accused, are of vital importance in the conduct of a criminal crime?  All we will get here is one simple statement of the evidence he gave before the commission and very often, I suggest, without cross-examination of any sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> I see that grave difficulties will arise in the evolution of these procedures. It is all very well to think in simple terms of a letter going up to the Chief Justice in Northern Ireland who appoints a High Court judge.  He sits, the evidence is given and that is the end of the matter.  The High Court judge will have to make arrangements to facilitate the three judges from the Irish court, then, if the accused decides to travel and be represented by a solicitor and counsel the whole thing will become a mini-trial.  It could be a long, drawn-out, protracted affair.  The situation could arise where we would have more or less two trials.  There would be a preliminary or a mini-trial taking place in Northern Ireland under the commission procedures and then a second trial down here.</P>
    <P>Will the proceedings in Northern Ireland be public?  As far as I can see from both pieces of legislation they will be in public.  They will be fully reported on and everything done and said will be public knowledge.  Will the Minister confirm if that is so?  I cannot see anywhere in the legislation any provision whereby they can be held in camera.  There may be somewhere in the general body of the law some provision which would enable this Northern Ireland High Court judge taking evidence on commission to have the whole affair conducted in camera. It would be very desirable that he would have such power because I can see very serious results emanating from the situation where this evidence in the North of Ireland would be taken in public.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not come to that.  It raised the important question as to whether or not the presiding Northern Ireland judge will be alerted to the dangers which could arise for witnesses if the hearings were in public.  What about the question of a witness in these proceedings claiming that he does not wish to give evidence on the grounds of public interest? The British Act goes on to stipulate quite clearly that in the case of evidence being taken on commission in Northern Ireland the public interest shall be determined in accordance with the law of Northern Ireland. One can see the reason for that but one can also see that that provision could be used to the detriment of a person accused in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>At least in our courts when the public interest is pleaded the court can look at all the circumstances and can decide, in the interest of the accused and in the interest of the overall situation, whether or not the claim for not giving evidence on the ground of the public interest, should be sustained or not.  I come back to the point that the accused person may well be, and almost certainly will be in some circumstances, an innocent accused person; he could be seriously affected by this provision which says, in effect, that any particular witness called upon up there to give evidence on commission might refuse to do so on the grounds of the public interest, and that interest would be the Northern Ireland public interest and, perhaps, something which would not at all be fair or in the interest of the accused person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is a <Col N="1751" /> crucial section.  It is a section that is of very real significance from the point of view of the accused.  I think the way in which this section operates will largely decide the future of the whole legislation.  With my colleagues on this side of the House, I cannot see it working effectively or satisfactorily.  I would not be prepared to accept either section 11 or 12 or Schedule 4 of the British legislation unless the whole procedure was spelt out much more clearly and comprehensively and all the different circumstances and situations which might arise fully enumerated.  Leaving aside for the moment the whole question of the safety of the person travelling to the North and the guarantees which the Minister purports to give in that connection&mdash;my colleagues have dealt with that very effectively and trenchantly&mdash;the sections themselves, as they are framed, are far too vague and imprecise and leave far too many fundamental matters up in the air.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I have a very special regard for the situation of an accused who is innocent and who, by virtue of the unfortunate situation in which he finds himself, would come within the provisions of this Bill and would be caught up in its machinations. I am not satisfied that these sections do anything like enough to protect the interests of the accused person.  Again, I want to plead with the Minister not to fall into the trap of presuming that all persons who are going to be brought within the provisions of this Bill are of necessity going to be guilty of terrorism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Once a person is charged under this measure one must assume, and does assume that he is innocent until the evidence is adduced to prove him guilty.  No innocent person need have any more fear under this Bill than he has in regard to any criminal legislation.  I am satisfied that the mechanics provided in this Bill are adequate to ensure that the rights and liberties of an accused are honoured and that his position is in no way prejudiced. I would, therefore, have no apprehension about the position of an innocent or, indeed, a guilty person <Col N="1752" /> under this Bill.  Their rights are exactly the same and their rights, in my opinion in the submission I have been making now, are fully vindicated by the procedures laid down in this Bill and in the reciprocating measure.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Haughey that this is a most important section and goes to the kernel of the operation of this Bill and the enforcement of the extra-territorial jurisdiction because, quite obviously, evidence will have to be produced from within another jurisdiction if the act complained of took place within that jurisdiction.  The Law Enforcement Commission recognised that unless some procedure was devised to enable that evidence to be produced before the court it would not be possible to operate the extra-territorial method.</P>
      <P>The Law Enforcement Commission, a commission of eminent jurists, suggested that the setting up of a commission procedure was the answer, because they recognised that witnesses might not want to travel south; they would be apprehensive for their own reasons, possibly apprehensive for their safety. I do not agree that they have reason to be apprehensive, but my feeling or my knowledge that they will be quite safe here will not remove their apprehension. This is a fact of life and we would be closing our eyes to it if we did not recognise the feelings of such a witness, irrespective of the guarantees we gave them here as to their safety should they come from the North of Ireland to a court in the South to give evidence.</P>
      <P>There is also the point that, even assuming that their apprehensions were completely removed to their satisfaction, there would be no power to compel their attendance at a court here, because the <i>subpoena</i> that would be issued by a court here would not run in the other jurisdiction.  Possibly reciprocating legislation to cure that could be provided for, but, this would not be a satisfactory solution.  I think the less unsatisfactory of two unsatisfactory solutions is the one proposed by the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission recognised that it is a novel procedure within our criminal code.  It is not a novel procedure on <Col N="1753" /> the Continent of Europe, because there is a convention providing for the taking of evidence on commission in criminal cases; nor is it a novel procedure in our civil code.  It is being extended in this instance to our criminal code.  The advantages of it are spelt out by the Law Enforcement Commission in pages 18, 19 and 20 of its report, and Deputy Haughey quoted some of them. These are advantages which are in ease of a defendant and go to ensure that there is a fair procedure and a fair trial.</P>
    <P>First of all, it provides for the presence of the accused.  Such presence is not provided for in the European convention to which I have referred.  The presence of the accused with immunities is being provided for here, if he does not want to go in person with solicitor and counsel.  Deputy Haughey raised the question of the situation of an accused who will not go himself and is not defended by a solicitor and counsel: is he not then seriously prejudiced, in that evidence on commission will be taken in his absence? I do not know that he would be entitled to plead prejudice when he himself is the author of the situation which he alleges is causing him prejudice. Such a plea would set the whole machinery at naught.  If the accused could say: &ldquo;I will not go North; neither will I send counsel nor a solicitor. I will, therefore, plead to the court that I would not get a fair trial&rdquo;, that would be giving him power to vitiate the whole proceedings.  If he is the author of the situation which he claims is to his prejudice or detriment, I do not think he can complain about that prejudice or detriment.</P>
    <P>That is not the end of the story. Going north will be the three trial judges from this jurisdiction.  Their position is that they will be present and they will hear the witness give evidence.  They will hear him being cross-examined by prosecuting counsel.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, in the absence of professional representation on behalf of an accused person, trial judges intervene to clear up any point which would normally be cleared up by way of cross-examination, or to open the <Col N="1754" /> case more from the evidence adduced by the prosecution, where there is no defending counsel to do this.  Of course, the three judges can do this at the commission proceeding.  We have to bear in mind that the commission proceeding is not part of the trial.  It is connected with the trial, but it is not part of the trial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate precisely where the provision is in the Bill for the three judges to do just that, even under the disability of having to ask questions through another person?  Can he point out to me the exact section in our Bill which guarantees and ensures that the judges can do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about a situation where the commission is taking place in Northern Ireland. That is the relevant one, from our point of view.  The person is leaving this jurisdiction.  I think that is what Deputy Haughey had in mind.  It is contained in Schedule 4, paragraph 3, under the heading &ldquo;Attendance of members of court&rdquo;.  Subparagraph (1) reads:</P>
      <P>Any judge of the court who issued the letter of request shall be entitled to attend the examination of the witness, and shall have a right to suggest to the Commissioners questions to be put to the witness.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (2) reads:</P>
      <P>The Commissioner shall arrange his sittings so as to facilitate the attendance of any such judge&mdash;</P>
      <P>There has to be mutual agreement on the day and place and time</P>
      <P>&mdash;and, subject to paragraph 2 (4) above, shall put to the witness any questions suggested to him under this paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no undue legal language in that drafting.  It is good plain English. On my reading of that, the visiting judges are entitled, as of right, to have any questions put to witnesses they want put.  They do not put them directly themselves because it is not part of the trial.  This is something we will have to bear in mind.  It is not part of the trial because they have no jurisdiction within that jurisdiction.  The <Col N="1755" /> person with jurisdiction is the commissioner. They are there as observers. I suppose that would be the proper way to describe them.  They are more than observers because they have a right to intervene, but not directly because they have no jurisdiction outside the jurisdiction of this territory.</P>
    <P>In recognition of that it is provided that the questions shall be put by the commissioner, all the questions they deem relevant or they want to put, subject to his right to rule that a matter should be excluded in the public interest.  The visiting judges have a full right to put all questions.  I have no doubt they will do that in exercise of their role, and in anticipation of having to come back and consider the case in the light of all the evidence. If the accused even deliberately choses&mdash;and I use the word deliberately in the context of trying to obstruct the proceedings&mdash;not to go and not to send solicitor and counsel, his absence can be compensated for by this procedure.  Even if it were not to be compensated for by this procedure, I do not think he could rely on his absence, or on the absence of solicitor and counsel, as an objection to vitiate the proceedings.</P>
    <P>The question of the exclusion in the public interest has to be decided by the person to whom the evidence is being given, that is, the commissioner.  A similar provision is made when evidence is being taken on commission down here.  The presiding judge down here, acting as the commissioner, will be the person to rule on the matters to be excluded.  This ruling will be made in the presence of the visiting members of the trial court.  It could be that in their own wisdom they might decide: &ldquo;It has to be excluded on the grounds of public interest.&rdquo; We accept that.  The fact that it is being excluded may cause a fatal gap, a fatal defect, a fatal flaw, in the prosecuting case and the case collapses. That is one consequence of an exclusion of evidence in the public interest, or an exclusion under the other headings on which the commissioner may exclude it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1756" /> The rights of the accused are protected. He can be there in person with immunity.  He can be represented by solicitor and counsel.  I do not think Deputy Haughey was serious when he asked whether solicitor and counsel have a right to take part in the proceedings. A right to be represented by counsel and solicitor cannot mean anything else other than that they will have the right to carry out the normal duties of advocates in a judicial tribunal.</P>

      <P>The visiting judges cannot ask questions directly to a witness.  They ask them through the commissioner for the reasons I stated. It is not part of their court.  The person in charge is the commissioner. They ask questions through him.  The point Deputy Haughey was worried about was whether the accused's counsel and solicitor could ask questions, or whether they just had to sit there mute.  I am saying to him that there is no doubt whatever but that the right to be represented by counsel or solicitor can only mean&mdash;having regard to the ordinary meaning of language and the whole scheme of <Col N="1757" /> operation of our courts&mdash;the normal right to be represented by counsel or solicitor and that is the right to examine and cross-examine.  I have not the slightest doubt about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, there are contradictions here. It spells out specifically that the accused can ask questions.  It spells out specifically that the judges can ask questions indirectly.  It does not say solicitor or counsel can do so.  There is an implication in the law that, if you confer powers on one person, and you do not spell them out in the case of another person, he has not got those powers.  That is a well-known rule of interpretation.  Even taking the Minister's own interpretation of the provision, why do the judges have to ask their questions secondhand? According to the Minister, counsel will be able to ask them directly.  What is the <i>raison d'être</i> for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to do with the nature of a commission.  The judges are there.  They have directed the setting up of a commission.  The commissioner is there on their behalf to take the evidence.  Normally in the taking of evidence on commission, the judge who directed the commission is not present and the commissioner is there on his behalf to take the evidence. In this situation, the commissioner is there on behalf of the court to take the evidence.  He is the person in charge of the proceedings.  The judges are there only by virtue of the special power to that effect written into this legislation as an extra safeguard in ease of the accused.  The normal commission procedure would not make any provision at all for the presence of the trial judges.</P>

      <P>When I speak of the normal commission procedure obviously I mean in civil cases.  This is an <Col N="1758" /> analogous procedure in the criminal code.  In the normal commission procedure which, in the context of this jurisdiction necessarily is in civil procedure, because there is none in criminal procedure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>In normal commission procedure the commissioner is representing the judge and the judge is not present.  In this procedure we are providing for the judges to be present while the commissioner is taking evidence for them.  The commissioner is the person with jurisdiction. He gets his jurisdiction by virtue of his standing as a judge of the High Court in that jurisdiction and he is a person who has the jurisdiction and the powers to carry on this commission and take the evidence.  The visiting judges do not have any such jurisdiction because they are from another jurisdiction and, as far as that jurisdiction is concerned, they are three laymen, so the proper procedure is (a) recognition of their status as laymen essentially at that point and (b) as there is a commissioner in charge the proper procedure is that they ask their questions through the commissioner.  I do not see that this takes from the rights of the accused or inhibits his position or should make the visiting judges shy about asking questions.  On the contrary I have every confidence that anything they want to ask they will ask and anything they want to find out they will find out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we are using the same mechanisms.  We are setting up something which is a new procedure but essentially has the same mechanísms and applying that on the criminal side just as the mechanisms have been applied up to now on the civil side.  That is a normal procedure.  Because it is done on the criminal side that does not make it invalid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is new.  I do not say it is abnormal.  In this new procedure in regard to taking evidence by commission the commissioner is representing the court.  That is his function and evidence given on commission will be given in the same way as it would be given before his principals, the court, that is by direct examination and cross-examination, and it is for this reason I say that the counsel or solicitors there before the commissioner will ask their questions directly of the witnesses.  They are there on behalf of the parties and the phrase &ldquo;right to be represented by counsel or solicitor&rdquo; means only one thing, namely, the right to have counsel act on a person's behalf in the normal way that applies when he acts as an advocate.  I am satisfied Deputy Haughey's apprehensions are not well founded and the phrase &ldquo;right to be represented by counsel&rdquo; means exactly what it says.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey was worried about the mechanics involved in setting up the commission.  I do not see any difficulty in that in this day and age with the ease there is of communication. It might occasionally be difficult but by and large we communicate with each other easily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not see any difficulty in the court here sending its <Col N="1760" /> letter of request and the various registrars asking to have a commission arranged at a time and place suitable to all the parties.  If that did not suit there would be no difficulty in having the sitting adjourned.  That is normal judicial practice.  Sittings are arranged to suit the convenience of the courts or the convenience of the parties and I do not see any difficulty in the mechanics of setting up a commission.</P>
      <P>It was envisaged this would be a cumbersome, tedious procedure.  It will be a new procedure.  I do not think we should assume it will be either cumbersome or tedious.  We will have to wait and see how it works in practice. It obviously will not be as simple as if the entire trial took place in Green Street.  There will be a certain amount of administrative work involved in setting up the commission and a certain amount of inconvenience involved in travelling.  There is no doubt about that.  There are many desirable things troublesome to set up but they are nevertheless well worth setting up.</P>
      <P>I indicated to Deputy Haughey that the proceedings will be in private unless the commissioner otherwise directs.  He also raised the question of the furnishing of documents and exhibits. These will be admissible in the normal way as evidence.  That is provided for in section 12 and in Schedule 4 of the British Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The commissioner takes the evidence on behalf of the court here and then sends that evidence down to the court here.  It may be a written statement or a physical object.  Physical objects will be part of the evidence and will be transmitted by the commissioner to the court here.  The question of the admissibility of evidence will be for the court here.  It will decide in accordance with our rules of evidence whether or not a particular piece of evidence is admissible.  The question of admissibility will not be ruled on during the commission because our judges will be there really as observers. That is the word I have used for want of a better one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be there as observers with the right to intervene and ask questions.  They will not be ruling on the admissibility of evidence at that stage.  They will do that when they come back to their own court and the evidence the commissioners has taken is produced to them. The Deputy may ask how can they rule on evidence they have already heard given.  Should it not have been ruled out before it was given?  This problem arises quite regularly in non-jury courts where the court has sometimes to hear the evidence before deciding on its admissibility or otherwise. Frequently the court rules the evidence inadmissible and it no longer has regard to that evidence in coming to its decision, so there would be nothing unusual in the court ruling out, when it comes to sit again in this jurisdiction, something it had heard before the commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know in how many respects the rules of evidence differ but, if the trial is held in the North, it will be the law of evidence relating to that jurisdiction which will prevail.  At the moment we are discussing trials being held here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey raised another point in regard to the form the evidence on commission will have. It will come down verbatim.</P>
      <P>If their examination and cross-examination raises matters of the type mentioned by Deputy Haughey, the antecedents of the witnesses, associations, and so on, all that information will be on the transcripts submitted to our courts.  There will not be any comments by the commissioner because he has no function to comment. It is his job to preside over the taking of the evidence.  The full transcript will be available to our courts.  Anything the parties want to adduce in examination or cross-examination will appear on the transcript and it will fall on our courts to assess that material when considering the entire case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that this is a new procedure in this jurisdiction but it is not new in civil law countries and it is not new in this jurisdiction in civil cases.  This is the first time we are providing for the taking of evidence on commission in criminal cases.  I submit that the procedure being provided is very concerned to ensure that there will be nothing prejudicial about the procedure to the interest of the accused. His presence is guaranteed.  His immunity if he decides to be present is guaranteed.  He can have a solicitor or counsel whether or not he goes, with full rights to cross-examine.  Provision is also made for the attendance of the trial judges.  It cannot take place unless the trial judges are present.  This is also and further in ease of the accused.  The entire proceedings are devised to ensure that the evidence on commission will not bear hardly on the accused and that it will be fair.  I do not agree it will be cumbersome <Col N="1763" /> or difficult.  Like any new procedure, there will probably be teething troubles; but with goodwill in both jurisdictions we will get over them. There is nothing on the face of it that suggests to me that this is unworkable. I am confident it will work and, in this way, end the scandal we all agree needs to be ended.</P>

      <P>When replying to Deputy Haughey the Minister constantly gave the impression that this was little less than normal.  He used the words &ldquo;the normal exclusion in that regard&rdquo; when he was referring to the exclusion of the judges from asking questions of the witness at the commission.  I want to put it on record that there is no such thing as &ldquo;a normal exclusion&rdquo; of a judge in his right to ask questions in any procedure we have here at the moment. In a very nice, low-key, persuasive voice the Minister has told us what we have been doing in civil law, where there is a difference between neighbours about a right of way or something like that, and telling us that we are transferring that into the criminal law.  Making such an analogy is, in my view jumping so many hurdles at the same time that the Minister is likely to land himself in a very deep ditch.  There is no such analogy.  Our criminal law knows no procedure whereby a man who is on trial for his liberty can have evidence given against him on commission.</P>

However, he surrenders his bail and goes into custody for the purpose of attending at his trial.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>If he wanted to abscond he could do so but if he goes into custody and absconds from custody he is then committing an offence under this Bill.  It is unrealistic in the context of the situation in Ireland at present to suggest that a person should go to the North for the taking of evidence on commission otherwise than in custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is on bail he could abscond.  The fact that a court sees fit to allow him out on bail means that he can clear out of here if he wants to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>If he does not answer the bail he can be arrested in this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>But he could go anyway.  The court considers all of this before granting bail.  The court does not give bail in anticipation of the fact that a person will skip it.  The court gives bail more or less on the understanding that a person will face his trial.  There is a total imbalance if a man who is freed by court order here, even on bail, has to surrender <Col N="1768" /> himself into custody to exercise these rights, as the Minister calls them, in the North of Ireland.  He must surrender himself into the custody of the RUC against whom we still have charges under investigation at the Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg. It is possible that they have been determined by now and rumour has it that our case has been successful.</P>
      <P>The Minister has used casual, calm and persuasive phrases such as, &ldquo;the normal exclusion in that regard&rdquo; or, &ldquo;the normal procedures for taking evidence on commission&rdquo; but they are wrongly applied in this case.  The Minister is not only being inaccurate but is throwing a cloud of confusion across the trail when he talks in terms of the &ldquo;normal exclusions&rdquo;.  I take it the Minister will accept that our judge who sits as an observer&mdash;that is the expression used by the Minister for want of a better word and I have invited him to use the best word he can find to describe the function of our judges&mdash;is under a disability.  He is under a disability that he has not experience in his normal judicial function here and this legislation is imposing that disability.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that the accused can ask questions, his counsel or solicitor can ask questions, and that is correct; but the only person under the disability is the judge who under our law on all such occasions can ask questions.  In fact, he is the person who can tell counsel when to stop while he continues to ask questions. However, under those procedures he has to sit as an &ldquo;observer&rdquo; and he cannot ask any questions.  The Minister has called that &ldquo;a normal process&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>If the Minister can assume that to be the same thing as asking questions it is no wonder he <Col N="1769" /> can infer that the provisions of this Bill are quite normal, because he is ignoring reality when he says that.  It is one thing to ask the Minister a question but if I have to ask Deputy Haughey to ask the Minister a question and convey the answer to me that is a different thing altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not be so daft.  If the Deputy asks Deputy Haughey to put a question to me and I answer, the Deputy will have heard my answer so there is no need for him to ask Deputy Haughey for the answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope our judges will not have too many questions to ask because if we are going to have that kind of procedure it will make this less like a judicial tribunal than anything else.  Apparently, if our judges ask a question the presiding judge shall put it but the section states that the commissioner shall arrange his sittings so as to facilitate the attendance of any such judge and, subject to paragraph 2 (4), shall put to the witness any question suggested to him under that paragraph.  It is likely that the questions suggested by <Col N="1770" /> our judges to the presiding judge may not be put to the witness.  The presiding judge may say: &ldquo;I am sorry but in my view, your lordships from the South, that question should not be put because in accordance with the law in Northern Ireland I decide that it will not be put.&rdquo;  Our three judges can say nothing except &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine that would be the exceptional reaction.  As I have already explained to Deputy Haughey, if a matter is excluded on the grounds of public interest, that is within the right of the commissioner taking the evidence, but our judges must then ask themselves if that exclusion leaves a fatal gap in the prosecution's case. If it does, it is a fatal gap and no harm is being done to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>They can be told that it is a fatal gap but our judges are being subjected to enough indignity in this procedure without subjecting them to that also.  They may decide whether or not it is a fatal gap but if they decide, because they are the judges appointed by us under our Constitution, that such a question should be put, I believe that question should be put.  However, the law of Northern Ireland may determine that it cannot, that somebody else will decide it for them and this creates the fatal gap.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that it was &ldquo;a fact of life&rdquo; that witnesses would be apprehensive about coming down here. Is it not equally a fact of life that our judges who will have to go to Northern Ireland because the people there will not come down will be apprehensive about going?  Will the Minister let me have his comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?  If it is a fact of life that witnesses coming down here will be apprehensive, it is only fair to suggest that the judges who will be obliged to go to Northern Ireland will be equally apprehensive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1771" /> Perhaps people who have to go North on business are apprehensive.  It is part of the reality of life in this island that people are apprehensive about going North and equally that they are apprehensive about coming down here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Very shortly.  My only function at this stage is to get some matters clearly on the record so that we can show the gaps in what the Minister is suggesting is normal and reasonable.  I think the gaps have been shown very clearly.  The Minister said that in this sense the judges would be sitting &ldquo;as three laymen&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be their status in the court.  They would not have judicial status outside this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the position the Minister might as well send three laymen.  The judges have <Col N="1772" /> a judicial function and they cannot divest themselves of that function. They cannot suddenly become laymen. The Minister has spoken about guarantees.  Does he acknowledge that under this legislation we cannot and do not give any guarantees to the accused person that he will not be charged, ill treated or otherwise while in Northern Ireland?  In this legislation we do not give the accused person who is going to Northern Ireland to be present at the taking of evidence on commission any guarantee that he will not be charged for offences before he went there, that he will not be ill treated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The immunity guarantee is given by the United Kingdom.  We cannot give guarantees within another jurisdiction.  We give that guarantee to a person coming down here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>We state that the court making the order &ldquo;shall inform him&rdquo; that while he is in custody in Northern Ireland he will be immune from detention.  However, they cannot do one solitary thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>We had this at great length on the Opposition amendments about immunity.  May I make again the distinction&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was on Deputy O'Connell's amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>And the amendment dealing with the Convention on Human Rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>We had it on the amendments at great length.  Again, I want to make the distinction between the granting of immunity and the guaranteeing of immunity. Immunity can be granted only by the Government of the jurisdiction where the person may be at a particular time.  The guaranteeing of that immunity in the context of this Bill is the sanction and the background that the reciprocal legislation will no <Col N="1773" /> longer be in force.  That is the guarantee behind the granting of immunity which can be given only by the Government with jurisdiction over the territory where the person may be at a particular time.  We do not grant immunity in the other jurisdiction.  It is granted by the UK Government and we guarantee it by the sanction of not working the reciprocal legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is not quite an inferiority complex but something of that kind.  The Deputy has not often been accused of that but I think it is something of that kind.  I am quite satisfied to rely on the sanction implicit in the need that this legislation be reciprocal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that we do not like this Bill but we might be more in agreement with it if he would consider writing in a provision on the following lines: &ldquo;The provisions of this Bill shall only have effect as long as guarantees which are not in this Bill are honoured and that this Bill shall cease to have effect if...&rdquo;.  Would the Minister consider writing in something of this kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to Deputy Brugha and publicly that I could foresee a situation if the guarantees were not honoured that I would come in here to repeal it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the Minister's word for that and, because he is an honourable man, that is a fine thing.  The Minister said this legislation will only work as long as they do what they promised.  It would be quite proper to insert a section on the lines I have set out.  I have not thought out the amendment but if the Minister would like to give me some time I will come up with one for him.  It would ensure that the informal guarantee <Col N="1774" /> he has got will be written as a formal guarantee in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that one underlines sovereignty simply by writing in provisions in a Bill that will guarantee it is answerable to us only.  It is obvious the Minister does not take kindly to my suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>So much for the sovereignty of this Parliament.  Apparently it is just the word of the Minister. The Minister knows that in criminal trials something one witness has said gives rise to a point of confirmation with another witness: witness A is brought back and questioned about some point made by witness B.  In Northern Ireland on commission we have witness A, and in our court here witness B gives evidence.  What happens then if the same need arises to question witness A?  Does the whole thing go back to Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite a regular thing in our courts and it is quite likely to happen under this Bill.  Does the Minister see now why we say this is unworkable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1775" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  I said there might be inconvenience but I am prepared to put up with it to see that justice is done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>You could have one of the judges here adjourning the case half way through to go back to the North to have questions put to witness A.  There will be to-ing and fro-ing between here and Belfast.  We believe seriously this is unworkable.</P>
      <P>There is one last thing I want to go into, the matter of identification.  A person may be charged here with having caused an explosion in the North and the very fact that he is in the South would indicate that he may not be the same man, that he was not near the place.  There would be people giving evidence in the North identifying him.  He may not go up to give evidence on commission.  Does the Minister not realise how ludicrous that is, that you would have evidence given in the North that so-and-so was the person who was seen running from the scene of an explosion or planting a bomb?  The person so identified is not even there.  The Minister knows from his legal experience that you cannot identify somebody without pointing to him in court and saying &ldquo;That is the man I saw running away&rdquo;.  Is the Minister allowing that procedure to be turned upside down?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not always necessary or possible to have visual indentification. Identification can be proved in other ways, but assuming this is the only way, assuming the accused is well advised and he does not go north and, therefore, cannot be identified, then the prosecution case has failed and this is in case of the accused.</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke about failure of the commissioner to admit a question.  He said that if one of our judges wanted to ask such a question and it was ruled out of order that could prove fatal to the prosecution. Could it not also prove fatal to <Col N="1776" /> the defence?  When the evidence is transmitted to our court, is it not natural that the same judge would ask the same question and that he would want the answer?  What will happen then?  Will the whole thing be sent back to Northern Ireland?</P>

      <P>The Minister is not answering my question.  The question I posed is that if one of the judges wanted the commissioner to ask a question the commissioner could refuse to ask it on the grounds that it was inadmissible.  The transcript arrives down here and the same judge again would be anxious to get the same information&mdash;it could be fatal to the defence as well as to the prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is one of the most objectionable in the entire Bill.  The provision in relation to the commission is specifically designed to cater for one type only of offender and ignores the fact that there may be other offenders brought into the net as well.  I have learned very little from the Minister or anybody else in regard to this matter of the commission. Those who make allegations against persons in our jurisdiction may be apprehensive about coming down to our courts to give evidence to back <Col N="1777" /> up their allegations to the point of arresting those whom they accuse in their jurisdiction, we go to great lengths which are extraordinary, unworkable and probably unconstitutional, infringing in many cases a basic right of our people, the right that a person should be presumed to be innocent until proved guilty. Our legislation should provide that if there is any question of doubt it should fall on the side of the accused rather than of the prosecution.  But here we are importing into our Statute Book a provision that is totally uncalled for. There is no reason why those who would make the accusations and allegations, and set the law in motion down here to pick up someone accused of an offence in the Six Counties, cannot come into our courts in safety to give evidence in regard to the charges.  I am sure the Minister is not prepared to say there is any foundation for such fears or apprehensions by the accusers.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is no reason for fear or apprehension on the part of the accusers coming South to back up the case that will have been laid against a person in the custody of the authorities here? I take it from his silence that the Minister agrees there is no reason whatsoever why the accusers may not in safety come south to give the evidence and the facts of the accusation. Nevertheless, because of those needless fears on the part of the accusers from the Six Counties, we proceed to incorporate in this Bill a very elaborate, and what the Minister describes as a novel procedure, in order to facilitate those accusers to press home their case in their own jurisdiction.  At the same time we deny the accused something which has been regarded as the right of an accused down the years in all our laws and laws elsewhere; the right to be present at his own trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's answer to that has repeatedly been that the provision is made within this proposed legislation, or in the British legislation that corresponds to this Bill, that immunity will be granted to the accused and that this immunity is <Col N="1778" /> sufficient to enable him, without fear or apprehension, to go from the South to the North and hand himself into the custody of his accusers.  As a result of that, while in custody, he can appear, be at his trial, and participate in it.  This is ensuring his right.  It is not, and the Minister knows it.  There will be every reason why a person accused by the authorities in the Six Counties, picked up on their warrant, as it were, down here, will not surrender himself into their custody or will not be prepared to go into the jurisdiction, either in custody or otherwise, of the Six Counties, or hand himself through the Garda into the hands of his accusers and the authorities in the Six Counties.  He has good reason not to.</P>
    <P>The accused person, therefore, is not given the right that the Minister holds this immunity gives him.  No amount of immunity written into British law or guaranteed by the word of the Minister&mdash;doubtless given in all good faith&mdash;no number of assurances given in this House by our Minister for Justice and no number of laws passing through Westminister are going to induce an accused person to go into the custody of the RUC, into the hands of those who accuse him, in order that he may be present at this sham.  That is all it can be. It is not part of the trial, although it is the basis of the procedure that will convict, or otherwise, a particular person.  It is in that jurisdiction that the evidence will be produced, that the witnesses will be produced in order to back up what the accusers, the authorities in the Six Counties, will have laid against the person whom we hold.  We are not only asking him to go, we are saying to him &ldquo;that is your right.  Your right is being guaranteed, your right as an accused person is being protected, because in the British legislation there is immunity from any other charges while you are in custody in the Six Counties for the purpose of evidence being given on commission against or for you.  Therefore your right as an accused person is being protected&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>But it is being protected in circumstances <Col N="1779" /> wherein the accused person, having fled the Six Counties for whatever may be the many and varied reasons in these recent years, knows he has not got his rights.  He knows he cannot get those rights unless he endangers himself physically by allowing himself to be handed into the custody of his accusers, those who may have hounded him out of the Six Counties in the first instance.  All this is being done merely to facilitate the prosecution and the following up of the charges made by the 6-county authorities because they, the accusers, are afraid to come into our jurisdiction.  If they want their prosecution to succeed, if they want assistance on this side of the Border to ensure that their prosecution does succeed, surely they should be prepared to come into our jurisdiction, where they know as well as the Minister and I know they may come without any fear for their safety.  Certainly we will not start talking about the degree of safety of the accusers coming down to press home their charges here in our courts as against the safety of an accused going North to be present at his own trial or the taking of evidence in relation to his own trial.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt in anybody's mind that the danger of the accused going north in the custody of his accusers is far more real, and truly real, as distinct from the unfounded fears that are being expressed and the apprehensions the Minister feels the accusers and their witnesses would have in coming down here. Despite that imbalance between the degree of credence we can give to the fears the accusers and the witnesses for the prosecution may have in coming south and those of the accused in regard to his rights, and having those rights protected by being enabled to go in custody to the commission in the north, we fall over ourselves by providing this strange paraphernalia in order to allay the unfounded and ungrounded fears of the authorities in the Six Counties and their prosecution witnesses in regard to coming south.  At the same time we ignore completely the well-established <Col N="1780" /> and sacrosanct rights of an accused person to be given every facility to be present at his own trial and the taking of evidence against him.</P>
    <P>We throw all that overboard merely because we want to pander to the authorities in the Six Counties or in Westminster, I do not know which, pander to them on the basis of groundless fears, fears that we know are without any basis, fears of their coming south to give evidence in our courts.  The only fears they would have would be that if they came south and gave bogus evidence they would not get away with it here as they are capable of getting away with it in their own courts.  Is this the real fear?  Is this the real stopper on people who want to bring prosecutions in our jurisdiction?  They are not prepared to come in and be subjected to a full cross-examination by the officers of our courts or by those representing the accused in our courts.</P>
    <P>There are, as the Minister knows, no other grounds for being afraid. Compare that with the very real fears of the accused in having to go north and being denied what has been regarded over the years as his rights. His rights are being trampled on needlessly and we are being told that it is all being done because of the facts of life, as the Minister said.  The facts of life are that the dangers are above, whereas they do not exist here to anything like that degree in so far as the prosecution or the accusers coming from the North and their witnesses would be concerned, and the Minister knows this.  The authorities in the Six Counties are well aware of this.  Why must we then deny the accused his rights on this spurious basis that the prosecution cannot come south because of fear?  There is no danger to them and they know it, the Minister knows it, and everybody else knows it. So why are we doing this?  Why are we pandering to them?  Why are we setting up a most spurious paraphernalia to deal with a situation that is not based on the truth or the reality of the situation in any respect whatsoever?</P>
    <P>The Minister has said&mdash;I was glad to hear him being challenged&mdash;that <Col N="1781" /> this procedure in this section not only concerns us, but that it is in general use in Europe.  Deputy O'Kennedy highlighted this and the Minister retracted it.  It is not paralleled by anything in Europe in the manner that we propose to do it.  Therefore, it is novel here and this novelty is being introduced at the expense of the rights of accused persons, rights that have been regarded down through the years as theirs and which still are theirs. All our domestic laws and all laws relating to any and every situation, respect the rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>This particular set-up has been brought about at the request, no doubt, of the authorities in Westminster who do not themselves understand the situation.  They cannot possibly appreciate what they are doing in these circumstances.  They do not seem to have come to a realisation that there are no real dangers to persons coming here from the Six Counties to give evidence in furtherance of allegations and accusations as a result of which we would have the accused person before our courts.  If the rights of the accused could be fully covered and fully protected, then the Minister could argue his case with some strength and some conviction.  We are merely pretending to give protection and, indeed, we are making a very hollow pretence that the provisions we have here in this section are the answer to the protection of the normal rights of an accused person. Far from it.</P>
    <P>It will be suggested to us&mdash;and, indeed, in this debate we have had it asserted on many occasions&mdash;that the accused will go into the custody of the RUC.  Why into the custody of the RUC?  We must remember that the RUC will be the actual accusers in certain circumstances.  Why should we apprehend and arrest at the behest of the RUC a person allegedly guilty of an offence in the Six Counties? Having done so and having accepted the groundless fears of the RUC about coming south, we then say: &ldquo;We will set up the commission and hand into your custody for your care and gentle consideration for the duration of the taking of the evidence on commission <Col N="1782" /> the person whom you accuse of doing such and such.&rdquo;  We say to that accused: &ldquo;Your rights are protected. Everything is in order.  There is a guarantee in the British legislation that, while you are in the protective custody of the RUC, your accusers in this particular case, you will not be proceeded against on any civil or other charge.&rdquo;  We do not and cannot guarantee any of those things, even those things in the British legislation.  The British legislation gives no guarantee that an accused person will not be assaulted, molested, subjected to interrogation or to torture of any nature during his time there.  That is not guaranteed nor is the accused guaranteed any immunity from any such operations by his jailers while he is in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The British legislation is silent on that and we here, in so far as the Minister and his Government and this legislation are concerned, are likewise silent.  The Minister in extenuation of that silence will indicate, and has indicated to the House, that we cannot guarantee these things because they are outside our jurisdiction.  Since we cannot guarantee that any of these things will not happen while the accused is in the custody of the RUC, or in jail in the Six Counties, we cannot give immunity of any kind whatsoever to the accused nor are we giving him the protection necessary to induce him in his own best interest to go to the commission and hear the evidence being given in his case.  We are merely making a pretence that we are securing his rights and we are not taking any effective steps to protect those rights.  We are wiping out, as a result of our omission in this regard, the time-worn right of an accused person on the basis that his accusers are afraid to come into our jurisdiction to give evidence for the prosecution. Surely that should stop the Minister in his tracks.  This is an absolutely useless and hollow procedure &mdash;protecting the accused's rights when he goes into the Six Counties&mdash;because it is being done for non-valid reasons, to satisfy fears which are totally groundless.  The Minister keeps on, almost parrot-like, repeating that the accused is immune from this, that <Col N="1783" /> and the other.  We cannot guarantee, even so far as the British law goes, that that immunity will be effective nor do we make any effort whatsoever to protect the accused against the much more likely happenings that will befall him if he is foolish enough to allow himself to be handed into the custody of his accusers in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The Minister does all this in a very soft sort of way.  Listening to him one would get the impression that everything was fine.  When he is pushed back to the point that none of the arguments he has advanced for doing things in this unorthodox and biased way in so far as the interests of the accused are concerned holds, he takes refuge in time-worn argument that if they do not perform according to the reciprocal understanding and arrangement we are making we will stop operating.  We fall over backwards to provide that paraphernalia for those type of proceedings.  Even if an accused is handed over by us into the custody of the RUC in the Six Counties at some convenient point, and then disappears or he attempts to escape and is shot at and maybe killed, it will be no good to say that it will not happen again because we will not operate it any more.  If the boys inside do not play ball, we will take the ball away.  We will not have any further game.</P>
    <P>None of those assurances is of any worth whatsoever.  Neither is the implied threat that if the game is not played properly in the North we will cease to participate in the game.  It is no use to tell the first person picked up under this legislation that if he is shot at, beaten up, interrogated, abused, bumped off or disappears it will not happen to anybody else because we will not operate the game any further. There is no protection given to the rights of the accused to be present at the taking of the evidence against him as provided in this sham section that we have here.  No amount of repetition will alter the fact that an accused person has no assurances nor are we capable of giving him any real <Col N="1784" /> assurances that so far as he is concerned this legislation will operate to protect him.  The best we can do is to fall back on the line that if they do not play the game, if the accused person goes up and they do not carry everything out according to the reciprocal arrangements and laws that we are putting through here we will not operate them in future.  The Minister knows that is no use.</P>
    <P>The rights of an accused person are being denied and a peculiar novelty is being provided.  All of the time of the Minister, his Department and this House is being taken up in providing such novel paraphernalia which is useless to protect the rights of an accused person, and is being done because his accusers are afraid to come, according to the Minister, to the South to give evidence, when we know they may do so in complete safety.  Despite this, we lean over to the point where we wipe out the rights of the accused person in order to provide circumstances wherein, in the comfort and security of their own surroundings, the accusers and their witnesses, touts and otherwise, may give their evidence before a commission of the Six Counties in their own jurisdiction.  It does not matter about the accused or his rights.  Let us get this job done.  The British want us to do it, the Six-County authorities want us to do it and they in return will do something for us.  Does the Minister really believe that?  Does he believe this will be a two-way traffic? Does he believe that because there are parallel and reciprocal laws being passed by the British Government that has any real meaning?  Can the Minister see the lack of parallel in the two situations?</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister will agree that there is no parallel whatever to be drawn between the Six-County judicial set-up and their police set-up as against the set-up we have in the South?  Surely the Minister will be the first person to acknowledge that we are not comparing like with like, that we are not dealing with two similar sets of circumstances, that we are not dealing with two similar institutions, the police force in the <Col N="1785" /> North <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Garda or the courts in the Six Counties <i>vis-á-vis</i> the courts down here?  Surely it must be clear to the Minister that those who come across the Border from the North and perpetrate acts which would be offences under sections 2 or 3 or their parallel and hop back over again are Loyalists or people of Loyalist affiliation or they may be associated with the occupation forces, the SAS?</P>
    <P>We can be sure that when any act is performed on this side of the Border and those who have done so hop back to the Six Counties, being of loyalist outlook, they will not be pursued diligently. They will not be followed up, investigated and brought to book in all cases where it is possible.  Does the Minister believe that the RUC and the authorities in the Six Counties will with the same diligence seek out and bring before their courts those who do deeds on our side of the Border similar to those we are providing for in relation to the Six Counties and the perpetrators of which are in our jurisdiction?  The Minister knows as well as I do that we from our knowledge over the years of the lack of a proper balance in the RUC and in the courts of the Six Counties are fully aware that there is not a fair deal for all in the Six Counties either in the enforcement of the law by the police force or in the follow-through in the courts there.  That being so, why should we say we are prepared to accept the biased and prejudiced manner in which the reciprocal laws will be carried out in the Six Counties, that we will do our share and it does not matter whether they do theirs or not?  We know very well from past experience that they will not.  We are prepared to agree to the paraphernalia whereby the rights of the accused are completely relegated to the background.  No matter how the Minister may gloss over it, he cannot ignore the fact that the accused person is now, for the first time under the laws of this land, being denied what has been regarded as his right down the years and that is, to be present at the taking of the evidence at his own trial.  He has not <Col N="1786" /> got that right here, and the Minister knows it.</P>
    <P>The Minister must, for all time, be answerable for the putting through of this legislation and he must and will be answerable for any unfortunate accused who may be misled into having himself delivered into the custody of the RUC and, as a result, being assaulted, beaten up, interrogated or allowed to escape and being shot perhaps in doing so.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy dealt concisely and clearly with the situation where an accused person is allowed out on bail.  That person must take the unprecedented step of surrendering his bail, going into custody here in our jurisdiction for anything up to 24 hours and then having himself delivered at a convenient point to his accusers, the RUC, despite the fact that he was bailworthy here before the court or the trial court as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The Minister thinks there is nothing strange about that.  I wonder does he swallow this as easily as he appears to. The Minister has long experience in the practice of law and I am sure that if he were not in the position he now occupies, and certainly if he were in Opposition, we would be hearing very forcibly from him about how abnormal this procedure is.  I am sure he would add good reasons to those already reported by his colleagues in law who are on this side of the House and who have given their views here this evening.  The Minister acts strangely for a man with his knowledge of the law and who on previous occasions upheld what some people might describe as the niceties of the law but which he would have described as principles.  He is ignoring one of these principles here.</P>
    <P>I journey north frequently, as I must.  Despite what seems to be the intimidatory delays caused by the occupational forces, of whom we seem to have become particularly fond in recent times, in going north to my constituency and county I go through the Six Counties.  However, when many of my acquaintances and friends from south of the Border have to go to Donegal, 99 times out of 100, no <Col N="1787" /> matter how I prevail upon them, they will insist on going the long way round by Sligo.  If those are genuine fears that these people have in merely passing through on the main thoroughfare, how much more real are the fears of a person accused by the authorities in the Six Counties of carrying out some illegal acts there?</P>
    <P>I have been trying to find out from the Minister why the accused must be in custody.  Deputy O'Kennedy pursued this, but the Minister sidetracked the issue.  He has not answered why the accused person must be handed into custody.  He attempted to answer it by saying the accused might abscond.  Deputy O'Kennedy rightly replied that since he was on bail here up to the time of his delivery into RUC custody, he might have absconded at any time.  He could have gone across the Border and disappeared in the Six Counties.  The only reason I have heard the Minister give for the custody operation in respect of an accused person going up to hear evidence given on commission in his own case is so that he will not abscond while he is there.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to think again about that.  Perhaps there is something he has left out which would be vital to the answer, but certainly what he has said is no answer.  I am asking the question again.  Why must an accused person go into the custody of the RUC, his accusers, while attending the giving of evidence on commission in the Six Counties, should he choose to go there?  Has the Minister an answer to that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reason I have already given.  The likelihood is that he would abscond and the trial could not be proceeded with in his absence.  Deputy Blaney says that is no answer because if he is on bail in the South he can abscond.  That is not a good counter reply.  In the South, his bail is conditioned by very heavy sureties.  If he were to abscond his bailsman would forfeit <Col N="1788" /> the bail.  In addition he would be liable to be rearrested when found. If he were to go North not in custody and if he were to abscond, he would not be liable to rearrest for that offence.  If he were to go to ground&mdash; and one can imagine that he would find places in the North to go to ground successfully&mdash;he would be able to evade justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not trying to make us believe that a person on bail here, accused of an offence of the nature we are talking about here, will not abscond purely and simply on the basis that his bondsman would be called in.  Assuming that to some degree that was a deferrent to absconding&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>While he is on bail I take it there will be no absolute knowledge that he never goes outside the jurisdiction even to cross the Border to buy a pound of butter. He may or may not come and go across the Border while on bail.  So long as he shows up on the day appointed for his trial or hearing, everything is in order.  If he goes across the Border for the taking of evidence, he is a free agent having chosen to do so in his own interest. If he does not show up in our court to answer bail, will not the same visitation take place to the bondsman as if he had absconded without going North to give evidence on commission? It is the same thing.  His bail is forfeit whether he disappears one day after he is allowed out on bail or while in the Six Counties on this mission.  To say he is put into custody in order that he will not abscond is ludicrous.  Why should he disappear when he is going North to hear the evidence and to take what should be his right despite any fears or dangers he may encounter?  The Minister says he must surrender himself anything up to 24 hours before going into the custody of the Garda Síochána, who will hand him over at a convenient point to the RUC, who will keep him in custody for the duration of the proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> If the man is daft enough to take the Minister up on the assurances which are so unsure in this legislation, or on the assurances of a British Government who we know from past experience have not got a great deal of creditworthiness in their assurances given to our people, and if he opts to go up although he is on bail here, why would he then abscond up there? Why go up there?  Why go through that procedure and then disappear up there when he could have disappeared any other day without anything being known about it?  He would not be missed until the case was called again.</P>
    <P>If he goes North and he is not there the next day, he is immediately suspected of having absconded, and the likelihood of his becoming involved is greater than if he had quietly disappeared in his own time and in his own way on this side of the Border? The whole thing is so unreal as not to make any sense.  It is so unreal that it does no credit to the Minister, to the Department, or to the Government. Pushing it through this House on a vote will do no credit to Parliament or to the reputation of this House.  Nor will it add any lustre to the enactments on the Statute Book of this State.  All of this is being done, and for what reasons I do not know. We have not been given the reasons. The Minister is still not forthcoming on the specific question I asked him. He has not given an answer which makes sense or satisfies me.</P>
    <P>Leaving out all the unwieldy and <Col N="1790" /> perhaps unworkable, unconstitutional, unorthodox and repugnant matters which will become part of our law as a result of this section, how can the Minister, how can this House, how can any Irish Parliament deny the time honoured rights of an accused, merely to facilitate the chicken-hearted accusers from the Six-County jurisdiction who would point the finger at persons on this side of the Border to put into operation the paraphernalia which will have us do the dirty work for them.  We are doing it for the chicken-hearted people who make those accusations and who, because of their chicken-hearted lily-liveredness, are not prepared to come into our jurisdiction.  They have expressed to somebody or other, we must assume, fears and apprehensions that they will be molested, insulted, beaten up, kidnapped, interrogated, shot, or whatever the case may be.  We are led to believe all these things are genuine fears and, therefore, we must bow the knee and make provisions of the most amazing character for these weak kneed, lily-livered, chicken-hearted people who will make their accusations but are not prepared to face up to the reality of the situation and come into our courts to back them up.  Therefore, we of necessity have to throw overboard the established rights of all accused down the years and down the ages, rights we had come to consider sacrosanct.  That is what the Minister is doing and no amount of explanation can get away from that sad fact.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 (9) provides that at the conclusion of the taking of evidence in this jurisdiction the accused will be brought by the Garda Síochána as soon as may be to some convenient point of departure from the State and there delivered into the custody of the police of Northern Ireland.  The words that the Garda Síochána must &ldquo;deliver the accused to Northern Ireland as soon as may be&rdquo; should be underlined. The corresponding provision in the British Act appears to be paragraph <Col N="1793" /> 4 (5) of Schedule 4, on page 16.  In that Act there is no provision that the accused person is to be delivered from the RUC to the Garda Síochána as soon as may be.  It merely states that at the conclusion of proceedings he is to be delivered back.  During the course of the Second Stage debate reference was made to the absence of these words from the British legislation. Perhaps the Minister might comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The meaning is identical although the actual phraseology used is not.  I am quite satisfied that the British Act provides that on conclusion of the proceedings the accused has to be handed back into the custody of the Garda Síochána of this jurisdiction and I do not think there is anything sinister to be read into the absence of the words &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.  I am satisfied that, as drafted, it means that the accused must be handed back immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister comment on section 12 (7), because my understanding is that contempt of court is now an offence which is not triable summarily.  A recent decision of Mr. Justice Parke indicates that is the position.  There seems to be conflicting views about this section. The Minister might deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the decision in question.  I cannot go so far as to say that it now represents the definitive state of the law in that area.  That would be going perhaps too far.  It was found in essence that before there could be a conviction for contempt there would have to be a separate criminal proceeding, because there was a criminal sanction involved and that automatically required a criminal proceeding before the sanction could be applied.  Should that turn out to be the definitive legal proceeding after all the judicial processes relating thereto have been exhausted, then the wording of this section might have to be looked at again or else it would fall, in relation to subsection (7) (d).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 is the corollary of section 11, which enables <Col N="1794" /> the Northern authorities to send down here and seek to have evidence taken on commission here which would be available to them for the prosecution of a trial in the North of Ireland. From that point of view it is of some significance to us in this jurisdiction in that if the situation were to arise where the persons who have perpetrated crimes in this State are subsequently brought to trial in the North of Ireland these provisions will be invoked to assist that prosecution.</P>
      <P>We must ask ourselves whether this section will ever be availed of or whether it will be an empty formula. On another occasion I asked the Minister if he had any knowledge about the situation in regard to the bombings that were perpetrated in this State almost certainly by persons from outside the State.  That question arises specifically on this section because if such persons are to be apprehended in the North of Ireland undoubtedly the provisions of this section will be brought into play to enable evidence to be garnered against them.  I do not know what the present situation is but I should like to know if the authorities in Northern Ireland are, in fact, prosecuting their inquiries in regard to these outrages.  Do they visualise any prosecutions likely to materialise as a result of their inquiries and if so is it likely that the provisions of this section will ever be invoked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is relevant and many people would be interested to know what the present position is.  Other countries have gone to considerable lengths to try to make sure that persons who committed atrocities on their people were pursued to the ends of the earth and brought to justice.  I am not one to advocate the pursuance of vengeance at any time but in the light of the barrage of criticism directed at us in the Republic about the situation in the North some effort should be made by the authorities there to bring those people to justice.  I asked the Minister before about this and I was inclined to confine my question to him and to know whether he had any information about the progress of such inquiries. Now that we are dealing with this section which is directly related <Col N="1795" /> to this sort of situation the Minister might go a little further and tell us whether he is satisfied that the Northern authorities are doing all in their power to pursue their inquiries or whether there are any initiatives he can take in the matter so that if we must have these very unorthodox procedures incorporated in our legal system at least they might be availed of in that context.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to advert to some reports of what I said here in connection with the explosives section yesterday.  I recognise that I may not have expressed myself clearly or that what I said may have been quite fairly misunderstood. The newspaper reports would seem to indicate that I merely confined myself to condemning the outrages arising from the use of explosives in our jurisdiction.  Of course, as the Minister knows, I condemned totally as abhorrent this new form of terrorism which has, unfortunately, come to our country.  Throughout the world this use of indiscriminate bombing has killed, maimed and injured unsuspecting members of the general public.  I should like to make it clear that I was not confining my condemnation to those offences which occurred in our jurisdiction; my condemnation of them, the condemnation of every right-thinking person, applies to all of Ireland and to anywhere else in the world where they may occur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the meaning I took from what Deputy Haughey said but possibly, because of the necessarily abbreviated way these lengthy proceedings have to be reported sometimes a wrong impression can unwittingly arise.  With regard to the outrages which have been committed here, I should like to say that this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will not apply retrospectively.  Even if those persons could be apprehended in the other jurisdiction they could not be dealt with under this Bill.  With regard to that specific point, police files are never closed as long as a crime remains unsolved.  There is always an interest in acquiring evidence to try to apprehend the guilty persons.  I am <Col N="1796" /> satisfied that every effort was made by the two forces in co-operation to try to identify and secure sufficient evidence to charge the people responsible for the terrible outrages here.  I hope that, as far as we are concerned, section 12 will be an empty formula and that the need for it will not arise. It would follow from that that outrages would not have been committed here and that there would be no fugitive offenders in Northern Ireland as a result of committing crimes under the provisions of the other Act corresponding to sections 2 and 3 of our Bill.  The way things are at present the reality of the situation is that the traffic is more likely to be weighted in the other direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not conceiving that the evidence for the defence which will be taken on commission in the South and which will be ruled as admissible evidence by our commissioner or judge could be ruled as inadmissible by the court of trial in Northern Ireland, having regard to the different rules of evidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think our commissioner would be entitled to rule on it other than in the narrow area of the public interest.  The admissibility, generally, would be a matter for the trial court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be against the interests of a defendant when what would be ruled as admissible here could be ruled as inadmissible in the North of Ireland and to that extent it is one other example of the difficulties and problems that can arise in practice in relation to this.  In so far as this envisages a judge coming down to sit as an observer on our taking of evidence on commission, the Minister will see immediately the contradiction that is involved in that if a judge sits here as an observer surely the witnesses we were dealing with under section 11 could be expected to come down and give evidence here.  Section 12, for its effectiveness, depends on the fact that a judge will come down from the North of Ireland to sit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1797" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not recognise that he may, to quote the Minister, &ldquo;as a fact of life&rdquo; have the same apprehensions about coming to the South as some of the witnesses would have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>He may have but I have no doubt that he will come down to discharge his duty.  The positions of the witness and the judge are not analogous.  Both are human beings and may suffer the same apprehensions. However, there are certain constraints that compel us to do things in the course of duty to which other people are not subject.  That would be the difference between a judge and an ordinary witness.  I do not want to reopen <Col N="1798" /> section 11.  We will have to wait to see who will or will not come down.  It could be that most witnesses will come here and, hopefully, that will be the case.</P>
      <P>The other point Deputy O'Kennedy made was in relation to the admissibility of evidence.  The trial will be a North of Ireland trial and when the evidence taken here on commission goes to the North it will be judged in the light of their rules of evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was making the point that Fianna Fáil deplore the Government's decision to deprive a large section of people of State housing grants.  The Government's decision merely reflects their commitment to expenditure in the coming year and took no account of the present purchasing power of money.  To illustrate this clearly, Fianna Fáil in 1972 built approximately 22,000 houses for a total of £46 million.  The Government this year are committed to build 25,000 houses at an intended expenditure of £122 million.  Fianna Fáil built 22,000 houses four years ago for £46 million and the Coalition are building 3,000 more houses for £122 million, a tragic example of the savage raging inflation that has taken place since the Coalition took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1801" /> Deputies on this side made the point that the Minister's decision in respect of grants would mean that a large number of young couples who might buy their own homes out of savings will be transferred to the already overtaxed, overburdened local authority waiting lists.  To clarify our position and to illustrate that that is not just a Fianna Fáil point of view, I have quoted the comments of various organisations and the assistant Whip of the Government with regard to his views on the decision of the Minister for Local Government to eliminate housing grants for those other than people eligible for supplementary grants.  His Parliamentary Secretary came in last night and said that people earning more than £40 a week were wealthy, rich, which shows his incredible lack of sensitivity as a Government spokesman.</P>
    <P>We are calling for reinstatement of the State grant to all applicants and we are committed, when we get back to office&mdash;despite the Minister's carve-up of the constituencies this election will be in the near future&mdash;to increase SDA loans considerably.  We are committed to increasing the figures we are discussing at the moment to a house price of £6,000 and an income limit of £3,000 and to reinstating and increasing the State grant.</P>
    <P>The most disturbing feature of the Minister's decision is the effect it is having on employment in the building industry.  Already there are more than 22,000 people unemployed in the building sector and 8,000 are unemployed in the house building section as a result of the Minister's decision.  I suggest to him it is his duty and responsibility, placed on him by the people in the last election, to look after the building industry in the way Fianna Fáil did before he came to office.</P>
    <P>This situation and the appalling decision he made could be put in no better words than those in the editorial of <i>The Irish Times</i> for Saturday, 3rd January, 1976.  Not even the Minister will say that <i>The Irish Times</i> is an organ of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I quote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1802" />
      <i>Hitting the homeless</i>
    </P>
    <P>The decision of the Government to abolish, to all intents and purposes, the £325 grant for purchasers of privately-built houses has, quite rightly, been strongly criticised by the Construction Industry Federation, the National Association of Building Co-operatives, the Association of Combined Residents' Associations, and other organisations closely linked with the business of building and buying houses. The Government may say that the grant provided only &ldquo;marginal assistance&rdquo; to purchasers, but any person saving to get a deposit on a house&mdash;merely trying to get a roof over his head&mdash;will look on £325 as being a very large sum indeed.  It takes a lot of saving nowadays to collect £325.  This is the case of the last straw breaking the camel's back.</P>
    <P>The Government announcement comes at a time when the building industry is complaining about being beset by major problems.  The Government subsidy to the building societies has been withdrawn, and it is now some years since the SDA (Small Dwellings Act) loan has been increased for house loans from its figure of £4,500.  In addition, the announcement came without warning. There was no consultation with the builders and no hint to the consumers (many small builders have been left in the situation whereby they have not applied for grants because of not having a staff to do paperwork; they can now take a cut in their profits or else pass on the burden to their clients).</P>
    <P>Those two paragraphs go straight to the root of the problem and straight to the savage attack the Minister has made on prospective house buyers, on the building industry, on the local authorities whose overburdened housing waiting lists he has further added to, as well as adding to the unemployed.  The Minister, following the genuine criticism from all sides of the House, including his own assistant Whip, should reconsider his decision, and immediately reinstate the grant and should <Col N="1803" /> also increase the SDA loans to the figure that was spoken about by Fianna Fáil of £6,000 and the income limit to £3,000.</P>
    <P>He cannot be unaware of the rising tide of revolt felt throughout this country at his decision with regard to this grant, and in particular the timing of the grant which came when he was well aware that a 20 per cent increase in building materials had been granted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that it is ridiculous for the Minister to speak of increases in money terms without speaking of the inflation that has taken place and without speaking of the purchasing power of the money concerned.  I would merely reiterate that Fianna Fáil built 22,000 houses for £46 million while the Government, because of raging and savage inflation, succeed in building 25,000 houses for £122 million.  It is nothing to be proud of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore:</NameTxt>
      <P>The very fact that this incident has happened here tonight speaks for itself.  The Government are now so afraid of a motion on housing that they do not want to speak on it. The Government's counter motion reads:</P>
      <P>takes note of the Government's decision to provide from the Exchequer in 1976 a record amount of finance for housing.</P>
      <P>Of course, there is a record number of unemployed people and a record all-time high in the cost of living but the Government do not boast about that.  If you compare the present figures with the figures of the previous Government you will see that there is a shortfall of about 5 per cent in the injection of capital into housing, despite the great boasting that goes on by the Government about building 25,000 houses each year.  The Government have put forward this figure of 25,000 houses each year and we have disputed it.  We do not accept as gospel any edict from the Government side.  The Minister has now removed the State grants which could have acted as a guideline as to the number of houses built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the hardships inflicted on young couples who are buying houses, we now have the further difficulty of trying to prove or disprove the number of dwellings built here in any one year.  The Minister has been cavalier in his attitude to these grants and so have some other members of the Fine Gael Party.  I heard one member of the Fine Gael Party describe the State grant of £325 as being the builders' pocket money.  Let us not become too impersonal when speaking of housing applicants.  It <Col N="1808" /> may be all right for the Minister and the bureaucracy to look at a housing sheet and merely see figures on it. Let us get down to the position of a young couple in any urban area who want to buy a house.  If the Minister would read the letters I have received from young couples he might be able to introduce some little touch of humanity into the regulations of the Department of Local Government. One couple told me about the loss of the £325 grant.  The builder is not worried, but they have got to find this extra £325.  Another couple told me that they were thinking of getting in a heating system but that has gone by the board now.  Even worse, another couple told me that they will not have floor covering because the builder wants his £325.  The Government will save £750,000 on this operation. It should be the intention of any Government to encourage young people to buy their own homes because we know that the local authorities will not house a young couple on marriage, or a young couple with one child.</P>
    <P>The point is that this impersonal machine has come down, not on top of the builder, but on top of the unfortunate young couples who must now raise this extra money.  They will be put to the pin of their collars to try to make up the money, Remember, if their income is more than £46 per week they will not qualify for all the grants.  The object of the State is to screw them as hard as possible, but it does not end there.  We do know now that two months before the Minister removed the grant the Department of Industry and Commerce had received applications for an increase in the price of concrete goods.  This increase was granted but it was kept very quiet.  The granting of this increase meant that not alone had the young couples who are buying houses now to do without a State grant, but they had also to meet the increase in the price of houses which was also caused by the Government's policy.</P>
    <P>We have the platitudes from the Government side of the House and the publication on housing and yet we find that, in proven cases where young <Col N="1809" /> couples are at the point of despair in trying to raise money for housing, the Government abolishes this grant in order to save £750,000.  Perhaps people would understand it if the Government told them it was absolutely necessary, but it is belittling.  A Fine Gael member may well say that this is the builder's pocket money.  If it is, it is being put into his pocket now by the young couples who are trying to buy houses.  This is the great benevolent State.  The Government laud their efforts to provide houses and yet they cannot or will not work diligently to try to preserve some hope for young couples, to show that the State believes in the justice of their cause and will make every possible effort to help them.</P>
    <P>As prices increase people say: &ldquo;Why make the effort any longer? Let us fall back on the local authority for housing&rdquo;.  I can only speak about the one authority I know anything about and that is Dublin Corporation. They, of course, cannot house every applicant because there are over 5,000 families on the housing list. Even building at the fastest rate possible, and with no fresh applications, it would take years to clear the housing list.  You cannot do this, as each day new applications are received and the young couples are pushed further back on the list.  What do they do now?  If they cannot afford the price of a house, if they will not be accepted by a local authority, they may try to find rented accommodation in this city or in any urban area in the country. Their last state is worse than the first because, while they will not have to put down a deposit to rent a flat, they will have to pay an exorbitant rent. In all the machinations of the State they are being sacrificed on the altar of incompetence of an incompetent Government.</P>
    <P>The Government have been warned time and time by members of this party.  We have pointed out what they could do.  They could maintain the grant.  They could increase the limit of the loans.  They could increase the supplementary grant.  We have asked for a bigger capital injection but this <Col N="1810" /> has been ignored.  We can leave the Fianna Fáil benches out of it and take the Economic and Social Research Institute.  They have called for greater capital investment in housing and have pointed out why this should be done. That has been to no avail.  The Government, who are in real trouble everywhere, are panicking as they did in the budget and as they did when they removed the State grant from housing. They are panicking in relation to every issue so the advice of that State body, the Economic and Social Research Institute is ignored.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a member of the Labour Party who claim close association with the trade union movement. The Congress of Trade Unions urged very strongly that the Government should put greater capital investment into the housing drive.  There is an affinity between the SRI, the Congress of Trade Unions and the Fianna Fáil Party in that we recognise the plight of young couples who are trying to buy houses or get themselves housed anywhere.  Those three bodies have impressed on the Government the need for capital investment in housing but their answer is shown in the cynicism of their action when they removed the State grant of £325 from dwellings. This forces young people to find extra money.</P>
    <P>Young couples who came to me said they could not afford heating or floor covering.  That is the way they met the new impost on them.  Some probably would not have any floor covering even with the grant.  They must cut back on something.  The Government are so depressing the housing scene that young people will find they cannot meet the demands in relation to the price of new houses.  The local authorities will probably not take them on their housing list and they will try to find flats in this city or in some urban area.  It is almost impossible to find flats at a reasonable rent.  This is the brave new world for young couples which the Government promised a few years ago when they came before the people with their 14-point plan.  What a cynical betrayal of the hopes of the young people it is that in 1976 they find it almost impossible to purchase houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1811" /> During 1974-75 we saw the downward trend in employment in the building trade.  We now have over 22,000 building operatives idle.  In the Dublin area alone we have roughly 8,000 idle.  All the time we have people on the house waiting list.  The Government will probably boast that they built a number of houses a year.  They should look at how much the waiting list has shrunk in that time.  How much has it gone down?  It is practically static in this city.</P>
    <P>In relation to the plight of old people any Member of this House or any member of a local authority knows the anguish of old people who come to them every day seeking a flat.  We know the small number built every year.  Those old people have to spend the winter of their lives either in some tenement room or live in overcrowded conditions with some of their relatives.  The prime concern of any Government should be the housing of the people.  We can see the awful mess the Government have made of it.  They boast about building 25,000 dwellings and they boast about how much more money they are putting into housing than we did.  At present-day prices they would need to put a lot more money into it even to keep pace with what we did when we were in Government.</P>
    <P>I do not ask the Government to accept my word for this.  They only need to go into this city or any urban area in Ireland and talk to the young people who will tell them of the obstacles which are in their way in relation to housing.  They should talk to old people seeking a flat from Dublin Corporation, Cork Corporation, Galway Corporation or any other body and the story is the same.  The young couples who walk the streets of this city seeking accommodation have their counterparts in every largely populated area in the country because the Government have failed to implement the plans of Fianna Fáil when in office.  They have ignored the warning of the Social and Economic Research Institute.  They have ignored the warning given from these benches and they have ignored the warning of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  They will <Col N="1812" /> not listen.  Who will pay for the Government's ineptitude in regard to the housing of the people?  It is the people who are on the house waiting list. The construction industry is grinding slowly to a halt.  The Department of Labour through their employment bureau can tell us the number who are unemployed.  The Central Statistics Office can tell us how many building workers are unemployed.  The Minister has no trouble getting information from his own sources.  If he took time off to talk to some of the people who have been looking for houses, whether they be purchase houses, rented houses or an old person's flat or maisonette, he would realise that there is something radically wrong with the construction industry as financed by the Government.</P>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to speak of the sufferings of the young and the old.  The Minister has a duty to tackle in a proper way the problems of the construction industry and its 20,000 plus unemployed plus the thousands of people who are on the housing waiting list.  There is a man-sized problem, and the Minister is the only one who has the resources to tackle this problem. We cannot command action.  However, the Minister has been appealed to by three important bodies in the State, the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Congress of Trade Unions and, last but by no means least, the Fianna Fáil Party.  If these three organisations are thinking alike on the gravity of the housing problem, the Minister and his Government will have to wake up to their responsibilities. If they do not wish to do that they have another option open to them, to vacate office and allow in a Government that will tackle the housing problem as was done in a traditional way. We could boast of the houses we built, but that is an empty exercise.  I cannot boast of houses being built by any Government as long as I can see thousands of young people on the waiting list.  The Minister may laugh cynically at the people who are on the housing waiting list.</P>

This Coalition cynicism must end shortly, and the Minister and Deputy Flanagan will have to render an account of their stewardship to the people.  There is only one answer they will get.  This is the Minister's third time to meddle with the construction industry.  In fairness to the Minister, let me say that Deputy Flanagan has more experience of this than he has. He was there twice before when the <Col N="1814" /> the Coalition Government wrecked the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully):</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate started off yesterday evening with Deputy Faulkner appealing to me not to throw statistics at him.  He was very anxious not to be baffled by facts, because facts are confusing to people who do not want to know what has actually happened.  It is nice to be able to say: &ldquo;We know the statistics.  We have heard them so often, and we want something else.&rdquo;  He proceeded to give his version of what the state of house building was in this country.  He was followed later on by Deputy Raphael Burke who took the same line, and now Deputy Moore has spoken.  Perhaps it was unfair that I did not stand up earlier, because Deputy Moore, not having prepared anything, had nothing to say.</P>
      <P>This country, in common with most of the nations throughout the world, and more powerful nations, is passing through a period of economic crisis unparalleled in recent years.  The Deputies opposite would lay all the blame for inflation on the shoulders of this Government.  In practically every other country where inflation is causing trouble reasonable opposition parties are pulling together with the Government for the purpose of promoting the national interest, but here it is not so.  Here Fianna Fáil, who thought they had a divine right to rule this country and suddenly found themselves out in the cold, can never forgive the National Coalition for putting them out there.  The result is they have been using this stupid claptrap in this debate.</P>
      <P>Does anybody in his sober senses think there was not a housing crisis in this country when the National Coalition Government took over?  If they think there was no housing crisis, as was suggested by Deputy Moore a few minutes ago, they do not know what was happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the time I started as Minister for Local Government I realised we had a crisis in housing on two fronts. We had a crisis because of the fact <Col N="1816" /> that not enough houses were being built.  We had a crisis because the number of local authority houses being built, small as it was, were substandard houses.  People should not be asked to live in substandard conditions. The Parliamentary Secretary was quite correct when he said the best Fianna Fáil could build were the houses with no fireplace, no back door and no back entrance.  Reference was made to a few houses out in Finglas without back doors which were completed during my term of office.  They were planned during Fianna Fáil's time.  Unless I stopped the whole scheme I could not do anything about that.  They were end houses.  Perhaps now looking back I would have been wiser if I stopped the lot of them and had good houses built.  The people living in them would be a lot happier.</P>
    <P>I decided I would not have the substandard houses Fianna Fáil were building.  I would not allow substandard local authority houses to be built.  I would not ask anybody to go into a house such as I was asked to look at when they were completed. The blame does not rest with the designer, or the builder, or the people working on the scheme, or the local authority, or the NBA.  It rests fairly and squarely with the Fianna Fáil Government.  They said: &ldquo;We have not a lot of money to spend on local authority housing.  We will do the best we can with whatever small amount we have&rdquo;.  In fact, it is on record that they decided it was wrong to build houses which would last more than 25 or 30 years.  That is the length of time houses were supposed to last under the Fianna Fáil Government and then the unfortunate tenants were asked to buy them under the 35 year purchase scheme at a ridiculous price.</P>
    <P>As we all know, the present Government took office almost three years ago in March, 1973.  In the year ended 31st March, 1973, the previous Administration had provided from the Exchequer a total of £46 million capital for all housing purposes. We increased that by 50 per cent to £68 million in 1973-74, and this year the total will be £122 million <Col N="1817" />&mdash;more than two-and-a-half times what Fianna Fáil were doing in 1972-73. Indeed, housing now accounts for about 30 per cent of the public capital programme.  There seemed to be some kind of a ridiculous idea in the minds of at least two of the Fianna Fáil speakers last night and tonight that, in some peculiar way, because Fianna Fáil gave only that amount of money and because they built a number of houses&mdash;the figure given was 22,000; I will deal with that in a minute&mdash; with a ridiculously small sum, it was wrong for this Government to provide the necessary money to have 25,000 houses erected each year.  In the next breath they wanted to know why we were not giving an immensely larger sum for houses.  This is the sort of twisted thinking some Fianna Fáil speakers seem to find quite easy to put across to satisfy themselves.  They do not satisfy me and I do not think they satisfy anybody else inside or outside the House.  Ridiculous nonsense is the only description I can give of the arguments these people are putting up.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in telling the House that the Government's annual target of 25,000 new dwellings was again handsomely exceeded in 1975 for the third year running.  The preliminary figure for new house completions in 1975 is 25,900, bringing to 75,000 the number of new buildings completed in the three years ended 31st December, 1975, as compared with only 51,000 in the last three years of Fianna Fáil administration.  Deputy Moore might remember that.  There was the difference between 51,000 and 75,000 houses.  There are 24,000 families who would not now be housed if Fianna Fáil were in office who are in good houses under the National Coalition Government.  He should remember that when he meets those people on the street&mdash;all the young people he talked about.  I doubt if it was down in Irishtown.  I have good news for him if it was, because I have signed a CPO for the City Quay recently and negotiations are going on to acquire land.  Nobody in Fianna Fáil had the guts to tackle the rack landlords of this city to make them hand over derelict buildings which <Col N="1818" /> should have been acquired years ago when houses could be built cheaply. They did not do anything about it. The result is that we will now have to pay a fairly hefty price for those old derelict dwellings.  We will rebuild the City Quay and the centre of Dublin, not with the assistance of Fianna Fáil, but in spite of their obstruction over the years and at present in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ray Burke last night and for a while today was rather incoherent in his address on this motion.  He gave a rather peculiar indication of his mathematical skills.  According to him, Fianna Fáil spent £46 million of public capital in 1972-73 and produced 21,647 new houses.  In 1976 this Government will spend £122 million and produce 25,000 houses.  Therefore, according to the Deputy, housing costs have increased by 144 per cent in the past three years.  Pocket calculators will go out of date if Deputy Burke keeps going at that rate.  He is either trying to bamboozle the House or has succeeded in bamboozling himself.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out to the Dáil on 20th November, 1973, as reported at column 37 of the Official Report, and on several occasions since, the number of houses completed in 1972-73 was not 21,647 but less than 20,000. The higher figure, as records in my Department clearly show, was distorted by the deferring until 1972-73 of the issue of about 2,000 grants for new houses due for payment in 1971-72 but for which the former Government had not provided enough funds in that year.  Secondly, the houses being built under the present Administration are not the substandard, so-called &ldquo;low-cost&rdquo; dwellings, imposed on local authorities by Fianna Fáil. They are good, soundly built and spacious houses.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we do not commence and complete the programmed number of houses all within the one year.  It is futile, as Deputy Burke did, to divide that number of houses into the capital provided and come up with a simple quotient.  A housing programme is an on-going affair.  Money has to be spent all the time not just in respect of houses being handed over, but also on <Col N="1819" /> the forward acquisition and development of land and the financing of construction work in progress.  For instance, local authorities held nearly 42,000 sites for future housing development at the change of Government in 1973.  The total is now 72,000 sites. This land bank had to be paid for.  A lesser number of houses were not being built.  In fact, more houses were built.</P>
    <P>It is also fair to say that with regard to the question of the number of grants that were not paid in one year and were carried forward to the next year, I suppose because the money was there, this had to be done.  We have not done that.  In the first year in which I was in office, we completed 25,365 houses.  If we wanted to do it, we could have carried forward the 365 to make a start for the next year.  We did not.  We announced the figure.  The next year we built about 26,600 houses.  Again we could have carried forward over 1,600 houses.  We did not.  They were built and announced, although our number for each year was mentioned as being 25,000.  We build 25,000 houses.  That is what we said we would do and that would have been quite satisfactory. We built over that and we gave the exact figures.  In the third year, the figures was 25,900 houses.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about all this is that Fianna Fáil keep saying &mdash;and for quite some time some of the people and organisations associated with them kept saying&mdash;that we were fiddling the figures.  There is no fiddling of the figures.  It is not possible even if we wanted to.  I explained the only way in which it could be done and Fianna Fáil used that in 1972-73.  But, apart from that, there is no fiddling of figures and the position is that, in order to do what is suggested, not alone would the Minister have to be dishonest, but his officials, the county managers, the builders, the ESB and various organisations throughout the country associated with the building industry would all have to be dishonest in order to prove the point Fianna Fáil are making, namely, that what they thought was good enough for 12 years when <Col N="1820" /> they were in office is not good enough when they are out of office.  That sort of argument will not carry weight any longer.  We are doing the job in a decent way.  We are giving the correct figures and I will not take it from Fianna Fáil if they try to put about the story that we are fiddling figures in order to make things look bigger. In one year, in two years, in three year we have exceeded the total and no one can get away from that.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of local authority housing, the most striking feature of the housing programme in 1975 was the record output of local authority dwellings.  Output exceeded 8,700 new dwellings, an all-time record.  The previous highest figure for any year &mdash;7,787&mdash;was achieved by the first Coalition Government in 1950-51 and this was, of course, mainly due to the dedication and energy of the late T.J. Murphy, when Minister for Local Government, and it is fitting that the record which resulted from his efforts should be broken by another Coalition Government and by another Labour Minister.</P>
    <P>The £65 million capital the Government is providing for the local authority housing programme in 1976 contrasts sharply with the £25.4 million made available in 1972-73 for that purpose.  Not alone have the Government secured this huge increase in local authority housing output but they have provided a positive incentive to all local authorities to tackle energetically the housing problems in their areas.  Before the change of Government in 1973 about half the annual nett cost of social housing fell on the rates and State subsidy amounted to £5.76 million.  This year £29.4 million will be provided by my Department in housing subsidy and practically all the deficit on local authority housing is now being met by the Exchequer. Only £855,000 will have to be provided by ratepayers in 1976 and next year the State will carry the entire deficit.</P>
    <P>On the private side it has been suggested, for some peculiar reason, that because I have insisted on those who are unable to house themselves being housed by the State as quickly as possible, <Col N="1821" /> I am trying to do down the private housing sector.  I will agree there has been considerable pressure for big increases in the loan and income limits under local authorities for house purchase loans.  Everyone knows that.  I want to make two points. There is such a steady demand for the loans on the present basis that local authorities will advance £46 million this year under the schemes compared with less than £10 million in 1972-73.  Equally important is the fact that if the loan limit were increased, as Deputy Burke demanded, to £6,000 and the income limit to £3,000, local authorities would be called on to advance not £46 million but nearly £100 million in 1976.  Deputies who have been demanding revisions of the present limits should say whether they would welcome the necessary additional State borrowing or else they should indicate the services they would wish to have cut back in order to divert this huge amount of capital to local authorities' loans schemes. Should the money be raised by an increase in income tax or by way of a cut in social welfare, as some people in Fianna Fáil seem to think would be a good thing?  I should like someone on the Opposition benches to comment on that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner referred to the &ldquo;colossal interest rate of 12½ per cent&rdquo; on local authority loans.  It is only right to put on record that this rate, which will remain fixed for the 30 years' duration of the loan, is being subsidised to the tune of 4 per cent by the Exchequer which has to pay more than 16 per cent on some of the capital raised for the local loans fund. It compares with an effective rate of up to 20 per cent charged by, and really paid to, hire purchase firms for consumer items which begin to depreciate in value from the date of purchase, unlike a house which continues to appreciate all the time.</P>
    <P>From the contributions of Deputy Faulkner and Deputy Burke one would think that persons of modest means had to borrow house purchase loans from local authorities or else do without. The fact is this loan scheme is only one source of mortgage finance <Col N="1822" /> for the private housing market even for borrowers of limited incomes.  The major source of finance is, of course, the building societies.  The inflow of cash into the societies since early last year has been so high they were able to advance £60 million in house purchase loans during 1975.  This is the highest amount they have ever paid in any year and represented an increase of 50 per cent on the £40 million lent in 1974.  We expect it will be higher again in 1976.  Loans are now more freely available from the societies than at any time in the past three years.  House purchase loan schemes arranged by the Government with the banks are also going extremely well. Already the banks have approved loans totalling £13 million, leaving £27 million available in the banks for further approvals.</P>
    <P>In so far as the overall position regarding house purchase loan finance for the year is concerned, I estimate that more than £150 million will be available during 1976 as compared with £61 million in 1972-1973.  I am glad to say that the indications are that all of it will be taken up.  How anyone could say the Government are not doing enough for housing when it cannot be denied that houses are being built at the rate of over 25,000 a year as compared with the miserly number of houses Fianna Fáil were erecting earlier I just do not know. Perhaps the key to this can be found in some of the statements made recently.  The Leader of the Opposition on 17th December last at column 1785, repeated verbatim by him on 28th January, 1976, at columns 617 and 618 of the Official Report said:</P>
    <P>We undertook in our housing programme, published in the late 'sixties and early 'seventies, that by 1972-73 we would have reached 25,000 houses output, which was reached.</P>
    <P>The plain fact of the matter is that at no time did the Fianna Fáil housing programme approach a yearly output of 25,000 dwellings.  The first mention of this target was in the 14-point plan published in February, 1973, by the National Coalition Parties.  Two White Papers on housing <Col N="1823" /> were published by the former Government in the 'sixties and one in the early 'seventies.  Apparently Deputy Lynch forgot&mdash;he did not tell a lie; he just forgot&mdash;that what he was saying was not correct.  One of the White Papers was on &ldquo;Housing Progress and Prospects&rdquo; published in November, 1964, setting out of the housing programme for the period up to 1970. At page 25 it said: &ldquo;The satisfaction of all needs would require an output of 12,000 to 13,000 houses a year but technical difficulties and the stress of demand on the building industry may prevent this level being attained immediately.&rdquo; In fact, the average annual output of new houses in the five years ended 31st March, 1970, was 12,188 so he was fairly close to the mark there but with less than half the number we are building now.</P>
    <P>The Second Programme for Economic Expansion progress report for 1965 published in February, 1966, referred in paragraph 192 to an annual programme of 12,000 to 14,000 new houses by 1970.  The White paper &ldquo;Housing in the '70s&rdquo; published in June, 1969, set out the then Government's housing programme up to 1975 as follows, on page 75: &ldquo;If certain population and other projections materialise it is estimated that the number of houses required by the mid-1970s may be about 15,000 to 17,000 a year, Unofficial estimates put the likely levels after that in the mid-1980s at about 21,500 a year.&rdquo;  Deputy Molloy, who was then Minister for Local Government, referred to this programme here in the Dáil on 27th December, 1971, and said in column 414 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>We have set up our targets for housing for the mid-'70s, targets that are based on a realistic appraisal of our needs.  It is a matter of top priority with me that, subject only to the resources that we can generate for the purpose, these targets will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The target for the mid-'70s was to achieve a house-building rate of between 15,000 and 17,000 per year.</P>
    <P>This was borne out by the fact that the annual average output of 16,221 <Col N="1824" /> houses was achieved in the four years ended on 31st March, 1973.  I am charitable enough to think the Deputy was misled by his expert advisers rather than that he set out deliberately to mislead the House.  Deputy Lynch said there was no necessity whatever for a crash programme, as the Minister for Local Government announced.</P>
    <P>The facts belie this assertion.  The present Government have been building an average of 6,000 houses a year more than the best annual average of the previous Administration.  All the houses have been occupied so obviously they were needed.  The big increase in output was also necessary. At the change of Government more than 30,000 families were awaiting rehousing by local authorities.  During the three years ended 31st March, 1973, an average of only 4,992 local authority houses had been completed. On that basis some families would have had to wait more than six years in unfit and overcrowded conditions before being rehoused.  If Deputy Moore went around the streets that time he would find many, many more people who had not a hope in the world of being rehoused.</P>
    <P>There are two matters which I should mention here.  The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O.J. Flanagan, referred to the fact that since I took office I have insisted on maisonettes, old folks' accommodation, being included in every public housing scheme.  A sizeable number have been already built.  We asked for 10 per cent and in most cases got it.  It was remarkable that Deputy Moore should refer to old people who talk to him about not being able to get houses. I do not know why they talk to him because when he was on this side of the House he did not do anything for them.  He could not get one house built for them.  Why they should go to him now when he is in opposition beats me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>I always tell the truth, as Deputy Moore knows.  I would now like to refer to the number of houses being built.  Deputy J. Lynch came in here on budget day and made a big <Col N="1825" /> thing of making a personal explanation to the effect that he did not say there were too many local authority houses built, but that there were too many local authority houses being built in relation to the number of private houses being built.  Somebody ought to take time off to point out the difference in that statement.  If there were too many local authority houses being built, I would like to know where.  I would like to see how he analyses and proves that what he said was that he did not agree with the rate at which local authority houses were being built. Perhaps some of the people on his side of the House who are very good at this type of thing might be able to give an explanation some time; they might even issue a White Paper on it. Maybe they will explain it at the ard-fheis. That would be a good place to talk to the people who come up from the country who, they say, are representative of the working classes, and tell them whether Fianna Fáil are in favour of building more local authority houses, or are too many being built, even in relation to the number of houses being built by the private sector.</P>
      <P>I think a slight slur was cast, I would not accuse Deputy J. Lynch of meaning it, when he said that in relation to those being built by people who want to own their own houses. I am glad to be able to say that those who now go in as tenants of local authority houses can buy them at a reasonable rate.  They also own their own houses and are every bit as good&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Fianna Fáil Deputies stand up and try to tell me that I am being unfair to those people, even though they know they backed to the hilt the regulation which was brought <Col N="1826" /> in by a Fianna Fáil Government, to use their own words, to rob them of their hard earned money when purchasing their houses.</P>

      <P>Thirty thousand people applied to buy their houses last year.  Those people would never have been able to buy their houses if a Fianna Fáil Government had been in office.  Yet, some of your people had the hard neck to suggest that because of what we were doing, people could not own their own houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our international rating, in terms of dwellings completed per thousand of the population between 1959 and 1973 was deplorable.  Ours was the lowest of the 23 OECD countries.  Our annual average of four houses per thousand was pathetically low, even compared with what are regarded as less progressive countries, such as Greece with 11.1, Iceland with 8.1, and Spain with 7.4.  The Opposition Deputies had the audacity to suggest <Col N="1827" /> that their housing programme, if it can be called that, was something anybody could be proud of.  Those are the facts.  We were the laughing stock of Europe.  Now that we are building a decent number of houses they have the nerve to complain.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by giving a few figures which might help Deputy J. O'Leary who, I think, is about to speak.  In 1972-73 the local authority dwellings completed in Kerry were 175, in Louth 54.  In 1975, 466 were built in Kerry and in Louth 387.  This is something which Deputies will be surprised to hear.  In Dublin county 878 houses were built in 1972-73 as against 1,036 in 1975, and in Dublin city 1,394 in 1972-73 as against 1,529 in 1975.  No matter what way one looks at it, the position has improved immensely in spite of inflation, opposition and every effort being made by people who should know better, who tried to prove that the housing industry was doing better than it actually was.  Representatives of the building industry came to see me a few days ago.  They wanted to talk about grants.  While they did not like the fact that I was taking the grant away, they were satisfied I was making a fair effort to meet them.  For Deputy Burke's edification, I also had the representatives of the housing co-op he talked about so much the other night, in with me an hour before Deputy Burke spoke.  They never even mentioned grants.  Incidentally, he misquoted Deputy B. Desmond because that Deputy did not say what Deputy Burke alleged.  In fact, he voted against the motion and defeated a motion which Deputy Burke supported that night.</P>
    <P>There is no point in anybody coming here and trying to say that this Government are not doing a great job for housing.  We have a fine record. We are proud of our record, of what we are doing in Government.  The proudest record which will go down in the history of this country is the number of houses which were built during the period of this the third Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I heard two people talking about <Col N="1828" /> the possibility of what Fianna Fáil would do when they got back into office.  I do not know what will happen in the year 2076, or if there will be an interest in housing grants then, but if Fianna Fáil do not pull up their socks and do better in opposition than they are doing, even 2076 will see them out of office.  I do not know who will be in office, but anyone who would be inclined to support Fianna Fáil would need to have his head examined.</P>

      <P>In replying to this debate I would first like to say to the Minister that if he thinks by shouting and roaring across the House he will do some good for building more houses and providing grants, he is making a big mistake.  It is regrettable the Minister did not give any reason why he withdrew the grant, which was the subject of this motion. He concentrated on the record of the Coalition Government.  It must be remembered that the really significant breakthrough in housing was made during the last few years of the Fianna Fáil Government when the number of houses being built increased from 15,500 to 22,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary:</NameTxt>
      <P>It must also be remembered that when the present Government took office, the foundations were laid for increasing that number rapidly, because the Government took over surplus building lands made available by Fianna Fáil and paid for by the Fianna Fáil Administration, as against the present position with circulars being sent to local authorities from the Department of Local Government asking them not to buy any more land for housing and not to be building up land banks around villages in rural Ireland.  This is a disgraceful state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true and I can produce the circulars from the Minister.  The Minister must bear in mind the fact that 50 per cent of our population are under the age of 25 <Col N="1829" /> years which means that more and more people will be looking for houses in the near future.  The Minister tries to confuse the issue by quoting statistics and referring to the fact that £46 million was spent by Fianna Fáil in 1973 as against £122 million in the recent budget, a figure which, in real terms, is less than the amount provided last year.  The real reason for the substantial increase from £46 million to £122 million was not the fact that more houses were built but that this Government failed to control prices.  They disregarded price increases, particularly the price of building materials.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government last night asked us to tell him where we would get money from for this industry. The fact is that the Government have their priorities wrong; they should have housing high on their list of priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's priorities are wrong and for the sake of £750,000 they decided to eliminate house grants for almost 95 per cent of those building their own houses.  The grant has been withdrawn at a time when the building industry requires an injection of capital and at a time when 8,000 more are unemployed in the building trade than at the same time last year.  It was suggested that the grants were scrapped because speculators and builders were pocketing the grants but that was a peculiar reason to cease the payment of them. If that was happening the Minister could have paid the grant to the first occupier of the house, as the local authorities do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary suggested that the payment of the grants was stopped in order to provide assistance for the less well-off but if he believes that a single man with an income of £40 per week is well off and can afford to build a house without the aid of a grant he is out of touch with reality, like the members of the Cabinet.  If the Government believe that a married man, with three or more <Col N="1830" /> children and an income of more than £45 per week, can build a house without the aid of a grant they are also out of touch with reality.  They should bear in mind that the average income of those employed in industry was said to be in the region of £53 per week, a fact which was disclosed recently.</P>
    <P>The loan limit of £4,500 is unrealistic when one bears in mind that the average cost of building a private house was quoted as £8,000.  The loan limit represents 56 per cent of the cost and without the Government grant people will have to find the other 44 per cent, a difficult task.  To add insult to injury the Minister increased twice within a period of two months the interest rates on local authority loans from 10½ per cent to 12½ per cent. The fact that these two increases came within months meant that there was, and still is, a substantial delay on the part of local authorities in paying loans to people.  It is well-known that all the documents went back to solicitors to have fresh mortgage documents prepared.  We must also remember that building materials increased in price by from 10 per cent to 25 per cent from 1st January, the day the Minister decided to do away with the new house grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Local Government, did not publish those substantial increases in the newspapers and builders' providers were surprised that they were not notified after the increases had been sanctioned.  That decision proved a massive blow to the building industry. It led to more unemployment in the building trade and allied industries. Some firms have since put their staff on a three-day week while others have laid staff off.  It has also meant a substantial increase in the local authority housing list imposing a further burden on local authorities who are in serious financial difficulties with their housing accounts.  For example, Kerry County Council owed £1,002,000 in January.</P>

I should like to remind the Minister that the Labour Party conference in 1974 passed a resolution seeking to have housing loans and grants increased.  Fianna Fáil are concerned about housing because the ordinary working man is anxious to build his own house.  We are determined to restore the grants and increase them to a realistic figure.  We are also determined to increase the amount of the SDA loan to a realistic figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided to build, in conjunction with Lansdowne at Limerick, a new milk powder plant in Cratloe, County Clare, some seven or eight miles away.  The two together would constitute a unit which would be viable in terms of milk usage under EEC conditions, which were to come into effect the following year.  That proposal was approved by the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy J. Gibbons.  There was almost unanimous agreement on that proposal.  The workers in the various places were agreed on it and the great majority of farmers, apart from a small number of larger farmers in part of County Clare, also agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Government changed in March, 1973.  Pressures were brought on the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries which caused him to change the decision of his predecessor, to scrap the Cratloe milk plant and to arrive at the situation where the Lansdowne plant was no longer viable on its own.  The <Col N="1837" /> Dairy Disposal Board had no option but to dispose of it to one or other of the very large creamery conglomerates in Munster.  The choice at the time was between Ballyclough, Mitchelstown or Golden Vale.  Golden Vale was the favoured one and they won the bidding, in so far as there was any bidding.  They took over the Lansdowne factory.  The result in terms of manpower in the Lansdowne factory at Limerick is that in the year 1972&mdash;here I quote from figures supplied to me and other Deputies for the region by the Irish Transport and General Workers Union&mdash;there were 532 people employed in the Lansdowne factory under the Dairy Disposal Board.  Next week, after these redundancies go through, as I assume they will unless the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries moves in to stop it happening, there will be approximately 90 people working in Lansdowne, an enormous decrease in a very short time.  It is proposed to make 450 people in the entire Golden Vale complex redundant.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that this is only part of the problem of the actual redundancies, because it has been the policy of the Golden Vale management over the past 12 months or so to encourage as much as they can what are described as voluntary redundancies among their staff.  On top of those who are now going to have to go in Lansdowne on Friday next, a large number of men were encouraged by financial inducements to retire or resign voluntarily over the last 12 months.  The loss of jobs therefore in Lansdowne alone, between this current redundancy and the so-called voluntary retirements over the last 12 months, is approaching, but not quite, 300.</P>
    <P>I want to deal primarily with the position in Limerick city.  My colleagues, Deputies Barrett and Daly, will deal with the situation that arises in Clare.  Limerick city has been a disaster area for employment over the past two years.  I received in the House yesterday a written reply from the Taoiseach of the number of unemployed in Limerick city at the moment.  The latest available figure <Col N="1838" /> for the 2nd January, 1976, is 4,305 people unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is in a city with a population of approximately 60,000, of whom a good deal less than half would be people who were in employment. Therefore, the proportion of people unemployed in Limerick city is extraordinarily high.  There has been an enormous increase in unemployment. At the beginning of January, 1974, the number of unemployed in Limerick was only 2,226, which is very slightly over 50 per cent of what it is at present.  The number of unemployed in Limerick city and county is 7,480, or was, at least, in April of last year.  I have not a more up-to-date figure.  It is probably about the same or slightly more.</P>
      <P>I have tried in the very limited time at my disposal to show in some way the shocking effect these redundancies will have in Lansdowne at a time when other traditional factories such as Ranks are about to have very heavy redundancies, when two very large clothing factories over a century old have both closed in the last 12 months or so, and when a whole series of other factories in Limerick and in Shannon have either large numbers of redundancies or have closed altogether over the past 18 months or so.  Limerick city cannot afford the closing of this one now, or the virtual closing, which is what these redundancies will amount to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To give an example, Sir, in County Limerick, in the rural area, there is the village of Herbertstown which had a thriving co-operative.  It was taken over not in the Dairy Disposal takeover but at an earlier stage by Golden Vale.  There were 16 employees there up to this week and 12 of them are being let go.  Herbertstown creamery, which was the focal point of that village and the only industry in that village, now becomes merely a small depot with four people and possibly will not even have four <Col N="1839" /> in a year or so.  The whole social structure in that village&mdash;and it is typical of many others that are being affected similarly&mdash;will be destroyed by this proposal of Golden Vale.</P>
    <P>At the time it was proposed that Golden Vale should take over the Dairy Disposal interests in Limerick and Clare, I, for one, opposed it because I said I was afraid that the interests of the workers would not be looked after and that hundreds of workers would be gone within a couple of years.  In fairness, I was supported at that time by Deputy Coughlan.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately there was not unanimity on the matter because the Minister for the Gaeltacht had a very different view and was very anxious that Golden Vale would come in.  He unfortunately persuaded his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, to accede to that view.  Because there were fears expressed very strongly about the future of the workers in Lansdowne and in the other smaller creameries in Limerick and Clare, strong representations were made by the union at the time, or the various unions, to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, who replied in writing on three occasions &mdash;I saw two of the letters&mdash;on each occasion assuring the unions and the employees that their jobs would be safe if Golden Vale took over.  They were given a written guarantee by a Minister of State.  As far as the ordinary worker in Ireland is concerned, there is no better guarantee that he can get than a written guarantee repeated by a Minister of State that his job is going to be safe.  Here we are, two-and-a-quarter years later, and on Monday morning next 90 people will go to work in Lansdowne where there were 532 only three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, Sir, that that is a deplorable situation.  While the Minister for Agriculture may now argue about the factors <Col N="1840" /> that have caused it, or the financial difficulties of Golden Vale and so on and that he cannot do anything about it, he has a strict moral obligation, if not a legal one&mdash;I think the unions are taking advice on this matter&mdash;to ensure the continuity of employment for all these people who are now being put out on the road.  This is happening in a city where there is the most appalling unemployment and where factory after factory has closed down over the last 18 months or two years.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture will tell us that he gave that guarantee in good faith, and I do not doubt it, but I call on him tonight to honour it. For goodness sake, do not condemn Limerick city and the rural areas around it for the fact that their biggest industry is going to be the employment exchange.  All the progress that was made in the Limerick/Shannon area in recent years will be set at nought if huge numbers of people are going to face what will amount to an almost permanent period on unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, even at this, the eleventh hour, to stop these redundancies, to make Golden Vale honour their pledge and to undo the harm that has been done by the unfortunate fact that Golden Vale were allowed to take over the Dairy Disposal Board.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up any more time because Deputies Barrett and Daly want to speak about this matter and I give way to them for that reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley has mentioned the Cratloe proposal. It had gone much further than just a proposal.  When we left office not only had the site for this milk plant been secured but planning permission had been granted and the milk supply would have come from east Limerick and County Clare and would have totalled over 60 million gallons.  Undoubtedly it would have been a viable proposition.  This had been sanctioned by Deputy Gibbons, as Minister for Agriculture, and it was set aside by the present Minister.  Whether the blame is to be taken collectively or <Col N="1841" /> not, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries undoubtedly had advice from his colleague, the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  As well as the Minister for the Gaeltacht, he had a minority lobby from the centre of Clare who were opposing Cratloe on the basis that it was not in the centre of County Clare.  He also had the IAOS lobbying against it.  After Cratloe had been set aside, the Clare farmers were asked to vote for or against Golden Vale.  They got no other choice.  They had no option but to vote for Golden Vale at that time.  The true facts were not put before them.  Nobody bothered to tell the Clare milk suppliers at that time that Golden Vale was in excess of £10 million in debt before they joined Golden Vale.  The fact that they were £10 million in debt means that the Clare milk suppliers are now obliged, since they left the Dairy Disposal Board to join Golden Vale, to pay 10 per cent of that £10 million by way of interest which they were not involved in incurring one way or the other.  They supply a third of the milk to Golden Vale and they must now pay a third of £1 million in interest on a debt which they did not incur or had no part in at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will remember that, when we were speaking to him with the union representatives a few months ago, the Golden Vale executives admitted that the haulage of milk from Clare to Golden Vale was costing more than £300,000.  Now that £300,000 would have meant slightly over a third of the cost of the Cratloe plant.  It was condemned by some people because it was not in the centre of the county.  Now the milk is passing by Lansdowne to Golden Vale at a cost of £300,000.  As Deputy O'Malley says, a commitment was made by the Minister to the employees that there would be no redundancies because of this takeover.  There are redundancies now, 450, a large number of which are in County Clare. The Clare Milk Suppliers are subjected to heavy interest payments, an insecure future for their milk and the employees have to walk out.  They have no choice because they are being <Col N="1842" /> made redundant.  Surely the Minister cannot say he has no responsibility in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister might have no responsibility for the inner workings of Golden Vale but he had a responsibility in 1974 when he allowed the Clare Milk Suppliers, the Clare workers and Lansdowne workers to join Golden Vale. They were supplying the Dairy Disposal Company, a State company, at that time, which came under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  He had a duty to find out what the facts were before the Clare Milk Suppliers and the Clare creamery workers were allowed to become part of a co-operative which has recently admitted to have been over £10 million in debt at that time.  The Clare farmers and workers had no way of finding out the position.</P>
    <P>Since 1930 they were part of the Dairy Disposal Company, the central creamery areas of Ennis, Kilrush, Ennistymon and Scariff and it is not correct to say that the Clare farmers could not make up their minds.  A big majority of the milk suppliers in Clare are members of the ICMSA.  This farming body backed the Cratloe proposal.  There was a small lobby working against Cratloe but, unfortunately, the Minister listened to them, among whom I regret to say was his colleague, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, to the detriment of the Clare Milk Suppliers and the Clare workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply concerned about this issue.  I believe it will have a very serious effect on employment in west Clare where they are already very severely hit by the unemployment situation, which is similar to Limerick.  Industries are closing down and people are losing jobs in long established industries.  This, above all, has been the main industrial concern in west Clare.  In County Clare there are 6,000 farmers with an average of ten to 11 cows per farmer supplying milk to creameries.  It is disastrous to find that jobs in this industry are in jeopardy and are expected to be lost next Friday.  This will have to be examined very closely by the Minister to see what can be done about it.  It is <Col N="1843" /> a very serious problem for the people who have been engaged in butter production especially in creameries in Kilrush and Ennistymon and who have won awards year after year for the quality of the butter they produce and also for the quality of the other produce which comes from that area.</P>
      <P>I believe it is a serious problem not only for the workers employed in the creameries but also for the farmers because there will be a worse service for them.  There will be one man creameries run by the managers. The farmers will not be able to get the facilities which they had to purchase manures and feedingstuffs.  It will not only be serious for the employees who are directly involved but for the farmers who will get a worse service.</P>

      <P>The first thing I want to say is that there is no public representative worth his salt, no matter which side of the House he finds himself on, who wants to see people losing their jobs.  In this particular case I sincerely regret the loss of jobs involved. The case has not been fairly put before the House.  I intend to put it as fairly and as clearly as I can.  The first thing that was said by Deputy O'Malley is that the purchase of this was given to the favoured one, that Golden Vale were the favoured group.  That is a complete distortion of the facts.  The Limerick Federation were given the <Col N="1844" /> first option.  They were given a reduction in the price to enable them to move in and take over because they had an important part of the supply, which none of us could guarantee would go to any particular point at any particular time.</P>
      <P>Next came Mitchelstown.  They had their go.  They were in the running.  It is not right to say that there was no choice open to the farmers in Clare except to either accept or reject Golden Vale.  Mitchelstown did their bit among the farmers and then pulled out.  In the finish they decided where they wanted to sell their milk.  Deputy O'Malley said that it was a concensus decision made by the previous Minister that this plant would be set up in Cratloe.  That is not the position I found when I came into office.  I felt that it was the right of the producers to decide what they wanted.  I had the Clare producers and the Limerick producers in my office no fewer than three times trying to get them to make up their minds what they wanted.  It is right to say that there was absolute disagreement between the Clare farmers and they could not make up their minds what they wanted.  They eventually went back and decided they would go to Golden Vale.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that this is so. One point I want to make clear is that it was not just my own policy to sell the Dairy Disposal Company's properties to co-operative interests.  It was the policy of the previous Government, and it has been the policy for some time.  The properties of the company have been disposed <Col N="1846" /> of in this way: Tipperary was disposed of to Tipperary Co-op in 1971; Coachford and Terelton to Ballyclough Co-op in 1972; Knocklong to Mitchelstown Co-op in 1972; Kerry to Kerry Co-op in 1974; Limerick and Clare to Golden Vale Co-op in 1974; Aughadown to Drinagh Co-op in 1975; Dunbar St to North Cork Co-op in 1975.</P>
      <P>What I am illustrating by giving these details is that it was established policy of both the last Government and the present Government to sell the Dairy Disposal Company's properties to co-operative societies.  In each case a condition of sale was that staff would be taken over on terms no less favourable than those appertaining prior to the transfer.  Prior to the transfer of the Limerick and Clare properties, the Golden Vale employees concerned were given a guarantee of continued employment.  Deputy O'Malley is quite correct in that.  The implementing clause of that guarantee which appeared in the sale agreement was as follows:</P>
      <P>The Purchasing Society shall take over and employ the managers and the other employees set out in the fifth schedule hereto at present employed by the first/second/ and in all respects and on the like terms as they are employed by the first and second vendors on the date prior to the possession date and shall not terminate their employment save on proper cause.</P>
      <P>On 6th November last I met representatives of the workers employed by Golden Vale to discuss the effect on the workers of the redundancies proposed by the society.  Local public representatives, including Deputy O'Malley, attended this meeting.  Due to the absence of representatives of the Golden Vale management, who would be the only people in a position to answer some of the questions which were posed.  I agreed to arrange a further meeting at which Golden Vale management would be present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This meeting took place on the 20th November, and it was attended by public representatives, again including Deputy O'Malley, union representatives <Col N="1847" /> and representatives of the Golden Vale management.  The overall redundancy proposals were discussed at length and it was agreed that there would be direct talks between the management of Golden Vale and the union representatives to discuss all the problems involved with a view to seeking an acceptable solution, and the Golden Vale representatives agreed to withdraw the deadline date of the 14th January.  I said that, should agreement not be reached by 14th January, arrangements could be made to reconvene a meeting.</P>
    <P>On February 3rd Golden Vale informed the Department that the talks with the unions were still continuing and they made it clear that only those employees who voluntarily accepted the terms offered by the management would be made redundant on 13th February.  Others would be kept on until agreement was reached with the unions.  Golden Vale has informed the Department today that some 50 per cent of the proposed redundancies would become effective on Friday next.  All these are accepting redundancy voluntarily subject to their receiving the benefit of any better conditions which the union may subsequently negotiate.  The remaining 50 per cent will be made redundant when an agreement acceptable to all parties is concluded.  Golden Vale also state that following representations they recommenced the manufacture of butter at Kilrush Creamery last Monday.  Manufacture will not be continued after Friday <Col N="1848" /> next because so many of the staff are accepting redundancy voluntarily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that the areas of Doire Bhó Riada and Doire Mhíle Mháma are included in the board's Clifden rural area where terms for supply under the final phase of the subsidised rural electrification scheme were quoted to 12 applicants in these areas in 1973.  The quotation to each applicant included a capital payment of £56.2 due to the high costs involved in making supply available.  The terms were not accepted at that time.</P>
      <P>In April, 1975, following an approach to the board the applicants were advised that subsidised terms were no longer available as the rural electrification programme had been completed in the Clifden rural area. To extend supply to the 12 houses at that stage, an overall capital contribution of £12,000 would have been required.  This was based on the cost of making supply available which would necessitate the erection of 5.6 kilometres of high tension line, one kilometre of low tension line, four transformers, service and meters.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in the Dáil recently I hope to introduce legislation shortly which will be designed to give further financial assistance to those householders who were quoted capital contributions, under subsidised terms, for connecting their houses to the electricity supply, but who were unable to accept the terms.</P>
