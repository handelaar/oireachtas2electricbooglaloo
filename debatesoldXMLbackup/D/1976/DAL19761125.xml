      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;3.  &mdash;Section 35 (1) (i) of the Credit Union Act, 1966 is hereby amended by the deletion of the <Col N="736" /> words &ldquo;Part I&rdquo; and the substitution therefore of the words &ldquo;Parts I and II&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is on the lines of what I think was agreed between the Parliamentary Secretary and myself on the last day.  He spoke of making the amendment in the Seanad rather than here.  It might be better to make it here.  Could I ask him if he intends to accept it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My consideration of this matter has been that it would not be appropriate to accept the amendment in the form in which it has been introduced by the Deputy.  The Act in question is a Credit Union Act.  Any changes made in the limits under the Credit Union Act have to go before the Credit Union Advisory Committee. Extending the powers in the way the Deputy has in mind to alter the limits for the friendly societies within the context of the Credit Union Act would mean that friendly societies who are quite distinct and different from credit unions would have to have the alteration of their limits processed through the Credit Union Advisory Committee.  This would be inappropriate and it would be mixing up pieces of legislation and dealing with friendly societies in credit union legislation which would be undesirable, as it would be undesirable to deal with the problems of credit unions in legislation not particularly designed to meet their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill.  Within the context of this Bill rather than by reference to the Credit Union Act, it is open to us to make the changes the Deputy and I agree should be made.  I have suggested that these changes should be made in an amendment in the <Col N="737" /> Seanad through this Bill, using the context of this Bill alone as a means of taking the power for that purpose and not making the change within the Bill but by reference to another statute designed for a different purpose which has a different means of control.  It is true that the original Government authority for the drafting of this Bill did not extend to the matters on which the Deputy and I agree.  These are the main objections to the course of action suggested by the Deputy.  I am sure he will be able to accept my <i>bona fides</i> in the matter and the anxiety I share with him that something should be done about the problem he mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Parliamentary Secretary agrees it is necessary, he is refusing to do it now on grounds which are a bit difficult to follow.  He says there would have to be consultations with the Credit Union Advisory Committee on raising the limits of the shareholdings or deposit holdings and insurance policies in credit unions.  There is nothing to stop that consultation.  The effect of the amendment is to bring Part II of the Schedule of the Credit Union Act, 1966 into line with Part I.  Part II deals only with friendly societies law and the Friendly Societies Act and nothing else.  I did not bring the Act into the House with me because I understood the Parliamentary Secretary was accepting this amendment.  I am sure he has it there.  He has three people to hand it to him.  If he looks at Part II of the Credit Union Act, 1966, he will see it deals with nothing but the Friendly Societies Act.  Am I right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, Part II of the Credit Union Act, 1966 deals only with the Friendly Societies Act, and gives the power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make regulations changing the limits there for the amount of deposits and other similar matters.  If it is intended as a result of the change proposed here to change those limits, then the Minister can have consultation with the credit union advisory committee.  That is the time he would have the consultation. It is not necessary for him to have them now because the limits are not being changed to any specific figure. At the same time the Parliamentary Secretary seems to give the impression that he will bring in an amendment in the Seanad on these lines in some different form.  Will he give me now an undertaking on the record of this House that he will do that, and I will withdraw the amendment?</P>

      <P>A brief comment, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording of section 35 (1) is that:</P>
      <P>The Minister, after consultation with the Credit Union Advisory Committee, may make regulationsel</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy rightly says, Part II of the Schedule deals solely with friendly societies and section 35 (1) deals only with Part I.  Therefore it was drafted with a view to credit unions, and the requirement about consultation with the credit union advisory committee was put into section 35 (1) because it was dealing with credit unions only, and I do not consider that that particular form of achieving the object would be the most appropriate.  I am prepared to consider very favourably the introduction of an amendment in the Seanad specifically to deal with the problem the Deputy has in mind.  I have some difficulty in that I have to consult <Col N="739" /> with my colleagues.  I imagine it will only be a matter of form but I at the moment cannot give the specific undertaking the Deputy seeks.  However, I see no difficulty in achieving in the Seanad the object I have already set in train.  Naturally enough the Seanad amendment would be coming back here and, if the Deputy is dissatisfied with the form in which it is then made, he can raise the matter again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair will appreciate the difficulty of trying to deal with a Parliamentary Secretary.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whose duty it is to attend this House, would attend it and would attend to his business here we would not have this difficulty.  I appreciate the problem the Parliamentary Secretary has.  He says he has no authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the utmost respect, that is all baloney.  The situation is that a Minister has to get the authority of the Government, just the same as a Parliamentary Secretary, to change the fundamental character of any legislation.  I am in no less a position to deal with this matter than the Minister would be, but the Minister, as I, would have to get Government authority in a matter such as this, and it makes no difference whatever that I am here rather than the Minister.</P>

      <P>It is very unsatisfactory that a trivial, minor amendment of this kind, which I thought was agreed in this House ten days ago, should now be rejected on the grounds that the authority of the Government has to be got to accept it.  Surely even a Parliamentary Secretary has authority to agree to something as minor as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may be making an error there.  If this amendment were widening the context of the Bill the Chair would rule it out; the Chair has not, and I think what the Parliamentary Secretary has said is a reflection on the Chair.  This specifically deals with friendly society law.  The Parliamentary Secretary is being unreasonable, and it is the most childish thing of all to run behind a story that he has to go back and get the authority of the Government just to add the words &ldquo;and II&rdquo; to &ldquo;I&rdquo;.  It is impossible to do business in the House if the attitude is such that the authority of the Government has to be got for every change of every comma.  I am prepared to withdraw the amendment if the Parliamentary Secretary gives me an undertaking he will introduce it in the Seanad.  He is not apparently prepared to give me that undertaking either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is very unsatisfactory.  The difficulty I am trying to deal with&mdash; and the Parliamentary Secretary should know this&mdash;is the difficulty that nearly every credit union in this country is in because these two figures are not added to section 35 of the Credit Union Act, 1966.  The Parliamentary Secretary agreed here with me the last day that this difficulty is here.  I have had many representations <Col N="741" /> from credit unions about it and they are in serious difficulties.  The Parliamentary Secretary said he was aware of that and that everything would be done to change it.  Now he is refusing to change it.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion the Parliamentary Secretary indicated that it was almost certain that the registrar would be a qualified practising accountant from outside the public service.  On Committee Stage he said that he agreed with that proposal but I wish to ensure that this will be the case.  I ask him to accept the amendment on the basis of its being in line with what he said during the Committee Stage debate.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to abolish the qualification of the registrar being a barrister of ten years' standing.  I agree with that.  It is obvious that the sort of job envisaged for this person, who also will be registrar of building societies, some of which have enormous turnovers in the region of £70 million to £80 million per year, will warrant his being an accountant of standing and experience and I have provided accordingly in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position here is that in the 1896 Act the qualification was laid down as being that of a barrister of ten years' standing.  With the passage of time it was found that this stipulation was unduly rigid and restricted choice to an undue extent. Considering that it has taken us all this time to get around to the job of making a change in the qualification as specified originally, it would be unwise to make the specific requirement that the registrar be an accountant of ten years' standing.  A provision that was quite appropriate for 1896 has been found to be inappropriate in terms of 1976 and it may well be that in 15, 20 or 40 years' time, professions may have evolved to such an extent that somebody who is understood to be an accountant may <Col N="745" /> not necessarily be the most appropriate person for the position of registrar or it may be that the type of work the registrar is performing will have evolved to such an extent that somebody with qualifications in addition to those of an accountant may be appropriate for the job.</P>
      <P>While an accountancy qualification is the most appropriate one for the position of registrar, a substantial amount of legal expertise is required, too.  Consequently, it may be necessary that we will need somebody with both legal and accountancy expertise.  If a man had acquired both in the course of his career he might not have the full ten years' experience of accountancy.  Rather, he might have some years' legal experience and some more years of accountancy experience.  Perhaps it would be more appropriate to appoint a person of such mixed qualifications to fulfil the diverse responsibilities of the registrar.  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to tie the Minister unduly as to the qualification in the way proposed by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can rest assured that the person appointed will be the right one in terms of meeting the needs of the day.  It is anticipated that he will be a man, not necessarily with ten years' experience of accountancy, but with adequate professional accountancy experience.</P>

      <P>I did not specify any particular type of accountant.  For example, it was suggested that one might insert the words &ldquo;chartered accountant&rdquo; but I left it as wide as possible and acted on the lines indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary on Committee Stage.  One of my aims in tabling this amendment is to endeavour to ensure that the registrar is independent of the Minister.  An amendment I had tabled to this effect on Committee Stage was defeated.  I could not table again the same amendment which was in <Col N="746" /> specific terms but to some extent I have tried to achieve the same purpose in the one before us.</P>
      <P>One of the ways of trying to ensure that the registrar will be somebody from outside who is not subject to the control of the Minister would be to set out some qualifications such as I have done which would make it unlikely that the person appointed would be a civil servant transferred to the job from the Department of Industry and Commerce or from any other Department.  I was hoping that the Parliamentary Secretary would accept this amendment which is very much on the lines of what he said on the last occasion on which we were discussing this Bill.  It is worth repeating for the sake of the record that what he said then was that no public servant from the Department of Industry and Commerce would be appointed to this position, that it was very unlikely that a public servant from any other Department would be appointed to it and that there was a high degree of likelihood that a practising accountant from outside the public service would be appointed. That being the situation and the Parliamentary Secretary having expressed those views, I feel the measure should be tied down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps I can help the Deputy by giving him a practical indication of our intentions which are to appoint somebody with professional accountancy experience.  It is pretty clear that the sort of work involved here is not the barrister of ten years' standing sort of work, that being the qualification hitherto. As the Deputy probably knows, there are not that many professional accountants in the public service. While one could not rule out the possibility that one of them might be appointed and, being appointed, he would retain his rights as would any public servant who is seconded to another post, it is likely that it will not be a public servant.</P>
      <P>I did not mention specifically as far as I can recollect that it would not be somebody from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I did not mention that Department specifically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the amendment should still be accepted. It is essential that a job of this kind which will have to be done in a very different way from the way it was done in the past should be done by somebody who has experience of business and of independent financial activity outside the public service. The duties which devolve on the registrar, particularly in his capacity as registrar of building societies and to a lesser extent in his capacity as registrar of industrial and provident societies are duties of enormous importance where on his own initiative, <Col N="748" /> he would have to take many important steps in relation to these very large and significant bodies.  I think he should have the freedom to take those steps which nonmembership of the public service would give him and he should not be beholden to the Minister of the day or any Minister at any time in carrying out those functions.</P>
      <P>He should be free to carry them out in the public interest and in the interest, in the case of building societies, of depositors and borrowers and, in the case of industrial and provident societies, of the shareholders in those enormous co-ops, their suppliers, customers and creditors. The job envisaged for this official for the future is very different from the purely mechanical recording function which he has only had to exercise up to now.  As I mentioned in the debate yesterday on the motion to establish a committee to deal with semi-State bodies, there is a growing tendency in recent months to try to subsume those hitherto independent bodies under the wings of various appropriate Departments, a tendency I deplore.</P>
      <P>It is particularly evident in the Department of Industry and Commerce where the recent appointments to the chairmanship of the board of the IDA and the chairmanship of the board of CTT have indicated a major change of policy which, in my view, is undesirable.  I think there is a reflection of it here to some extent in an unwillingness to give a guarantee that an officer of the Minister will not be appointed to a job which patently calls for independence of the Minister.  No matter what the calibre of the man concerned is, if he is an officer of the Minister he cannot exercise and be seen to exercise the kind of independence one would feel is essential in a position such as this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as friendly societies are concerned, this Bill achieves some useful objectives but the friendly societies are the least important of all the various associations or institutions of the kind we have been talking about and of the kind for which the registrar of friendly societies is responsible.  Now that the least important of these various fields has been brought up to date let us get on with the work of bringing up to date the ones that count.  There is a crying need for modernisation and amendment of our Companies Act, 1963. The Parliamentary Secretary has only to look at what has happened in the last few weeks in relation to a certain supermarket chain which went into liquidation in order to realise what the crying need is.  There are considerable difficulties at present being encountered by industrial and provident societies in the form of agricultural co-operatives where the shareholding of members is very limited and where the societies are trying to evolve a satisfactory system of higher shareholding by means of what is called revolving capital, which is not envisaged by the industrial and provident societies and which has given rise to a lot of legal difficulties.  There are needs, as has been made clear in the debate on the Committee and Report Stages here, for the bringing up to date of the law relating to credit unions even though the Act was passed only ten years ago.  Inflation has had <Col N="750" /> such an effect on the figures there that it was essential that those figures be increased on the lines which the Parliamentary Secretary has agreed in principle to do.</P>
      <P>Friendly societies are very limited in number, in scope and in their financial significance.  The Parliamentary Secretary has told us in his opening speech that the turnover of the whole lot of them in the past year was only £600,000.  He should bear in mind that one building society would turn over more than that in a week. For that reason alone, while welcoming what has been done in relation to friendly societies, I strongly urge the Parliamentary Secretary to take immediate steps to modernise in a similar way the law relating to companies and to industrial and provident societies in particular.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there is a need for a substantial body of law reform in the areas mentioned by him.  One of the important and, to some extent, novel elements in this legislation is that it takes power to effect a lot of these matters by order and to modernise them by order on a continuing basis, subject to those orders being debated here in the House and voted upon if necessary, rather than just made by default.  The type of provision in this legislation will to some extent prevent law getting out of date in the way the legislation that the Deputy referred to has got out of date, because if it is to be amended there has to be a full-dress debate in the House with all the preparation and delay that that involves.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why law goes out of date is that Ministers and Deputies try to include in it excessively rigid provisions which become out of date in the way that the Deputy sought to introduce some provisions into this legislation which I sought to oppose and successfully did so.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Minister for doing so.  I might say in passing that we should be mindful of the position of the Irish language when introducing new legislation. Where it is proposed to appoint a board we should, as we have in the past, avail of the opportunity of giving to that board an Irish title which, hopefully, might find its way into the life of the Irish people.  In that regard I have some slight reservation about &ldquo;An Chomhairle Um Fhiadhúlra&rdquo; in so far as it is a bit cumbersome.  On the other hand, in so far as it represents that which may be regarded as the perfect translation of the word &ldquo;wildlife&rdquo;, I suppose one cannot object too strenuously to it.  I had hoped that a word like &ldquo;nádúir&rdquo; which is familar to the people might have found its place here.  I appreciate that &ldquo;nádúir&rdquo; spreads beyond wildlife and applies not alone to wildlife but to people and personalities and, therefore, it might not be appropriate.  I welcome the amendment and I thank the Minister for it.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 43, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and may include persons who are members of recognised game councils, gun clubs and other kindred bodies.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage and, indeed earlier, concern was expressed that this legislation should do everything possible and appear to do everything possible to marshal all the voluntary forces already operating in this field. This legislation can only succeed with the co-operation of these voluntary bodies.  When the matter was being discussed the Minister acknowledged the efforts made in that area.  He went to the verge of saying recognition of that might appear in the legislation. When he was pressed by Deputy Daly, we were unhappy because we felt his assurance did not cover in full the basis for our concern.  Accordingly, we have introduced this amendment which does not precisely require the Minister to do it, but at least it would appear in the legislation.  I am sure its appearance would be welcome to all the people to whom I refer, apart from the most important fact that it would be showing due recognition of the contribution they have made and will continue to make.</P>
      <P>Everybody in this House knows that, were it not for game councils and gun clubs and the membership of those and other kindred bodies, our wildlife which, unfortunately, has become so depleted would be in much worse straits.  When the Bill was introduced Deputy Callanan referred to this.  I am sure the amendment will be welcomed by all and not only by Members on this side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> During the debate on the Wildlife Bill which was introduced in the Seanad as far back as 12th March, 1975, I have paid well-deserved tributes to the <Col N="759" /> voluntary organisations which have given such valuable help in connection with game preservation and wildlife conservation over the years.  Since the introduction of the Game Preservation Act, 1930, and the Wild Birds Protection Act of the same year, various Governments and Ministers charged with the preservation of wildlife have received great assistance from the voluntary organisations.  I want to take this opportunity once more to recognise that co-operation and assistance and to express my thanks to the Irish Wildbird Conservancy, the National Association of Regional Game Councils and the Irish Deer Society, to name but three, and various other organisations who, in one way or another down through the years in a voluntary way, have assisted the Minister and his Department.</P>
      <P>In more recent times since it was decided to replace the Game Preservation Act, 1930, and the Wild Birds Protection Act of the same year by this very comprehensive measure, the Wildlife Bill, 1975, my Department have had much consultation with the voluntary organisations I have been speaking about.  Again, I want to express my thanks and appreciation to those organisations for their suggestions in connection with this Bill and their input into the Bill.  As I see it, those organisations will still have a big part to play in wildlife conservation in the years to come.  I see myself availing of the experience and knowhow in the field of wildlife preservation and conservation which undoubtedly these societies have, and which they make available so generously and so readily to the Minister and the Department of Lands.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy Tunney is to the definition of an authorised person in section 2 of the Bill.  As it stands, that definition reads: &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; means a person who is appointed under section 69 of this Act by the Minister to be an authorised person for the purposes of this Act.  Deputy Tunney seeks to add to the definition the following words:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and may include persons who are members of recognised game councils, <Col N="760" /> gun clubs and other kindred bodies.</P>
    <P>I say, with the greatest respect and while recognising the good intentions behind the amendment, that it is not necessary.  If we go to section 69 of the Bill we will find that subsection (1) provides that: &ldquo;The Minister may appoint in writing a person to be an authorised person for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo;  We go back to the definition section and we find that an authorised person means &ldquo;a person who is appointed under section 69 of this Act by the Minister to be an authorised person for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I said on Committee Stage and I repeat here that I would look, in the first instance to the experienced and trained officers of my own Department when seeking persons to appoint as authorised officers, and outside that sphere of persons I would ordinarily and naturally look to the type of people covered by the amendment. Section 69 (1) and the definition are already broad enough.  They are unlimited and enable me to appoint people who are intended to be covered by the amendment.  I would say to Deputy Tunney and those who support this amendment that it is a patronising sort of amendment.  It is an amendment which might not confer the honour or pride of place that it is intended to confer on the people covered by the amendment, because the very first words of it say &ldquo;and may include&rdquo;.  With the greatest respect, I would say it suggests that it would need to be written specially into the Bill that members of these organisations would be called upon before the Minister would call upon them.</P>
    <P>My contributions towards this debate from beginning to end make it perfectly clear the regard in which I hold members of these voluntary bodies.  As I say, the definition of section 2 and the enabling provisions of section 69 (1) are broad enough for me to appoint anybody that I regard as suitable, and outside my own Department I cannot think of anybody more suitable than people who have experience in the field of game protection and wildlife conservation <Col N="761" /> when I am looking for people to deal with this facet of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to put it on record that the Bill deals with wildlife in the broadest sense.  That includes the game sector.  It would be quite invidious to mention any particular interests in the definition of &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;. However, the House may be assured that when it comes to the question of appointing authorised persons, all relevant organisations will be considered. Those who have read my contributions in the Seanad, on the Second Stage debate here and to the protracted Special Committee debate will come to the conclusion, I am sure, that the Minister can be relied upon to give due consideration and due regard to the people mentioned.  Instead of putting people that the Deputy has in mind in a special privileged position or in a grade one category, the phraseology of the amendment would seem to suggest that they are also qualified.  I hope that, on reflection, the Deputy will agree that the definition and subsection (1) of section 69 as they stand are not alone adequate to meet the point he has in mind but more advantageous to the people he is concerned about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment submitted by Deputy Tunney and I think that its acceptance will show in a positive way that he recognises the excellent work the voluntary organisations have been doing.  I agree fully with the Minister when he praises voluntary organisations for their achievements.  I cannot understand why the Minister takes issue with Deputy Tunney in regard to the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, because he uses the very same words in section 69 (1): &ldquo;The Minister may appointel&rdquo;.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider his position and accept this amendment proposed by Deputy Tunney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to accept Deputy Tunney's amendment.  As the Bill stands at the moment it is obvious that it will not be necessary for the Minister to appoint any member of any of those councils or clubs as an authorised <Col N="762" /> person.  It can be argued under section 69 that the Minister does not have to appoint in writing any person to be an authorised person for the purposes of this Act.  The Minister states that it is his intention to appoint experienced persons of his own Department and that he intends to appoint persons from outside bodies and organisations such as have been mentioned in Deputy Tunney's amendment. This should be built into the Bill, otherwise there will be no guarantee that these organisations, which have done and are doing tremendous work in the interests of conservation, would be recognised and that a member of these organisations could ever become an authorised person under this Act.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Minister's argument as regards the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; as against the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, if you look at section 69 it will be seen that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used, and in this context I feel that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is the appropriate word in the amendment. I agree that the definition of &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; is broad enough, but it is not positive enough to make it clear to all that a member of any of the recognised councils and clubs and other bodies could be appointed as an authorised person.  This amendment is not fundamental to the Bill, but it is important that it should be accepted so far as the calibre of persons to be appointed is concerned in regard to what Department or from what organisations or associations these authorised persons are to come from.  That should be spelled out in full.  This amendment should be accepted and the words &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; should be clarified more fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Deputy Tunney's amendment.  The main reason that the Minister might include the game councils and gun clubs in this section is because of the tremendous local knowledge their members would have in particular areas.  It is the local knowledge and co-operation of the community in different areas that will be a great factor in promoting the aims of this Bill.  The only way we can promote <Col N="763" /> the aims of the Bill is through the co-operation of organisations like the regional game councils and the gun clubs, which do such great work.  In County Galway the gun clubs have done great work in controlling vermin.  The gun clubs and other kindred bodies mentioned in this amendment would help to realise the aim of the Bill&mdash;the conservation of our flora and fauna.</P>
      <P>It has already been pointed out that the Minister used the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 69.  I do not see any great argument against we on this side of the House having the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in our amendment.  It goes back to the problem raised by Deputy Daly on the Special Committee as regards the definition of the words &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;.  From what I have heard on the Special Committee and here this morning I am not satisfied that this word is adequately defined.  In connection with the definitions &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; and &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo;, would the Minister let us know the difference between the two?  In supporting this amendment we would not just give recognition to the voluntary organisations but we would have people included who have local knowledge and who would give co-operation to the Minister and his officials in carrying out the intentions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I appreciate that the Minister probably intends to include these people.  Recognition should be given particularly to game councils as they consist of gun clubs and farmers, who are very important.  If you have not the support of the landlord, game preservation cannot be implemented. Another important point is that raised by Deputy Kitt, that is, the local knowledge of these people. That should be taken into consideration also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, I do not think any other word can be put in.  The reason for Deputy Tunney's amendment, as far as I know, is to have it in the Bill that recognition may be given.  The Minister says that can be done without. <Col N="764" /> These people have done so much in this sphere that to include them here would be a recognition of their efforts. Therefore I suggest that Deputy Tunney's amendment be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced that the Minister has given a valid reason for not accepting the amendment. Rather, I should think that he has made a case for it.  He repeated the concern that we all share for the type of voluntary effort which up to now has been evident in regard to the subject we are discussing.  When we consider the area of the preservation of wildlife to date we realise that the saviours of the various species have not been entirely the appointed officers of the Department but also the people I am talking of. The Minister suggested that the amendment was superfluous, that it contained an element of tautology but this legislation, more than any other, is legislation of the people. What is before us is a people's Bill. That is why I want our acceptance of that position given recognition in the Bill.  It is legislation which gives us an ideal opportunity to make reference to those people on whom we are so dependent in regard to the success of the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main concern is that the aims of the legislation be achieved.  The Minister referred to the amendment as being patronising.  I would not agree with him on that.  Is he talking of our being patronising in so far as we are endeavouring to give recognition to people who deserve such? The people to whom I refer are more important in this whole area than are those whom he indicated will be the approved officers.  Perhaps an officer from the Department will have a better knowledge of the subject than those other people.  At least he will have a little more statutory backing by way of having something in writing from the Minister but that will not guarantee his acceptance by local people especially in the context of the subject we are talking of.  I accept the Minister's sincerity in regard to the organisations I have in mind but how do we know that any successor of the Minister would give <Col N="765" /> them the same recognition?  Any successor to the Minister will be governed by what is contained in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The amendment may seem simple in content but we regard it as being very important to this legislation.  The Bill as a whole is regarded as being of great importance, a fact that is proven by the number of people who have come here for this stage of the debate.  The real importance of the subject may not be as obvious now as it will be in five or ten years' time.</P>
    <P>I have given consideration to the words &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this context and I reckoned that if I proposed to have the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; inserted the reaction of the Minister would be that he could not accept a situation in which it is spelled out in legislation that he must do what we have in mind, although in all probability <Col N="766" /> that would be how he would act.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; appears in subsection (1) of section 69, but I cannot see the major relevance of that subsection which says that the Minister may appoint a person in writing. That does not refer to what we are talking about.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment in the interest of the conservation of wildlife.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2 (a):</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 5, after &ldquo;includes&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;surveying,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is essential when we talk about conservation in respect of wildlife that we make provision for the identification and the scientific pinpointing of all the problems attaching to what we hope will be successful conservation. In other sections there are certain exclusions and inclusions in respect of education and science, but unless there is a scientific approach and unless certain surveys and surveying take place it will not be possible to treat all the problems attaching to wildlife conservation that really exist.  On an earlier amendment I spoke of how vital it was to provide for local knowledge, local interests, local personnel but simultaneous with that we must have a development which searches out the problems attaching to wildlife and makes these searches in an educated and scientific way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear from the legislation before us that conservation is dependent upon restricting the shooting and the pursuit of game and wildlife generally by persons.  We know that that is not the position.  We know, for instance, that the frightening reduction in fauna and flora in this country over the last decade has occurred because of other factors, especially the use of insecticides and <Col N="769" /> also the ravages of vermin.  I would venture to say that insecticides and vermin have done more to lead to a situation where one can no longer see a partridge in a stubble field in Ireland than has any man with a gun.  I give that as an example and as justification for my including here the word &ldquo;surveying&rdquo; which I hope would apply to the actual surveying of the land as well as surveys which would be carried out.  Unless we have this information and unless the land mass can be surveyed to indicate to us the extent of vermin and the extent of damage which has been done by insecticides and pesticides, it will be a rather futile exercise to hope that we could reach the point we hope this legislation will bring us.</P>

The reason I do not propose to accept it is that I do not consider that it is necessary and I believe that it is adequately covered by the existing provisions in the Bill. I hope to be able to convince Deputy Tunney that that is so.  Conservation, as defined in the definition section, is stated to include management, regulation and use of land in relation to the interests of wildlife and, when appropriate, development and improvement of land having regard to those interests.  I would put it to the House that &ldquo;management&rdquo; is a very wide term.  It is wide enough to cover anything necessary to manage lands properly.  Surely one of the paramount necessities of managing land would be to know what is on the land, to know the extent of the land.  Therefore, I am satisfied that the word &ldquo;management&rdquo; is wide enough to cover surveying the land.  I have no doubt about that but, if there is any doubt about it, it is already covered by another section of the Bill.  I refer the Deputy to section 65 which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any person appointed in writing by the Minister under section 11 of the Act of 1946 to be an authorised officer for the purposes of that section (which person is subsequently in this section referred to as an authorised officer) may <Col N="770" /> at any reasonable time enter on, inspect and survey any landel.</P>
    <P>That section confers on the Minister the right to send one of his officers to survey the land for the purpose of ascertaining whether there is any fauna.  I respectfully suggest that that section should meet and dispel any doubt the Deputy has in regard to the definition of &ldquo;conservation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Again in regard to the definition section, I am satisfied, and I am so advised, that &ldquo;management&rdquo; is wide enough to cover and include conservation. How could one manage something if one does not know all about it?  How could a man manage a farm if he has not access to each field to see if it needed manuring, if it should be tilled, if it needed fencing or if there was an adequate water supply there. In my view that is elementary. I am also satisfied that the Minister has research powers conferred on him under section 11 (3).  In my view it would be bad drafting to add unnecessary words to the definitions and I am satisfied, having considered the matter and being so advised, that the inclusion of the word &ldquo;surveying&rdquo; suggested by Deputy Tunney is unnecessary and I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view the Minister should accept this amendment because the inclusion of the word &ldquo;surveying&rdquo; is of great importance to the definition of the word &ldquo;conservation&rdquo;.  Surveying is the key to proper planning, development and management.  One must survey before one can carry out any development. The carrying out of a survey should be a preliminary step to any scheme of conservation.  It may be necessary one day to carry out a survey to see if a wild animal or bird should be protected. We may then be told that there is no authority to carry out such a survey because surveying is not included in the definition of &ldquo;conservation&rdquo; under this Bill.  Therefore, it would be impossible to carry out such a survey.  That could be used at least as an excuse.  Therefore the word &ldquo;surveying&rdquo; should be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned section 65. <Col N="771" /> In my view there is a big difference between the provisions of that section and a proper survey being carried out for the purpose of conservation.  There is a big difference between an officer being sent out on an inspection and carrying out a survey to discover if it is necessary to protect flora or fauna. I am convinced the Minister must accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not spend all day discussing the merits of one word as against another.  The Minister did not convince me that one can equate management with surveying. As I see it, surveying is a necessary antecedent to management.  It might be said that one cannot manage properly without having surveyed, but I do not know if this legislation recognises the importance of surveying. Section 65, to which the Minister referred, is an indication of that.  He said that the authorised officer may &ldquo;inspect and survey any land for the purpose of ascertaining whether there are fauna on the land which are in need of protection&rdquo;.  That refers to what the officer will see.  The Minister could argue that subsequent to that the officer will set in train certain surveys&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Precisely, and I have that underlined.  The performance of the Minister is governed by what is in this Bill.  In the definition section, page 6, line 5, &ldquo;conservation&rdquo; includes management and regulation. In my view it would be additional protection for the Minister and would satisfy more correctly the spirit of section 65, if we extended the definition of &ldquo;conservation&rdquo; to include &ldquo;surveying&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I should waste the time of the House covering ground already covered, but surely the Minister <Col N="772" /> will accept that unless there is a scientific approach the legislation will not be desirably effective. I refer specifically to the importance of education, of scientific application in the matter of conservation.  I repeat what I said earlier, that the ravages we see today are not highlighted in the legislation. If the Minister is satisfied that &ldquo;management&rdquo; refers to surveying and that it provides for the type of surveying I have mentioned, I would be happy.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2b:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 41, after &ldquo;take&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;bolt, dig out,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At the Committee Stage the Minister spoke about the dangers the draftsman enters into when he sets out to define any word.  The definition here is very important in regard to the word &ldquo;hunt&rdquo;.  The draftsman has given us about 20 words and they naturally set us wondering whether his attempt at defining the word was as comprehensive as we had wished. Reference was made to an exercise that has been occurring in that regard. There is reference to the circumstances in which a person hunting an animal would drive the animal to the refuge of a hole or burrow, not necessarily his normal habitat.  The animal is removed by the use of a special type spade, as in north County Dublin, or a fork.  The hunter proceeds to dig until such time as he has little between himself and the animal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see how any of the words in the section refers to that unsporting and unwelcome operation.  We gave it some thought and our description <Col N="773" /> of that operation appears in the two words &ldquo;dig out&rdquo;.  We think these two words should be included.  Words and traditions vary from county to county, but we understood from other members of the committee that such an operation is sometimes referred to as bolting, and we are attempting to have the word &ldquo;bolt&rdquo; inserted as well. We hope the Minister will accept this, about which there is nothing controversial. I am hoping he will not tell me that he considers it to be unnecessary. The committee were not satisfied that any of the words in lines 41 and 42 would cover the distasteful operations to which I have referred.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> One of the ways of attempting to prevent somebody from giving the obvious answer is to say: &ldquo;I hope the Minister will not give the obvious answer,&rdquo; and I admire Deputy Tunney's technique in that respect. In all sincerity, I regard the amendment as quite unnecessary.  The Bill defines hunting very elaborately in the following terms: &ldquo;stalk, pursue, chase, drive, flush, capture, course, attract, follow, search for, lie in wait for, take, trap or shoot.&rdquo;  Deputy Tunney proposes to add the words &ldquo;bolt, dig out&rdquo;.  I am satisfied that the activities mentioned by Deputy Tunney are included.  They could be included in &ldquo;chase, pursue&rdquo;.  I think &ldquo;bolt&rdquo; is another way of saying &ldquo;flush&rdquo;.  Therefore, I respectfully suggest that the activities covered by the words proposed to be added are already covered by several parts of the definition.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2c:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 49, after &ldquo;State&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and includes tidal estuaries and reservoirs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I raised this at a meeting of the Special Committee and I was not entirely satisfied with the reply I got from the Minister.  In my constituency we have the Shannon estuary which is tidal right up to Limerick city.  I am not satisfied that the Shannon Estuary is included in the definition. The mouth of the Shannon as officially defined is from Kilconneely Point in Kerry to Kilfinane in County Clare.  From there out to Loop Head is quite a considerable distance.  I suspect there might be territorial seas but from Kilfinane and Kilconneely up to Limerick city would not be regarded as territorial seas.  Therefore it would seem to me that this area is excluded from the Bill.  If that is the case, we need to amend the definition of &ldquo;inland waters&rdquo; to have it included. This can be done if the Minister accepts this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister gave an assurance that he would look at this matter and see if anything could be done about it before we got to this stage.  He has not made any changes in it.  Therefore, I assume he must be satisfied that this stretch of waterway from Limerick city to Kilfinane is included in the definition of &ldquo;inland waters&rdquo;.  I assume there must be other areas in a similar situation.  There is an omission from <Col N="775" /> the Bill and tidal areas could be excluded.</P>
    <P>Reservoirs were also mentioned. At the Special Committee the Poulaphouca reservoir was mentioned. It appears to me that Poulaphouca is not included either.  It is felt it is desirable that reservoirs should be included and therefore we suggest the inclusion of tidal estuaries and reservoirs.  Is the Minister satisfied the areas I have mentioned are covered in the section?  I believe they are not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I can appreciate Deputy Daly's anxiety in regard to the Shannon.  It was quite proper for him to raise this matter at the Special Committee.  I undertook then to look into it further. It was quite proper for him to raise it again here today.  I can tell him straight away that the Shannon estuary is an inland water.  This is a technical matter and I will just have to explain it section by section.  It will not take too long.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;inland waters&rdquo; is defined as meaning any waters comprised in the internal or inland waters of the State.  Section 5 of the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959, declares and establishes that the internal or inland waters of the State shall extend to all sea areas which lie on the landward side of the baseline of the territorial seas.  Section 2 of that Act defines the territorial seas of the State as that portion of the sea which lies between the baseline and the outer limit of the territorial seas.  The outer limit is defined in section 3 of the said Act as being three nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline. The baselines along the north, west and south coasts are straight baselines fixed under the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959, Straight Baselines Order, 1959.  The baseline along the east coast is the low water mark on the coast of the mainland or of any island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To summarise, therefore, anything lying inside a baseline as defined in the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959, is an inland water.  It may be a bit complicated and we may have to take it stage by stage, but there is no <Col N="776" /> doubt that the Shannon estuary, with which Deputy Daly is particularly concerned, is an inland water within that definition.  At the Special Committee I produced a map showing the baseline established under the Baselines Order, 1959.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3a:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 36, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other than moneys received under the terms of section 6&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want to suggest that this amendment, in the name of Deputy Tunney, is one the Minister should accept.  In the Special Committee we pointed out an internal contradiction which exists in the Bill in the fact that section 5 seems to be at cross-purposes with section 6.  Section 5 stipulates that all moneys received by the Minister under this Act shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister for Finance may direct.  That is very specific and very clear.  I suppose it is a fairly normal provision in legislation of this sort protecting the public purse and making sure that any moneys accruing as a result of the passing of this legislation or its operation or administration will go into the Exchequer and come under the general control of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6, however, deals with the question of gifts which may be made to the Minister or to the Government in respect of the purposes for which this legislation is being enacted. Section 6 is a very desirable and important section, and I think we would all like to envisage that public-spirited persons would be disposed to make such gifts to the Minister.  Again, I think we can all anticipate that there would be circumstances, with the burden of taxation as it is, in which many persons will not be able to maintain or keep up properties, and consider that the best thing for them to do is to hand these properties over to the State and ensure that whatever amenities they provide will be preserved for the good of the general public.  I believe that is something <Col N="780" /> Deputies on all sides of the House will agree should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Apart from the possibility of persons making gifts or handing over properties of one sort or another to the Minister and his Department, there is also the question of individuals making donations for specific wildlife purposes.  There are many people in our community who have a very lively interest in wildlife conservation. They would be prepared to make outright gifts of money if they could be certain that these gifts would be put to good use and would be used for the benefit of our wildlife and for maintaining our countryside in its present form.  There is, of course, on the world scene a very important fund, the Wildlife Fund which, I understand, receives enormous sums of money which it dispenses for worthwhile purposes in the conservation field and for different wildlife purposes.  We are also familiar with the situation which prevails in this country and, indeed, in Great Britain whereby there are traditional funds for various purposes in this area.  There is a number of organisations to which benevolent persons make donations to which they bequeath money in their wills for the purposes of the avoidance of cruelty to animals and or the protection of different species of animals. Many of us would not be happy that in the case of many of these funds the wishes of the donors and the benefactors are always fully carried out. In the case of many funds in this area a great deal goes on administrative purposes rather than being spent for the specific purposes for which the funds are ostensibly established.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is very desirable the Minister would be in a position to accept gifts from persons, organisations and companies for the general purposes which this legislation is intended to cover.  There is no better way in which people who are so minded could put their money to good use than by simply giving it to the Minister and his Department.  The Minister and his Department have now, and in the future will have to an even greater extent, more knowledge of what is needed in these areas than anybody else.  They are better equipped <Col N="781" /> to achieve the purposes which the people I am referring to have in mind. Section 6 is a very important and desirable section.  One would hope that the existence of section 6 would be publicised as much as possible so that as many people as possible who are interested in this area would know about it and would be prepared to use it to give effect to their wishes in regard to wildlife and conservation purposes generally.</P>
    <P>The Special Committee saw a danger here which we wish to avoid.  We see the possibility that the purposes of section 6 might be subverted unless it is made absolutely clear that any person, organisation or company which wishes to make a donation of either money or property for this purpose could be certain that their wishes in this regard would be fully implemented.  We do not want to see a situation where money gifts donated by well-meaning people could be diverted into the general Exchequer or for general Department of Lands purposes.  We would like to ensure that the Minister would be absolutely free to receive gifts, whether money or property, and devote them exclusively for the preservation and protection of wildlife.</P>
    <P>For that reason we have put down this amendment.  We want to take any such money totally out of the ambit of section 5.  As section 5 is framed at the moment, it seems that a gift given to the Minister for a specific wildlife purpose could be diverted into the general Exchequer and lost, or it could be diverted within the Minister's Department for some other purpose of a general departmental nature.  Our amendment is to make sure that section 5 does not apply in any way to gifts made to the Minister for the purposes of this Act.  As the two sections stand there is a danger of confusion.  As we know, a person making a gift may not always necessarily be specific in the terms in which they are making it.  One could visualise a person making a gift of this sort with a general intention that it would go towards the conservation and protection of wildlife, but not spelling that out as explicitly as would <Col N="782" /> be necessary.  We know that the Comptroller and Auditor General is very alert to the interests of the general Exchequer in all matters of this sort and will make sure that, pursuant to the statute and to constitutional responsibility, any money which properly belongs to the Exchequer will go into the Exchequer. Therefore, in certain circumstances we can visualise gifts intended for the purposes of this Bill being diverted, without malice on anybody's part, into the general Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We suggest that in section 5 after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; the words &ldquo;other than moneys received under the terms of section 6&rdquo; be inserted.  That would mean that section 5 would be restricted to that extent and could not in any circumstances be invoked by the Minister for Finance, the Comptroller and Auditor General or anybody else to take for general Exchequer purposes gifts which were clearly intended by the donor for the purposes of this Bill. Apart from achieving that overall objective, the amendment helps to make the Bill a better Bill, because there is some confusion between section 5 and section 6.  If our amendment is accepted the position would be much more defined, so that section 5 would only apply to normal administrative receipts as a result of the implementation and operation of the legislation and that section 6 would apply specifically and exclusively to money given to the Minister as gifts by well-meaning public spirited persons for the general purpose of this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Broadly speaking the object of this Bill is to conserve wildlife and for that purpose to protect certain wild creatures and flora.  Deputy Haughey anticipates that some well-intentioned benevolent and generous citizens might wish, and are very likely to desire to make gifts to the Minister for Lands or to the Government for that purpose. I know that Deputy Haughey is concerned to see that the Minister for Lands would have unfettered jurisdiction and discretion to apply those gifts for the purposes they were intended for by the donors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> The Deputy appears to be fearful that in some way section 5 of the Bill as drafted might capture these gifts for the general Exchequer or might, so far as the donor would be concerned, misappropriate gifts. There is no fear of that happening. The section as drafted confers absolute power and discretion on the Minister to use and apply gifts whether of money or kind for the purpose for which the donor donated them.  As Deputy Haughey knows well, when gifts are being made negotiations and discussions take place between the donor and the Department receiving the gifts for the purpose of ensuring that the gifts will be applied in the manner in which the donor intends. Sometimes gifts are made on certain conditions.  I go further and say that the legislation as drafted enables the Minister to apply the gifts for the purpose for which they are donated. Even if they are not subject to conditions, I am providing that they would be so applied.  This would be the case even if there was merely an expression of a wish on the part of the donor regarding the manner in which the gifts were to be applied.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the two sections. Section 5 which Deputy Haughey fears might capture the gifts for the Exchequer reads:</P>
    <P>All moneys received by the Minister under this Act shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister for Finance may direct.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the moneys mentioned in that section are moneys received by way of revenue under the Act, such as licence fees, car parking fees and, perhaps fees or moneys received from the sale of various items under the Act, items which the Minister is entitled to sell and also moneys received from lettings under the Act. Consequently, moneys received under the Act shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We come now to section 6, the existence of which makes clear that <Col N="784" /> gifts are being dealt with in a manner different from that in which revenue is being dealt with.  Specific and special provisions are being made for gifts under the Bill.  Section 6 reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may accept any gift made to him for all or any of the purposes of this Act, and, subject to the terms thereof, may apply it for those purposes.</P>
    <P>That is subject to the terms of the gift, whether these terms be written or oral.  The section does not provide that the Minister concerned may apply the gift, not with the consent of the Minister for Finance nor of any other Minister, but of his own volition. Is that not as clear as anything could be?  The only attempt to fetter the Minister or, indeed, to guide him, is contained in the terms of the gift, the terms laid down by the donor.  Like the provisions of most Acts, this is not new.  It has followed precedent as we will see if we refer to section 8 of the Forestry Act, 1946 which reads:</P>
    <P>All moneys received by the Minister under this Act shall be paid into, or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister for Finance may direct.</P>
    <P>That is the section dealing with revenue. Section 9, (4) of the same Act, which deals with gifts, reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may accept any gift made to him for all or any of the purposes of this Act, and, subject to the terms thereof, may apply it for those purposes in accordance with regulations which he is hereby authorised to make.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> In so far as there is any difference between subsection (4) of section 9 of the Forestry Act, 1946 and section 6 of this Bill, the provision before us is the more flexible.  I am advised that the fear held by Deputy Haughey regarding gifts being misappropriated is groundless but I cannot rely merely on advice.  I must, as Minister, accept the responsibility in putting the legislation <Col N="785" /> through.  Consequently, having considered this question carefully, I am satisfied that section 6 which deals with gifts is in no way subject to or controlled by section 5 and that the Minister has the sort of power, freedom and discretion in regard to gifts that Deputy Haughey would wish him to have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment before us is essential if we are to avoid ambiguity in respect of sections 5 and 6 of the Bill.  We must ensure that gifts or moneys which are donated to the Department of Lands cannot find their way by any means into the Exchequer as would seem to be the possibility in the context of the terms of section 5.  We must ensure that any such gifts or moneys are taken completely out of the ambit of section 5.</P>
      <P>It is of vital importance for the future that everything possible is done in the interests of the conservation of wildlife and of the environment. This is of particular importance to our tourist industry but apart from that consideration we must do everything possible to improve the quality of life not only for this but for future generations.  It may well be necessary that we promote campaigns in an effort to procure donations of gifts and money for this purpose.  Such promotion could be got under way by way of educational programmes on the subject of conservation; and these, in turn, would tend to encourage individuals to contribute and donate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that if such campaigns are to succeed any ambiguity as between sections 5 and 6 of this Bill should be removed completely.  The only way to remove it would be to accept our amendment in the name of Deputy Tunney.  This amendment clarifies beyond doubt that such moneys, gifts or donations should be applied for the purposes of this Act solely.  The Minister said that it is <Col N="786" /> quite likely that donations of the kind which he envisages would be the subject of negotiations and discussions. This could well be so in many instances but what about the position relating to wills?  Many a person may intend to provide some money in his will for conservation and protection of wildlife but because of some doubt as to whether the money would be properly used afterwards, whether it would go into the Exchequer, he might not will this money for the purposes of this Act.  We must remember that, strictly speaking, the word &ldquo;gift&rdquo; in section 6 includes gifts in the usual sense of the word&mdash;more than lands, more than property; it includes cash. If we are to get the gifts, donations and cash which we should get and which we should seek to get to make sure that conservation is a success and that wildlife is protected to the extent we would like, there should be no doubt as to how the money is to be accounted for.  I am firmly convinced that this amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my comment to the case so cogently made by Deputy Haughey and supplemented by Deputy O'Leary.  I think there is ample proof that the Minister has excessive respect for what has appeared in other legislation.  One can correctly accuse him of this and charge him with using plagiarism as a justification for what is correct.  To me, the copying of two sections from some legislation of 20 years ago is not necessarily a basis for doing something in 1976.  We are required to do the correct thing and if what already exists does not do what we think is necessary and what should be done, there is no point in quoting tradition and trying to justify a case on the basis that you copied two sections out of some earlier legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that, broadly speaking, this legislation deals with conserving wildlife.  We agree, but it also treats of the employment of every agent and agency in that respect. Surely the Minister will accept that there is a greater likelihood of people or associations or organisations making <Col N="787" /> gifts to conservation rather than to afforestation.  We must look at the situation before us.  As Deputy Haughey said, there are people and agencies so well disposed that one can anticipate that they might make a gift in the form of money.  I think the Minister did not deny that.  If that is so, the Minister will have to admit that his unpreparedness to accept the amendment in my name is an indication of the doubt which he has as to whether that money is provided for in section 6.</P>
    <P>I offer him the reverse of the situation as presented by us.  It is proposed to amend section 5 so as to exclude moneys which the Minister would get by way of gift from the power or the direction of the Minister for Finance so that that money would be available to the Minister for Lands.  Section 6 at present reads: &ldquo;The Minister may accept any gift made to himel&rdquo; Suppose that were to read: &ldquo;The Minister may accept any gift including gifts of moneyel&rdquo; would he accept it?  On his own argument, I think he would have to accept it but in view of his attitude to the amendment proposed to section 5 I must have doubts.  If what the Minister says in respect of section 6 is true, the logical conclusion is that he must accept the provision made in our amendment in respect of section 5.  The Minister made no case against it except that he was quite sure that it would happen and that it would be his function and right to accept and dispose of moneys which come to him by way of gifts. If that is so there should not be any reluctance on the part of the Minister to accept the amendment which appears in my name and which has been prompted by Deputy Haughey in respect of section 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support this amendment and in doing so I would like to support what Deputy Haughey said as regards the desirability of having section 6 in this Bill.  If we did not have a section like this the Minister would not be in a position to accept any gift in the first place, but it is obvious that there is a contradiction <Col N="788" /> between section 5 and this very welcome section 6.  Section 5 states:</P>
      <P>All moneys received by the Minister under this Act shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister for Finance may direct.</P>
      <P>Our amendment clarifies the position that moneys other than moneys received under the terms of section 6 and section 5 would be included.</P>
      <P>We are talking about conservation in this Bill, and if we have a public-spirited person who gives a gift to the Minister, perhaps in money terms or an area of land, we want him to be sure that this will be used for the purposes of this Bill and of conservation. I know that the Minister has doubts on this from what he said at the Special Committee and what he has said here to-day.</P>

There could be a situation whereby the Minister for Lands in a severe economic situation would get very little from the Exchequer and the fear that has been expressed on this side of <Col N="789" /> the House that the aims of this Bill would not be carried out would be well founded.</P>
      <P>Section 4, which relates to the expenses, is also related to the two sections we are discussing.  To make this situation clear the Minister must accept our amendment that moneys received by the Minister under this section other than moneys received under the terms of section 6 would be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer.  That would clarify the point we have been making on this side of the House.  We also made this point at the Special Committee.  I do not think it is desirable that the Minister should have all the consultation which we will see comes up later on in the Bill.  Consultation between Ministers as regards the section is possibly another day's work.  Again here we have the possibility of conflict between two Ministers and I feel that the result would be that the Minister for Lands would come out second best.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be as well at the outset of my concluding remarks that I should say that all on this side of the House accept the Minister's goodwill in this matter.  If we are pushing him on this amendment it is in order that this Bill would be a better Bill as a result of having gone through the parliamentary procedures here.  I would hope that, having listened to us, he would even at this late stage decide to accept our amendment. I think my colleagues and I have put up an unanswerable case. Let me first of all deal with the wording of section 5.  It says very specifically:</P>
      <P>All moneys received by the Minister under this Actel</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister endeavoured to suggest <Col N="790" /> that that referred only to licence fees and ordinary administrative receipts. I am afraid it does not.  It is totally wide in its application.  It is all moneys, no matter what, that are received under this Act.  If a person makes a gift of money to the Minister under section 6 nobody could possibly argue that that is not money received by the Minister under this Act.  It will be a gift of money received by the Minister under section 6 of the Act and therefore will be moneys received under the Act.  I think the argument in that regard is unanswerable.  Any Minister for Finance or Secretary of the Department of Finance as the Accounting Officer, or the Comptroller and Auditor General would have to look very closely and carefully at any gift of money made to the Minister under section 6 and say &ldquo;That comes within the ambit of section 5 and must go into the Exchequer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy J. O'Leary made a very important point about wills.  The Minister is inclined to fall back on the position that there will be negotiations when these gifts will be made. Perhaps in many cases that would be so and the matter could be put beyond doubt and the donor would say &ldquo;Under no circumstances is that socialist over in Merrion Square to get his hands on this gift of mine.  I want it specifically given to the Minister for Lands to be spent for that purpose&rdquo;.  That could happen under negotiation but, as Deputy J. O'Leary points out, some of those gifts could be made under wills and in fact many of them would be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but it is more likely that if it is made under a will specific conditions would be laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that later.  I would ask the Minister not to interrupt me.  I am making my own arguments in my own inimitable way. It is very conceivable that a solicitor, perhaps not as knowledgeable and experienced as the Minister but an ordinary solicitor, would be advising a client drawing up a will.  In the case where the client would say &ldquo;I wish to <Col N="791" /> leave £10,000 for conservation purposes&rdquo;, the solicitor would say in all good faith &ldquo;Well, the best possible thing you can do is leave it for the Minister for Lands for the purposes of the wildlife legislation&rdquo;.  The gift would almost certainly appear in the will &ldquo;I hereby bequeath the sum of £10,000 to the Minister for Lands for the purposes of the Wildlife Act, 1976&rdquo;.  That is a perfectly normal development which would occur in a will.  That, of course, immediately would bring that gift within the terms of section 5 and without any doubt it would have to go into the Exchequer for general Exchequer purposes.  The Minister must recognise that.  The wording of section 5 is far too comprehensive and certainly includes money paid to him as a gift under section 6.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go over the same ground again, but we would all like to see a situation brought about where people who are disposed to leave money for these purposes would leave it to the Minister and his Department. We all agree that that is the best place to which such gifts should be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am coming at.  We would like to see full use made of section 6.  Instead of well-meaning people leaving money to this or that organisation for the protection of cats, or for the development of some particular species, we would like to see such people encouraged to make their donations and gifts to the Minister for Lands because in that way they would know it was going for the right purposes and it would be scientifically directed.  The Minister and his dedicated staff know better than anybody else the way money of this sort can be properly and beneficially spent.  People could be certain that none of it would be frittered away in administrative expenses as can happen in the other organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was only as this Bill was teased out in Committee that one began to think a little better about it, but if I had to do it again I would propose that the Minister establish in his Department, <Col N="792" /> as a separate item, an Irish wildlife fund.  That would positively encourage persons to make donations and bequeath sums of money in their wills to that fund.  It would be separate, distinct, kept in his Department and administered by the Minister and his advisers and officials for the sole and specific purpose of wildlife and conservation. I am sure the Minister would fully agree that that would be a very desirable development.</P>
    <P>Section 6 could become a very important section, but it will not unless we make this safeguard.  I asked the Minister across the House if any gifts had been made under section 8 of the Forestry Act, 1946.  I would be very surprised if there had, because nobody knew about it or, if they did, they were not very certain what it was all about.  Anybody who wanted to leave money for a specific conservation or wildlife purpose would leave it, perhaps, to the world wildlife fund or to one of the organisations co-operating in this field.  Why can we not decide to make section 6 an important section and use it as a vehicle for channelling these funds into an Irish wildlife fund administered by the Minister?  I suggest we can do that if the Minister accepts this amendment.</P>
    <P>We are getting to a very late stage in this Bill.  It is not like an ordinary Bill where we could say to the Minister: &ldquo;When you get to the Seanad perhaps you will consider this and make an amendment there&rdquo;.  This Bill came to us from the Seanad and it will not go back there.  We are practically on our last parliamentary procedural legs at this stage, and unless the Minister accepts this amendment now, there is no other avenue open to us.  I very strongly urge him to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>If he asked any outside lawyer, who knows nothing about our parliamentary procedures, he would tell him that moneys given to the Minister as a gift for any conservation or wildlife purpose come within the wording of section 5 and will have to go into the Exchequer.  What objection has the Minister to the amendment?  He has not told us.  At the most he can say it is not necessary, but we say it is.  We also say that it cannot do any harm to <Col N="793" /> his Bill.  It cannot be in any way inimical to the interests of the Minister for Finance or the Exchequer.  It is merely putting beyond doubt the question of money gifts made to the Minister under the terms of section 6. It is making sure that there will be no doubt or ambiguity about the operation of section 6.  Anybody who wants to give money to the Minister for these purposes under section 6 can do so in the secure knowledge that that money will go for the purpose he intended and will not be diverted into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept that we are accepting his goodwill in regard to section 6.  We are concerned and anxious that he should have the best Bill possible when he takes it away from this House.  If he cannot see any particular objection to our wording&mdash;and I cannot see how he can &mdash;he would make us all a lot more secure and happier with the two sections if he would accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3b:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 45 and 46, to delete &ldquo;at the same time as is so laid the report for that year of his proceedings under the Act of 1946&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;within twelve months from the termination of the year to which the report refers&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Anybody who looks at the report of the Committee Stage will see that at this point in Committee we met but parted on what might be described as an unhappy note.  That arose because in our efforts to put what we regarded as a proper input into this Bill the chairman of the Committee, whose belated arrival I welcome to this House, endeavoured to prevent our exercising what we regarded was not alone our right but our duty.  I do not intend to develop that point but I want to show that as far as the Government are concerned they have one interest and one interest only, in this legislation and that is to get it through this House as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Committee, this legislation did not have the benefit of more than half a dozen contributions by Committee <Col N="794" /> members representing the Government side.  This can be shown as a sample of other legislation.  Perhaps it reflects the attitude of this Government where they decide on something in a broad way; it is handed to the draftsmen, to civil servants, and a Minister comes here and his only anxiety is to get it through the House in any way possible and say: &ldquo;I have done that&rdquo;.  That is not our concern.  We regard this as most important legislation and we feel that it should not leave this House until it has the benefit of every worthwhile comment which could be made by any Member of the House.  Our deliberations this morning started at 11.45 and it is significant that apart from the Minister no other member of the Government parties was present until 1.50 p.m.  Have they been told to keep quiet?  Have they been told that this legislation should not receive any further notice?  Have they been told that the comments of this House are irrelevant to this legislation?  If they have, then we have not.  As one who has some interest in this area and who has regard for the contributions which can be made by Members of this House from all sides, I think it is regrettable that this legislation will go to the people without any contribution from a member of the Government parties, save the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant to the amendment because this amendment derives from the concern of the Minister to follow in the safe footsteps of that which already exists in other areas and which is not appropriate to the business we have here before us.  The Minister has said that it is customary that these reports appear in the fashion in which it is anticipated the report referred to here will appear.  Our answer to that is that this is not good enough.  We believe that reports have their advantages and that they are essential. Together with that, we believe that the value of a report is often diluted to the point of making the subject matter useless unless it appears at a relevant time.  Accordingly, we ask in <Col N="795" /> our amendment that the report referred to in page 8, lines 45 and 46 of the Bill should appear within one year from the termination of the year to which it refers.  In other words, if the report is in respect of activities in connection with wildlife and conservation for 1976, the report should be available before the end of December, 1977.  The compilers, editors and contributors to the report would have a year in which to prepare it.  If the Minister tells us that this is neither possible nor desirable, we will not accept it.</P>
      <P>What would the contents of this report be?  If the report is of the kind which we envisage, it would contain material vital to the legislation.  It would indicate possible weaknesses and inhibitions in the matter of the implementation of the spirit of this legislation.  It would highlight the absence of appropriate provision for the scientific pinpointing of problems and the absence of surveys which I believe are necessary if the business of conservation and preservation is to be conducted in a proper fashion.  On Committee Stage we would have been prepared to accept the recommendation of the Minister.  In other matters we have taken his assurance but we must have regard to the fact that he will not always be the holder of the office.  Nevertheless, we have accepted his assurances, but in so far as we detected from the Minister a complete lack of sympathy as to the importance of this matter we have tabled the amendment which appears in my name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for a report and there the Minister is providing for the satisfaction of the demands which occurred in legislation of the same nature in the past, but we keep reminding the Minister of how different this legislation is from all other.  This is very special legislation.  One even might use the word &ldquo;unique&rdquo;, except that one does not want to be accused of dramatising the importance at the moment of wildlife conservation, especially in these times when there are other urgent economic and social problems.  On the other hand, one has to accept that in its own right this <Col N="796" /> legislation is worthy of the full consideration of this House.  Regarding reports, it must be accepted that they should have a merit, a quality and a character which would make them welcome and attractive.  Reports should not become museum pieces, as has often happened in the past.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there was a considerable backlog in relation to the west of Ireland and priority is being given to a great extent to the west in the major telephone developments that have been occurring since the very sizeable injections of capital into the system from 1973 on.  The six exchanges to be converted in 1977-1978 will mean a major improvement in the service. There are plans also for conversion to automatic working of 15 other exchanges. In my view the future outlook is bright.</P>

That seems a reasonable priority to me.  I am sorry if it causes inconvenience to some people.</P>

      <P>I am informed by CIE that the working model of Rosslare Harbour is now complete and tests are being conducted at the Hydraulics Research Station, Wallingford, from which a final report is expected early in January, 1977.  The report will then be assessed by my technical advisers.</P>
      <P>A decision has not yet been taken on how the project, if feasible, might be financed.  The matter cannot be fully considered until certain legal aspects have been clarified and until a firm proposal for the project is formulated following examination of the report from the hydraulics research station.</P>

There are certain proposals but it has not yet been established (a) whether the scheme is actually feasible, (b) whether certain legal difficulties can be overcome and (c) where exactly the <Col N="805" /> project will be financed from.  The first thing that has to be settled clearly before anything else can be decided is the actual feasibility.  I imagine firm decisions in relation to financing are naturally being deferred pending the results of the feasibility study.  As I said, the final report from Wallingford is expected early in January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if, in view of the hardship which a further increase in air fares would impose on Irish people residing in Britain who take their holidays in Ireland and the adverse effects on the tourist industry, he will request Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte to pool their expertise in a co-operative operation designed to obviate the increased landing charges being sought by Aer Rianta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Landing charges at Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports are subject to my approval as are the level of air fares to and from Ireland.  In discharging these functions I am guided by the principle that as far as is reasonably practicable users should bear the economic cost of the services provided for them. The application of this principle must of course be balanced by consideration of the interests of the travelling public and of the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The airports, which are managed by Aer Rianta, are expected to operate commercially.  This means <Col N="806" /> that they must cover operational and other costs and, according as these increase, some increase in airport charges is unavoidable.  I have asked Aer Rianta to minimise the impact of such increases by the pursuit of economies in their own operations and by the development of non-aviation activities.  Aer Rianta have achieved a considerable measure of success in this direction and to that extent landing charges are lower than they otherwise would be.  I expect Aer Rianta to continue to pursue all means of curtailing operational costs and maximising revenue from nonaviation commercial activities so as to avoid unduly burdening airlines and passengers.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus must also operate to commercial criteria and must therefore take account of cost increases in proposing fare levels.  Here again I emphasise the importance of curtailment of costs and the pursuit of counterbalancing revenue from related and ancillary activities.  I am satisfied that the increases that have taken place in Aer Lingus fares have been unavoidable.</P>
    <P>There is close liaison between Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and Bord Fáilte on all matters of common interest, including the promotion of traffic, the standard of facilities, the development of incentive packages and so on. It would be unreal to expect that their joint efforts would be effective in obviating the need for increases in charges, but I agree that no effort should be spared to keep down the cost of travel to Ireland.  In this connection, I should point out that the level of standard fares between Ireland and the UK is the lowest in Europe on a pence per mile basis on comparable routes.  Moreover, in addition to the normal fares, there are special fares and arrangements designed to provide a wide range of choice for persons and families travelling from Britain.</P>

      <P>The Harbours (No. 2) Bill, 1975, was introduced in Dáil Éireann on 30th July, 1975.  The drafting of the Bill has taken longer than anticipated but I expect to be in a position to circulate a text next month.  Assuming Oireachtas approval for the Bill, my intention would be to declare 1977 to be an election year for the new authority.  The first annual meeting of the new authority would then take place, in accordance with the provisions of the Harbours Acts, on 13th October, 1977.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated to the Deputy that we are proceeding on the basis of trying to harmonise the number of those being trained in this college with the estimated <Col N="820" /> number of posts being available in the three- or four-year period running up to the end of this decade.</P>

Of the 50 who were notified approximately 14 indicated they did not wish to pursue the course.  I am asking the Minister why he changed his mind since he originally notified the number of vacancies there would be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it is the custom to offer places in the college in excess of the number mentioned by the Deputy.  It is true that the number of confirmed acceptances was less than 50 and that of these a smaller number registered with the college and of the final number a further six have withdrawn.  It is not that there is a reluctance on the part of the Department of Education to fill those places but that of those who had confirmed acceptance&mdash;not all registered&mdash;some registered and then withdrew.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is saying there is not a reluctance on the part of the Department of Education, surely there must be many other applicants who would have been next in line who could have been called upon or invited to fill the places which were not taken up by the 14 people, or thereabouts.  If the Department are not reluctant there seems to be no reason why the remaining 14 places should not be filled.  Unless the position has changed, there must be a huge number of young boys and girls who are anxious to get into the National School of Physical Education.</P>

I should like to remind the House that these are specialised teachers, as the Deputy very well knows, and it would <Col N="821" /> be socially undesirable that we should train specialised teachers and not provide some reasonable hope for their employment in the years ahead.</P>

The present detailed stage of planning cannot be regarded as complete until the VEC submit specifications of drawings for the mechanical and electrical services.  Then would follow the preparation of bills of quantities and other tender documents.  The VEC have not lately mentioned any date when they may be ready to seek tenders.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the grant allocated to Comhairle le Leas Óige is adequate for the purposes intended to be served thereby and that adequate use is made of it.  The grant for 1975 amounted to £167,000 and this has been increased to £200,000 for 1976.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned there is no objection to an arrangement being made between the three vocational education committees concerned under which some of the grant which is allocated for the purposes of An Chomhairle would be expended on activities in the areas of Dublin County and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <P>Comhairle le Leas Óige is a sub-committee of Dublin City Vocational Education Committee and as such, both it and Dublin City Vocational Education Committee are precluded from spending money outside the boundaries of the city.  However, they may enter into an agreement with other vocational education committees under section 40 of the Vocational Education Act, subject to the approval of the Minister for the expenditure of moneys outside the area.  In response to the specific query from Deputy Dockrell, I can say it would be our intention to give the money to Comhairle on the same basis as it has been given in the past and not to make any specific allocation.</P>

    <Title>Wildlife Bill, 1975: Report Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 3b:</P>
    <P>In page 8, lines 45 and 46, to delete &ldquo;at the same time as is so laid the report for that year of his proceedings under the Act of 1946&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;within twelve months from the termination of the year to which the report refers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Tunney.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was indicating to the House the importance which we attached to the report which this legislation envisaged would be made available in respect of wildlife conservation. Nobody would make little of the importance which is attached to annual reports but it is true that, where the report does nothing more than give a presentation of statistics and refers to facts which have occurred and which are no longer relevant, the value of that report is relatively insignificant and useless.  In this legislation we would like to see a report making a useful contribution.  The report should indicate to the community where there were inhibitions on the Department, inhibitions in respect of the spirit of <Col N="839" /> the legislation, and these indications should be acted upon.  We cannot see the report being acted upon if it arrives two or three years late.  It can happen as provided for in this legislation that the report might not arrive for two or three years.</P>
      <P>Supposing that matters connected with conservation which are in need of remedy are referred to in the report, the relevance will have disappeared if the report is not to appear for some years. The report should appear within weeks or months of the year to which it refers. We appreciate that there would be difficulties and that no Minister would like to have his hands tied to weeks or months but we certainly do not think it in any way reasonable that a Minister should shy away from it being mandatory on him that the report would appear within 12 months.  If there is a fear of that, one would be inclined to the view that, perhaps, the purpose of the report would be to conceal rather than reveal the facts, that it would be to satisfy only the need which legislation required that it should appear, but that in the matter of the contribution which ideally it should make it would be useless.  It certainly would not be in accord with the importance I attach to a report of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. We went into detail on all these sections on Committee Stage. We dealt for some time with and attached some importance to the procedure in section 7 in relation to the report.  The Minister may say that there is no precedent and that there is no obligation placed by law on any statutory body, or in any legislation, in relation to the Minister's duties as to the time in which the report was introduced.  There has been a good deal of criticism in this House from time to time about our having to examine reports a year or two after the period which they cover when their relevance is not of great importance.  There are other reasons why we should take a step in regard to this legislation.  This is non-controversial legislation so far as political or party views are concerned. We sought to help the Minister to improve it.  Perhaps at times the <Col N="840" /> Minister felt that we were impeding the progress of the Bill but we tried to do as good a job as possible on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>This is a bulky piece of legislation which covers quite a lot of things which directly affect the lives and property of people.  With good reason, it gives exceptional powers to the Minister in relation to property, behaviour and sport, particularly gun sport.  For that reason we hope that the report&mdash;which the Minister is obliged to make&mdash;would appear as soon as possible.  One would like to get the report one month after the year expired but that would probably be asking for too much.  Taking into consideration what has happened in the past, we believe that it would be reasonable to expect the report within a year.  It is not just to make it awkward for whatever Minister happens to be responsible for producing the report down through the years.  It is to ensure that the vast amount of work and the activities which are involved in relation to the provisions of this Bill will be made known while they are still fresh in the minds of the people and while people have a better chance of identifying with the happenings that have taken place throughout the country in relation to this Bill.</P>
      <P>This is quite a reasonable request. The Minister said on Committee Stage that he would like to ensure that the report would be ready as early as possible but that he should not be confined to a particular period to be set out in the Bill.  To leave it open-ended the report could fall into the practice which has characterised such reports in the past, of becoming a belated report, which we get in the post and which we will hardly look at because questions have been asked in the House long before the report came out about matters now contained in these reports.  We get these reports almost every day and when we look at the date we are often amazed to note that they are dated two years back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason we can forget about the precedent established in other legislation in which there is not prescribed a fixed period in which to report. <Col N="841" /> Our aim should be always to improve on past legislation and what we are proposing here would constitute a real improvement.  We would hope that the council which is to be responsible for preparing a report for the Minister would have that report ready at the end of the year.  We should not be concerned about the quality of the publication in terms of it having a glossy cover, for instance. The aim should be to get the report, even in draft form, before the House as quickly as possible so that Deputies could discuss the workings of the council.  Our request is reasonable.  I am prepared to listen to the Minister's case but I wonder whether he has changed his mind since Committee Stage when, as far as I recall, he gave an undertaking to consider this matter before Report Stage.  In many ways this Bill is an innovation in terms of legislation generally.  Every effort should be made to have the report ready within a shorter time than a year if possible, but certainly in a period not longer than that and that provision be made to have its contents debated here while they are still fresh in the minds of Deputies.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Tunney was critical of what he considered to be a lack of input on <Col N="842" /> the part of the Government in regard to this legislation.  He seemed to suggest that the Bill was being steamrolled through the House without adequate discussion and without adequate amendments.</P>
      <P>In view of those charges I should like to put the situation on record. On the 22nd January and on the 4th February last the Bill had a Second Stage Reading in the Dáil.  It was referred then to a Special Committee and that Committee met to debate the Bill at length on 17 different dates. As the House knows, on Committee Stage a Bill is teased out line by line and amendments are tabled.  Members may speak several times on each amendment if they so wish and, if necessary, further amendments can be tabled for Report Stage.  In the case of this Bill we find that, although following representations which I invited from the various voluntary bodies interested in this measure, there were 52 Government amendments for Committee Stage while there were merely two amendments from the Opposition, neither of which was tabled by Deputy Tunney but one of which was tabled in the earlier stages by Deputy Kitt and the other by that hard-working and energetic Member, Deputy Haughey.  I do not know where Fianna Fáil would be without Deputy Haughey.  He seems to find time to deal with all Departments and to answer all questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We shall deal with those in a moment.  The Bill, having been put through Committee was reported to the House and came before us on the 11th of this month.  The date for the Report Stage was ordered on Tuesday last in order to give Deputy Tunney time to table his amendments. But we find that although the Bill was ordered for last Tuesday there was a request from Deputy Tunney&mdash;he was not ready and he asked if I would have any objection to the Bill being put back to yesterday.  I said I had not and it was tentatively ordered first for yesterday.  I was asked if I had any objection to it being postponed to being the last item on yesterday's Order Paper.  I agreed to that. But even then Deputy Tunney had neither the time nor the energy to prepare amendments or to process them.  The seven amendments which he now boasts about having been put down, although the Bill was introduced in March, 1975, were stuffed, in manuscript form, under my office door late last night or in the early hours of this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am not thin skinned and I do not want to introduce controversy but I am not prepared to listen to sanctimonious lectures from Deputy Tunney on how I discharge my duties and how the Members of the House discharge their duties, when that is his record in regard to this legislation.  It is necessary to put the record straight in that regard lest innocent people might be misled into thinking that Deputy Tunney was rearing to go, eager for work, had all his work processed and was in some way being held up by me.  Nothing could be further from the facts.  The amendments with which we are now dealing are proposals to amend section 7.  Section 7, as it stands, reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister shall, as regards each financial year, prepare a report <Col N="844" /> of his proceedings under this Act during that year and he shall cause the report to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas at the same time as is so laid the report for that year of his proceedings under the Act of 1946.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes to delete the words &ldquo;elat the same time as is so laid the report for the year of his proceedings under the Act of 1946&rdquo;, and to insert &ldquo;within 12 months from the termination of the year to which the report refers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I share wholeheartedly the views of the Opposition when they say that when reports are held up indefinitely or unduly they cease to be as valuable as they would be if they were promptly presented after the period with which they deal.  I am doing, and will continue to do all I can to ensure that reports are promptly prepared and presented before the Houses of the Oireachtas but I do not believe that a statutory obligation to get a report into this House within a specified time will necessarily get the fullest, most comprehensive and most informative report before the House.  In some circumstances it might well result in a statutory report by which, in that context, I mean a report that would simply be brought in to comply with the statute.</P>
    <P>One of the basic objectives of the Bill as explained in the explanatory memorandum and as I have explained on a number of occasions is to bring about a unification of the services provided by the Forestry and Wildlife Service of my Department, two subsections of one section, to put it more correctly.  This is apparent in many areas of the Bill and section 7 is one good example of it because it provides for the simultaneous presentation to the Oireachtas of the annual reports relating to wildlife on one hand and the forestry activities of my Department on the other. Because of the unified nature of the Forestry and Wildlife Service as now constituted I would envisage that in practice a single report combining the activities of both sides of the service&mdash;wildlife and forestry&mdash;would be produced in future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> The first part of the proposed amendment would cut across that procedure because the section as drafted provides that the report of the forestry section and the report of the wildlife section would be brought in on the same date but the amendment proposes to divorce them and would make it obligatory to introduce the wildlife report within a certain time while leaving the forestry report to be brought in in accordance with subsection (6) of section 9 of the Forestry Act.  That subsection, which imposes on the Minister an obligation to bring in a report in respect of forestry activities, states:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the expiration of every financial year, cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas a report of its proceedings under the Act during that year.</P>
    <P>That is my first objection.  As regards the second part of the amendment&mdash; I appreciate the spirit in which the amendment has been tabled&mdash;for the reasons I have given I do not think it would be desirable or in the interest of the presentation of a proper report to write that specified time into the Bill.  This is partly due to what I have said about uniform procedure and to the reason that in certain circumstances it might have the effect of resulting in a report presented merely to comply with the statute.  I share fully the sentiments that an out-of-date report is less valuable than an up-to-date one and might very well be valueless but the Oireachtas has available to it machinery to chastise a defaulting Minister, and to expose the delays in bringing in a report.  Of course, the first and most effective opportunity is the Estimate debate, in which the Minister can be called to task for not bringing in the report within the proper time.  If it is considered that the Estimate debate is a dilatory or delayed method of dealing with this problem&mdash;indeed sometimes, due to pressure of business, the Estimate might not be dealt with &mdash;there is always the remedy of the parliamentary question which is available to any Member of the Oireachtas <Col N="846" /> on three or four days' notice.  He can ask when the report is being brought in and if he is not satisfied with the answer he can bring the Minister back on the adjournment and have it teased out.  If that is not considered long enough, Private Members' Time is available now all the year round, since the procedure was amended, and there can be a three hours' debate if any Minister is so neglectful as not to bring in a report.</P>
    <P>I have given this matter thought and I have put down many amendments to this measure&mdash;57 before the Special Committee in response to requests and points made to me and 25 for discussion here on this Stage. If I thought that this amendment on time limit was in the best interest of not alone getting a report but of getting a useful, informative report, then I would accept the amendment. However, I do not think so and for that reason I do not propose to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that this amendment should be accepted.  It is reasonable, and the case put forward by Deputy Tunney was very well put and very well argued.  I do not at all agree with the reasons given by the Minister for refusing to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>After all, a period of 12 months is a fairly considerable period of time for the preparation of an annual report for the previous year, particularly by a Minister of State who has the back-up service of his whole Department behind him.  When we consider the form that this report should take and when we take into account the fact that we are dealing here with a limited field&mdash;the field of conservation and protection of wild-life&mdash;it should not take more than a few months to prepare a very comprehensive report of the activities for the previous 12 months.  It is not at all unreasonable to insert this amendment in the Bill and to have it stated in law that the annual report should be submitted within a period of 12 months from the end of the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are presented here with a <Col N="847" /> golden opportunity of setting a headline for other Departments and other organisations as far as the production of annual reports is concerned.  Too often we see and read of reports by various State Departments and semi-State organisations referring not alone to the previous year but to years going back.  I have seen reports coming out of various State Departments which are so much out of date in comparison with the present-day workings of those Departments that they are not even worth reading.  The printing of these reports is a complete waste of time and of public money. The longer the publication of an annual report is left the greater the loss to the people interested in that Department or work, particularly when the delay goes over one year from the previous year.</P>
    <P>We have the census of population that is taken every five years.  We know that five years is a long period and that it is important that a census should be taken at least every five years.  We know also now that, despite the fact that only a very short period has elapsed since the time that that census should have been carried out, serious damage has been done to the whole country in many ways as a result of that census not being carried out, and not intended to be carried out, at the proper time.  I mention this as an example of the value of these reports if and when they are published at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>Fresh reports are of vital importance for numerous reasons, apart altogether from comment on the activities of the Department, section or service concerned. They are also of importance in order to rectify any errors.  As we all know, the longer these remain uncorrected, the harder it is to rectify them.  These reports could and should be used as well in reverse: to give praise to the good work being done when it is being done, and to consider ways and means of improving the good work being carried out by a Department or a section of a Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that there are numerous ways open to Members <Col N="848" /> of the Houses of the Oireachtas should there be a continuing delay in the publication of these annual reports, but we all know what happens when such steps and measures are taken.  We know well that, if a question is asked why the annual report of any Department has not been published to date despite the fact that it is a few years overdue, we are told that it is with the printers and will be published shortly, and that is the end of it for the moment.  Again, by raising it on the Estimate for the Department we know well that the consideration it will get will not be anything like what would happen if this amendment were accepted. Therefore, it should be built into this Bill that the report be published within a period of 12 months from the end of the preceding year.</P>
    <P>This reasonable amendment should be accepted.  I cannot see why the Minister and his Department cannot give a solemn undertaking to this House that there will not be more than 12 months' delay before the publication of the annual report.  This is one of the most reasonable amendments ever put down in this House.  I implore the Minister to accept it and to be reasonable in this case.  If a report dealing with the operation of this Bill cannot be published within 12 months from the end of the year, we might as well forget about the workings of this Bill altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. I support my colleagues in their appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment to place upon himself and his Department a statutory obligation to produce a report within a relevant period of time.  The Minister knows we discussed this at length in the Special Committee and, following on the views expressed there, we put down this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to think that with this legislation a new era will be ushered into the whole world of wildlife and conservation in this country.  I am certain that is what the Minister and his dedicated officials have in mind. In the organisations outside the Department which are interested in conservation and wildlife that is what is hoped for.  We want to see the protection <Col N="849" /> and preservation of our wildlife take on a new meaning in the life of our community, take on a new dimension, and become something of more importance and of greater significance.  How better can that be achieved than by the Department producing a comprehensive report on their activities every year?</P>
    <P>I would not be content with a comprehensive factual report.  I would like to see&mdash;and my colleagues share this view&mdash;an attractive, interesting stimulating document brought out each year showing where we are going and what progress has been made.  Many organisations are very successful in bringing out that sort of document, organisations whose purposes are not anything like as important as the functions of the Minister will be under this legislation.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not being unduly sanguine or optimistic in looking forward to a document being brought out each year in colour which would be available to our schools and which would be included in the school curriculum and would be mandatory for all our primary schools to study and be familiar with.  That document should stimulate throughout the community a new revival of interest in country life, wildlife and conservation in all these areas.  I foresee a great and significant part being played by this document in the future.  That is the idea.  If we are not going to have something like that let us not bother about it.  Let us forget about it.  Let us not have any report.  The Comptroller and Auditor General in the Committee of Public Accounts will make sure that routine administrative matters are examined and looked into.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House want to see something meaningful emerge from this legislation.  We hope and visualise a document of importance and significance which would be looked forward to every year by interested people, by different organisations, societies, naturalists, conservationists and everybody interested in this field.  We hope that this document by its very existence and by its annual appearance would stimulate many other people who might not be interested in this area at the moment <Col N="850" /> to become interested.  That is what we are looking forward to.  That is why we put down this amendment.  We want to see that interesting, colourful, attractive, informative document made available to the public within a reasonable space of time.</P>
    <P>I think that would be good for the Department.  The Minister is very fortunate in having many dedicated people in his Department who labour in this wildlife service above and beyond the call of ordinary civil service requirements.  It would be in their interests if they knew that their work &mdash;what they were doing, what they were achieving and the progress they were making&mdash;was to be recorded and displayed to the general public at an appropriate and relevant time every year.</P>
    <P>What good is it to them if three or four years later some dull and uninteresting routine report is brought out and read by no one?  That is not the sort of atmosphere we want to generate.  We see this document as a climax of the year's work of the wildlife service.  We want it brought out as quickly as possible.  The only reason I would tolerate any delay in bringing it out would be because they want to make it better, more attractive, fuller and more interesting.  If the Minister looks on this annual report of his Department in that light, he will not hesitate to accept our amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do the way the public service operates.  If he looks at any aspect of the public service he will see that, when there is a statutory obligation, a statutory mandate, the thing is done.  If there is not, it is postponed, put on the long finger, produced whenever time permits and nothing more pressing intervenes. Under EEC legislation, for instance, there is a statutory stipulation that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government must bring out every six months a report on developments. It is one of the few reports that appears promptly and regularly because there is a statutory obligation on the Minister and the Department to produce it.</P>
    <P>There are other areas in which, <Col N="851" /> if there is no statutory obligation, things are postponed and come out in God's own good time.  Deputies have experience of finding in their post a report of some Department or other and saying to themselves &ldquo;I did not realise that Department brought out reports,&rdquo; simply because in a period of three or four years they had not seen such a report. When the Department have no obligation by statute to produce a report in a certain time they will not do it until such time as they have nothing better to do, and then it is too late to be of any significance or importance.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with the Minister accepting the statutory obligation to do this?  The Minister for Finance has all sorts of constraints placed on him to do certain things every year and he does that.  If he is prepared to undertake these annual statutory obligations, surely the Minister for Lands should equally be prepared to do so.  It is no answer for him to say the matter can be brought up on the annual Estimate.  We are not discussing such a situation because as we all know very few Departments any more have their Estimates brought in here for lengthy discussion.  In recent years we have been rushing through a whole bookfull of Estimates at the end of the year, shoving them through in a matter of hours.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows there is no answer.  The only satisfactory way to approach this is that the legislation would place on the Minister and the Department a statutory obligation to produce a worth-while report so that everybody interested would see it while it was still relevant.  I am sure the schools, apart from others interested in an adult professional way, would like to see such an occurrence so that teachers could bring it into the classroom to have it discussed and examined.  That would do an enormous amount of good in so many cases that I could not possibly begin to talk about them here.</P>
    <P>I join with my colleagues in asking the Minister to accept this reasonable proposal.  It is no good for the Minister <Col N="852" /> to say this is not done in any other Department.  We are changing our procedures all the time.  We are doing things now that were unheard of and unknown when I first came here.  Let us set a headline in this new area.  We have never had a comprehensive piece of legislation dealing with wildlife.  Let us do the thing properly and bring out a fullscale, adequate report on time every year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and appeal to the Minister to accept it.  Year after year in the past ten years we have had more business coming on to the Table of the House and the result has been the crushing out of opportunities to discuss all the Estimates on an annual basis, and this goes for the Department of Lands. All of us agree with the aims the Minister has set out in the Bill, the objectives and the conditions laid down. We should like to see a better scheme for the preservation and conservation of wildlife because we all know that every age carries its own advantages and disadvantages and that although standards of living have been rising, standards in other directions, for the animal and wildlife in general, have been lowered.  That is apparent not only here but in many other countries and consequently wildlife in some parts of the world has become extinct.  It would be too bad that that would happen here and to that extent we all support the Minister's aim.</P>
      <P>At the same time, we have suggested to him that, concomitant with that, when a report is published its contents should be fresh in the minds of those concerned so that we could discuss them and make suggestions for the betterment of the running of the Department concerned.  In this case it would enable a debate to take place on the wildlife activities of the Department.  For that reason all of us here are in total agreement that it should be mandatory on the Minister to lay this report before us within the time suggested in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing extraordinary about this.  It does not take from but adds to the legislation.  It would be a <Col N="853" /> help in discussing the general activities of the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of this amendment I should like to add my voice to the pleas made by the other Deputies.  It should not be necessary for me to give the reasons why this report should be produced speedily. I am sure the Minister realises what would happen if the report was not issued reasonably early.  For instance, if there were recommendations in the field of conservation and the report was not issued for some time those recommendations might be irrelevant. I hope the report will be a factual publication and not just a lot of statistics.  I hope it will be attractive, interesting and stimulating.</P>
      <P>Such a report would be of interest to many people, not just Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It would be of interest to school-going children, their parents and teachers. When I mentioned this on Second Stage the Minister pointed out that this was a matter for the Minister for Education.  However, I am sure the Minister for Lands is aware that in most schools, particularly primary schools, there is a great interest in rural science and nature study.  One of the big problems in this regard is that there is a lack of text books and information for children undertaking projects.  In addition, such a report would bring home to young people the need for conservation.  Schoolchildren and their teachers would be interested in obtaining a copy of such a report.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made a good case for the publication of this report in good time.  The Forestry and Wildlife Section of the Department issued, from time to time, good and informative documents and they are used extensively in the classrooms. One of the reasons the Minister gave for not accepting our amendment was that the publication of the report might be held up at the printers but in my view he could get over such a situation by introducing a minor amendment himself.  The Minister has accepted our principle.  The IFA issued a report recently and I would like to see the report we are concerned with here being on similar lines.  The IFA report was very informative.</P>

I also mentioned that during Committee Stage debate there was a noticeable lack of contributions by Government Deputies.  I was endeavouring to demonstrate what I thought would be the shortcoming of this legislation because it would not have that vital element of contributions made by Members.

It is fairly significant that in regard to teasing out, in the words of the Minister, this legislation with a view to improving it, there is not in the report, apart from interventions by the chairman and one intervention by Deputy Hogan O'Higgins on the last page, one comment by any Member of the Government side of the committee.

We cannot yield on that because we want a period before any Estimate debate takes place here and we would be hoping that, if there were questions to be asked, they could be asked during that debate. We would be hoping that the material in the report would form the basis for discussion.  Therein lies the relevance and the importance of our amendment.</P>

    <P>In Committee Stage meetings many references were made to the importance of education and to the fascination <Col N="858" /> wildlife has for children and how, in the interests of conservation, we should cater for and capitalise on that, even indeed exploit it.  Deputy Haughey referred to this.  Deputy Kitt referred to it on practically every occasion on which he spoke.  It would appear that in the matter of satisfying that hunger and in the matter of what the report might do in that regard the Minister is quite happy that he need do no more than furnish the report under the same cover as the report he will furnish on forestry.  Everyone accepts that there is an affinity between forestry and wildlife.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will accept that the urgency of the legislation is because of the many new provisions in it, because it is a great step forward and because we have not had any legislation on this matter since 1930. He regards it as a vibrant, scintillating, fascinating piece of legislation and he will leave the scene as the Minister who piloted the legislation through the House.  However, at the same time, he is asking us to accept that a belated, dull, mundane, prosaic statistical report, issued some years after it is relevant, is in accordance with the legislation we are discussing.  I am afraid we cannot accept that equation. It only tends to convince us that he is concerned for the expeditious passage of the Bill rather than for its perfection. He wants to show a clean pair of heels to the House rather than leaving behind legislation that will stand well and that will serve its purpose.</P>
    <P>What is unreasonable or impossible about asking the Minister to have the report published?  It should be borne in mind that it need not necessarily be published within his Department. Under this legislation they are entitled to engage expertise in this regard. What is difficult for any Minister who has any interest in what he is doing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What is relevant to lands and forestry is not necessarily relevant to wildlife conservation, and the Minister knows that.  I am disappointed to learn from him that he considers this report must be spancelled to another report. This matter warrants a separate report of its own.  I do not know if the Minister is going to yield on this or on the other amendments which he will have the pleasure of seeing next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I raised this matter is because of the shilly-shallying that has gone on between the Department of Education and the vocational education committee in the last couple of years.  The Parliamentary Secretary indicated today that funds which were sanctioned prior to the beginning of 1975 would be allocated.  I brought to his attention that on 13th May, 1975, in a letter <Col N="861" /> to the chairman of An Chomhairle le Leas Óige, the Sport and Youth Section of the Department of Education, for which the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible, it was stated:</P>
      <P>A Chara,</P>
      <P>Further to the meeting which took place in the Department on 2nd May, 1975 in connection with expenditure of money allocated for the activities of An Comhairle, I wish to point out that, as a sub-committee of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, An Chomhairle is not empowered to spend money on activities outside the Dublin city boundary.</P>
      <P>This letter was written in spite of the fact that Statutory Instrument No. 328 of 1975 was in existence.  It is called Vocational Education (Grants for Annual Schemes of Committees) Regulations, 1975.  It commences with: &ldquo;I, Richard Burke, Minister for Education, in exercise of the powers conferred on meel&rdquo;.  Section 5 states:</P>
      <P>In respect of the financial year commencing the 1st day of January, 1975, there may be paid to the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, in addition to the additional grant a grant (to be called and known as a supplementary grant) not exceeding £167,000 of the corresponding expenditure incurred by the said committee, under arrangements which have been approved by the Minister with the sanction of the Minister for Finance in establishing and maintaining or encouraging or assisting the provision and maintenance of youth training centres for the Dublin City Vocational Education area, the Dún Laoghaire Vocational Education area and the functional area of the county of Dublin of the Vocational Education Committee.</P>
      <P>In spite of the existence of this document the Department of Education said they were not empowered to allow the VEC to release funds outside of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 19th February, 1976, a letter <Col N="862" /> was written to a gentleman in Raheny regarding an application by a youth club outside the city boundary.  The letter he received from An Chomhairle le Leas Óige stated:</P>
    <P>I wish to confirm what has today been communicated verbally to you. The youth club in Donaghmede, about which you spoke, appears to be situated outside the city boundary. By virtue of a recent decision of the Department of Education, Comhairle le Leas Óige is not empowered to provide its services to youth groups outside the city area. Accordingly, I regret to inform you that affiliation of the youth club cannot be considered by my committee.</P>
    <P>A letter from the Borough of Dún Laoghaire Vocational Education Committee, dated 22nd January, 1976, to An Chomhairle le Leas Óige stated:</P>
    <P>Please find enclosed copy of letter sent today to the Department of Education concerning the above.</P>
    <P>This was a letter dated 22nd January, 1976, to the secretary of the Department of Education and stated:</P>
    <P>A Chara,</P>
    <P>My Committee at their meeting held on 12th January, 1976, and indeed at some former meetings, questioned the fact that the services of Comhairle le Leas Óige have not been extended to their vocational education area.  They fail to understand why provision is made in section 5 of the Statutory Instrument No. 328 of 1975, and indeed in several former statutory instruments for this purpose, and yet the services have not been extended to the Committee's area.  My Committee would be grateful if you would look into this matter and let them have your comments at your earliest convenience.</P>
    <P>No reply was received to that letter. I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary why have the officials of his Department denied the authority of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee to extend outside the city area when the VEC of County Dublin and Dún Laoghaire have <Col N="863" /> agreed to this?  In fact, they have requested it.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that County Dublin VEC and Dún Laoghaire VEC in October, 1974, requested the sanction of the Minister for Education under section 40 of the Vocational Education Committee Act, 1930, for co-operation in the youth area but no reply was received from the Department on that.  This is very ironical because I have here a question which I would like to read from Volume 243, dated 4th December, 1969.  It is from the present Taoiseach and states:</P>
    <P>Mr. Cosgrave asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that at present facilities provided by Comhairle le Leas Óige which operates under section 21 (2) of the Vocational Education Act, 1930, do not extend to County Dublin or Dún Laoghaire; and if he will make funds available so that facilities may be extended to County Dublin and Dún Laoghaire such as are at present available within the County Borough of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The then Minister for Education, Deputy Faulkner, referred him to a reply of 13th February, 1969, concerning the matter.  The present Taoiseach then asked:</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that Dún Laoghaire and County Dublin are discriminated against at present? Perhaps he would consider making a grant available so that the Comhairle le Leas Óige service could be provided outside the borough area&mdash;I mean outside the city borough?</P>
    <P>The then Minister for Education, Deputy Faulkner, replied:</P>
    <P>I appreciate what the Deputy has in mind.  Discussions took place on this and it was decided that the city group could help in the other areas but that no extra money could be given for that purpose.  This year An Chomhairle received a grant of £53,890, which is £17,630 more than last year.  Perhaps they might wish to help.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> In other words, there was no objection whatsoever under the provisions which we introduced to an Chomhairle spending their funds outside the city of Dublin and in the Dún Laoghaire borough.  The Parliamentary Secretary owes an explanation why there has been this shilly-shallying, why the delay, why no replies have been received from the Department of Education and why there has been a lack of co-operation.  Nobody wants to be at war with anybody about this.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows that about three or four weeks ago I spoke to him about this.  I said I did not want to put down a question as I do not like to make politics out of youth work or anything to do with youth work.  I prefer to get things done quietly behind the scenes.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that I spoke to him on a number of occasions.  I told him if I did not get a response he would leave me with no alternative but to put down a question in the House, which I had to do today.  When the question was put down the Parliamentary Secretary's colleague, Deputy Percy Dockrell, had been primed to put another question down ahead of mine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Deputy that that question was not inspired. He can accept my assurance on that. The matter was as much a surprise to me as it was to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary offer some compensation in some way by allowing any applications for grants which have been made since this Government came into power, which were denied to them because of the refusal by the Department of Education to allow An Chomhairle to implement this, to be paid?  I also want to ask him, because of the lateness in the year and the possibility that there are still <Col N="865" /> funds which have not been spent by an Chomhairle, because they have not been allowed to spend outside the Dublin city area that this money be brought forward into next year and added to whatever the vote will be to the VEC.  That is the very minimum the Parliamentary Secretary can do.</P>
      <P>I am quite certain the youth clubs which applied to An Chomhairle in full expectation that they would receive grants for the various pieces of equipment and whatever decorating materials they ordered still have the invoices.  If those invoices are submitted to An Chomhairle I am sure they will be allowed to be paid for them from the time this began.  This would settle a lot of bad feeling which certainly is there.</P>
      <P>This question was asked by the Taoiseach on 4th December, 1969.  It was asked by Deputy Clinton on 13th February, 1969.  It was put down on 14th July, 1970, by Deputy Tunney to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Kennedy, and he was assured that the money could be spent outside the Dublin city area.  I hope I have made my case without engendering too much bad feeling.  I want to see that justice is done.  I am glad that, in the reply today, the Parliamentary Secretary said they are entitled to pay out these grants.  I think I interpret his reply correctly when I say that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Briscoe for the manner in which he has approached this question and his genuine desire to get to the rights of the matter.  I should like to start by quoting from a reply given by the then Minister for Education on 13th February, 1969, in which he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have authorised An Chomhairle le Leas Óige to make assistance available to clubs operating in the areas immediately outside the Dublin Borough Area&mdash;i.e.  Borough of Dún Laoghaire and County Dublin &mdash;in conjunction with the County Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Vocational Education Committees.  This <Col N="866" /> authorisation was conveyed on the clear understanding that the extension of the area of activity would not be a basis for seeking an increased State grant.  In the circumstances, I am unable to make an increased grant available to An Chomhairle as a result of this development.</P>
    <P>In other words, the position taken by the Minister of the day was that there would be no objection to Comhairle spending their money outside the area, provided there was an agreement between the three VECs, and that there would be no extra grant sought on the basis that money to be spent outside the area was involved.</P>
    <P>This was the position of the Minister since some time in 1968.  He took the view that he would be prepared to see money spent outside the area, subject to agreement.  The Director of Comhairle le Leas Óige, Mr. Lyons, wrote to the Department on 17th December, 1968, and said:</P>
    <P>I am also to draw your attention to the position that has now arisen and to the Minute of the Meeting where An Chomhairle has deferred the extension of its activities outside the City Area &ldquo;until the question of the financial arrangements had been clarified with the Department of Education&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The financial arrangements he was referring to were the adoption by the Department of Education at that time of the position which was subsequently contained in Deputy Faulkner's reply of 13th February, 1969, where he said this authorisation was conveyed on the clear understanding that the extension of the area of activity would not be a basis for increasing the State grant. In other words, Comhairle and, on their initiative the VEC of Dublin city, were not prepared to enter into the agreement in question unless they got the increased State aid which Deputy Faulkner, in his reply, said he would not be prepared to make available.  My position is the same as that of Deputy Faulkner on this matter.  We are prepared to give a grant to Comhairle, but we are not prepared to give them a supplementary <Col N="867" /> grant for Dún Laoghaire or Dublin County.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised a very pertinent question when he referred to Statutory Instrument No. 328 of 1975 which he quoted and which, apparently, contained departmental authorisation for this expenditure.  That Statutory Instrument was made under the Vocational Educational Act and it is subsidiary to the basic provisions of the Principal Act.  Section 7 provides that money may only be spent within the functional area of the Vocational Educational Committee in question by a Vocational Educational Committee. However, that is qualified by the provisions of section 40:</P>
    <P>Any two or more Vocational Education Committees may, subject to the approval of the Minister, enter into an arrangement for the joint exercise of any of their powers under this part of this Act, or on such terms and conditions as may be agreed between them, and if any question arises between such Committees in relation to such an arrangement the matter in question shall be referred to the Minister whose decision thereon shall be final.</P>
    <P>The basic position of the Department is that the Minister has approved, in principle, the making of such an arrangement. This is subject to the <i>caveat</i> that no extra State money would be involved.  By virtue of the statement of Comhairle le Leas Óige that they were deferring making such an arrangement pending getting a satisfactory answer, which they never got from their point of view about the financial situation, no formal arrangement under section 40 of the Act was made.</P>
    <P>To that extent, therefore, the provision in Statutory Instrument No. 328 of 1975, which says that this expenditure in Dublin city, Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin, was OK under arrangements approved by the Minister with the sanction of the Minister for Finance was incorrect.  It should not have stated that.  The Deputy was perfectly correct in raising the matter. The arrangement had not been formally entered into because of disagreement <Col N="868" /> about the matter raised by Deputy Dockrell as to whether a supplementary or special grant would be made available to An Chomhairle for the purpose of aiding Dublin County and Dún Laoghaire.  Obviously from the point of view of An Chomhairle there is a problem.  If we maintain our opposition that we are not going to give them anything extra, there is a problem for them that, if they decide to spend some of their general grant in Dún Laoghaire, there is that much less to spend in Dublin city and similarly if they decide to spend something in Dublin county.</P>
    <P>As to the failure of the Department to reply to the letters referred to by the Deputy, I can only offer him an apology and also offer an apology to the other people who did not get replies.  I can say that there is and has been considerable doubt as to the exact sequence of events in this matter, most of which occurred back in the late sixties and also as to the precise meaning of the provisions of section 40, as to whether section 40 applied to a case like this where, if you like, Dún Laoghaire had nothing and Dublin had something and where an arrangement could be entered into between two apparently unequal parties. Some people would argue that section 40 only envisaged the sharing of responsibility between the two authorities who had equal provisions but wished to intermingle them in some way, whereas this proposal is effectively for one authority which has something to give <i>simpliciter</i> to another, and the confusion about that accounts for the delay in the reply.</P>
    <P>The problem then is not resolved entirely from the point of view of the people in which the Deputy is interested, because there has not been this formal agreement.  I believe it would be quite possible to achieve a formal agreement which would be satisfactory to all parties.  Given the amount of money which is available to An Chomhairle as it is, generally having been drawn up on the basis of catering for Dublin city, it would not be possible, without grave disruption, to the services of Comhairle le Leas Óige in Dublin city, to envisage any major <Col N="869" /> scheme of An Chomhairle activity in the county or in the Dún Laoghaire area, and I can offer no hope whatever that the Department would be able to provide money to An Chomhairle on a scale that would enable this to take place.  In fact I can give no undertaking that any extra money can be given to them.</P>
    <P>Therefore I believe that the best approach to solving this problem would be for a meeting to be held&mdash;chaired, if necessary, by the Department of Education&mdash;between representatives of the three VECs and An Chomhairle, along with the Department.  We will see then if we can achieve an agreement which will satisfy the requirements of section 40 and will enable An Chomhairle to meet the type of case the Deputy has in mind.  However, I think I should say before this meeting takes place that I cannot envisage any extra money being made available, and I cannot envisage money being made available next year on the scale that would enable Comhairle activity to be extended on the same basis in the rest of the Dublin area as it is taking place at present in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>What I would envisage is that within the Comhairle grant we might be able to reach an agreement for certain limited activity the terms of which would be written down and formally agreed, perhaps in relation to clubs on the border between the two areas, which may be what the Deputy has in mind, and perhaps in relation to <Col N="870" /> other limited matters which would be agreed specifically between the three committees.</P>
    <P>That, I think, would bring the matter to finality, and I hope it can be so dealt with.  I would be perfectly happy to have this meeting take place at a very early date, and I will communicate what I have said here to the three authorities tomorrow.  I would hope that if they are interested, they will be prepared to come forward to discuss the matter.  In the context of that meeting all the legal difficulties can be thrashed out and the financial limitations which I have mentioned and which are very real, can also be put frankly before all three authorities, so that An Chomhairle can come to a firm decision whether or not they want to share some of their money with the other two authorities.</P>
    <P>I hope this interchange between Deputy Briscoe and myself in this matter will prove to have been useful, and I repeat the thanks I have offered to him for the manner in which he has approached it.</P>

Every effort is being made to have the necessary inquiries completed and a report furnished as quickly as possible.  As soon as this has been done the case will be decided without delay.</P>

      <P>Pension and lump sum are, in the normal course, payable on retirement not earlier than age 60 for established officers and age 65 for unestablished officers.  If salary was paid for absences on sick leave during <Col N="834" /> service, then the reckonable service referred to in the question would be 40 years.  The calculation of superannuation for established and unestablished officers, on the assumptions specified in the question are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Established Officer:</P>
      <P>Pension num40den80 ×£44×52num1den5=£1,148.40</P>

      <P>The deduction of £24.30, representing twice the single Social Welfare Retirement Pension rate, is made in the pension scheme for unestablished staff as they are eligible for pensions under the Social Welfare Acts.
