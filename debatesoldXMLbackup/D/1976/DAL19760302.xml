    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will give details of the unauthorised expenditure by the Eastern Health Board to which he referred on 21st January, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The funding of health boards is organised on the basis of periodic grant payments to the boards related to annual budgets.  These budgets represent, in general, the financial allocations for funding the approved health services administered by the boards.  As Deputies will appreciate, control of public expenditure on health services can only be exercised if these allocations are adhered to unless authority is given to any specific additional expenditures. In so far as the Eastern Health Board is concerned expenditures in excess of allocations have been incurred, and in some instances these were on services for which my Department's prior approval had not been obtained.  I do not regard it as appropriate to detail these instances since such matters are best dealt with by way of direct consultations between the board and my Department, but they would consist, in the main, of a number of building and maintenance works the funding of which had not been fully agreed with my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very pleased with the reply, as a member of that board.  On 21st January last the Minister made an allegation that the board were guilty of incurring unauthorised expenditure.  I have now asked him for details of the unauthorised expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There was unapproved unauthorised expenditure of about £700,000 on capital works.  No prior approval had been given by the Department. As far as details are concerned, these will be discussed between the officers of the board and the Department.  In respect of one <Col N="945" /> hospital, there was provision for a number of extra beds and this had not been approved.  I am not saying they would have been disapproved if application had been made.  That would amount to about £700,000 but there is a small number of other projects. Unauthorised expenditure was engaged in in this case.  There may be some doubt about it and there will be consultations between the officials of the board and the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has approval since been given for that expenditure and would the members of the board be surchargeable in a situation where such members authorise payments of that level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard about surcharges but in my experience of health and other bodies I have not seen them implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there provision in law for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This will come up at a meeting of the board on Thursday. They can be surcharged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say specifically in this case.  All I can say is that there has been unauthorised expenditure and that there are consultations between the board officials and the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that it should not necessarily affect the officials.  It obviously affects members of the board and is it not with them that the consultations should be held?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the officials discussed it with members of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This question arose when we were dealing with the plight of the health boards who owned £8 million and the Minister said this unauthorised expenditure was the cause of the board owing so much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that Supplementary Estimates come before the Dáil from the different Departments after the expenditure has been made?  Can the Minister say if this is not a regular feature of the running of Departments and boards of this nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have information of the Eastern Health Board only, but as far as expenditure of that kind is concerned, there were two Supplementary Estimates to provide for increases in salaries and for increased prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if the allocation of £33.59 million to the Eastern Health Board for 1976 for direct expenditure is an increase of 13 per cent on the figure provided for similar purposes for 1975; and, if not, if he will indicate the percentage increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation of £33.59 million to the Eastern Health Board for 1976 in respect of direct expenditure by the board shows an increase of 13.1 per cent on the corresponding revised allocation for 1975.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The original allocacation was £23.5 million and the revised allocation in 1975 was £29.7 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this figure&mdash;£31.5 million&mdash;was circulated by the Eastern Health Board?  Is the Minister saying that that figure is incorrect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I replied to the question put by the Deputy.  I told him the original allocation was £23.5 million and that the revised allocation as per the Estimate given by the health board in September-October was £29.7 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to hazard a guess as to why the health board have the figure of £31.5 million while his Department have the figure of £29.7 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Towards the end of the year there was unusual expenditure which was provided by way of Estimate. For example, £1 million of that was due in respect of non-recurring payments such as back pay to nurses and pharmacists.  That was included in the Estimate I referred to in the course of my reply to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it included?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained to the Deputy that this was non-recurring expenditure of back payments to nurses and pharmacists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this was direct <Col N="948" /> expenditure even though it was non-recurring expenditure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that the amount of grant money from the Minister's Department to the Eastern Health Board last year was not £29.7 million but £31.5 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but in determining the allocations for 1976 surely I would not have to repeat non-recurring expenditure.</P>

The virus believed to be responsible has, however, been isolated in some cases in this country and the possibility of an outbreak here cannot be ruled out.</P>
      <P>The practical steps which may be taken to control on outbreak consist primarily of offering vaccination to appropriate health service personnel and to those people who are most at risk from influenza.  This action has already been taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that 80 per cent of the people from a point south of the original signing centre must now travel 1¼ miles further to sign?  Would the Parliamentary Secretary be prepared to arrange a new signing centre in the south to suit the people of that area? Why was the centre moved to the post office from the crossroads centre because I understand there is no accommodation at the post office?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

This is a bleak windswept side of the mountain and my information is that there is not sufficient accommodation at the other centre.

    <P>In the case referred to by the <Col N="951" /> Deputy the recipient did not qualify for a widow's pension as she had been divorced by her husband while he was domiciled in Great Britain, and in accordance with the legal advice available to my Department she cannot be regarded as his lawful widow for widow's pension purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that the legal advice available to me is to the effect that once the facts of a marriage and subsequent desertion have been established a woman is entitled to a deserted wife's allowance provided any other requirements for entitlement are met.  When a woman becomes so entitled she can only become disentitled by ceasing to be a woman who has been deserted.  When I assumed responsibility in the Department of Social Welfare a woman in that position was not entitled, as she would not be now under existing legislation, to a widow's pension, but also she would not have been paid the deserted wife's allowance.  The sum payable is the same, so at least the woman can be extremely thankful <Col N="952" /> that there was a change of Government to allow something to be paid to her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell the House when the cost/benefit analysis was first commissioned and when we are likely to have a report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 12th April, 1972, proposals for an establishment within the Naval Service for a hydrographic survey were submitted to the Department of Finance for approval so that the question of the provision of necessary personnel might receive attention.  Approval in principle was also sought for the additional steps which would be necessary as soon as the requisite staff for the service had become available.</P>
      <P>In subsequent correspondence with the Department of Finance it was agreed that the question of setting up a hyrographic service would be made the subject of a cost/benefit study.  The study, which was mentioned by the Minister for Transport and Power at Question Time in the Dáil on 28th March, 1974, was carried out by Mr. R. O'Sullivan of the Department of Defence during 1974 and completed in November, 1974.  In the course of the study a visit was paid to the British Admiralty.</P>
      <P>Following departmental consideration of Mr. O'Sullivan's report, draft proposals to the Department of Finance for a programme for the setting up of a hyrographic service as part of the Naval Service were circulated on the 5th August, 1975, to the Departments of Transport and Power and Industry and Commerce for observations.  The Department of Transport and Power replied on 17th September, 1975, but the Department of Industry and Commerce are still considering the matter.  The draft proposals take cognisance of the State's responsibilities in any extended zones, that is, a 200-mile economic zone, which may be agreed at the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea which is to be resumed in New York on the 15th March, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Hydrographic Organisation, which is located in <Col N="954" /> Monaco, was set up in 1921.  Its purpose is to advance the science of hydrography and to promote the coordination of the work of the national hydrographic services.</P>
    <P>The British Hydrographic Department had, since 1963, engaged in carrying out a hydrographic survey of an extensive area of the North Atlantic to the northwest of Ireland, including certain Irish harbours and coastal waters.  Our authorities cooperated with the British in this survey. In 1970 the survey was extended to the south and south-west and an inshore survey of Baltimore Harbour was undertaken.  On the 20th April, 1971, while two of the British survey launches were moored at the pier in Baltimore the larger vessel, a 30-foot motor launch, was, to our eternal shame, blown up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the sea is a very big place and the physical act of carrying out a hydrographic survey is a very big undertaking.  Co-operation with other nations is extremely necessary and co-operation could further our case much more quickly than if we were on our own.  Therefore I would hope we would be able to get whatever information is necessary, particularly for the benefit of our fishermen, as soon as possible, and at this stage I ask the Department of Industry and Commerce if they could speed up their memoranda on what was sent to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The capital allocations made to date in respect of expenditure this year on major public water and sewerage schemes in progress or recently completed were based on returns furnished by the local authorities showing the financial position in relation to these schemes at 21st December, 1975.  In my opinion these allocations were reasonable and generally should suffice to meet commitments. If, in due course, the circumstances of any individual local authority raise a special problem, the matter can be considered further.</P>
      <P>In the normal course, allocations for new major works are not made until relevant loans are approved. Having regard to the level of existing commitments on a very heavy programme of ongoing works, including some schemes of exceptional size, new loans for further major works for which capital has been allocated to date are those in the small schemes programme, for which the total allocation amounts to £608,000.  I might add that the total capital provision for sanitary services programmes in 1976 is £19 million&mdash; £1.28 million more than last year and over 130 per cent more than in 1972-73.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is a relatively small increase when one considers the increase between 1972-73 and this year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Deputy is asking for my advice in the matter, because Dublin Corporation got £1,750,000 for 1976 and Dublin County Council who, as the Deputy is aware, are connected in many ways <Col N="957" /> in regard to water and sewerage schemes with Dublin Corporation, got £4,025,000, a total of £5,775,000 for the Dublin area.  This represents over 30 per cent of the total allocation for sanitary services. If Deputy Moore wants my advice it is to consider that they should not look a gift horse in the mouth.  They are doing very well and unless he believes that Dublin is Ireland and that they should get the whole lot he should be satisfied with what they are getting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

Therefore, there is a further check to be made and the question of money does not arise at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably, the Minister is aware of a cut-back of almost 50 per cent, or approximately £135,000 on the figure for last year. But is he aware that, because there will be no more money available from the Department, there may be redundancies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making the same sort of mistake that some of his colleagues made a couple of weeks ago in regard to this matter. The road grants allocations consist of grants for special improvement purposes. Such grants are applied to one local authority road in a given area. Obviously, when the work is completed there is no need to repeat the grant.  Therefore, an area may be allocated £500,000 or even £1 million in one year but get nothing the next year under that heading.  The grant is solely for the purpose of having this special work carried out.  In these circumstances it is correct for the Deputy to say that the overall grant for his county this year is less than the figure for the previous year but the decrease is in respect of grants for special improvement purposes.  The grants for normal works have been increased substantially so that there will be no question of lay-offs.  The people who are engaged in the special improvement works are usually contractors and workers who are engaged specially for such jobs.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Connolly, as I pointed out earlier, there is a reduction in improvement grants for national roads in Offaly solely because no further major improvement schemes are required in respect of those roads.  There are only 11.58 miles of national primary road in the county so in those circumstances they have done quite well so far as the grants are concerned.  As Deputy Enright pointed out, this grant was increased from £142,050 in 1973-74 to £230,000 last year.  The reason why it is only £60,000 this year is because the work is finished.  There is no mystery about it.  This happens to each county in turn.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the national primary road upkeep grant for Offaly is increased by £2,500 while the corresponding grant for national secondary roads in the area is increased by £16,950 and the block grant which can be spent on anything, including bogs, is up by £19,630.  The Deputy is usually fair-minded, and if he considers these figures he will agree that Offaly got a fair deal.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he has approved 100 per cent relief of rates proposed by Dublin Corporation to all those whose only source of income is old age non-contributory pension, blind pension, widow's pension and disabled allowance; and, if so, if he will ensure that this relief is extended in the case of all local authority areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the necessary approval to the Dublin Corporations waiver of rates scheme for 1976. The corporation's scheme enables consideration to be given to applications for rates relief in whole or in part from persons who are the recipients of non-contributory old-age, non-contributory widow's and blind pensions and from other persons not within the aforementioned categories who may claim that special hardship applies in their cases.  With regard to the final part of the Deputy's question, I would point out that under the Local Government (Rates) Act, 1970, it is entirely a matter for each local authority to decide whether to adopt a scheme for the waiver of rates and what categories of persons to cater for in any such scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulations made under that Act require only that any schemes adopted by local authorities or the amendment <Col N="967" /> of any such scheme should be submitted for the approval of the Minister for Local Government.  To date 37 local authorities other than Dublin Corporation have submitted schemes in respect of the 1976 financial year and have obtained my approval thereto.  Most of these schemes are similar to that adopted by Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question arises from the tabular statement circulated with my reply to Question No. 29 of 27th January, 1976, from which it was apparent that a number of housing authorities had not at that date furnished information about housing applicants which is sought by my Department from time to time.</P>
      <P>Returns have now been received in my Department from 71 housing authorities and I understand that the rest of the authorities are compiling the information as quickly as they can.  Some of them do not maintain waiting lists, but advertise dwellings for letting when they are being built.

      <P>There was a reference a few moments ago to somebody not reading his brief properly, but might I suggest that Deputy O'Leary, who should know about these matters, would be helped by reading his brief before beginning to ask questions. There is no statutory obligation on housing authorities to supply the information to the Department.  The statutory requirement in the matter derives from section 53 of the Housing Act, 1966, which imposes a duty on housing authorities to inspect houses in their area and to assess the adequacy of the supply and condition of housing.  It does not require them to submit the assessment to the Minister, nor is there any requirement of my approval.  It is only since I took over that information of this kind has been brought up-to-date.

I am prepared to consider granting recognition in the case of a country which is willing to reciprocate.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable powers exist under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, enabling local sanitary authorities to control temporary dwellings in their areas and to prohibit such dwellings in particular places.  It is a matter for the local <Col N="970" /> authority to decide on any initiatives to be taken on foot of those powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the magnitude of the problem, particularly in the Cork area and with special reference to Carrigtwohill area, where at the moment there are up to 40 caravans in a small space of roadway without any facilities?  Would the Minister consider investigating the matter?  The local authority are quite helpless in dealing with these numbers. They are a pretty arrogant group of people, they are causing a considerable nuisance and we need something more than the existing legislation to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised in connection with the Dublin area by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Tunney.  There are a number of powers local authorities have which they can exercise.  If they do not try to exercise them there is not much use in saying they do not operate.  I know that the people involved can be a nuisance, particularly those who are not itinerants but who are very much better off.  It must start with the local authorities.  If these authorities find it is beyond them and if they bring the matter to my notice perhaps we may have to introduce legislation.  At the moment there is no such legislation.</P>

All of them have vehicles that cost £8,000 or £10,000 each; most of them are from the North of Ireland or from the UK.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>I want to be fair to Deputy Tunney who raised this question also.  The situation is not as easy to deal with as some people try to make out.  If these people are in the areas around towns by-laws introduced by the towns can deal with them, but as far as the country districts are concerned it is purely a matter of using the powers local authorities have at the moment.  If they try to deal with this matter and find they are unsuccessful, I should <Col N="971" /> be glad if they would give me details. Until they do that there is not much we can do.</P>

      <P>Stokers at the central heating station have taken industrial action in furtherance of claims for special increases in addition to the standard increases of the national agreement which these workers have already received.  The claims are for improved overtime and shift rates.</P>
      <P>As I explained to the House in my financial statement of 28th January last, the Government have reluctantly come to the conclusion that, in present circumstances, they have no option but to defer consideration until at least the end of 1976 of all outstanding claims for special increases subject to a strictly limited number of clearly defined exceptions &mdash;none of which covers this particular case.  There is, therefore, unfortunately, no scope for compromise proposals as suggested.</P>

      <P>I would again urge the Minister to accept this amendment. It is in a sense a compromise between the strength of the old section, to which the Minister objects, and the relative weakness, I suggest, of the new section 2.  We have been over the ground before but I would again emphasise that the Minister must be in a position to exercise responsibility in a somewhat more direct way than the Minister proposes.  The section as it stands is too weak.  It is of considerable importance that the executive authority of the Government should be kept in a more direct way and I would ask the Minister to consider the implications of the weakening of the Government's authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Hitherto we have been discussing here at some length both section 2 and the amendment, as you, Sir, or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, directed that we should consider them together.  As far as the amendment is concerned, I think I have said what I have to say. On the whole we have covered the ground pretty well.  But I would now like to say something more about section 2, which of course is there to replace section 6 of the old Act of 1960, which section is deleted by section 22 (a), or will be deleted by section 22 (a) of the Bill before the House.  In my earlier remarks, which <Col N="992" /> were mainly concentrated on the amendment, I avoided on the whole the past history of this matter.  I did so because the Fianna Fáil amendment, by the very fact that it was an amendment of the old section, seemed to imply that the old section had shown itself capable of misapplication, if not of abuse, and if that recognition was there I did not wish to trouble the House with that matter any more. However, from Deputy Collins's intervention it became clear there is not such a recognition and therefore I think it necessary to discuss in a little more detail just why it is necessary to replace the old section 6, in the Government's view, with the new section 2.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins said, and I quote from Volume 288, No. 1, of the Official Report for Tuesday, 17th February, 1976, column 122, which reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister is not wise in refusing to accept this amendment. We fully appreciate that in 1960 the Oireachtas in its wisdom saw at that time that it was necessary for the Government to have power to remove the Authority.</P>
    <P>Then he goes on:</P>
    <P>Many people are of the belief that the Provisional IRA would never have been as popular or would not have been given the footing they have but for the way they were glamorised in Telefís Éireann in the early days.</P>
    <P>I think it is implied here that the previous Government were right to remove the then Authority in the way they did and that they were right because the Authority had, if not itself glamorised it, at least condoned the glamorisation of the Provisional IRA.  I do not accept this.  I do not think that RTE, or individual broadcasters of RTE, have a record beyond question in this matter, or that any section of the media have, but I think that as a whole over the years, including the years in which Deputy Collins and his colleagues held responsibility, RTE made an effort at impartiality and that they cannot be accused of having consistently glamorised or sought to glamorise, the Provisional IRA at any period.  Some <Col N="993" /> sections of the media are far more guilty in this respect and none more so than the Fianna Fáil organ, <i>The Irish Press,</i> which continues to this day to glamorise this section.  I do not accept&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not consider that the real reason why the former Authority was removed&mdash;not by Deputy Collins, but by the Government to which he belonged&mdash;had much to do with glamorising the Provisional IRA.  As regards glamorising the Provisional IRA, the answer to that was given, curiously enough, by none other than Deputy Collins himself in a reply on the 17th July, 1970, to a letter from his then colleague, the then Minister for Justice and present colleague, who made precisely this charge.

      <P>I do not think I have read the whole of the Deputy's letter.  They are all interesting.  At the Deputy's request I will read the whole thing.  The letter from the then Minister for Justice, dated 13th July, 1970, reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Dear Minister,</P>
      <P>I am writing to protest very strongly against the irresponsible behaviour of RTE in glamorising persons who are well known to have engaged in subversive or criminal activities and while I begin by asking you to read the text of a letter which was sent last October to your predecessor by mine, I want to emphasise that in writing to you now I do so entirely on my own initiative and not by way of formal follow-up to what Mr. Ó Móráin wrote&mdash;in fact I did not know of his letter until I asked to have a note of various incidents prepared for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Left-wing bias in RTE is so notorious that I will not take up your time by illustrating its many manifestations.  It is clear that an altogether disproportionate number of RTE staff at key points are biased to varying degrees to &ldquo;the Left&rdquo; and, when subjects of current interest come up, they not only put their own slant on them but they are in a position to pick most of the &ldquo;guests&rdquo; from amongst people of like mind.  I will not labour this further.  My immediate concern is with the mis-use of the National Television Service, not just to push a particular political view-point, but to glamorise known subversives; RTE cannot plead ignorance of what they are doing.  Last January (&ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;, 3/1/70), one of the panel was Miss Maureen Burke, Secretary of Sinn Féin, Secretary of the Dublin Housing Action Committee and a member of a number of pseudo-protest bodies.  In the course of the programme, she said quite categorically <Col N="996" /> that she was not interested in reform that what she wanted was revolution.</P>
    <P>Despite this clear-cut statement of her unlawful purposes, Miss Burke continues to be given the benefit of publicity by RTE.  So do her associates.</P>
    <P>On 13th January, the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme carried a series of interviews with IRA members, in relation to the Sinn Féin Árd-Fheis.  I want to emphasise that these men were openly identified as members of the IRA, an organisation which has been formally proclaimed as unlawful.  Amongst those appearing and openly identified as IRA members were: Joe Nolan; Seamus Costello [see reference to him in Mr. Ó Móráin's letter] Rory Brady: Tom Mitchell (who has a long history in the North); Eamon Thomas (&ldquo;...we are the continuity of the lawful republican stand... we are the alternative of the two Parliaments North and South&rdquo;); Jim Sullivan, Belfast (who openly referred to &ldquo;the last campaign&rdquo;, i.e. the campaign of violence 1956-62); Seán Keenan, Derry (&ldquo;I believe that the people who advocate attendance at and recognition of Leinster House...have betrayed the people who have struggled...&rdquo;); Tomás Mac Giolla (Tom Gill), President of Sinn Féin (&ldquo;I have upheld the abstentionist policy for a long time ...because I believed it was important that we maintain a nonconformist and revolutionary role&rdquo;).</P>
    <P>On 12th January, Cathal Goulding, openly known to be the Chief of Staff of the IRA, was interviewed by Eddie Barrett after the 1.30 p.m. news in Radio Eireann. The interview explicitly questioned him about the future of the IRA.</P>
    <P>You will see, therefore, that RTE have had ample notice of the sort of people they are publicising. Yet in recent weeks we have once again seen them have on their programmes Gill, Goulding, Mitchell, apart from the usual quota of unrepresentative propagators of Left-wing <Col N="997" /> and even crypto-communist propaganda.</P>
    <P>When is this going to stop?  Is the RTE Authority going to sit back and allow the Television and Radio stations to be used by this minority to brainwash the public? If the answer to that is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, then I am faced with the unfortunate necessity to raise the question of enforcement of the law.  If they will not maintain some reasonable effort at fair play, they must at least observe the law of the land and, if nothing else can be done, I propose to raise immediately the question of prosecuting them the next time that they publish seditious matter.  While I am on the subject, I will add a few other items.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of last year, the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme brought on a person just out of Mountjoy Jail, one Martin Sherlock.  He was presented as a pathetic victim of official indifference to his plight and he was photographed being reunited with his wife who had some hours earlier given birth to a baby. Even people who did not know the facts saw something seriously wrong with asking a woman in that condition such a question as: &ldquo;Do you intend to have any more children?&rdquo;, but to those in the prison service who did know the facts, the interview was a scandalous libel on the Prison Service.  I will mention just two facts: (I) The Welfare Officer of the Prison had got this man a job.  He walked out of the job in less than a day, making it clear that he felt society owed it to him to keep him in idleness (II) the Welfare Officer, with the assistance of the Legion of Mary, had his flat completely redecorated: in no time it was like a pig-sty.  But, what really matters is this.  Within weeks, word was filtering back from the gardaí that the man was heading for serious trouble as a direct result of this television interview: it had gone to his head and he was lording it over his acquaintances.  The next development was that a man was stabbed to death.  Martin Sherlock <Col N="998" /> has been convicted of his murder.</P>
    <P>There was a &ldquo;Wednesday Report&rdquo; programme on legal adoption. It was based primarily on the evidence of a woman who made statement after statement that were provably false.  Either the woman is a plain liar or (more likely) she is slightly unbalanced.  The most outrageously false and damaging comments were made by the commentator and all this was done at a time of serious controversy involving certain aspects of legal adoption.  It was only the fact that the Moneylending Tribunal was on at the time that prevented this programme being discussed in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of the response that was made to my predecessor's letter.  I should be glad to know from you whether anything is going to be done now.</P>
    <P>I note that in this letter there are matters concerning things coming within the Minister's ambit and having apparently nothing to do with illegal organisations; part of it is about illegal organisations, part is not.  To that which I have quoted in full the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs replied on 17th July. I shall also quote what he said:</P>
    <P>Dear Minister,</P>
    <P>Thank you for your letter of 13th July about RTE.  I am in general agreement with much of what you say.  You can rest assured that so far as my powers enable me to do so, I shall see to it that a proper balance is maintained in programme presentation.</P>
    <P>Your letter raises two main issues which are really separate, (i) the IRA and (ii) Left-wing bias in RTE.</P>
    <P>As regards the IRA and its various splinter groups, I agree entirely there must be no glamorisation of them or of figures identified in the public mind with these illegal movements.  Mistakes have undoubtedly been made by RTE in this matter in the past; I shall do my best to see that they don't recur. I note that almost all the events you <Col N="999" /> complain of occurred a considerable time ago.</P>
    <P>On this subject however I feel bound to point out that in the past year or two the newspapers appear to have been tacitly released from the obligation not to refer to the IRA by name and there have been innumerable instances of their giving generous and favourable publicity to the IRA.  Less than two weeks ago (on 7th July) the <i>Irish Times</i> published an extensive report&mdash;far longer and more comprehensive than RTE would have given&mdash;of a statement by the &ldquo;IRA council in Dublin&rdquo; with a photograph of Mr. Cathal Goulding &ldquo;chief of staff of the IRA speaking at a Press conference held in Dublin yesterday by the Army Council of the IRA&rdquo;.  Any foreigner reading this article would assume that the IRA was a legitimate recognised army in the State and many of our fellow citizens must be feeling that it has Government blessing as well as toleration.</P>
    <P>There have been pictures of an IRA group marching with arms. There have even been statements from the Saor Éire Group in connection with the murder of Garda Fallon.</P>
    <P>I don't know what the Department of Justice has done about all these matters, but until the situation which has been allowed to develop is changed, RTE cannot reasonably be forbidden to publish news items about the IRA which the newspapers&mdash;their competitors&mdash;freely publish.  These matters are news and it would be absurd of RTE to draw a veil over them while the newspapers flaunt them.</P>
    <P>So, what RTE will be required to do&mdash;and I am sure the Authority will be very willing to do it&mdash;is to report facts on the subject in a &ldquo;played-down&rdquo; way and to avoid so far as possible making the illegal organisations sound attractive or appealing to the impressionable.</P>
    <P>When the Department of Justice decides to enforce the law in regard to the IRA and its satellites, I shall <Col N="1000" /> be happy to deal further with the problem so far as RTE is concerned.</P>
    <P>So far as Left-wing bias is concerned it is necessary to move with some care.  I am in no doubt that the Left-wing and even some pretty extreme elements of it have a good footing in RTE but it would be very easy in attempting to deal with that situation to do a lot more harm than good.  It is perfectly natural that a new exciting service such as RTE would attract very many young people to its staff and without considering the possibility of deliberate infiltration by hard line communists, the probability in present day circumstances is that a great number of these young people will be of Left-wing sympathies.  There can be no question of eliminating these influences in RTE but what we can and will do is ensure to the utmost extent possible that they will not be able by their influence to bring about the presentation of programmes biased in favour of their views.  The Radio Éireann Authority has a statutory obligation to ensure that matters of public controversy are presented objectively and impartially.  There can be little doubt that breaches of this requirement will occur from time to time but I intend to leave the Authority in no doubt of the absolute need to enforce the rule as fully and efficiently as is possible.  If prejudiced and unbalanced presentation does occur I shall certainly take it up with the Authority very firmly.</P>
    <P>You will appreciate that I don't have much time available for watching television programmes and I can of course deal only with what I see or receive authoritative reports about.  Accordingly, if any programmes come to your notice which you feel are condoning illegality, I shall be glad if you will bring them to my notice.  I will give any such complaints, made promptly, my immediate attention.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Gerard Collins.</P>
    <P>They are the full texts of the two letters.  It is quite clear there was a <Col N="1001" /> long history of pressure by the then Government on RTE on subjects other than the IRA.  There was the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; moneylending controversy and the tribunal set up by the Minister's predecessor, Micheál Ó Móráin in 1969.  There was pressure on the authority by the then Minister, Deputy Collins, in December, 1971, in connection with a programme on which a then member of the Opposition was featured rather prominently, and there was pressure on the Authority by the same Minister in May, 1972, in a controversy directly involving his own Department on the question of a post office at Lettermore, all this before December, 1972.</P>
    <P>At that time the Minister, having given a general directive, which was in its nature ambiguous, to RTE and having refused to give the clarification requested of it, took action.  I believe the Fianna Fáil Government killed two birds with the one stone in December, 1972.  They punished the RTE Authority for failing to be adequately subservient and they made RTE the scapegoat for their own failures and collusions&mdash;I am referring to the 1969 period&mdash;in relation to the IRA.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch described that as an exercise in democracy.  We on this side of the House regard it as the kind of exercise which should be avoided for the future because we regard it not as an exercise in democracy but as an exercise in the use of power, to a large extent arbitrary, to a large extent affected by party interests, by the Government of the day, and this new section replacing section 6 is intended to make that kind of exercise in democracy more difficult and to make future exercises in democracy in the area of broadcasting more sophisticated, more sensitive, more respectful of legitimate autonomies and therefore more compatible with the long-term interest of democracy as distinct from the immediate interests of the Government of the day, and that is why we have put forward this section in its present form in replacement of section 6.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1002" /> A lot of people in the House, probably on both sides, as they look back on that period would agree there has been some need to correct this, to bring these processes more under the attention of the House, and therefore have recognised that the old section 6 no longer serves.  To that extent I welcome the intention behind the amendment but I cannot agree it goes far enough in the direction in which it has been demonstrated to be necessary that we should move.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister and having expected that I would hear something new, something worth while, something that might eventually give us some legislation, I am disappointed.  We did not. The Minister deliberately tried to create a situation whereby once again he would be in the headlines, where the minds of the people, if he could get his way, might be diverted from the economic chaos that exists.  The Minister is good at this.  Indeed he could be regarded as a professional in this line.</P>
      <P>I made a case the last day when dealing with the amendment&mdash;it was on 17th February.  It was a good and valid case.  I rightly said that the impression in the past had been that RTE and those working in it did glamorise the IRA.  I said that, and I stand over it, and that view was held not only by me but by many others. That view was held by the Taoiseach and was expressed by the Taoiseach on the famous night in November-December, 1972, when the bombs went off in Dublin.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may not be aware of what was said that night. Perhaps he was not too interested in Deputy Cosgrave's chances as a potential Taoiseach.  Few were: it looked as if he would never realise his ambition to be Taoiseach at that time.  It is on the records of the House.  I never said, as the Minister would like me to say, that RTE consistently glamorised those people.  I do not believe I ever said that.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of what I said.  May I say in regard to the correpondence which has been read out that it is a new approach by a Minister to read what were confidential letters between one Minister and another in Government?  This is an approach that must be examined to see whether it is right or wrong. To my mind it is wrong.  I am glad both letters were read out.  In the past we had just a part of one: now we have the two and I will let the public decide for themselves what is in these letters.  It is very easy for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to pick a paragraph, or a sentence, out of context, as he has often done in the past and has had to be taken up on, and deliberately give a wrong impression. It is easy for him to do this for political purposes.  I am satisfied that since late 1972 or early 1973 there was no glamorisation of the IRA by RTE.  I said this in the House during the course of the debate on the first Estimate presented by the Minister in May or June, 1973.  I gave my reasons on that occasion and the reasons I gave then are still valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that RTE make a reasonable effort to be impartial. RTE are not on trial here and never were.  During the course of the debate on this amendment we were questioning whether the Minister was right in adopting the course he had adopted with regard to the removal of an Authority.  The Minister will recollect that I prefaced my remarks by saying that I hoped the occasion would never arise when an Authority would have to be removed by any Minister, any Government or the Oireachtas.  I said that in the event of such a thing having to happen the Minister, and the Government, should have the power to so remove the Authority after giving consideration to what was involved.  I pointed out that if such an occasion arose during a Summer Recess and it was necessary to remove or suspend an Authority the Minister or the Government would not be able to do anything about the suspension or the removal because the Houses of the Oireachtas <Col N="1004" /> would not be in session.  The Members of this House might be absent on holidays and it might not be easy to get them back.  I went on to say that the Government, with a majority&mdash;a doubtful one at times&mdash;might not be in a position to reconvene the Dáil to fulfil their duties if they were satisfied all their Members would not be present.</P>
    <P>I am not going to chase other hares raised by the Minister; this is neither the time nor the place to do so.  We are discussing an amendment to the Bill.  The situation is one which could in practical terms arise.  If the Minister is satisfied that the amendment is not acceptable, that is his right; but let him not deliberately twist and try to misrepresent and misquote people on what they said in this House or on what they put in letters to their ministerial colleagues.  If I have had to in the past write letters to my colleagues in Government I would prefer to communicate with them during the time and in the course of a letter and certainly not afterwards in the course of a book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Minister should be assured that confidential correspondence which passes between themselves should not be revealed by some future Administration. We have heard of the strong criticism of the Crossman Diaries and I believe those who criticised them were justified in doing so.  That confidentiality, which is important for democracy, should be upheld.  Confidential matters should be kept confidential by succeeding governments.</P>
      <P>Sections 1, 2 and 3 deal with the suspension of the Authority and section 4 deals with the removal of the Authority.  Section 2 provides that a member of the Authority may be removed by the Government from office for stated reasons, if, and only if, resolutions are passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas calling for his removal.  The more I look at this section the more I am convinced that our amendment is correct.  The Minister appoints the Authority, with the approval of the Government.  But what would be the situation if there was a breach of section 17?  Such a breach could occur when the House is in recess and the Minister would have to endeavour to convene the Dáil and move a resolution for the removal of the Authority.  Once the Minister makes up his mind to remove the Authority it is obvious that the Authority will be removed.  The Authority will then know that it is only a matter of time before they are removed but during that time they can exercise their rights as regards broadcasting.  An extraordinary situation will arise then from the Minister's point of view and from the point of view of the Authority.</P>
      <P>The Authority could be in breach of section 17, which states:</P>
      <P>Where the Minister is of the opinion that the broadcasting of a particular matter or a matter of a particular class would be likely to promote or incite to crime or would tend to undermine the authority of the State,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Authority could proceed along the lines prohibited under section 17 while the resolution for their removal <Col N="1006" /> is being debated.  That would be a dangerous situation for a Minister to find himself in.  In this section the Minister should be entitled to remove. However, subsections (1) and (2) of the new section we propose give a right of suspension, and I am concerned with these more than with any other part of the amendment.  I believe the Minister would be very foolish not to retain for himself the right of suspension. In my view, this right of suspension for the Minister would be as welcome to the Authority and to the whole broadcasting operation as to anybody else.</P>
    <P>There could be one or two members on the board who are impeding the activities of the Authority.  Any Minister would be very careful to take into consideration the competence and ability of the people he elects as members of the Authority, but as has happened in many other organisations, a particular member of the Authority, perhaps through excessive drinking, is unable to function satisfactorily as a member.  Other members might come to the Minister and say: &ldquo;We would like this member removed.&rdquo; The Minister should have the right to suspend that person there and then. This is normal practice in any organisation.</P>
    <P>If one did not look behind the section, one might think it was more democratic to bring a resolution before both Houses of the Oireachtas. Whether it was a Fianna Fáil Government or a Coalition Government, the resolution would be passed by a majority.  The result therefore is a foregone conclusion when the decision to remove the member is taken by the Cabinet.  There is no difference in the end product: the Authority would be removed by our amendment; the Authority would be removed by the Minister's section. The Minister's section is cumbersome, unworkable and is bad legislation. Our amendment is concise and decisive. Certainly it places no greater burden on the Authority than the section in the Bill does.</P>
    <P>People outside have criticised section 6 of the old Act, but one must look at the reasons for which it was <Col N="1007" /> used.  The Minister is one of those people who is fond of expounding the virtues of law and order, but in this section the Minister is going contrary to his beliefs.</P>

The Minister, in effect, is saying to the Authority, although they may have violated section 17: &ldquo;You may remain on with your full rights and authority.  I have no power to remove you.  I must bring a resolution before both Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.&rdquo; The reason we are proposing this amendment is to uphold law and order, to ensure that if section 17 is breached the Minister of the day will have the right of suspension.  We have already pointed out the problems the Minister will have if the House is in recess.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I do not know whether the <Col N="1008" /> Minister lacks courage, but when a person accepts office as a Minister it usually carries with it the duty to take unpopular decisions.  Our amendment is reasonable.  There are certain restrictions in it.  A member may not be suspended except for stated reasons. Our proposal would leave the Authority functioning without being impeded by the person whom it is proposed to remove. That is a logical way of approaching the matter.  It has always been our policy to give as much autonomy as possible to the RTE Authority in the day-to-day administration of broadcasting.  I believe too much Government interference would be bad for the Authority.  There must be a certain amount of restriction and the Minister must have a certain amount of authority with regard to certain matters.  He is perfectly right in retaining these rights under section 17, but we maintain that section 2 does not give him the right to operate the full effect of section 17.  That is the reason we are putting forward those amendments.</P>

      <P>There is very little further I desire to add except to say that I am relating the Minister's attitude <Col N="1009" /> today with that when we last discussed this measure.  If there was any better proof required of the weakness of the Minister's case it was reflected earlier on in his behaviour and in the efforts he made to substantiate his case.  As everybody knows the Minister now finds himself trying to ride two horses, the erstwhile liberal Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien and now the present holder of this office as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  We got proof today of his reaction to what happened under a previous Authority when a Minister had the courage to exercise the power given to him in the legislation.  The present holder of the office wants to pretend that he is democratising the whole situation and in future nothing will happen unless that matter has been brought before the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister should ponder for a moment on what happens when matters are brought before the House, whether we might anticipate any change and look at the happenings of a couple of weeks ago when a Member of the Minister's party tabled an amendment in this House and when ultimately the time came for him to exercise his rights the Minister and other Members of the party saw to it that he toed the line.  The same thing will happen here.  The Minister will make the decision in his position as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. He will report it to the Government and subsequently it will be brought to the House.  The Minister, as well as everybody else, knows that the moment he moves on it the result is a foregone conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last day I said how impractical this would be.  I said that what is envisaged in this legislation refers to emergency times.  I refer to the possibility of the Minister being anxious to perform the duties envisaged here in circumstances where the Dáil no longer exists.  We all know that the Taoiseach of the day can decide that he will have a general election in three weeks and during that period there is no Dáil.  I refer to this as an emergency situation but one which can occur.  How will the Minister implement the legislation?  How will he honour section 17 if he clings to <Col N="1010" /> section 2?  He knows it cannot be done.  Earlier on I referred to his misbehaviour here and how regrettable it is that a Minister, carrying the responsibility which he is presumed to carry, should descend to the type of political thinking which he has given us here today.</P>

Of course, it could not always be perfect because the handling of the day's news, particularly in relation to the subject of violence, is an extraordinarily difficult matter and it is not best got at by using a hammer to break the works apart to see what is wrong. Not only in RTE, but in the Press and in the community at large, there are people who have some degree of sympathy with illegal organisations.  I do not think that RTE has been the main offender here.  I think that the newspapers controlled by the Minister's colleague, Deputy de Valera, have produced more matter than have RTE calculated to promote the aims or activities of an organisation which engages in, promotes, encourages or defends the gaining of any particular objective by violent means.</P>

      <P>Here we have a situation where a Minister who projects himself and is projected in certain areas as being the most perfect man since the Lord Himself brings a Bill to the House which is intended to take from him responsibility which is his.</P>
      <P>This is remarkable.  The former Government and their Minister for Posts and Telegraphs took the responsibility of removing the Authority. That step had repercussions.  Undoubtedly the present Minister could quote at length from the attack he made on the then Minister for the manner in which he used his power. But ministerial position carries with it both power and responsibility.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the former Minister may have used his power in relation to RTE may be interpreted as one of the many reasons why this party are in opposition now.  But even the correspondence quoted by the Minister this afternoon establishes beyond doubt the genuineness, in the national interest, of the two people who were involved in correspondence on that occasion.  The reading of that correspondence is the sort of thing that we have come to expect from this Government and, in particular, from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

      <P>My interpretation of the Minister's writings would be different from what I would consider to be official records.  Deputy Tunney suspects that one of the reasons for the Department being in such a state of chaos is that the Minister spends so much time on research.  However, I shall deal with the amendment before the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister has such an opinion of himself that he considers it right that those he nominates for appointment to the Broadcasting Authority be exalted to a position similar only to that held in this State by the High Court and the more senior judges and that they cannot be removed from office except by a decision of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
      <P>While I should like to safeguard members of the Authority in the discharge of their duties, I want positively to question the wisdom or prudence of giving judicial tenure to members of the Authority.  Anyone can be appointed a member of the Authority without any requirement as to professional qualifications and experience.  I know the Minister's view of professional qualifications might be very different from mine.  Up to the change of Government, 50 per cent of the mischief-makers who paraded in Kildare Street, Molesworth Street or around Stephen's Green endeavouring to upset authority were generally accompanied by someone who is now a Minister.

I do not know if the Minister is aware that one of the reasons they are lulled into a feeling of semi-security is because we have not these parades through Dublin, we have not those massive sponsored parades that had a fair share of subversive money.  He can take his ideas about where these subversive moneys came from but if he studies the colour of shirt he will know.  The Minister was associated quite positively with undermining the security of the State, with the groups he associated with in public protests when the last Government were in power.</P>

      <P>The Minister steered me away with his intervention.  Anyone can be appointed as a member of the Authority and, unfortunately, the man or woman the Minister will be tempted to appoint will be someone who paraded with him during those colourful days when he was serving his apprenticeship to disloyalty to authority. People can be appointed without any requirement as to professional qualifications or experience, such as apply to judges.  There is no question of any inquiry as to their character or financial probity before their appointment.  I suggest it would be possible to appoint persons whom it would be difficult to remove if section 2 is passed.  I go so far as to say that one junta could get a grip on RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand the thinking of the Minister except in so far as the former Government operated under an Act and took a specific action where the then Minister removed the Authority from power.  The <Col N="1016" /> present Minister so attacked that action at the time that he is now afraid to hold on to that power.  I do not see why any member of a State-sponsored body should be in such a privileged position that it would take a majority of the Members of the Oireachtas to remove him from office. This is a most injudicious section.</P>
    <P>On the Order Paper there is a motion referring to the setting up of a joint committee to consider the administration of certain semi-State bodies.  However, in this Bill it is being suggested that members of the Broadcasting Authority, of all the State boards, should be put into a specific category of their own and protected in this way because the present Minister has not the guts to accept the responsibilities his predecessor accepted in this regard.  To put on the sham of trying to create the impression that the same kind of dictatorial process followed by Deputy Collins when he was Minister will not be followed by the present Minister and his colleagues is completely unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of section 2 a member of the Authority or the whole Authority&mdash;I am not clear on that&mdash; may be removed on the passing of resolutions by both Houses.  There is no doubt that if that procedure had been necessary when the Authority were removed by Fianna Fáil, that Authority would have been removed just the same.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister considers he may be embarrassed by the record.  Deputies on this side of the House may have to go through each volume of the debate to find out what the Minister had to say when he was in Opposition and when he had responsibility for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I think this is all a charade simply and solely because the Minister wants to satisfy his ego: &ldquo;I said it would be changed&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I said that the former system was wrong and now I must change it for the sake of change&rdquo;.  I do not know whether the Minister would admit that he has heard colleagues of his own <Col N="1017" /> standing up and making the same sort of defence for not doing things that we used to make when we were on that side of the House and Deputies on this side now query the change of mind of the present incumbents as compared with what they used to profess when they were on this side of the House.  I have heard the Minister for Local Government who, like George Washington, is never found wanting and never told a lie, say that &ldquo;Surely the Deputies are aware, because they were long enough on this side of the House, that this, that or the other cannot be done&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I suggest now to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that he must be aware and must realise as the man responsible for appointing, with the permission of the Government, the members of the Authority that in order to follow his responsibility to its logical conclusion he must have the right to dismiss those members if they are found wanting and it should be unnecessary for him to come in here in order to dismiss them.  He must realise that he would need to say a great deal more when he comes in here beyond the fact that he did not like the colour of their eyes or there was something a lady or a gentleman said with which he did not agree.  He must be able to come in here in a solid way and really castigate the member quite seriously.  He will be using the privilege of the Dáil to show in what way he found the individual concerned wanting and not fit for office.  In doing that the unfortunate member of the Authority will become quite notorious.</P>
    <P>It is wrong in this small State that it should be necessary for the Minister to come in here and subsequently in the Seanad seeking positive authority for the removal of a member of the Authority.  He will, of course, get the message across to his colleagues in Government.  Telling the members of the Opposition the reason why somebody is being removed will be a different matter.  It will be very embarrassing for the individual concerned. I presume the individual will know why he or she is being removed, <Col N="1018" /> which is the position under the present system, and the community in general can only guess. Perhaps we have a habit of dressing up our suspicions but giving a removal all the publicity the Minister would seek under this section of the Bill would make one wonder if it would be wise to accept appointment to the Authority.  Our amendment would certainly soften the blow.  It talks in terms of the Minister making an order to be laid before both Houses.  It would not necessarily mean publicising the reasons for the removal of the individual.</P>
    <P>The Minister really should have second thoughts on this.  I know that what I say will not make the Minister in any way amenable to falling in with my point of view but I have some little knowledge of these things.  If I were Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and I wanted to remove a member of the Authority, I might not necessarily want to be too easy on that member but I do not think I would seek to publicise the removal in the way the Minister proposes here.  The Minister may say that in the event of publicity proving as embarrassing as all that to the member then the member would have his or her own way out.  He or she could send a letter of resignation to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle is in charge of recruitment to the civil service and we all know that no member of the civil service can be dismissed without a decision by the Government.  Nobody has more experience of that than the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The Minister should really re-think this section.  Removal by Government decision, or the decision of the responsible Minister, is the proper way.  As the Minister and the Government make the appointment it should be the Minister and the Government who relieve it.</P>
    <P>The Judiciary are appointed by the President.  We have built into section 2 of this Bill the same protection for the members appointed to the Broadcasting Authority.  Quite frankly, I do not know who the present members of the Broadcasting Authority are.  I do not think it is any reflection on them to say that it is a reflection on the <Col N="1019" /> Judiciary to think that a group of this nature can be protected against removal from office, or should need to be protected against removal from office, in the same way as the Judiciary. There are high responsibilities in connection with the Judiciary.  We should not set up another group of this nature and exalt them to the position of being comparable with the standards set for our Judiciary.  That is why I am completely opposed to the changes envisaged in this section of the Bill.</P>

      <P>When I was speaking previously of Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment, the Minister said he had power under section 10 to suspend the licence under which the station operated during any emergency.  In fact the section reads:</P>
      <P>During any emergency declared under section 10 of the Act of 1926 the Minister may suspend any licence under this subsection and while any such suspension continues the Minister may operate any service which was provided by the Authority under the suspended licence.</P>
      <P>I argued that in order to suspend the licence it would require almost a state of emergency in this country. I should like to repeat what I said on that occasion: that the only difference between what the Minister was proposing and what Deputy Fitzpatrick proposed was that Deputy Fitzpatrick proposed that the Minister would have the right to suspend the Authority and then come before the House and get sanction for that move, rather than the Minister having to come before the House to seek authority. It has been pointed out to him that if it was during a recess or anything of that sort, there might be difficulty in getting sufficient Members into the House even for the Government side to carry this through.  One of the trade marks of Fianna Fáil in Government is that we have always accepted full responsibility.  We do not believe in passing the buck.  If the Minister feels that he has to perform an act which he himself is against, then he can always resign his portfolio if he so desires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did say that it could be done only on his instructions but this is not so.  The collective responsibility which the Minister is so fond of throwing across the House applies very much in his own case.  I can see no earthly reason why this very reasonable amendment of Deputy Fitzpatrick's cannot be accepted by the Minister.  He has had time to study it.  If he had an open mind on this&mdash;and I do not think he has an open mind&mdash;he would agree to this amendment.  The Minister has caught himself in the trap that he set for himself on the occasion when after many warnings we had to take the unpopular decision to fire the Authority. The Minister is well aware of this.  It states here that the Minister may give a number of warnings to the Authority if he feels they are not complying with the terms of the Act as laid down by this Parliament acting on behalf of the people from whom it gets its authority.  The people elect a Government to act on their behalf, be it right or be it wrong.  They then face the electorate in due course and the electorate will make its own decision.  If the Minister feels that the removal of the Authority resulted in our loss of Government, I would remind him that we got more votes in the last election. We did not lose public support for our section in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still believe it is incumbent upon the Minister to be decisive, to make a decision and then come before the House for ratification.  If he has made the wrong decision, the House will vote against it and it can be reversed. But once the Authority is removed <Col N="1021" /> there is a situation where you have virtually a state of anarchy, because the Authority are under notice to quit and therefore they have no power over the servants of the Authority over whom they were put in the first place. Once authority runs away from a body, once the leadership has gone, then anarchy will surely follow, and this is the reason the Minister must act instantly.  If the Minister finds there is someone within his Department who is behaving in a manner which is detrimental to the service or to his Department, or if he finds that he is in some way misappropriating funds, he does not give the man 30 days' notice and keep him employed during that time.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any difference.  The person is suspended and is ultimately out of the way of disclosing information.  There is no difference between what the Minister has in section 2 and what he proposes as an amendment, only that we are saying that he should retain the authority to dismiss them and then come before the House rather than the reverse procedure.  That can lead to a very serious situation where he may be forced to enact that more serious section which he quoted at me in section 10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I have very little to add.  We have put our case.  We think it was a reasonable amendment which would certainly be beneficial to the whole operation of the Authority.  There is nothing dictatorial about this.  One part deals with suspension and the other with the movement.  If the day should arrive when a Minister comes into this House to remove the Authority I hope he does not give us 24 hours to revoke the Authority, or in any way impede the debate that may continue for a fortnight or three weeks, or that he will say: &ldquo;This is a matter of urgency, because this Authority is still functioning.  I need this Bill urgently. <Col N="1022" /> I need this draft urgently and for that reason if I do not have it in two days I will apply the guillotine.&rdquo; If that Bill is drafted under section 2, whether in the Minister's time or after many of us have left this House, as sure as the sun rises in the morning, that is going to be the position at some future date and it will entail a long debate.  That can be very emotive.  As the Minister has not taken the responsibility on himself of removing the Authority, but has moved it over to the Members of the House, such a debate will be protracted.</P>
      <P>We have put forward a reasonable amendment which is a working solution to this problem.  The Minister has failed to accept it.  I am disappointed that he did not refer to any particular section of it, especially the suspension section which is one of the most reasonable imports of that amendment, a thing that is accepted in every walk of life, and I am disappointed that the Minister did not look at it favourably.  I have the highest respect for the members of the Authority.  The only bodies in this country that are more exalted are the Judiciary and the Auditor General. The Minister may at some future date regret this decision as impracticable, and I am talking about practicalities.</P>
      <P>I am more concerned about the working of the section than any other emotive section of the Bill.  For that reason I believe that section 2 as it stands will present many difficulties in future for the Authority themselves. It will place the Director General and the whole staff of RTE in a most embarrassing position if a situation should arise where the Minister is trying to remove the Authority here or putting forward a resolution to remove the Authority and at the same time the Director General and other people operating within RTE do not know from whom to take directions. That is a situation which we must anticipate and consider what the consequences of this section would be.</P>

      <P>It is on the amendment to section 2 that I wish to speak. Various speakers have made the point that the Minister wants to be in control and he does not want to be in control.  He is running away from his responsibilities.  A Minister should be a man of decision, but apparently the Minister no longer wants responsibility. We have seen that recently in relation to another decision that he could have made in regard to BBC 1.  On this occasion he is shirking his responsibility.  It is typical of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to be pushing from the back.  It is easy to fight from the rear.  But Ministers must lead from the front.</P>
      <P>This is not the only occasion on which the Minister has run away from his responsibilities.  He is passing the buck, buck-passing on previous occasions on his circus tour, and now on this occasion.  We must have men of decision.  What would happen if a crisis arose at a weekend, a holiday period or in the middle of the Summer Recess?  Would the Minister be able to control the situation? How would he get the Dáil, the Seanad and the President together during the period he wants to have amending legislation brought in? This is where decision is necessary.  I am appalled to see the Minister once again pushing from the rear.  By the time this discussion ends I hope he will have changed his attitude to the amendment put down by Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>
      <P>The Minister was very active in his early days but now he is delegating his responsibility, shirking, and soon we will not need a Minister at all.  His decisions can be made elsewhere by somebody else.  On questions of major importance the Minister hides behind a barrage of words and tries to silence individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is one of substance, one calling for a man of decision to make a decision when the time comes and to stand over that decision.  This is not one of 14 or 15 <Col N="1024" /> points that can be put forward; it is a positive area of decision.  If the Minister is going to shirk he may as well get out.  Maybe he is tired.  Maybe the last three years have been laborious for him and he feels he can no longer shoulder the great burden placed upon him, and the complications he has brought into his Department.  If he shortens his lines of communication or his stay in the Department then he will need additional legislation as every issue goes through the House so that he will be able to buckpass in the future.  Blame-placing or buck-passing is no solution to a problem.  We want a man of decision. Apparently we have not got that in the Minister.  He is as usual pushing from behind.  A Minister should not push; he should lead from the front. I would ask the Minister to consider accepting Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment and so ensure that once again he is prepared to be as energetic as he appeared in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to answer the Deputy's general question. Why has it been deemed necessary to give the Authority a degree of irremovability comparable to that of judges&mdash;not, incidentally identical to that of judges since members of the Authority are appointed for a restricted period at the end of which their term may lapse or be renewed.  The answer must refer again to what happened in December, 1972, the point being that in most democratic countries in western Europe and particularly in north-western Europe, great importance is attached to the concept of autonomy of the controlling authority responsible for broadcasting.  Just as great importance is attached to the role of the State in relation to this.</P>
      <P>If we take a nearby country, Britain, there the Government possess and have long possessed powers equivalent to those possessed by the Government under section 6 of the Act which we are now engaged in amending, but all commentators recognise that the use of those powers are so hedged round by convention, by unwritten laws, that it would be virtually unthinkable for a British Government or a Norwegian or Danish Government to take the sweeping action that was taken here in December, 1972.  So, to provide the kind of effective autonomy which prevails in other democratic countries in conditions where it is apparent that such drastic action can be taken because it has been taken, the Government deemed it desirable to give the Authority this degree of autonomy and this kind of guarantee so that if it is a question of their being removed, the Government would have to come here and to the Seanad to say why.  We think that is necessary to protect the degree of autonomy which a Broadcasting Authority should have which in our opinion, is a high degree of autonomy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear in the debate the somewhat slighting manner in which several Members opposite referred to the Authority as if it were <Col N="1026" /> utterly ridiculous that they should be given a degree of autonomy or irremovability even comparable with that of judges, as if they should be considered as being on exactly the same footing as civil servants and therefore automatically removable by the Government. In our view it is unhealthy in connection with an Authority in control of an area so politically sensitive as that of public broadcasting not to safeguard autonomy, not to respect the Authority's function, a function which under contemporary circumstances is a very high function indeed.</P>
    <P>Ar dheis láimh Dé go raibh a anam. As I have said, not only were the Authority in the days of the last Government pressed from various angles, as well as the angle of public security which is the angle protected, as it must be, by section 17, but also the Minister constituted himself judge of objectivity. For example in relation to his own Department in a dispute between that Department and RTE, the Minister set himself up as the arbiter.  I believe all that to be unhealthy.  In those days the Authority were made to a considerable extent a political football and finally kicked out of the ground altogether in a most unceremonious way.</P>
    <P>I do not very much care, as Deputies opposite have speculated, if that action damaged the party responsible, but I think it did damage the prestige and standing of broadcasting in this country and the morale of the broadcasting profession.  It was an ill-judged action, and to guard against the recurrence of such action, the Government have provided these safeguards against the arbitrary removal of the Authority and have provided for reference to Parliament.  We do not think, however, that the Authority should be set up on a different basis from that on which judges have been appointed, and for that reason our position is that members of the Authority should be appointed by the Government for a stipulated period and that during that period they cannot be removed except by resolution of both Houses.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite have expressed <Col N="1027" /> their objection to these provisions at considerable length.  I do not find their objections convincing and particularly I do not find them convincing from the party whose actions give rise, in our view, to the necessity for this provision which would not have been necessary if the action concerned had not been taken, in our view without due cause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not replied to my question.  Instead, he ignored my question and refused to give me an answer to it.  I asked the Minister the reason why this Parliament, if they have been given responsibility for the termination of the term of office of an authority, are not being given responsibility for the setting up or establishing of the Authority.</P>
      <P>The Minister tried to bring us away on a tack dealing with the autonomy of the Authority.  For fear that the Minister thinks, because of the Ministry he holds, that there is only one semi-State body I should like to remind him that there are authorities dealing with Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte.  We have many other authorities which fulfil a very important function in our economic and social life.  I should like to assure the House, and the public, that every member of my party believes in the autonomy of all semi-State body boards.  Down through the years Members of the Minister's political grouping in this House tried to upset such an approach but their efforts were thwarted at all times by Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
      <P>The Minister said public broadcasting is a politically sensitive area and if he holds the view that there seems to be a slighting of the present Authority in this politically sensitive area it may be that the actions of the present Minister contributed a lot to that feeling. The chief propagandist of the Government up to recently had been put second in control of public broadcasting here.  It may be that because in this politically sensitive area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Minister tries to put words into my mouth we will get involved in an old hassle that will not do this House any good.  When I want to say something I will be well able to do so without any help or hindrance from the Minister.  If a certain amount of scepticism was introduced into this debate or developed since the debate started the Minister is largely responsible for it.  When the Minister started he felt free to channel the debate in a way which he thought would benefit him most politically, not caring too much what would happen the Bill. Perhaps, when times are bad economically this sort of tactic is necessary.  In the past the Romans fed the populace bread and brought them to a circus in an effort to take their minds off their worries, and we had the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs giving us a circus during the summer when he tried to sell us BBC 2 and maybe now we might get the bread.</P>
      <P>When the Minister said he rejected the idea that RTE glamorised subversives in my view he was saying it with his tongue in his cheek.  Many contributions were made in this House by members of the political grouping that forms the Government, which the Minister might not agree with, and they represented charges.  It is ironic that I am standing in a position in the House which was normally occupied by Deputy L'Estrange, a Member who made accusations of partiality against employees of RTE in the way that members of subversives were being glamorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> The Minister, as is his usual form, would like to have it both ways but we are not going to allow that.  When the Government are in a position that they have to decide that an Authority must be removed it appears that the Minister and the Government will not have the freedom they should have if they are to act as they should. Perhaps, at that stage the Minister might feel free to go on another circus run around the country to see whether the people of Limerick, Kerry or Mayo should or should not tell him what to do.  When the time comes&mdash;I hope it never comes for the sake of the country&mdash;that the security of the State is at risk and the Minister needs to be guided, God help the country.  We have asked what will happen if the Dáil is in recess but we have not received an answer.  What happens in the case of a general election being called?  The campaign will last three to four weeks and will be followed by a further two weeks before the Dáil assembles.  Are we to be powerless during that time if an emergency situation which threatens the security of the State arises?  Under this section this can happen.</P>
    <P>The autonomy of a broadcasting authority is a very valuable thing. Unfortunately, as Deputy Brugha pointed out, the trouble does not start in the Authority and the Minister knows that better than I.  A situation could develop where contracts would be made, decisions arrived at, before an Authority would be aware of it.  Again, perhaps the Minister would know far more about this than I.</P>
    <P>I am not going to chase some of the hares the Minister raised except to say that the Government have responsibilities. Sometimes it is not easy for them to live up to their responsibilities. Sometimes it is easier for a Government, particularly a Government of the type we have at present, in refusing to face up to their responsibilities to have a resolution passed in this House, as the Minister would hope, if&mdash;and I hope it never has to happen&mdash;an authority have to be removed. I think it is wrong, that it is poor leadership.  A Government should not lead from behind.  If the <Col N="1030" /> Oireachtas is to be asked to terminate the term of office of an authority, then let the Oireachtas have power to create the authority.</P>

      <P>We must all contribute to this debate in relation to our own experience, and my experience teaches me that section 2, as it has been spelt out here, is not satisfactory. It places the Authority and the Executive in a similar position to that of the Comptroller and Auditor General or a judge, and I think the Minister conceded that that was what he had in mind.  As Deputy Collins has said, the Minister appoints the Authority, and therefore the Minister should deal with the Authority as it is necessary to deal with it.  If the Minister is to be an effective executive he should not have to make a kind of court case out of any unsatisfactory situation that might develop, as he would have to do under section 2 by having a resolution passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In doing so he is weakening or downgrading his responsibility to the Oireachtas, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Broadcasting Authority.  As has been said, situations could arise: Dáil Éireann could be in recess or there could be a general election and the Minister might not be able to exercise his authority.</P>
      <P>We will be coming shortly to section 3, which deals with impartiality, but under section 2 the Government are, in effect, responsible for the impartiality of the Authority and their servants.  They are now weakening their authority and therefore their ability to play their executive role in regard to the Authority's fulfilment of their duties under the Act.  Under section 2 the Authority would be in a position to tell the Minister where to go.  The Authority and their officials are not responsible to the Minister or the Government or to Dáil Éireann.  That is not a satisfactory position to create.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a crucial area such as broadcasting, the Minister should be seeking agreement in the Dáil, and I do not think he is.  I am sorry to have to say that, but the Minister earlier on gave me the impression that he was basing his objection to the amendment that <Col N="1031" /> has been lost on Deputy Collins's approach to that amendment.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  There is a fundamental principle here, which is the responsibility and the right of the Executive to act on behalf of the Dáil and the people.  Section 2 sets that responsibility at one remove, the remove being that the Minister must have resolutions passed through the Dáil and the Seanad before he can fulfil what I would regard as his responsibility as a member of the Executive.</P>

      <P>I would like to pursue the question posed by Deputy Collins, which I think is a valid question if it is being contended that the Houses of the Oireachtas, and they only, should have the power to dismiss the Authority or member of it, why not give to the Oireachtas the right of their appointment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in presuming to answer, embarked on his usual strategy of the citation of irrelevant matter.  He did not answer the question.  He said that what was happening here was identical with what happens in respect of members of the Judiciary.  That is acceptable if you accept <i>ab initio</i> that the nature of the work carried out by the Judiciary is identical with that carried out by the Authority.  It is acceptable if you are simultaneously showing that the period of office of members of the Authority will be identical with that of members of the Judiciary.  It is acceptable if, in the matter of apprenticeship and training to the profession, it can be shown that members of the Authority can be equated with members of the Judiciary.  I do not think&mdash; even with the Minister's record in the <Col N="1032" /> matter of appointments&mdash;we can accept that.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible that membership of this Authority will go to a person whose only qualification may be his proximity politically to a Minister.  I do not see how, in those circumstances, you can equate that position with that of the Judiciary.  As I said, it is a tactic in the Minister's strategy to move away from questions that are put to him.  If the Minister expects that we should accept the sincerity of the case he is making he would want to give us more cogent reasons because he has not done so up to now.  Does one not make the same argument for the Houses of the Oireachtas in relation to their appointment as one does for being the Authority for dismissing a member of the Authority?</P>
    <P>The Minister is over-sensitive and motivated excessively in relation to what happened in 1972.  Is it wise and prudent to generalise in relation to a particular case?  Is the sole basis for his case the fact that the holder of the office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in 1972 acted in a certain fashion.  Does the purpose of this legislation emanate from what happened in 1972?  I am inclined to the view at times that where other people use a speech as best they can to reveal what is in their minds the Minister acts differently and uses it to distort or conceal.  I would like the Minister to tell me if the whole basis of his attitude here springs from a decision made by his predecessor in 1972.</P>

Section 2 means that even though both Houses of the Oireachtas have, for the stated reasons of the Government, passed the resolution the Government need not remove that person. The section does not say that the person shall be removed or he must be removed.  It says that he may be removed. The Minister will have to explain this.  This means to me that the Government still have power to retain the person if they so desire, notwithstanding the fact that both Houses of the Oireachtas have decided in favour of the stated reasons submitted to them in the resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reply to a few points raised.  First of all, Deputy Collins accused me, on behalf of the Government, of using this debate to distract attention from other topics of greater importance to the nation.  Although I believe this Bill is of significance and importance, undoubtedly there are more important topics.  However, I have not been protracting debate on this.  Anyone who looks at the record will see that my contributions have been relatively few and short whereas the contributions of Deputies opposite have been long and repetitive.  They have kept this debate going on for so long.  If anybody is to be accused of seeking to distract attention from other subjects it is those who have artificially protracted a debate, which has gone on so far for two days on section 1 and 2.  I cannot accept responsibility for that.</P>
      <P>On the question of the appointment of judges as compared with the Authority, may I refer Deputies to what I said on this subject in the Seanad where this matter was debated thoroughly also?  On 13th May, 1975, at column 1372 of the Official Report of that House I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators suggested that if the Oireachtas is to be responsible for removing members of the Authority from office, the Oireachtas should also have power to appoint them.  This does not follow. Within a period of appointment, which is an important limitation, the security of members of the Authority, if this legislation is passed, will be very like that of judges, who cannot be removed <Col N="1036" /> from office except for stated misbehaviour and then only by approval of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  But, of course, under Article 35 (1) of the Constitution, judges are appointed by the President on the advice of the Government, not by the Oireachtas, and their appointments do not require the approval of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>There are good reasons for that. I am not sure whether the idea of appointment of members of the Authority by the Oireachtas was really mooted as a serious proposition in itself, or whether it was not simply intended to discredit or disparage the idea of requiring dismissals to be submitted to the Oireachtas.  It is clear in any case that there is an important distinction between the two concepts.</P>
    <P>The Government are appointed by the Oireachtas and the qualifications of their members can be subjected to debate there, often very sharp debate.  Politicians accept that&mdash;that is what they are for. Neither judges nor private citizens, such as those who accept appointment to State bodies like the RTE Authority, have chosen to submit themselves to such ordeals, which might be actually harmful to their future discharge of their tasks.  The case of a dismissal, which would be expected to be a rare event, is different in kind and in this case it might be expected that the person or persons concerned would welcome an opportunity for the vindication of his, her or their position. For these reasons the Government consider that, while the final decision to remove members of the Authority from office should be in the hands of the Oireachtas, the appointment of the Authority should continue to be on the same basis as appointment to all other public boards, that is, a matter for Government or ministerial decision, and so it will be under this legislation if it is passed.</P>
    <P>Another point was raised to which I have replied already in part, but since Deputies seem to consider that my <Col N="1037" /> reply did not cover the matter fully, let me try to explain it again.  Some Deputies seem to be concerned that a situation might arise in which urgent action to prevent the Authority as a whole or some members of the Authority from exercising their function would be necessary.  They consider that the procedure for dismissal by resolution to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas as provided for in section 2 might be too protracted, for example, the Dáil was in recess and that in the meantime a recalcitrant Authority might continue to flout ministerial direction.  There is general consensus that such an eventuality is extremely remote and, as I mentioned in an earlier intervention in the debate on the section, my view is that legislation should be based on the assumption that an Authority appointed by the Government to run the national broadcasting service will act responsibly.  A difference of opinion could be envisaged between a Minister and an Authority about whether the Authority had failed to exercise sufficient control to ensure compliance with ministerial direction or, indeed, about whether the Authority were complying with ministerial direction.</P>
    <P>If the situation was such that the Government of the day decided that dismissal was warranted and thought there would be undue delay in having a resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, the order for <i>mandamus</i> could be sought from the courts requiring the Authority to comply with ministerial direction.  I am advised that an application for such an order would be treated by the courts as a priority matter and that a decision could be given within a matter of days, assuming the issue was clearcut.  It is inconceivable that an Authority would flout a court order.  Therefore, public interest would be safeguarded adequately by recourse to the courts pending a decision by the Oireachtas &mdash;all fairly unlikely developments.</P>
    <P>As for the case of an individual member of the Authority going off the rails as suggested or refusing to accept a ministerial direction, I would point out that under section 10 (4) of the <Col N="1038" /> 1960 Act every question at a meeting of the Authority should be determined by a majority of the votes of the members present and voting on the question and that in the case of an equal division, the chairman of the meeting should have a second or casting vote. I would expect a situation in which one member of the Authority became a disruptive force, if it happened at all, to develop during a period and timely action should give adequate opportunity to apply the procedure for dismissal provided for in section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney made the point that, supposing the entire Authority had not been dismissed in the way they were dismissed, would I have judged necessary this legislation.  I do not know whether I would have thought it necessary to repeal section 6 if section 6 had never been used.  It was the use of that section and particularly the circumstances in which it was used that suggested the question as to whether section 6 should not be changed.  By tabling an amendment which would replace that section, Deputies opposite seemed to recognise that there was a need after all to change the section, as I believe there was.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling raised the ingenious point, and I must give him full credit for it, that a member of the Authority may be removed from office by the Government for stated reasons but he pointed out&mdash;this is like the kind of point that the late A.P. Herbert used sometimes make&mdash;that it was possible to conceive under this wording that a Government would come into the House, call for the removal for stated reasons of certain members of the Authority, pass the resolution through both Houses and then refrain from taking action.  That would be a rather remarkable political exercise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for any Government to engage in.  However, I am prepared to have the parliamentary draftsman look at the section to see whether this odd ambiguity can be removed without creating some new and more probable ambiguity because <Col N="1039" /> it is highly improbable, I would say virtually impossible, that any Government should act in the manner which Deputy Dowling has ingeniously devised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wishes to contribute these smartalecky remarks I would ask you to request him to contain himself, Sir. The Minister said that his contributions were few and short but that ours were long, artificially protracted and repetitive.  Last week I reported progress on this discussion. This party were ready to have the matter dealt with there and then but the Minister, thinking that he was to be the last speaker on it, could not resist the temptation to introduce something controversial. He deliberately misrepresented certain facts in relation to a letter written by one Minister to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tried to give a false impression.  If he was hoping for a reasonably mature debate on an important broadcasting Bill he completely misjudged the Members of the House by acting in the way he did.  It is not the first time the Minister read this letter, or part of it, in this House.  On 20th June, 1973, the Minister used that same letter when he was replying to the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. He was the last speaker and, knowing that, he felt free to use it in the knowledge that no one could come back on it.  That is changed now.  We are dealing with the Committee Stage of the Bill and we can talk about it now.  If he was serious in getting this Bill dealt with in a mature way he was wrong to act as he did.  If he thinks he can play political football with the Bill in the way he did, in the one-sided fashion he hoped he would be <Col N="1040" /> allowed to operate, he was wrong there also.</P>
    <P>I accused the Minister of trying to distract the attention of the public from the economic chaos at the moment.  This is true but the fact that I made that accusation does not take away from the importance of the Bill.  If the Minister was as serious about this matter as he should have been he would not have acted in the way he has done this afternoon.  He has said he was prompted to introduce this section because section 6 in the old Bill was used.  If there is a section in the Bill it is there for a good reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would love to comment on the remarks made by everyone so that he can have it recorded in his own Machiavellian way.  I wrote down a phrase the Minister used when he spoke just now&mdash; if the Official Report proves me wrong I shall apologise unreservedly to the Minister&mdash;and my clear recollection is that he said the use of section 6 prompted him.  At that time the then Government decided that section 6 was going to be used.  Members now sitting on the Government benches, prior to the use of section 6, strongly and severely criticised the state of affairs that existed at that time.  I have here a speech made by a Member of this House which the Minister should read.  He is no longer just a Labour Deputy but is a member of a Government supported by Fine Gael and Labour backbenchers. On 13th June, 1972, in an Adjournment Debate, Deputy L'Estrange had some very strong observations to make in relation to the way subversives were being glamorised by individuals within RTE.  At col. 1474 of the Official Report of that date he stated:</P>
      <P>I wish to point out to him&mdash;&mdash; that was to me, as Minister.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that for the past two years I believe, with the vast majority of the Irish people, that the orders issued by the Government to RTE have been flouted by slick operators in that organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> These are the people who are keeping the Minister in government now. Deputy L'Estrange continued:</P>
    <P>Certain men in that organisation have built up and glorified men of violence.</P>
    <P>These were the words of a front bench Fine Gael Deputy and the same sentiments were expressed by other Members. The Deputy went on to say:</P>
    <P>They have downgraded and vilified men and women of this country both North and South who stand for a peaceful end to the unfortunate tragedies which are taking place in our midst today.</P>
    <P>These were very profound statements by a leading member of the Fine Gael front bench and similar statements were made by members of the two major parties.  We are not here to discuss whether the decision of the Government to remove the Authority under section 6 was right or wrong and it is a pity the Minister deliberately tried to get us to discuss the justification or otherwise of using the section.  I am quite satisfied that what was done was right and I justified my case in the House at that time.  I will not repeat it but, if necessary, I can read it line by line for the Minister.</P>
    <P>My main point now is to reject completely the most recent statement by the Minister that we are protracting the debate.  We are not but we are determined to rebuff at all times the untrue insinuations and allegations of the Minister.  If this Minister thinks he can label anyone on these benches with the tag of subversive, let him understand clearly that it will be rebuffed. If his conscience is pricking him, I suggest he should look at some of the actions of members of the Labour Party.  It was not a member of my party who tried to kick down the door of the Mater Hospital when certain people were being held in there and treated as prisoners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that the section is rather doubtful and he agrees that it must be looked at.  In the course of the discussion he indicated it was ridiculous to <Col N="1042" /> think any Government would introduce a Bill, get it through the Houses of the Oireachtas and then not act on it.  I do not think that is too extraordinary an idea when we consider the equal pay legislation and other measures that were brought before the House where the Government changed their mind.  In this instance possibly the Minister sees the outlet the Minister for Labour did not see when he was presenting the equal pay measure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a safety valve for the Minister.  It is clear to me, as it is to the Minister, that the Government need not dismiss a member of the Authority even though both Houses of the Oireachtas agree to the removal of that person for stated reasons.  The Minister has undertaken to have a word with the parliamentary draftsman to see if there can be some substitute for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;. There must be a way of framing the Bill to meet what the Minister requires. Legislation must be positive. There must be no ambiguity.  This is a most important section in the Bill and there must be nothing doubtful about it and any doubt that exists at the moment must be removed.  The Minister knows he can by weight of numbers force this Bill through in any particular form he desires.  He has admitted there is a doubt and he must remove this immediately.</P>
      <P>Is this deliberately designed to provide a way out for the Minister and the Government?  It is not a question that the Government may do something. It is a question that the Government must do something.  Ministers say different things in different places.  That is a fairly common practice with the present Government. The Minister is satisfied there is an area of doubt in this section and the Minister must remove this area of doubt.  If the Minister wants to consult with the parliamentary draftsman we will give him that opportunity.</P>

      <P>I was very interested to hear the Minister explain that the intention was to remove a member of the Authority when a resolution to that effect had been passed by both Houses. As I see it, the section provides the Government with an option.  Earlier the Minister talked about what he loosely described as an exercise in democracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister had a &ldquo;go&rdquo; at Deputy Jack Lynch for using those words.  The Minister comes in here and tries to establish beyond yea or nay that he is the champion of democracy because he is taking the decision out of his own hands and handing it over to the Oireachtas to enable the Members of the Dáil and Seanad to decide whether somebody should be removed from the Authority. I do not believe this word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is here by accident.  I honestly believe that that has been deliberately inserted by the Minister following consultations with the parliamentary draftsman, because under the terms of section 2 a motion can be moved in this House by any Member.  It does not say that the resolution has to be moved by the Government. It simply says that, if a resolution is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas calling for the removal <Col N="1044" /> of a member of the Authority, the Government may remove him.</P>
      <P>This is where I question the ministerial thinking behind the suggested democratic purpose of section 2.  We have at present in this House one Deputy from the Government side who has deliberately avoided voting on one Bill in this House which is under discussion at present.  Down through the years we have heard a lot about dissidents.  Peculiarly enough, all dissidents were members or former members of, or were associated with Fianna Fáil.  There are no dissidents on the Coalition side.  I suggest that there are, even though the media has not cottoned on to it yet, deliberately or otherwise. A number of people on the Government side made their entry into this House through the medium of television and a notable exponent of that is the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. One can visualise a situation where a motion can be moved in this House, sponsored by the Opposition, calling for the removal of some member of the Authority.  In the normal course, any motion moved by the Opposition is doomed to failure from the word go.  Under this Bill it is quite possible that we can have a resolution moved from this side of the House which might find favour on the Government side and might be supported by three or four members of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a Private Member's motion at 7 o'clock this evening, and if there is any semblance of reliability or honesty left in the Labour Party they should support it.  In the same way it is possible under this Bill to have a resolution moved in this House, sponsored by the Opposition, for which we could expect a certain amount of Government backbench support.  I am suggesting that if such a resolution moved by the Opposition were passed in this House with the support of two or three dissident backbench supporters of the Government, it is possible in that event that section 2 enables the Government not to apply the democratic process.  It is an escape clause built in by the Minister on the advice of his colleagues following consultation with the parliamentary draftsman.  Apart from the promise given by the Minister for Posts <Col N="1045" /> and Telegraphs to Deputy Dowling a few moments ago, I believe that when he has his consultation and when we get to the Report Stage there will be no change in this section.</P>
    <P>Here we have a whitewashing job. There is going to be no more interference with members of the Television Authority by the Government.  Built into section 2 we have a situation where, even if the majority of the elected representatives pass a resolution for the removal of a member of the Authority, the Government, we are told by the Minister, because of the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, will not abide by the decision of this House in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to a few points.  As it stands the section merely sets out the conditions which have to be complied with if the Government decide to dismiss the Authority.  The section defines how an Authority may be dismissed. It does not purport to provide for the circumstances in which any Authority shall be dismissed and I do not consider it desirable that it should be so.  I have said that the wording can be looked at again to see if it can be improved between this and the Report Stage, as often happens.  But I am not going to change it at this Stage and I am not promising that it will be changed at any later Stage.  Nor is it envisaged in the section, nor was it ever envisaged by me in connection with this Bill, in regard to the removal of an Authority that the Government should do so.  I have said that.  What this section proposes to do is to limit in a certain specific way the power of the Government in that matter, that is to say, that the Government cannot do this unless resolutions are passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is what it means and that is all it means.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It is a pity that the Minister did not give more thought to this section.  It is quite obvious that he looked at section 6 and disliked it for his own personal reasons.  It is quite obvious that the Minister did not give enough thought to the drafting of section 2.  Certainly it does not look to the future.  Indeed, I can see an unfortunate situation so far as the Director General is concerned, because we know he is appointed by the Authority.  The Director General is going to find himself in a difficult situation.  The removal of the Authority by the Minister is going to take a considerable amount of time in this House.  It is quite obvious that the Minister has no confidence in the Authority he is removing at this particular time, but at the same time the Director General will have to take instructions from the Authority during this period.  This is undesirable and I doubt whether it would be tolerated in any other type of organisation. The Minister should have made some provisions, if only to protect the Director General and other staff within RTE in regard to their positions during the removal of the Authority from office.  Some time ago the Minister stated that he could not see a situation where the Authority would flout the directives of a Minister. None of us knows what is going to happen from day to day, and we are placing the staff and the Director General in a position that we, as legislators, should not place them in. I am concerned about the practicalities of it and that is what legislation is all about.  The Minister is, in effect, saying here in section 2: &ldquo;I am going to remove the Authority by moving a motion in this House which can then be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo; At the same time, the Minister is not giving any directive as to whom the Director General should take instructions from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was one of the reasons that I was concerned about the suspension clause and the position which RTE and the Director General would find themselves in during this period.  Evidently the Minister, if he took them and these consequences into consideration <Col N="1047" /> at all, looked at section 6 of the 1960 Bill and said &ldquo;I will replace that completely&rdquo; and went in the opposite direction.  If he had looked at our amendment he would have found, especially in the suspension clause, the solution and the section that should be in the Bill.  I have no doubt that if you ask any member of the Authority in regard to our amendment &ldquo;Is that a practical amendment?&rdquo;, the answer must be &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Regarding employees of RTE, and particularly the Director General, the question arises: from whom are they to take directions? This is the type of ambiguity that will arise in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We have debated this section at length and it is regrettable that the Minister did not see our point of view on our amendment.  He would be introducing practical legislation that would be respected by the Authority and by the staff of RTE and which would give the Minister the tain times.  If one is head of an organisation or a Department one must authority which he must have at cer-have authority.  Somebody must make the decisions.  It is not nice to have to make unpopular decisions, but the man at the top must take that responsibility. Once a person accepts a position as Minister he is taking on the responsibility.  During his course of office it will fall upon him to take important decisions.  The Minister here is afraid to take unpopular decisions and he is asking us in the House to do it instead.</P>
    <P>This is a cumbersome section.  It looks tidy as we see it in this Bill, but it is a most cumbersome section to put into operation.  We have opposed the Bill.  We have put in an amendment which took a considerable length of time to work out.  If the Minister had objected to section 6 as it stood the amendment which we proposed would have filled the bill and would have lead to much better legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amazed at the dogmatic manner in which the Minister answered the question in relation <Col N="1048" /> to this doubtful area.  Deputy Lalor covered the field fairly well and projected new light on this area of deception, because that is what it is. The Minister states that he will not do it on the Committee Stage and he may not do it on the Report Stage.  We want to guarantee that this section will be rectified to meet the requirements that the Minister has indicated. Deputy Lalor posed the question whether the Opposition could formulate a motion or present a Bill for stated reasons.  If I understood the Minister, he stated that it was not his intention that a motion could be formulated by the Opposition.  If that is so the Bill does not indicate that.  This is an area of deception.  I did regard it as an area of doubt.  The Minister has been very dogmatic about this and has dug his heels in.  He wants this House to pass the most important section of this Bill, that he agrees is ambiguous, that could be used in a variety of ways, but does not mean what it states and does not mean what has been conveyed to the Houses, the Seanad and the Dáil, as being the intention of the Government. Surely the Minister does not believe that this House has lost its sanity and is prepared to pass any type of legislation.  If that is so, and if he insists that the bootboys be pushed into the lobbies, we have moved from a democratic system to a dictatorial one.</P>
      <P>I hoped that the Minister would have given a clear indication to the House when this aspect was uncovered, that it would be rectified.  At an early stage the Minister stated that he would consult with the parliamentary draftsmen to see if a solution to this problem could be found.  However, speakers uncovered further areas of misrepresentation.  I ask the Minister to give a clear undertaking that he will change this area or the area of doubtful quantity by the removal of this word and the substitution of another word, or indeed of another sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister, when he does get his parliamentary draftsmen to study section 2 again, if he would also get them to <Col N="1049" /> examine the situation from the point of view of the word &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; or &ldquo;resolutions&rdquo;.  The section reads:</P>
      <P>A member of the Authority may be removed by the Government from office for stated reasons, if, and only if, resolutions are passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas calling for his removal.</P>
      <P>Arising from my contribution of a few moments ago I have been checking out Standing Orders in regard to the function of resolutions.  Under Standing Order 87 (2) I find:</P>
      <P>That matters that may be dealt with by resolution shall include Standing Orders, adjournments of the Dáil, appointment or removal of the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, expressions, of condolence, censure, thanks and opinion and any other matter which, by law, the Dáil may decide by simple Resolution</P>
      <P>It does not say whether the members of the Broadcasting Authority are members.  It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>(3)  The matters that may be dealt with by Order shall include the suspension of members, the appointment of committees&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>It does not say the dissolution of committees</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the printing of Bills and documents and questions of procedure generally.</P>
      <P>I think, therefore, that the use of the word &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; in this section could be the inappropriate word in this section.  I have some knowledge and experience of the dedication of the drafters of Bills in this regard and I am sure that the word &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; or &ldquo;resolutions&rdquo; covering both Houses was something that was investigated by the parliamentary draftsmen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to provide adequate funds in 1976 to <Col N="1050" /> enable regional health boards to maintain the health services at their existing level.</P>
    <P>We in the Opposition have put down this motion in order to direct the attention of Dáil Éireann to the fundamental nature of the crisis which has arisen in the nation's health services this year.  We are seeking to arouse the Dáil to its responsibility in this situation.  In our view the Government have failed to discharge one of their primary duties in a modern society, that is, to provide for the basic health needs of the people.</P>
    <P>In that situation we believe that this Parliament has an ultimate responsibility to ensure that these basic needs will be met.  We believe that Dáil Éireann must refuse to accept this dereliction of duty by the Minister for Health and the Government, and must instruct them to make the necessary funds available to supply this essential public service and to avoid the widespread hardship and suffering that are definitely inherent in the present provisions.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise, in case there be any misunderstanding either in the House or among the general public, that we are not dealing in this motion with normal annual budgetary exercises, with superficial economies or even sensible cutbacks and savings.  We are faced with a major deficiency in the level of funds needed to maintain the health services at an acceptable level throughout the country.  This is not a matter of the cutting out of unnecessary luxuries or even eliminating waste.  What is involved is a major dislocation of services which meet a basic community need; a dislocation which will cause widespread hardship among the weaker section of our community and which will directly accentuate the suffering of the sick, the disabled and the aged.</P>
    <P>Nor is this something which is just temporary in its effects.  I believe these cutbacks and this dislocation will have long-term lasting effects on the health of our community. That is the sort of situation <Col N="1051" /> that confronts Dáil Éireann today. It is a tragic price to have to pay for bad Government and fiscal mismanagement, but it is the reality we have to face.  Dáil Éireann must confront the simple fact that we have arrived at a situation where an Irish Government have to say they are unable to provide the funds needed for a reasonable health service which meets basic humanitarian needs.</P>
    <P>The Coalition apologists are seeking to explain away this crisis on two separate grounds.  First of all they say it is all due to the economic recession, something that could not be helped, something that is due to world economic conditions.  On the other hand they say it has arisen because health costs have escalated to a level that cannot be tolerated. I say categorically that neither of these excuses can be sustained.  The economic recession basically has nothing to do with the health financing situation.  What we are dealing with in regard to health administration are financial management and budgetary policy, and there is no reason why economic recession should at any time affect this budgetary situation.</P>
    <P>What we are dealing with in this motion is the question of allocating the public funds that are available between different services, the question of settling priorities.  I believe this situation has arisen because of a combination of two ministerial defaults. First of all we have the failure of the Minister for Finance to safeguard our public finances and we have the parallel failure of the Minister for Health to ensure that in the disposition of the funds that are available our health services are awarded their essential basic priority.  To the over-all failure of the Minister for Finance has been added the specific failure of the Minister for Health&mdash;it is his particular responsibility.</P>
    <P>The real situation is that the unwise, imprudent, misguided general financial policies of the Government have brought us to a critical budgetary situation and in that situation the <Col N="1052" /> Government have awarded other services a higher priority than health. They have deprived the health services of the essential level of resources that they require.  Nor can it be validly argued that the health services are escalating to intolerable levels.  That is not sustainable.  An examination of the Estimates in recent years shows that health continues to absorb roughly the same relative proportion of the total budget and that there has been no major change in that overall situation, nor in the last three years have there been any major developments in the health services to which blame could be attributed.</P>
    <P>I have maintained, and I still do, that it is not the duty of this House or the Opposition to order the budgetary provisions in detail.  We do not have disclosed to us the full facts.  We do not have the detailed knowledge of the exigencies and the pressures which would enable us to decide the manner in which the specific budgetary allocations should be made.  Only the Government can do that.  But we can as a Parliament give a direction to the Government, as we are seeking to do in this motion, that we want our health services to receive their proper priority and to be given an allocation sufficient to maintain them at their present level.  We can also demonstrate that the 1976 Book of Estimates contains some very disturbing contrasts in their approach.</P>
    <P>We can show that in the Estimates as published there has not been any consistent approach, any balanced coordinated attempt to regulate conflicting demands and to settle priorities on a fair basis of relative needs.  Why, for instance, are the health boards being pinned to an artificial inflation-compensating increase of 15 per cent or 16 per cent when AnCO get a phenomenal increase in their current budget of 70 per cent?  I want to know the sort of thinking that produced that sort of contrast.  Of course at this stage we have only an abridged Book of Estimates to go on. So slovenly do this Government do their work that we are now well into this financial year and we still have <Col N="1053" /> not got the details of the Estimates, and if and when we get those details they may reveal some valid reason for this disproportionate increase in the AnCO estimate.  Without some such explanation we can only regard it with suspicion.</P>
    <P>I direct attention also to the fact that the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce includes a provision of £3 million for investment in mining concerns.  How can that be justified in the circumstances of this year?  I think it is a piece of nonsense. There is no necessity to lock up £3 million of taxpayers' money in that way. The State can procure any reasonable share that it decides on of the produce of those mines without resorting to a foolish and unnecessary investment of this large amount of taxpayers' money. I believe this is being done for no other reason than to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce some empty status as a shareholder at our expense. This is a rich, extensive ore body, a project well capable of supporting its own development on commercial terms.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that the shortfall on the estimate of the Eastern Health Board is £3.7 million and I am seriously proposing that that £3 million set aside for that unnecessary investment in mining companies well able to look after their own investment be switched to the Department of Health and used to meet the Eastern Health Board deficit.  That would not affect mining operations in the Navan area in any way.  It is the kind of sorting out of basic priorities that should be taken in present circumstances. Admittedly, the £3 million which is provided is classified in the investment as capital expenditure, but I do not think in the context of this year's budget that need necessarily prevent the switching of it as I have suggested.</P>
    <P>We cannot attempt to propound a budget from these benches.  We have not got the necessary information to do that, but we want to indicate to the Government the sort of priorities they should adhere to.  We want to underline the confused thinking and the false judgments that are manifest in many of the provisions in the Book of Estimates as published.  I believe that if we <Col N="1054" /> were given the responsibility of doing so I do not think we would have any great difficulty in making other fully justifiable switches inside the existing budgetary dispositions which would take care of the health service deficiency this year without resorting to additional taxes or any similar measures.</P>
    <P>I should now like to look at the extent and the depth of the damage the inadequate provisions made by the Minister for 1976 will give rise to in the administration of the health services.  The total amount provided in the Estimate for the Department of Health is £249 million and that compares with an actual expenditure of £214 million in 1975, showing a paper increase of 16 per cent.  It is instantly obvious that this overall provision is entirely cosmetic; it is mere window dressing.  It simply represents the out-turn for last year with a 15 or 16 per cent added, allegedly, to cover for anticipated inflation.  It is totally unrealistic.  There is no provision for any normal development, any unforeseeable contingencies, any emergencies and, certainly, no possibility for any improvements of any sort.</P>
    <P>Next to the allocations to the regional health boards, the largest item in the Department of Health Estimate is the global amount which is provided for the voluntary hospitals, the homes for mentally handicapped and the general medical service.  The amount provided under that global heading for 1976 is £93.4 million against an actual expenditure of £80.6 million.  Again, that is clearly unrealistic.  It is widely known that a number of hospitals throughout the country, and particularly in Dublin city, have no possibility of carrying on their operations at existing level. They will have no alternative but to effect major reductions in staffing and services.  In certain cases, as things are, they will have to close down entire wards.  Can we allow this to happen?  Are we prepared to contemplate a major reduction in something as basic to our community as the hospitalisation of the sick?  Voluntary hospitals are in an unprecedented state of dismay and apprehension.  Cuts varying between 5 per cent and 20 per cent on their projected budgets are <Col N="1055" /> being dictated to them.  Some of them estimate that if they maintain their staffs at their existing level&mdash;heaven knows those staffs are in many cases already overstretched&mdash;they will have to stop feeding their patients sometime at the end of this summer.</P>
    <P>The ban on overtime for lay staff in the case of the accident-duty hospitals in the city will result in there being no essential back-up service in these accident-duty hospitals after 5 p.m. It is rumoured that three of the North Dublin trauma hospitals, the Mater, Jervis Street and the Richmond, are being forced indirectly to close down 50 beds each.  I should like to know if that is true and if that is the intention of the Minister.  This city is seething with rumours of reductions, close-downs and lay-offs and the Minister must deal with this critically dangerous situation when he replies to the motion. We do not want irrelevancies; we do not want attempts to show that hospital X got £Y in 1970 and this year is getting £X and, therefore, there is an increase of a certain percentage.  We want factual statements from the Minister as to what are his intentions and what are the possibilities, particularly with regard to the staffing and the servicing of these major Dublin accident hospitals.</P>
    <P>It is certain also that the general medical service cannot be maintained at its present level with the moneys provided in that £93.4 million and it is obvious that curtailment, reductions and withdrawals to the poorer sections of our community are going to be savage in their intensity throughout the regional health boards.  For instance, the Southern Health Board have already moved in this direction.  I should like to read from a circular which the CEO issued on 17th February, 1976.  He stated:</P>
    <P>It has been the practice for a number of years to grant medical cards automatically to persons who are recipients of non-contributory old age, widows' and orphans' pensions. It has come to notice that a significant number of persons in receipt of such pensions at reduced rates have incomes which are much in excess of those which would normally <Col N="1056" /> qualify them for medical cards.  The automatic granting of medical cards to pensioners with such incomes has given rise to anomalies. Accordingly, it has now been arranged to discontinue the automatic granting of medical cards to them and to consider their applications on their individual merits within the revised guidelines.  Medical cards will, as heretofore, be granted automatically to those in receipt of pensions at the maximum rates.</P>
    <P>There is the thin end of the wedge. Those in receipt of non-contributory old age, widows' and orphans' pensions are to be deprived of a privilege they have had for many years of automatically getting medical cards.</P>
    <P>The allocations on current account which have been projected for the regional health boards have placed them in an intolerable situation.  The economies and cut-backs they are being forced to consider are ludicrous. In the name of common sense and human decency they cannot be tolerated by the Dáil.  The situation confronting the eight health boards is basically the same.  The Secretary of the Department of Health, in the course of a letter of 12th January, 1976, and at a meeting with the chief executive officers of the eight health boards on 28th January, laid down the law.  He stated that the allocations which had been notified will not be increased under any circumstances.  He said that no further funds would be forthcoming, apart from budgetary welfare increases, and that section 31 of the 1970 Act would be fully invoked to ensure that these allocations were adhered to.  The iron curtain came down with a very definite ominous finality.</P>
    <P>It is important for us to realise that all this took place in January and February of this year.  Neither the boards nor their management teams were given any advance warning or any opportunity to prepare for this cataclysm.  The Secretary of the Department of Health had the good grace to say to the CEOs that he would have liked to have been able to tell them last September.  Why did he not tell them?  Why was this hapless <Col N="1057" /> Minister for Health still perpetrating the fraud at the annual conference of his party in November that he was improving our health services and saying that all was well?  He was still going through the pretence when he must have known what the grim reality was.  The Minister and his Department, in my view, are guilty of very serious neglect, guilty of accentuating a difficult situation by this coy reticence on his part and not giving the boards and their management teams timely notice of the situation they must face.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage I believe the Minister for Health must be absolutely frank with this House.  There is no point in him coming in here with figures and percentages that we are not in a position to check and purporting to prove that he has been doing great things for the Irish health services.  It will not wash.  This great propaganda bubble has burst and we are now facing the hard and bitter results of the mismanagement by this Government of our financial affairs. On the 5th February, 1976, the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board made this report to his board:</P>
    <P>The Secretary of the Department of Health has indicated in his letter of 12th January that the Board's allocation for the year will be £33.59 million.  Taking into account other income estimated at £2.06 million, the amount available to meet expenditure on health services is £35.65 million.  The estimated cost of maintaining the services at the levels obtaining at 31st December, 1975, at current price levels and excluding any expansion of services (other than such limited development as may be possible with the aid of ESF grants is £39.37 million. The Board is, accordingly, faced with the task of securing a major reduction of £3.72 million in expenditure in 1976, and it is clear that the level of services must be affected.</P>
    <P>There is no shilly-shallying about that. That is a clear-cut statement of the situation.  He goes on:</P>
    <P>Paragraph 11 of the Department's letter stresses that adequate provision <Col N="1058" /> must be made to support certain items throughout the whole of 1976.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that the cost of those will be £29.08 million; and the cost of the other items is £10.29 million.</P>
    <P>But this is the key paragraph:</P>
    <P>It is clear that it would not be possible to achieve a reduction of £3.72 million in our estimate of £10.2 million.  It is difficult therefore to see how the board can avoid reducing the level of services, including staff numbers and the payments to external agencies.</P>
    <P>There is to be no misunderstanding about the situation.  I am talking there about the Eastern Health Board, but the situation is exactly the same proportionately in the case of the other seven.  The management team of the Eastern Health Board, faced with the alternative of running completely out of money sometime before the end of this year, or trying to carry on through the year on some basis, put forward proposals for the board as follows for consideration: Maintenance works to be postponed; transport services for the conveyance of patients to be reduced; maternity facilities to be reviewed; £30,000 saved by paring the rate of assistance of persons maintained in private homes; economies in various hospitals and homes in heating, lighting, power and household expenses to be actively pursued.  We know what that means.</P>
    <P>There are other suggestions: In certain hospitals to reduce the intake of junior medical staff; close certain wards; under the community care programme, reduce the age limit for the free milk scheme from five to three years; introduce a means test for the handicapped children constant care scheme; discontinue routine medical examination under the school examination scheme; withhold increase due to foster parents of boarded-out children; hold expenditure at the 1975 level&mdash;in other words, cut back on the disabled and infectious diseases allowances, home help, meals on wheels, employment of the blind and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> Does that not read like something out of &ldquo;Oliver Twist&rdquo;, or the sort of regime that a Victorian board of guardians would lay down for a workhouse in 1870?  The Southern Health Board CEO calculated that he would have a shortfall of £960,000. He had this to say in a report to his board:</P>
    <P>A cutback of expenditure of close on £1 million to meet the cost of existing services cannot be achieved by minor economies here and there.  It will necessitate quite severe measures, and no area of the Board's services can quite escape their consequences. Not alone is there no money for new services of any kind but a severe cutback on spending on present services must be made.</P>
    <P>He goes on to elaborate a whole series of restrictions on the use of transport for patients being conveyed to hospital.  The North Western Health Board will have a shortfall of £850,000.  The South Eastern Health Board will have a shortfall of £750,000.  The Midland Health Board will have a cutback of £900,000. There will be the same level of cut-back and restrictions proportionately all over the country.</P>
    <P>Such proposals and, in particular, the proposals which the Eastern Health Board have had to put forward, are a negation of planning.  It is an insult to our intelligence and makes us all look mean and shabby as administrators. Not alone does it cause unnecessary hardship, disappointment and suffering but ultimately it is, as always, counter productive even from the strict financial point of view.  It is the blunt-instrument, panic-stricken approach, and it is all based on an erroneous impression that health expenditure cannot be controlled and regulated in an orderly way, because I believe it can.</P>
    <P>This absurd situation will keep on recurring if this Minister for Health is guided, as he appears to be guided, by dogma rather than by realism and common sense.  He keeps on foolishly suggesting that all that is needed to have a perfect health service is some vague good intention and that Fianna <Col N="1060" /> Fáil's insistence on ordered, planned development as resources became available was obscurantist and reactionary.</P>
    <P>The situation we now face arises because of lack of sound long-term thinking about the kind of health services we need and the kind we can afford.  In the absence of such basic thinking and planning we can certainly expect piecemeal, <i>ad hoc</i> attack on the estimates from time to time, depending on the extent to which the general financial budgetary situation is mismanaged.  Of course we can hope that it will not, for a long time, be as seriously mismanaged as it has been during the last two or three years.</P>
    <P>This sort of panic reaction to a financial crisis brings suffering and hardship to those unable to bear it, perhaps those who are least able to mount any effective volume of protest. On this occasion I believe there has been indiscriminate overkill and that the situation can still be met by a reallocation of existing provisions in the context of the budget, even as it is presented.  We can hope perhaps that the urgency and the panic which this precipitate action of the Government in regard to the health services has generated will persuade the Government, and more importantly, those socialist theorists that we have imported into the public service and imposed on the trained and experienced civil servants, that a rational health policy for Ireland cannot be imported, that it must be built up on the basis of our own experience, our own needs, and that it must be realistically related to our own resources.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this crisis will force upon the Minister some positive thinking about the future financing of the health services, the extension, for instance, of the insurance principle, the full utilisation of public and private resources and a variety of other possibilities. Perhaps it will, but I doubt it.  Responsibility for the allocation for the health services for 1976 has moved from the Government to the Dáil.  The Government have failed to see where their duty lies.  They have become totally confused, being overwhelmed by the financial chaos of their <Col N="1061" /> own unwise and imprudent policies.  It is now the solemn duty of Dáil Éireann, in this far reaching and fundamental situation, to restore common sense and sanity and to insist that the existing services be maintained during the coming year at their present level.</P>
    <P>I would like to direct in a very special way the attention of the Labour backbenchers in particular to the implications for them of this motion of ours.  Their respective electorates will be watching very carefully what action they take on this motion. They, like all of us, have heard grand humanitarian sentiments from them over the years.  They have heard of their devotion to the interests of the poorer and weaker sections of the community.  I believe the time has now come for those Labour backbenchers to demonstrate if those were genuine principles sincerely held or if they were merely political clichés.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House, with our voting strength, cannot stop the Government closing hospital wards, throwing old people out of homes, forcing nurses to work intolerably long hours, cutting out meals on wheels, cutting out children's clinics or cutting out free milk.  But if only three of those Labour backbenchers stood by their principles Dáil Éireann could safeguard the people's health on this occasion.  We can make the Government do their duty to the poor, the weak, the sick and the disabled. We can demonstrate that Dáil Éireann is the ultimate guardian of the people's welfare and not just a rubber stamp for the economists of the Department of Finance.  Will those Labour backbenchers stand up and be counted now when the ordinary men and women of Ireland need them on this vital, important, fundamental, basic issue?</P>
    <P>I propose this motion to the House. As I have said I believe that the cut-backs which the Government have proposed, the allocations which they have made, will cause fundamental, long-term, serious dislocation of our health services.  This dislocation will cause immediate hardship, suffering and inconvenience but it will also have serious long-term implications <Col N="1062" /> from the point of view of the health services' structure and also from the point of view of the welfare and the health of the community.  I believe we must express our complete rejection of the Government's proposal.</P>
    <P>We must indicate to the Government by passing this motion that the fundamental community services cannot be dislocated and disrupted in this way and that we demand that the Government make an allocation which will be adequate to maintain services at their existing level.  That is all we are asking.  We are not asking the Government for improvements or for development, although we might well do that.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government we were constantly harassed from the Labour benches in particular for increases of all sorts. We are not even asking for that on this occasion.  We are only asking that the Government provide enough money to maintain basic services at their existing level and that they do not force health boards throughout the country to use the shabby, mean tricks of cutting out all sorts of basic humanitarian services.  I had a case reported to me today of an old people's home in Ennis, which is only typical of what is happening all over the country, where old people of 75 and 80 years of age are being thrown out of the place, which has been their home for many years, because of this financial deprivement of the Government in the allocation to the different health boards.</P>
    <P>I hope I have said enough to persuade the House that whatever has to be done be done.  I believe it can be done by a reallocation of the existing provisions and that certain moneys which are being foolishly devoted to other purposes could be switched to meet the deficiencies in the health services. I believe, whatever way it is done, that there is a solemn obligation on Dáil Éireann to pass this motion and to insist that the Government make those provisions to enable us to maintain our health services at a reasonable level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. R. Barry) Richard Barry">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. R. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his proposal of this <Col N="1063" /> motion Deputy Haughey used such terms as drama, rumour, crisis and panic reaction.  At one stage he mentioned tragedy.  I suggest to him and the other Members of his party in this House that it does not suit him to stand up here in that fashion and make drama out of one of the most important subjects which can be discussed in this or any other Parliament &mdash;the ill health of the unfortunate people in our midst.  The short contribution I make to this debate will, I hope, be made with more calmness and coolness.</P>
      <P>I can well understand the anxiety of people having listened to Deputy Haughey and indeed to other Fianna Fáil Deputies in the House during the past month and having read the reports of the different health board meetings throughout the country, where we had the Fianna Fáil Deputies, Senators and spokesmen in county councils crying out that there was to be a drastic deterioration in the quality of our health services.  I want to say straight away that that is utter nonsense.  One will acknowledge Deputy Haughey's new found concern for those ill people in our midst but I am tempted to ask why the same concern was not shown by his colleagues when Fianna Fáil were in office.  Fianna Fáil were in power for 16 consecutive years.  It is fair for me to say that their record in the health field does not stand up that well on close examination.  The truth of the matter is that it was not until this Government took office that the people generally got the full health services they were entitled to and which they could rightly expect.  I do not believe there is anybody, no matter what his politics are, who can deny that under this Administration there has been a dramatic and unprecedented improvement in the quality of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that it is not possible to approach discussion of a motion of this kind without referring to the whole range of Government expenditure. Neither can one consider the 1975 and 1976 figures in isolation. Health expenditure in this and other countries has been the subject of great <Col N="1064" /> growth for a long time.  The figures I shall quote show that the Government have not been negligent in regard to expenditure on health.  The percentage of our GNP spent on health has increased from 4.8 per cent in 1972-73 to an estimated 6.3 per cent in the present year.  Deputy Haughey has asked us not to indulge in irrelevancies. I trust that what I have to say is strictly relevant to the motion.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Government would have liked to continue the progress and improvement in the health services this year, but solely because of economic circumstances that are well known to the House this is not possible. In his contribution Deputy Haughey referred more than once to the Eastern Health Board.  I shall leave the affairs of that board to be debated by people better fitted than I to do that, but I have some experience of the Southern Health Board so my remarks mainly will be in connection with the administration of that most efficient board.</P>
    <P>The basic figures relating to the Southern Health Board are as follows: the total allocation for the area, that is, Cork and Kerry, for 1975, as revised after the Supplementary Estimate which was passed in November was £35,286,000; the allocation for 1976 is £39,570,000, of which £10,140,000 relates to indirect expenditure in that it is channelled by the Department directly to the body paying doctors under the choice of doctor scheme, the voluntary hospitals and so on.  This leaves an allocation to the board for their own expenditure of £29,430,000 or an increase of £3,130,000 compared with the final allocation in 1975.  No one pretends that this increase allowed for growth and expenditure.  Indeed the Department's circular notifying the board of their allocation stated that because of the economic situation the Government have had to decide reluctantly that the growth in health expenditure in real terms could not continue during 1976.  It was made clear also that the allocation to the health boards would require therefore the exercise of economy in planning and administration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> The CEO and the members of the Southern Health Board have approached the situation in a most constructive way.  The CEO reporting to the health board on the 29th January, 1976, had this to say:</P>
    <P>In facing the extremely difficult time that lies ahead the Board is fortunate that its services have undergone such considerable improvement over a number of years that it is now in a better position to face a pause in development than it would have been some years ago.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to say that in order to cope with the situation the greatest possible understanding and co-operation will be needed within the board itself, its management and its staff at all levels and, above all, from the public.  This was an example of the Southern Health Board approaching in a real and constructive way the situation that has been made known to them.</P>
    <P>The result of the consideration by the Southern Health Board of that report of the manager is reflected in reports of their meeting held only yesterday, details of which appear in today's press.  The board say that if they effect economies in such areas as the use of taxis for the transport of patients and the prescribing of excessive quantities of drugs, it is clear that their activities can be financed from the allocation for the present year without any reduction in services.  In an article in today's edition of <i>The Cork Examiner</i>, under the heading &ldquo;Taxi Service for Sick being Abused&rdquo; it is stated in relation to the cost of taxi and ambulance services that the board's CEO said in his report that this cost was running at about £250,000 per year and that he was satisfied that it was subject to abuse.  Since this situation of abuses was known to every member of the health board, and perhaps to almost every member of the public in the area, was it not time in the public interest that there be some cutting down on expenditure in Counties Cork and Kerry of the £250,000 on ambulance and taxi services? The reaction I got in my own area was that it was time something was done in this regard.  At about <Col N="1066" /> 3 o'clock this afternoon I communicated by telephone with the CEO and he assured me that yesterday he gave a personal guarantee to members of the board that no suffering or hardship will be caused by this cutting back in so far as special categories of patients, such as the mentally handicapped or geriatrics, are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  I am sure that this CEO, who expressed so much compassion for the mentally handicapped, will look after the physically handicapped, too.  I am anxious to ensure that any cut-backs that are necessary will be effected only in the areas where they can do least damage. Also, at yesterday's meeting of the Southern Health Board the CEO guaranteed that there would be no redundancies in the hospital services as they existed in 1975 and as they exist now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to refer to the importance of the health services with regard to drugs and in this connection I shall refer to the Southern <Col N="1067" /> Health Board because that is the area with which I am most familiar.  I quote from <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of today's date part of an article under the heading &ldquo;Taxi service for sick being abused&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A lady member...told yesterday's meeting of the Southern Health Board in Cork that she had been told by a chemist that £500 worth of drugs had gone into one home,...</P>
      <P>The ex-chairman of the Southern Health Board, Mr. Vincent O'Connell, said that drugs were being used in that part of the country like fresh air. Is there any reason why an administration should not take notice of those facts and set about eliminating the abuses and effecting economies?</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that in the last three years there has been standardisation with regard to eligibility for medical cards and this is a step in the right direction.  There has been a scheme providing assistance towards the cost of drugs, the payment of monthly allowances for domi-cilary care of handicapped children has been introduced and there has been an extension of the scheme with regard to long-term illness.  Allowances for disabled persons have been introduced also.  All of these benefits have brought about a tremendous improvement in the services available for the unfortunate people we are talking about this evening.  The total amount of non-capital expenditure for 1972-73 was £107 million approximately but this year the figure was £242.48 million.  Even allowing for inflation that represents a substantial growth in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each Department of State, including the Department of Health, were asked in this difficult year to effect economies where they would least hurt.  It is true to say that in this endeavour all the health boards and their administrative staffs are making a genuine effort to constrain public expenditure.  In my official capacity as Parliamentary Secretary in the last month I met three of the eight CEOs of the health boards and I discussed this subject with them. Each of the three members said to me <Col N="1068" /> that while they would much prefer to have more money, like all of us, they felt they could run their boards on the allocations they got from the Department without any severe hardship to anyone, especially the underprivileged.</P>
    <P>The House will agree at this time it is reasonable to ask for a tighter kind of housekeeping.  I appeal to Deputies, particularly those who are members of health boards, to support the boards in their efforts this year to obtain the best value in the administration of the boards.  The Minister, his Department or officials in the health boards do not accept with any pleasure the fact that they will have to do with less but it may be a good thing for all of us to stop and think.  I am convinced that if we do this we will find that the effort will be worth while and that there will be very little hardship caused.  My hope is that the underprivileged and the less fortunate will not suffer as a result of the economies that, unfortunately, must be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the seven years since I was Minister for Health I did not intervene in a debate on this subject but left it to my successors to do their best in a difficult job.  I agree with much of what was said on both sides, by Deputy Haughey in his very able speech and by the Parliamentary Secretary in his most useful contribution.</P>
      <P>I want to say that what I shall offer now is intended to be helpful and, in so far as it will be critical, I hope it will be critical in the best meaning of that word.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave figures for the increase in the cost of the health services in recent years. These show that in 1970-71 the cost was £43 million, increasing to £52 million, £63 million, £96 million, £102 million&mdash;that latter figure was from April to December, 1974, when the change in the fiscal year was made&mdash;£207 million for 1975, which is provisional, and an estimated £242 million for 1976.  I have left out in all these figures the odd money though this year's odd money is £483,000 which would be very helpful indeed if it were pumped directly into some service in aid of the needy, the poor and the handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> I agree with Deputy Haughey that the figures themselves are not all that relevant.  What is relevant is the basic question as to whether today there is an improvement commensurate with the multiplication by six of the cost of the service in the past six or seven years.  My last yearly estimated cost of the service was £24 million and that ultimately worked out at £26 million. Where I do not agree with the Parliamentary Secretary is with his statement that the service has been improved commensurate with that enormous increase in cost.  I congratulate all those responsible for any improvement whatever in the service in recent years and there have been very considerable improvements and obviously the most important improvement was the change, a change with which all of us agreed, from the old poor law system to the choice of doctor and chemist and so forth.</P>
    <P>I do not accept for a moment that the people are receiving from the health services anything at all commensurate with this vast multiplication in cost and, while I sympathise and agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that there is a great deal of abuse by some doctors, by many patients and so on, of the new services, and here is where I agree with Deputy Haughey, I think this has passed from the Department and the Government and this Dáil with the enormous salaries that are now being paid to the vast array of bureaucrats throughout the country in so many different health boards.  How can you explain a situation in Cork or anywhere else where the taxi service had to be withdrawn, curtailed or cut down?  How could that possibly be? How do you pay vast salaries to people who are not able to control a taxi service for those going from their homes to hospitals?  What are these people for?  By what justification are we extracting vast sums from the populace and still these people on a health board are incapable of runing a taxi service for someone unfit to travel by himself?  That is the question I ask the Minister for Health and his Parliamentary Secretary.  I say, and I am sure I am absolutely right, that <Col N="1070" /> what is gobbling up most of the money is the vast increase in salaries and wages for bureaucrats fed on a mountain of paper which is driving the doctors, the chemists and the ordinary citizens&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;into psychiatric homes.  If this Government or some subsequent Government are not able to tackle this situation then Deputy Haughey's dream and all our dreams that we would be able to cater for all our poor, all our mentally and physically handicapped and all our old people inside or outside institutions will forever disappear.  I am not saying that I blame the Minister for all these developments.  He inherited some of his problems from his immediate predecessor.  I do, however, blame him for attempting to provide free hospitalisation for everybody without having the necessary consultation with those who were supposed to provide that service, in circumstances where even the most bigoted must have been able to see that even the alleged beneficiaries did not want it and do not want it now.  Here again I profoundly agree with what Deputy Haughey said about socialistic theories.  It is quite ludicrous to hear Deputy O'Connell trying in an aside to justify the removal of the medical cards from old age pensioners.  <i>Plus ca change plus ca même chose.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care whether the Deputy answers me or not. What I am offering here tonight for the first time in seven years is intended to be helpful.  I am not interested in attacking Deputy O'Connell or anybody else.  I have neved done so and I do not intend to do it now.  I am trying to offer to the House what I hope are helpful suggestions.  They are not meant to be personal to anybody here.  I repeat that the Minister made a mistake in trying to force a free hospitalisation service without the necessary consultation and ultimately he had to recognise it was a mistake. I hope he and all his successors will <Col N="1071" /> continue to realise it will continue to be a mistake and also realise that in Government what appear to be fanciful socialistic theories do not actually work out in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth is the hospital system is on the verge of breaking down.  Perhaps this is the appropriate time to express my own deep disappointment but in all the years since 1969 no real progress at all has been made in the rationalisation of the hospital structure. There used to be 29 acute hospitals in the city of Dublin.  I do not know whether it is 29 or 28 now, or what it is.  What I do know is that there are far too many.  I also know the Minister's predecessor dumped the FitzGerald Report into the nearest wastepaper basket on his arrival in the Custom House.  He was a curious man.  He could not persuade himself to take an interest in anything that he himself had not invented.  It was a tragedy.  The present Minister has also rejected the FitzGerald Report.  The basis of his rejection is, I think, mainly founded on the fact that the report was compiled by consultants and therefore did not sufficiently reflect the feelings of the GPs and other medics of intermediate level.  I do not accept that as valid or fair criticism. I sympathise with all the doctors, whatever stage of eminence each of them individually reached or had reached at the time, for the hard work they put into the making of that report, only to find it summarily and comprehensively rejected by two successive Ministers for Health.  The Minister's new proposal has not succeeded in doing anything more than creating further unnecessary division, dispute and debate at a time when the rationalisation of our hospitals structure is even more urgent and necessary than ever it was.  Why?  There is no question or doubt but that this country cannot sustain the number of so called acute treatment hospitals in existence today.  Unless steps are taken very rapidly to take the present situation by the throat, then the hospital system is going to break down in the very near future.  The fact that so many abuses occurred and are still occurring and the fact that the health <Col N="1072" /> boards appear to be incapable of dealing with these local abuses, seem to justify at this stage a re-examination of the operation of the Health Act which I introduced and which my successors brought to fruition.</P>
    <P>A committee of this House should be set up to re-examine the functioning of the eight health boards at present. Their terms of reference would be very easy to devise.  The first term of reference would be to avoid unnecessary administrative waste.  The second term of reference would be to avoid operational waste, and the third would be to take very strong steps against those who are abusing what we in this House made possible for the best of reasons.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have had a lot of talk about alcoholism.  The unfortunate Minister for Health at present, as a result of the activities of an erstwhile quondam shadow Minister for Health, will wind up having to provide accommodation for vast numbers of other erstwhile pint drinkers who will be suffering from psychological disturbances because the pint has been put past the capacity of the working man's pay.  They will probably wind up in a psychotic state for which the Minister for Health will have to pay.  It will indeed be a fine tribute to the combination of a former shadow Minister for Health now masquerading as a Minister for Finance.  It seems a curious by-product of the marriage of people who seven or eight years ago violently disagreed in particular about how the health services should be financed and what should or should not be provided.</P>
    <P>I congratulate all concerned in the old health authorities and in the new health boards for any improvements that have been effected in the service in recent years.  I deeply regret that six times the amount of money spent in 1970-71, which is only over five years ago, has not shown anything at all commensurate in the way of improvement for the people the health services are intended to serve.  I believe that the blame for that in the last two years rests basically on the <Col N="1073" /> shoulders of this Government, not especially the Minister for Health.  It is the by-product of a misguided overall policy, including, as Deputy Haughey said, no clear understanding of the country's real priorities and what appeared to me many times to be an unthinking rushing forward into expenditure for the sake of expenditure. A profligate who is using his own money eventually goes broke.  Even a Government profligate using the people's money will eventually find that the people are broke. This year's budget showed that this Government had come to that stage in their overall situation.  What has been happening in the last three or four months in the health service field proves that it is happening there as well.  It is a sad thing and something that should not have happened.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister for Health in the problems that have resulted from the Government's overall failure, but I also think it is time that he and his Department set up the committee which I mentioned a few minutes ago to re-examine the entire structure of the health boards. I say that, having been the Minister for Health at the time the legislation was prepared to create these boards in the first instance.  If the present rate of expenditure goes on for the benefit of other than those who ought to be the recipients, then the whole service will roll backwards, not forwards, and then, at an even greater cost, we will be providing progressively less and less for the people who need the health service.</P>

      <P>I was impressed listening to Deputy Flanagan, and it is regrettable that we do not hear him more often on a matter on which he feels so strongly and deeply.  Since he has now broken his silence we may have many contributions from him in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that he has proposed that an all-party committee be set up. I asked the Minister in this House many months ago if he would consider setting up such a committee to consider the whole structure of the health services and how we might re-organise these health boards.  The <Col N="1074" /> Minister's answer was, &ldquo;How do you unscramble a scrambled egg?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have a situation which is very difficult in terms of money available for the health services.  I do not know whether this has resulted from a shortage of money or the information to the health boards as to what was available, or trying to delude people that no money was available, or to general confusion about cutting back.  It must be obvious to all that we cannot have unlimited money available for the health services, and Deputy Flanagan said what I had proposed to say: money does not necessarily bring health.  You can spend many millions on the health services, but who is reaping the rewards of this money?  Is it the patients, the people who need health? No, it is not.  I wonder if the elected representatives on the health board have sufficient power to see that the spending of the money is properly supervised.  We have heard the rumours and seen the panic situation that has arisen.  Major cutbacks, as I know them, affect patients and doctors.  I have not seen yet one cutback in the administrative end of the health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but not at the top.  We have created cumbersome monsters, and with due respect to Deputy Flanagan, it is unfortunate that it was he who brought in this structure, this McKinsey report, because it has succeeded only in producing top-heavy administrative bodies which are sucking away like parasites at the money being shovelled in from the Department of Health. In no area whatsoever at top administrative level has any effort been made to economise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a threat to St. Loman's hospital that the whole lot will close down.  This fear and panic among people and patients as to what will happen is regrettable.  I asked the Minister a week or two ago if he would consider calling in the CEOs and having full-length discussions with them on what the situation is and where economies can be effected <Col N="1075" /> without impairing the health service with regard to the patients and those who treat them directly.  As I see it, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the main economies are in the community health care services such as meals on wheels and disabled persons maintenance allowance.  This is the area that needs more and more money to enable it to function properly.  I had a person up to me last night disabled and unfit for work.  He had been told, &ldquo;You qualify but we are sorry there is no money to pay you.&rdquo; I have written to the Minister about that because this is the area where cutbacks are taking place affecting the ordinary poor persons. He cannot have the disabled persons maintenance allowance.  He is disabled.  They said, &ldquo;You are qualified. A doctor has examined you; you qualify all right as a disabled person; but we have no money to pay you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is this the situation we as legislators are going to permit to continue, with these cumbersome bodies deciding everything at an administrative level, very top-heavy, with these massive salaries which Deputy Flanagan has adverted to?  Should we allow it to continue any longer or should we take the matter in hands and set up an all party committee and see how we can restructure this and bring it back to its own level?  I asked the Minister to consider a cost-benefit analysis of the health boards and how they are functioning, and the cost <i>vis-à-vis</i> the old local health authority at county council level.  This should have been done a long time ago.  It is a pity we should have been forced into a situation like this at this short notice, when already two months of the year have gone by, and we will see more than 6 to 7 per cent cutback as told to us in the Eastern Health Board.  You will see a 12 to 15 per cent cutback because the cutbacks are not beginning to take effect until April.  This is where the cutbacks are much more serious with more serious repercussions.</P>
    <P>There may be isolated cases of abuse.  I would refer to the Parliamentary Secretary's remark about the tax. He said it was subject to abuse, but everything is.  Unemployment benefit <Col N="1076" /> and social welfare disability benefits are subject to abuse; but &ldquo;subject to abuse&rdquo; and massive abuse are two completely different things.  We talk about abuse of drugs.  Of course there is abuse of drugs.  I can keep patients out of hospital by putting them on the necessary expensive drugs.  Which am I to do?  Am I to say &ldquo;No, cut down on that, and I will have you admitted to hospital&rdquo;?  I was faced with that problem yesterday morning.  Should I prescribe the expensive drug for that patient?  I found that my prescribing happens to be above the normal but I keep that patient out of hospital.  Is it better to spend £5 on a patient for a drug or let the State pay £140 for his bed for a week?  These are the problems we face.  One asks oneself which is better for the patient and which is better for the State.  I say to patients, &ldquo;You cannot have this and you cannot have that because it is costing too much&rdquo;.  These are the facts we have to consider when we talk about abuse.</P>
    <P>I never come into problems about over-visiting.  However doctors are in fear of the bodies that investigate them for over-visiting.  I would ask the Department to ask the health boards to educate the public on the system of calling doctors.  Doctors go, not because they want to abuse the service, but if they refuse a patient that patient may die or anything may happen. The Minister for Health is not going to appear in the court and say &ldquo;I ordered the doctors not to visit&rdquo;. This is the problem when the doctor must give the benefit of the doubt.  He may feel that the patient is overanxious and should not need a visit, but he has to say to himself, &ldquo;It could be a coronary&rdquo;, if for instance the patient complains of pain in his chest.  Is the doctor to say, &ldquo;You are visiting me too often, I cannot see you but I can call out to see you&rdquo;? The doctor has to make up his mind about this, but he cannot take the responsibility of saying, &ldquo;I am sorry, I must cutback.  I cannot go and visit you&rdquo;.  That patient dies, and who takes the blame?</P>
    <P>These are points to bear in mind when talking about economies in the health service.  It is not good <Col N="1077" /> enough to say that we must have economies at that level.  We cannot have them.  The Minister should be saying: &ldquo;We must in the health service at the level of the community pour money into that service.&rdquo; It is a real investment in the health service if you pour the money in there.  This is where they should call in the CEOs and tell them &ldquo;I want the money poured into that area, because if you do that you will be reducing the cost of the health services in this country&rdquo;. That is what we should be aiming to do.</P>
    <P>I was interested in a point made by Deputy Haughey.  He said we as backbenchers must consider what we are going to do to help the health service. His argument had much merit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm, a Cheann Comhairle, gur thug tú cead dom an cheist seo a phlé anocht.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh mé in ann í a chur os cómhair an Tí go deimhneach agus go cruinn.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I hope I shall have something definite to say on the matter of the two-thirds grant towards the cost of bicycles for school-children.  First of all, I should like to relate how this matter came to my notice.  The scheme was in the Department's archives since 1966 and this is where my worry comes in.  It relates to a seven-year-old girl whose local national school was closed and she was transferred to another school. Automatically she would have been entitled to free school transport, but for various reasons she did not get it.  Various offers were made, none of which could be considered satisfactory, the result being that the child was out of school for a long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope those responsible for this will be able to face up to it.  Eventually in this case, the scheme for the payment of two-thirds grants came to <Col N="1078" /> light in the Department but naturally the parents of the child did not consider this form of transport suitable for a seven-year-old.  My feeling about such cases is that the Administration find themselves dreadfully short of money and they are welching on their responsibility to provide adequate suitable transport for school-going children who qualify.  I hope that this bicycle grant scheme, now that it has come to light, will not be abused, that it will not be used as some form of substandard transport. I hope that scheme will only complement and supplement but not substitute or replace suitable adequate school transport services.</P>
    <P>As I said, this bicycle grant scheme apparently originated in the Department in 1966 and on 18th February last I asked the Minister for Education the amount of money paid by way of grants towards the cost of bicycles for school-children eligible for free school transport and the number of pupils so facilitated.  The Minister replied that grants had been offered in a number of cases but only one such offer had been accepted in recent years.  In that case, in September, 1972, three children in one family were involved and the grant towards the cost of three bicycles amounted to £59.33.  I then asked the Minister when this scheme was introduced&mdash;had it been introduced with the free transport scheme?  The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>If the Deputy asks me that question on another ocasion, I will answer it.</P>
    <P>On 25th February I had another question on the Order Paper and the answer was given by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I asked him if his reply meant that where the number of eligible children did not constitute a bus quota the children involved would not be offered the two-thirds grant towards the cost of a bicycle. He replied:</P>
    <P>They would be considered for that grant if they are eligible for transport and apply for the grant.</P>
    <P>That is precisely my complaint: how could people apply for the grant if <Col N="1079" /> they were not aware it was available? What efforts have been made to publicise the scheme?  How has it come about that since the scheme was introduced only one family availed of it? I asked these questions of the Minister on 18th February last and his reply was:</P>
    <P>I take it this exchange will draw the attention of the public to it.</P>
    <P>What kind of reply is that to give? The Minister is responsible for seeing such schemes are brought to the attention of deserving families.  How could people apply for something they did not know existed?  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not consider it rude of me if I ask him whether he or the Minister were aware of the existence of this scheme prior to my raising it on behalf of one of my constituents. I hope the Department will arrange sufficient publicity for this scheme to allow people to apply for the grants.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will bear the safety factor in mind when considering this matter.  Most of the children involved live in remote areas and although the roads they would have to travel on are comparatively quiet they must use them at a time when motorists are travelling to work.  The age of the pupils who qualify for this grant should also be considered.  Their safety is an important aspect.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the efforts to economise and rationalise, efforts which are causing a great deal of concern to people adjacent to me, this scheme will not be offered by way of a substitute. I hope it will be used as a last resort and after all avenues have been explored.  I hope we will not see a further rush or rationalisation in the Department with children attending certain schools being told that they must leave that school and avail of the transport to another school.  Continuity in education is most important and the wishes of the parents should also be considered.  I hope officials of the Department will not tell children who are attending a school 2.6 miles from them that they must attend a school which is 2.4 miles from them.  This is <Col N="1080" /> happening at present.  I should also like to know if this scheme is available to pupils attending secondary schools.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure the Deputy that great attention will be paid to the safety factor when considering applications for grants under the scheme in question.  I realise that with very young children on dangerous roads there could be problems.  I realise that using a bicycle requires a certain degree of motoring ability which very young children do not have.  The Deputy seemed to suggest that we would use this scheme as a means of economising on school transport but I should like to assure him that nothing could be further from the truth.  It is not our wish to avoid carrying out our duty to provide school transport for those eligible pupils.  The Deputy raised the question of the grants for bicycles.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  I should like to tell the Deputy that this grant does not apply to pupils attending secondary schools.  Where transport cannot be provided within the normal terms of the scheme, because the children are so isolated that there is not a sufficient number to establish a service, there is in existence for second level pupils&mdash;it does not exist at first level&mdash;the possibility of offering a boarding grant.  That is the course we would follow in such cases. I should like to draw the attention of the Deputy to the circumstances in which this scheme may be brought into operation.  I indicated those circumstances in the course of a reply I gave to a question on Wednesday, 25th February.  I said then that under the scheme grants towards the cost of bicycles are offered to children living in isolated areas where the nearest national school is a considerable distance away and where it is not possible or it is too costly to offer alternative transport facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> We have been operating that scheme in accordance with those fairly narrow terms of reference in cases where the school is a considerable distance away and where children are living in isolated areas.  We have operated the scheme in the past three years in exactly the same way as it was operated by my predecessors.  The Deputy raised the question of publicity for the scheme. In the normal way when a scheme is initiated it is given publicity.  This scheme was introduced in 1966 and I did not have any responsibility for the publicity given to its introduction but the Department adopted the practice of bringing the terms of the scheme to the notice of parents where it was considered appropriate.  The scheme was offered on an individual basis in the light of the circumstances prevailing. The Deputy urged that the scheme be used as a last resort and where school transport could not be provided.  I should like to assure him that that has been the practice.  We will not be seeking to use the bicycle grant scheme as a means of depriving children of getting transport.  However, if we were to be too free in bringing forward the bicycle grant scheme it could have the effect of depriving children subsequently of the entitlement to school transport.</P>
    <P>I should like to give an example which would illustrate this.  If we had a situation where there were seven or eight children in an area eligible for transport they would not qualify for that transport, because as the House is aware, a service can only be established if there are ten children.  However, in many such cases there would be a reasonable prospect that next year, or the year after, young children would be coming on to bring that number up to ten.</P>
    <P>If we were to step in in these cases and, by publicity, seek to encourage some of the children to take bicycle grants and, say, four of them accepted it and the others did not, those four who accepted the bicycle grant would <i>ipso facto</i> rule themselves out for subsequent consideration for free school <Col N="1082" /> transport.  By that act they would also rule out the children who might otherwise be eligible for school transport subsequently.  They would reduce the numbers, and in the following year when maybe there was a total of ten eligible children available and in the normal way a school transport service could have been established, it could not be established because those four children had opted out and accepted a bicycle grant.</P>
    <P>There are definite limitations on any excessive promotion of the scheme, because it could in these circumstances&mdash;and these circumstances would not be uncommon&mdash;have the effect of jeopardising not only the prospects of those children themselves of getting school transport but also the prospects of other children in the immediate locality.  Therefore, I think the Deputy will accept the practice adopted by the Department as being the correct one, namely, of offering the scheme, as he himself said, as a last resort as and when we felt it was the only appropriate means of coping with a particular case.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare why injury benefit and pay-related benefit have not been paid to a person (details supplied) in County Laois even though he has been claiming since 6th January, 1976; and why he was paid less than £20 injury benefit over a three-week period of injury in November/ December 1975.</P>

      <P>The person in question claimed injury benefit in respect of a head injury sustained in the course of his employment on 4th December, 1975.  He submitted two medical certificates, dated 4th and 11th December, 1975, respectively, and he was paid injury benefit at the appropriate rate of £13.80 per week in respect of the period 8th to 11th December, 1975.  Injury benefit is not payable in respect of the first three days of incapacity unless the insured person is, as a result of the injury, incapable of work on not less than 12 days in the injury benefit period and pay-related benefit is payable only from the thirteenth day of incapacity.</P>
      <P>On 27th January, 1976, a medical certificate, dated 13th January, in respect of incapacity from a wound on his right hand was received from the person concerned.  There was no indication that this incapacity was due to, or connected with, the accident on 4th December, 1975.  Disability benefit was awarded to him and is still in payment.</P>
      <P>The insured person did not furnish his PAYE number in connection with either of his claims, although asked to do so.  His entitlement to pay-related benefit with disability benefit cannot be determined until that number or a certificate from his employer of his earnings in the income-tax year ended 5th April, 1974, is furnished.</P>
