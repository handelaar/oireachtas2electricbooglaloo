      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last evening I was making the point that it was very difficult to know what Fianna Fáil wanted with regard to social welfare.  I might add that it was extremely difficult to know what they wanted with regard to most things in the last few years, but I find it baffling to know what precisely they want in the matter of social welfare in particular. The contradictions in their attitude towards this area justify anyone being confused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of this debate a number of Fianna Fáil speakers said that the increase of 10 per cent is inadequate and that it should be much more.  On the other hand we must consider their obstructive opposition in the last three years to the introduction into our taxation code of measures with regard to wealth tax, capital acquisitions tax and other forms of taxation.  We must also bear in mind their attitude towards the adjustment in the agreement with the mining companies. <Col N="140" /> Their leading spokesmen have called for cutbacks in expenditure on social welfare; on some occasions the amount involved is £20 million and on other occasions it is as high as £30 million.  Yet, they come to this House and claim that the 10 per cent increase provided under the terms of this Bill is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil claim that monetary payments in the area of social welfare are inadequate.  According to some Fianna Fáil Deputies, people in receipt of social welfare are less well off now than they were when Fianna Fáil were in Government.</P>
    <P>One can understand any Opposition trying to make a case or pointing out various good things they were responsible for while in government.  One can also understand them pointing out any weaknesses in the performance of the Government of the day.  That is legitimate and acceptable but total distortion and total resistance to face up to the realities of the situation is not helpful.  I do not mean that it is not helpful to the Government; it is not helpful to the Opposition because the public are not fools.  Obviously, Fianna Fáil think the people are fools when they make statements to the effect that monetarily speaking people were better off under Fianna Fáil than they are under this Government as far as social welfare payments are concerned.</P>
    <P>I have given the facts on many occasions but they do not appear to have penetrated to some of the Fianna Fáil Members.  Since 1973 the cost of living has gone up approximately 52 per cent and the payments in social welfare have gone up, on the lowest percentage scale, by 96 per cent and on the upper scale by 120 per cent.  Children's allowances have been increased by 360 per cent since this Government took office.  They are the facts but a more significant fact and one which shows a true picture is in regard to the shift in emphasis from Fianna Fáil policy in relation to the percentage of our GNP that is now being spent in the area of social welfore. When Fianna Fáil left office the proportion of GNP spent on social welfare by them was 6¼ per cent.  The percentage of GNP being spent on <Col N="141" /> social welfare now is 11.  That is the true reflection; it is the true yardstick and criterion by which one can judge and compare the commitment in this area of Fianna Fáil and that of this Government.  That is redistribution in real terms.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies were interested in this matter and showed a knowledge of, and concern for social welfare.  I refer to Deputies Callanan, Faulkner and Andrews but, unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the other contributions that came from the Fianna Fáil benches.  Deputy Faulkner, in a serious way, thought there was a failure to understand the exact nature of the work of the poverty committee.  I do not know why there should be a failure to understand the work these people are engaged in because a booklet issued by them setting out precisely their aims and the progress they hope to achieve was given to every Member.  I do not know how successful this committee will be in their work but I have confidence in them.  They are engaged in four projects.  A lot of preparatory work has gone into these projects at home and through the EEC.  Due to Irish initiative in this field 25 projects are being undertaken in the nine member states under the auspices of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputies that as far as the director and commitee are concerned they would welcome any interest shown by Members or any approach for information by Members. Like most Deputies, my reaction to poverty is a gut one.  I see what it leads to.  I see the end result but I am no expert in this field.  I have no training in any of the disciplines necessary to evolve proper policies or implement procedures which will help in the eradication of this social evil from our society.  However, the members of the poverty committee have great experience in this field.  Over the years they stood out as individuals who were concerned and active in the campaign against poverty.  They are now supported in their work by a properly trained staff who assist them in undertaking various projects.  I have great hope for the work in which they are engaged and I can assure <Col N="142" /> everybody that the committee would welcome any queries and engage in any discussion about this problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan and other Deputies raised the question of the farmer's dole and the assessment of the farmer's dole.  I personally think that this step to curtail the payment made under that scheme is one that was long overdue.  It was done under the terms of this Bill in a way that will ensure that persons in the farming community who need this kind of financial support will continue to get that support and that persons who are not entitled to that support, by any stretch of the imagination, are debarred under the new method of assessment from getting it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan and, indeed, Deputy Martin Finn, who are both rural Deputies from the west of Ireland, said that under the scheme the method of assessment could lead to persons who are not entitled to it getting it in some cases and to persons who would be entitled to it not getting it.  That is quite possible.  This is the first time since 1966, since the introduction of the scheme, that any adjustment of the method of assessment has been made and it is quite possible that there may be flaws in its administration.  This method of assessment, like any other scheme operated by the Department, will be kept under review.  What we are determined to do is to ensure that persons who need this kind of help and who by virtue of their needs are entitled to it continue to get it.  We are also concerned to ensure that persons who do not need it do not get it.</P>
    <P>If there are persons who are affected by the change, if there are small farmers from whom something has been taken because of their valuations under the operation of the scheme there is nothing to debar them from making application for assessment, as happens in the case of any other recipient, and there is provision which will allow the Minister for Social Welfare in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to exercise powers which exist under the 1965 Act to enable a factual assessment to be made in <Col N="143" /> these cases.  So, there is no danger of any small farmer who feels that he has been unjustly affected by the introduction of this new assessment being left without a remedy.</P>
    <P>The number that has been affected is very small&mdash;5,000&mdash;but 18,000 small farmers are still being paid and not only are they being paid but they will enjoy the increases provided for under the terms of this Bill.  In addition to those 18,000, there is a number in the region of 7,000 who qualify under a factual assessment.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the stamping of cards by employers and also the question of general abuses under the social welfare code.  I said before and I maintain that the number of abuses, whether it is by employers failing to stamp cards or by persons claiming benefits to which they are not legally entitled, is relatively small and if you take the expenditure of £430 million this year on social welfare the amount of money that goes astray in this way is also relatively small.  That does not make abuses any less serious or any more acceptable.  I cannot think of any graver form of anti-social behaviour than that engaged in either by employers who refuse to live up to their obligation to stamp cards, in respect of which, incidentally, they have collected the money from the employee, or by persons claiming and getting benefits to which they are not legally entitled.  The seriousness of it is more in the resistance that this type of behaviour builds up among the general public to proper progress being made in the field of social welfare and we have a long way to go in this area as yet.</P>
    <P>Although the number of persons who engage in this type of activity is relatively small, when an abuse is discovered the media build it up as big as they can.  It makes good reading.  It is spoken about and built up out of all proportion and a type of resentment and resistance among the general public can be and to some extent has been built up by the highlighting of these isolated <Col N="144" /> cases.  That is where I see the dangers of the anti-social behaviour that these persons engage in and within a very short period of time a Bill will be introduced for consideration by the House that will increase very substantially the penalties for persons who engage in this kind of activity and are found by the courts to have engaged in this kind of activity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.  We would welcome it.  The Parliamentary Secretary will get our support on it, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy. I hope, not that persons will be caught under the provisions of this new Bill, but that the fact that the Bill comes into law will be a deterrent to those participating in this kind of activity.  I said a moment ago it is possible to build up a case of employers not stamping cards though the cases are actually fairly isolated. The media are inclined to generalise about people drawing &ldquo;the labour&rdquo; and working at the same time. It is unfortunate the media do not give the same publicity to the prosecutions in respect of such offences.  Last year alone there were round about 500 prosecutions against people drawing social welfare illegally.  Very little publicity was given to those cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>How many of the prosecutions succeeded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got those figures but approximately 500 cases were initiated.  The maximum penalties under existing law were drawn up at a time when the level of social welfare benefit was much lower and when the cost of the stamp was much lower and it would now appear that there is an increasing tendency towards believing that the game is worth the candle and, if one can &ldquo;do&rdquo; the social welfare people, it is worth while financially.  Under the provisions of a Bill we will be introducing shortly that kind of thinking will go out of fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> One of the things I was happy to hear from a number of Deputies&mdash; Deputy Callanan, Deputy Andrews, Deputy Faulkner, Deputy O'Connell and some others&mdash;was that, as a result of their contact with their constituents through their political clinics, they had no doubt in the world but that the vast majority of those who were unemployed were not only prepared but anxious to resume work.  It is extremely important that politicians who know the facts should avail of every opportunity to get that important truth home to the public because there is a tendency among a certain section to regard the unemployed man as a layabout and as an enemy of society instead of recognising that he is actually a victim of society and not an enemy of it.  Deputy Faulkner told us about one particular case in his constituency where a man, with small children, after years of gainful employment found himself unemployed and for five weeks that man left his home at the same time each morning to create the impression among his children that he was still employed.  He went out looking for work and he returned at what would be the normal time for his return from work in the evening.  He wanted to hide from his children the fact that he was unemployed.  Think of all the implications behind that story as told by Deputy Faulkner.  This man had a feeling of shame or a feeling of guilt because he was unemployed and he wanted to hide that shame and guilt from his children.  It is a marvellous insight into the effect of forced unemployment on a man.  It demonstrates the psychological effect forced unemployment can have on a man.  There are thousands like this man with a sense of failure.  As I said, this man was not guilty.  He was the victim of our society and he should be recognised as a victim and treated as such.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest social evils&mdash; God knows, we still have a great many in our society&mdash;is unemployment and anything we can do to create a society with full employment should be done.  We have an obligation to ensure that anything that can <Col N="146" /> be done to create full employment must be done.</P>
    <P>Unemployment, which I regard as the greatest social evil in our society, was not discovered by this Coalition Government and I find it a little hard to take when I hear Fianna Fáil speakers talk about unemployment and unemployment figures as if people had never before heard or experienced unemployment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Parliamentary Secretary will go through it again. The unemployment figures have never been so great.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go through it again because it has obviously not registered. The figures for unemployment are undoubtedly frightening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>They are undoubtedly causing a great deal of anxiety and emotional stress and, in some cases, financial difficulties, but let us put it into proper perspective.  Deputy Andrews told me that it is only during Coalitions apparently we have unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are not my exact words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are the greatest indictment of our society and of the way we approach this matter of employment and unemployment. We have approximately 116,000 unemployed now.  In January, 1973, the registered figure for unemployment was 76,000 and in February, 1973, there was a general election and in the three weeks' campaign of that general election unemployment was not even an issue.  That is the greatest indictment of all as regards our attitude to unemployment.  A figure of 76,000 unemployed, 6 to 7 per cent, was such an acceptable figure and so taken for granted that it was not a major issue in the general election. Law and order was a major issue, <Col N="147" /> prices were an issue, and half way through the campaign rates became an issue.</P>

      <P>I did not mention&mdash; and I am glad the Deputy has brought it to my mind&mdash;the 30,000 that were emigrating every year up to the middle sixties, and if you add the two together, the 76,000 registered unemployed and the 30,000 emigrating&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only stating facts and they can be verified.  The unemployment figures for January, 1973, are available to anybody.  There were 30,000 emigrating per year up to the middle sixties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <P>I am not playing down the seriousness of it not only for the individuals concerned but for society and our economy as a whole. What I am doing is putting it into its proper perspective and reminding <Col N="148" /> Fianna Fáil, who apparently like to forget that there was ever unemployment in this country before the Coalition came into office, what the facts are, and not only about the numbers but that for 16 years of continuous Fianna Fáil rule, with a short three-year break, and for 16 years before that the numbers were acceptable.</P>

      <P>That is the most frightening aspect, that when every country in Europe, including the present members of the EEC, was experiencing full employment, in the middle forties, right through the fifties, with one short break, and right through the sixties, we had this acceptance level of 6 to 7 per cent.  Yet Fianna Fáil have the audacity to talk about unemployment as if it was a new discovery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The real crime is Fianna Fáil's attitude and their complacency that they could lull this nation into an acceptance of those figures as being normal.  They have drifted a long way from being what the people who supported them took them to be.  They have shifted their whole emphasis; in the early period of their party there was a social commitment, some kind of radical approach to the solution of some of our problems.  I am sad to say that they have now become the party of the privileged.  They are grouping around to latch on to a feeling of discontent among the more well-heeled members of our society.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick objected to the fact that the Department of Social Welfare were engaged in a campaign to ensure that people knew their entitlements under social welfare.  He went to great lengths objecting to advertisements being placed in the papers and to television being used to ensure that people who were entitled to social welfare payments knew of them.  In the course of his objections he went on to compare last year with this year.  He said that although we had engaged in a publicity campaign last year, we were not doing so this year because the increases offered were not in our favour.  According to him, it could be said that we were keeping a low profile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy Fitzpatrick, and any other Deputy who might be interested that there will be no departure from the policy which was initiated by the Coalition.  We will, as usual, engage in a campaign through the media to ensure as far as possible that people know their entitlements and how they can obtain them.  If Deputy Fitzpatrick had given this matter much thought&mdash;from the tone and content of his contribution he did not give much thought to any part of this Bill, so he did not discriminate <Col N="151" /> against this particular part &mdash;he would have realised that it was not possible for us to engage in such a campaign until the Bill became law. I can assure the House that when the Bill becomes law we will once again use the media to the maximum to ensure that the people entitled to benefits get them.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Deputies spoke about the 10 per cent increase but neglected another aspect&mdash;perhaps it did not appeal to them to highlight it too much.  As well as the 10 per cent increase provided under this Bill, there is also a very significant advance in the field of social welfare&mdash;to me probably the most significant section of the Bill&mdash;that is, an extension of three months in unemployment benefit not only in respect of pay related benefit but also of the flat rate benefit. I believe this is the first time since the introduction of this type of payment that the period of eligibility has been extended for the flat rate benefit. In my view, this is a very significant and progressive step in the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House much longer.  Deputy Dowling in his short contribution&mdash;the only reason it was short was that he let me in to conclude the debate&mdash;said that what was needed was an overall plan for social welfare.  I can assure the Deputy, as I have been trying to convey to the Deputies opposite, that we have an overall plan for social welfare and have been pursuing that plan consistently and, I am glad to say, successfully over the last three years. One of the most immediate and necessary objectives was to increase the payments under the social welfare code.  Everybody knows that the monetary payments made in that area when we took office were extremely low and clearly reflected, in my opinion, the low priority the Fianna Fáil Party in Government gave to this area of social welfare.  In the last three years we have managed to increase those benefits substantially.  I am not suggesting that they are adequate because they are not.  In many cases they have doubled and led to a substantial improvement in the real <Col N="152" /> living standards of the recipients.</P>
    <P>I do not feel there is any room for complacency about this aspect of social welfare but we should face up to facts as they are and acknowledge this achievement.  Social welfare has not, and will not, under this Government be treated as purely an income maintenance scheme.  There are many other things in the field of social welfare which still remain to be done, not only dealing with the amount of the payments but with the extent of the coverage.  That has been greatly improved by the removal of the income limit and by bringing into the code deserted wives, unmarried mothers, prisoners' dependants and so on.  There still remains a considerable amount to be done.  In 1973 we laid out a comprehensive plan.  We set our sights on where we wanted to go and we did not keep it a secret.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare in 1974 I spelled out in considerable detail what we hoped to achieve.  Any Deputy can find that speech on the records.  Anyone examining it will find that there has been substantial progress towards the attainment of the overall goal that we set ourselves. However, there is a considerable way to go.  There remains the question of the self-employed, for instance, who comprise approximately 31 per cent of our people and who are outside the social welfare code.  The fact that no provision has been made down through the years for this category has caused unnecessary hardship and difficulties in some cases.</P>
    <P>It is our belief that it is possible to attain all the aims that we set ourselves on coming into office.  Indeed, many of our objectives have been brought to fruition and many more are at an advanced stage of preparation. In the very near future there will be various proposals before the House in this area for consideration. As I said earlier, I had been finding it very difficult to know what Fianna Fáil want in the sphere of social welfare.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the new rates of benefit.  It indicates an increase of 10 per cent in the rate of social insurance benefit.  We are talking about people we hope would benefit most from their social welfare entitlements, people who contributed to the State during the years of their employment.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that due to the economic circumstances in which we are existing these people will receive a 10 per cent increase in their benefits.  Is it his intention to review the scale of the increased benefits before the end of the year?  A recent survey indicated that food costs had jumped by 7.1 per cent in the three months ending in February of this year.  This indicates that over a 12-month period food costs would increase by somewhere in the region of 29 per cent. This is the difficulty and the tragedy. The continuing rise in food costs is hurting those people who can least afford to pay them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people come to me looking for employment.  I say to them: &ldquo;Of course, I will do what I can for you.&rdquo; I write to the National Manpower Service who provide a very efficient service.  These people can only give what they have got.  The simple truth of the matter is that they have nothing to give in the context of employment. This morning I received five replies from the National Manpower Service indicating that they will send out a placement officer to see the five individuals who came to me looking for work last Saturday.  It is the same story every Saturday.  It is depressing <Col N="160" /> for the people who come to you, and it is depressing for you to try to explain to them why they cannot get work.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is absolutely right in saying people want to work.  They do not want to be out of work.  The fashionables who come out with the glib statement that people wish to be unemployed, or that those who are unemployed wish to remain unemployed, are not telling the truth.  That is not the reality of the situation.  People want the dignity of work.  They are prepared to work.  I will deal with that aspect on another section of the Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary might tell the House whether it is his intention to review the rate of increases in social welfare entitlement under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a thread of thought going through the minds of some individuals that we should not increase social welfare benefits, and that we should keep them in line with some vague cost of living figure.  I am speaking now about the necessaries of life: food, clothing, shoes, and the right of people to have a roof over their heads and warmth within the four walls.  These are the basic necessaries. I would remind the people who complain about increased social welfare benefits that these increased costs have to be met by people covered by the social welfare code.  If the increases are not sufficient to meet the huge cost increases on a daily basis, the social welfare code is not operating to the benefit of people who are in such need.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a difficulty. The economy is in a shambles.  There is no doubt about that.  Yesterday the Taoiseach talked about 3,000 new jobs.  I will believe in those 3,000 jobs when I see them.  I welcome the announcement.  If these jobs are for the benefit of people in Brav, or in the west of Ireland, or anywhere else, good luck to them.  The people want jobs.  They want factories.  They want work.  I would welcome foreign companies coming in here to provide the jobs which the Taoiseach announced yesterday.  It was an encouraging and <Col N="161" /> hopeful announcement which we hope will come to reality.  We hope there will not be an announcement in a year's time that it is not going to happen.</P>
    <P>This country is second to none in the context of the work force, the availability of an intelligent work force, the availability of people willing to work hard if given the opportunity. At the moment they are not being given that opportunity.  The Government have an obligation to see that, during this period of lack of opportunity, they are given some form of reasonable subsistence allowance.  We argue that the 10 per cent increase in the rate is not enough.  The simple truth of the matter is that the cost of living is increasing daily.  There is great hardship in a large number of families. Parents come to you on Saturday morning.  They are living on social insurance benefit.  They tell you they can only buy meat once a week, on Sunday, for their four or five children.  They are deprived because the father is out of work.  They can barely survive because of the cost of meat, the cost of butter, and so on.</P>
    <P>If you cannot buy butter you are told margarine is healthier, but there are different views on that.  People in any society should be entitled to buy a lb. of butter at a reasonable price. The price of butter is almost 10s. in old money, 50p per lb. in current coin. It is just not good enough.  These are the hardships that are being created. These are the new poor.  People are living in what would appear externally to be houses of reasonable accommodation. Go into the houses and ask them how they are living, how they are surviving.  Survival is about the proper word for it.  They are subsisting in many cases.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to seriously consider taking into account the dreadful rate of inflation which is afflicting the country.  It is hurting the country beyond measure and the Government do not seem to have any answer to it.  I appeal to the Government to tackle inflation and price increases as a matter of urgency.  These are two dreadful social evils, eroding evils, which are affecting the progress <Col N="162" /> of this country, and nothing appears to be done about them.</P>

      <P>Since 1973 the cost of living has increased by approximately 52 per cent but from the point of view of social welfare benefits the lowest percentage increase was 96 per cent and the highest 122 per cent.  I am excluding children's allowances which increased by 360 per cent. However, a more significant point is that the percentage of GNP spent on social welfare in 1973 when this Government took over was 6½ per cent while the percentage now is 11 per cent.  That is a very significant increase and it is a real achievement with regard to redistribution.</P>

      <P>Is Deputy Andrews showing that he is more politically sensitive than compassionately sensitive with regard to social welfare? The facts are there and they cannot be denied.  I have stated that I do not regard the levels of payments as adequate but very significant increases and progress has been made in three years.  It is not the haphazard &ldquo;hit it now, ignore it again&rdquo; approach to social welfare.  It is not done as it was done by Fianna Fáil, purely as an election gimmick which was the priority it had in Fianna Fáil thinking and in their secret policies.  We are achieving a consistent, progressive improvement in the area of social welfare.  I regret that inflation has taken from the real advances in the standard of living of social welfare recipients that I had hoped would be achieved by the monetary increases. Undoubtedly they have been diluted somewhat by the rate of inflation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>How can anyone reconcile the Deputy's statement about the increase not being sufficient with the call for a cut of £20 million to £30 million by the Opposition?  How can anyone reconcile his statement with the opposition displayed by Fianna Fáil in this House to wealth tax, capital acquisitions tax and a tax on the mines?  Any kind of progressive legislation allowing for development in this area has been opposed by Fianna Fáil.  They say the 10 per cent increase is not sufficient but in view of their own record where they requested a cutback in social welfare of £20 million to £30 million, how can they expect anyone to take them seriously?  After the budget the Tánaiste stated that this question would be reviewed later in the year and that will be done.  While it has not been possible to make the progress I had hoped could be made this year, it has been possible to safeguard the benefits that accrued to social welfare recipients.  We will continue to safeguard them during these difficult economic times and after that we will resume our rapid progress in the area of social welfare.  The Deputy may not like it politically but I can assure him that the people who depend on those benefits like it a lot.</P>

He says that they want more money for milk, butter, beef and for all kinds of farm produce.  Those two voices have been displayed by Deputy Andrews.  The city Deputy tells the people in the city that the farmers are getting away with murder and that the people in the city have to pay too much for milk, butter and meat.  At the same time, Deputies Callanan and Jim Gibbons tell the farming community that they are not getting enough for their produce.  Fianna Fáil cannot have it both ways.  We have had two policies on farm prices from Fianna Fáil, the city policy and the rural policy.</P>

      <P>Obviously, the Parliamentary Secretary does not know what section we are dealing with.  It is our contention that the increase of 10 per cent is not sufficient. The amount being granted has been completely eroded in advance. I should like to know if it is the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare to return to the House with a Bill providing for increases to keep pace with the rising cost of living.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary give that guarantee and undertaking?  Such a Bill is necessary to keep pace with the rampant inflation and the rapidly rising costs of the basic requirements of people.  People will have to be cushioned and protected against these increases.  There is not much point in providing for an increase of 10 per cent if that increase does not measure up to the increases in the price of the basic commodities people require.  An increase of 10 per cent is not sufficient. I am aware that the Parliamentary Secretary would like to provide further increases so that the advances made would not be eroded.  He told us that the increase has been eroded somewhat but it could have been eroded into the minus sector.  Every day one reads of increases in the basic items in the newspapers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but we are talking of increases in rates of periodical benefits.  I do not feel that in any context this can be seen as an increase, except in a statistical context but statistics alone are not satisfactory. If people could be fed on statistics they would be well off because we have gluts of them coming out daily from various agencies. Statistically, the Bill provides for an increase of 10 per cent but in practice it is not an increase.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us that after the recess he will introduce <Col N="167" /> a Bill which will provide for a further increase and show an actual improvement in the living standards of those in receipt of social welfare benefits. This could be done by way of a cash increase to these recipients.  We would welcome such a move and give it full support.</P>
      <P>Such a Bill is necessary because our people are suffering a lot due to inflation and uncontrolled price rises.  If one tries to broaden the terms &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; or &ldquo;increase&rdquo; into actual life one will see that there is no benefit or increase involved.</P>

      <P>This section provides for an increase of certain rates of unemployment benefit but the increases are, again, derisory.  A special class of person is provided for in this section: a person entitled to an increase in respect of a qualified child but not entitled to an increase in respect of an adult dependant will receive a weekly rate of £9.05 with an increase for a qualified child or for each of two qualified children of £2.75 and an increase for each qualified in excess of two of £2.10.  Naturally, we will not be opposing this measure although it is a paltry increase.  However, the mind boggles at the triumphant manner in which the Parliamentary Secretary spoke of his new schemes and so on.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> Again, they must be seen in the light of the current economic disaster in which the country finds itself. Make no mistake about it, we are in a very serious economic situation and people have to be given this type of increase in unemployment benefit. Unemployment benefit is something for which they paid during their working lives in order to secure a reasonable level of subsistence in a period of unemployment.  The contributions towards unemployment benefit were considered by workers to be a safeguard against a temporary period of unemployment.  The persons concerned did not think that they would be out of work for in some cases 18 months to two years and that there would be no prospect of employment for them and that payment of unemployment benefit would continue.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has stated and we have stated that entitlement to work is a civil right.  It is a right provided by the Constitution.  It is a right which should be protected and given by the Government.  It is not being given by the Government. Full-time employment is a civil right. Citizens who are entitled to it and who are looking for it are being denied a basic human right, the right to work.</P>

In the past two or three years the main topic of conversation of every section in our society has been unemployment benefit and the increases that would be made.  The fact that these measures are a lively topic of conversation is an indictment of the Government who have failed to provide jobs for the people.  I would prefer that people would talk in terms of jobs and job opportunities.  There is no point in anyone glorifying these increases.

      <P>This increase has been brought into line with the pay-related benefit.  Since the foundation of our party our philosophy has been that persons who have contributed towards unemployment benefit during a period of employment are entitled to unemployment benefit in a period of unemployment.  This section extends the period in respect of the payment of unemployment benefit and brings the period in respect of which it is payable into line with the period in respect of which pay-related benefit is payable.  We give the extension a guarded welcome in the sense that if Fianna Fáil had been in Government the extension would not have been necessary because there would have been a period of full employment. We recognise that in a period of economic recession and high unemployment such as exists at the moment this type of remedial action must be taken.  It should be recognised, however, that the Government have given up the ghost in the <Col N="170" /> context of giving people their civil right of employment.</P>

      <P>The Coalition have given up the ghost in respect of the possibility of returning this country to a state of full employment.  This extension of the period of unemployment benefit is a recognition by the Government that the unemployment situation will continue.  They have created this monster of unemployment. If they are the authors of unemployment then they have to pay for the hardships they have visited upon people.</P>
      <P>We take the view that the extension is necessary and that it would not have been necessary under a Fianna Fáil Government.  No doubt, the Parliamentary Secretary will produce the 1973 unemployment figures and the mid-sixties emigration figures in order to prove to the people that in 1976 all would not have been as well if Fianna Fáil were in power, that things are better under the Coalition.  Jumbled figures are no answer to the situation that exists in the country at the moment and it is no consolation to persons who have to go on the poverty line to be told what happened in the past or what is alleged to have happened in the past.</P>

      <P>In this section we have a watershed in that the period is extended over one year.  We must give this guarded welcome, as Deputy Andrews said.  It is with regret we see it has passed the full year now and people who enter on this system now see they are entitled to this for 390 days by virtue of the fact that they have worked.  It is regrettable that this must be highlighted.  I am all for increases and improvements but now we have gone over a year.  Are the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary now anticipating that, when a person goes out of work, it will be over a year before he will be back again in gainful employment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This section deals with pay-related benefits.  We are not opposing it and the only objection we have is that unfortunate people are forced to stay on these benefits for so long.  This scheme was not designed initially to carry people for a year or a year and a half.  This was a Fianna Fáil scheme and the intention was to tide people over a short period of unemployment. It was anticipated that practically everyone would change jobs once or twice and the scheme was to tide such people over the period during which they might be unemployed temporarily. The idea was to prevent incomes falling dramatically during such a short period. Now, because of lack of action and lack of positive planning on the part of the Government, this is becoming a permanent feature of life.  The vast majority would prefer to be working fulltime.  These pay-related benefits about which the Parliamentary Secretary spoke in such glowing terms are <Col N="172" /> welcome and necessary.  I condemn them only because people are forced to draw these benefits.  As to 99 per cent, they would prefer to do a decent day's work.  That is their aspiration.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the contribution side.  There is a surplus in the fund. Will he consult the employers and the trade unions with regard to the contribution now that there is this surplus? We are trying to get down unit costs at a time when competition is very severe.  This contribution represents a charge on the unit costs of manufacturing. We want to expand industry and encourage people to invest in industry. This contribution represents 1 per cent on the employee and 2 per cent on the employer.  That can come to a sizeable sum in a big factory.</P>
      <P>The figures show the fund is in surplus. I would not criticise if it were not for that surplus.  When negotiations were taking place it was promised there would be consultation after a trial period to see how the contribution was going.  If it were too low, it would have to be increased.  Now the fund is in surplus and the commitment given should be honoured.  This is a gesture that can be made.  The contributions could be reduced.  If the scheme had operated for the three-months' period only, there would be £50 million in the fund.  With the extension of the period what must be the figure now? If we were in Government we would be reviewing the situation.  There would not be so many unemployed.  In a factory employing 50 or 100 people, a factory struggling to make ends meet, 2 per cent on the weekly wage bill can come to a very sizeable figure indeed. The Parliamentary Secretary is in a position now to reduce the contribution. Will he consult with the employers and employees on this?  Under a later section the cost of the stamp will be increased for both the employer and employee.  I know that this fund was never intended to form part of the funds of the Department of Social Welfare and the mistake made was that it was not kept as a separate fund.  I mentioned this yesterday and I will go on mentioning it until I get satisfaction.</P>

      <P>This is an extremely important section and this is an extremely important development in our whole social welfare system.

      <P>The Deputy has made that point and I accept it.  It is undoubtedly of very considerable benefit to these people.  It gives them a period of time during unemployment when they can maintain, to some extent, their standard of living, but more important, possibly, than the unemployment aspect, or at least as important, is that it also applies to sickness.  In fact, 47 per cent of the claims made under the scheme are in respect of sickness. Deputy Fitzpatrick was here last night and he is back here again this morning doing his Maggie Thatcher bit.  The fact of his being spokesman for Posts and Telegraphs and having to look at television, particularly cross-channel television, is having a bad effect on him, and he sees himself in the role of the champion of the upper and more privileged classes.</P>

There seems to be a sizeable volume of political thought in Fianna Fáil these days along those lines.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has questioned the operation of the pay-related scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and talked about a surplus.  He also emphasised repeatedly that the Pay-Related Benefit Bill was drafted by Fianna Fáil, and I acknowledged that.  Deputy Fitzpatrick engaged in supplementaries to a parliamentary question in relation to the fund on the 19th February, 1976, and he was told precisely how the fund operated, that it was part of the general fund&mdash;and it was part of the general fund under the terms of the Bill that, in Deputy Fitzpatrick's own words, was drafted by Fianna Fáil. There has been no departure and no amendment of the Bill, so if the Deputy does not like the way the fund operates, I suggest he take it up with his own colleagues who drafted the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick also wanted to know if I am going to reduce the contributions.  No, I am not.  I intend to ensure, as far as possible, that the fund operates the way it was meant to operate, so that people who become unemployed or become ill are cushioned against the worst economic effect of those contingencies.  To ensure as far as possible that I can do that I am going to keep the fund in a healthy financial state.  It has been possible to extend it on a number of occasions to meet these contingencies; it might be desirable and possible in the future.  In other member States of the EEC the period of eligibility for coverage is in excess of ours.  Ours is by no means the most progressive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that we elicited from the Parliamentary <Col N="175" /> Secretary in his pious reply to Deputy Fitzpatrick that 47 per cent &mdash;this is subject to correction&mdash;of those in receipt of pay-related benefit at present are ill and by virtue of their illness are out of employment. I assume that that 47 per cent who are in receipt of benefit under the social welfare code are in employment and are out of their existing employment because of their illness. It would be interesting to get a break-down of the 47 per cent quoted by the Parliamentary Secretary.  It was for that very reason, amongst other reasons, that the Fianna Fáil Party produced this worthy scheme, to ensure that people who were ill and consequently out of their existing employment or who were unemployed because of temporary economic conditions would receive this benefit.  This Bill, as we understood it at the time, was introduced to give help to those people who would find themselves in a temporary situation of either illness or unemployment.  It was never intended that the social welfare pay-related benefit scheme would continue on for ever and ever.  Let us be fair about it: if we found it necessary to extend it, as it has been extended now, we would have considered the prospect of so extending it.  Make no mistake about that.  We would be dishonest to say otherwise.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that the philosophy behind the social welfare pay-related benefit scheme was to ensure the temporary uplift of those living on subsistence under the other entitlements of the social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well to remind the House that this is the third occasion the Parliamentary Secretary has come here to extend the pay-related benefit scheme. It was introduced under the 1973 Act for a six-month period; then it was extended to nine months, then 12 months and now 15 months.  I am talking about calendar months in the context of working days.  The last number of working days in the last increase was 78.  This is all very worthy and necessary.  The people who are now in receipt of the <i>largesse</i> of pay-related benefit should <Col N="176" /> be reminded that they are receiving only 20 per cent of their reckonable earnings between £14 and £50.  On the last occasion it was 25 per cent, on the previous occasion it was 30 per cent and it was 40 per cent under the original scheme.  Do not let the people be fooled.  There is a continual reduction in the amount they are being paid under section 12 of the Social Welfare Act, 1976.  It is not as big a bonanza as the Parliamentary Secretary says.  Quite the contrary.  It is well to point out these figures and to keep repeating them.  They were 40 per cent under the original Act, 30 per cent for the first period of extension, 25 per cent for the second period and 20 per cent under this Bill.  Section 12 (2) reads:</P>
    <P>.... of the part (if any) of his reckonable weekly earnings for the relevant income tax year that exceeds £14 but does not exceed such limit as stands prescribed for the time being, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed to restrict the total amount of benefit payable under the Acts to the person in respect of any week.</P>
    <P>That is the reality of the situation.  It is a continual reduction by subterfuge. The Parliamentary Secretary was very careful not to spell this out in any great detail or to make any specific mention of it.  He slipped it into the Bill, hoped nobody would notice it and pretended to give the people more than he did.  That appears to be the message contained in this section.</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary, as he must, if he is to be consistent, comes back to this House in three months' time to look for a further extension of this scheme, will the reduction be from 20 per cent to 10 per cent of the reckonable earnings between £14 and £50 or is the figure of 20 per cent the minimum?  These questions must be asked and answers must be given but the Parliamentary Secretary may not have the answers now.  If he comes here in three months' time to extend this scheme by a further 78 days it will mean that he realises the Government cannot control the unemployment situation. Every extension of this scheme is a <Col N="177" /> recognition by the Government that they do not have a solution to the unemployment problem.  They have jobs for the boys but they do not have jobs for the people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick was concerned about people in employment.  The Parliamentary Secretary twisted his words and suggested that Deputy Fitzpatrick was concerned solely with the privilege of working.  The message I took from the Parliamentary Secretary is that the people who are in employment are privileged.  In present economic conditions, the Parliamentary Secretary might consider it a privilege to work, but we are talking about the civil right to work.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was talking about the need for people to be given employment and the Parliamentary Secretary called that a privilege.  To work is a fundamental right guaranteed by our Constitution and by every founding document, the United Nations Charter, the Convention on Human Rights&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hoped the Parliamentary Secretary would have offered to reply to those questions. I see the extension of this scheme and the percentage curtailment as part of the philosophy of the Government.  For the first period a person is entitled to 40 per cent.  When he has become accustomed to that amount it is reduced to 30 per cent.  This frugal approach is being continued and a person is then entitled to 25 per cent, and now we have an extension for a <Col N="178" /> further 78 days at 20 per cent.  The attitude seems to be that the unfortunate man or woman will not feel the pinch.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary intend to come into this House in three months' time for a further extension of 78 working days at a lower percentage? The people should see the small print.  This is an extension of 78 days at 20 per cent.  It is a further tightening of the belt which the community must suffer because of a lack of Government policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This section must be of concern to everyone since it involves increased contributions from both employer and employee.  On two occasions already I have spoken here of the disincentive that these new rates will have so far as employment is concerned. I appreciate that Fine Gael have a certain philosophy in relation to employers but it appears that the socialist element in the Coalition consider the employer as one who has two or three heads and that, consequently, <Col N="179" /> he must become an extinct member of society.  I would remind the Coalition and, in particular the Labour Party, that by definition an employer gives employment.  If people are willing to put their efforts into the running of companies and therefore to give good employments and therefore to give good employment they should not be humiliated, sneered at or harassed either by the Government as a whole or by the socialist element within that Government or, indeed, by the tax people, although I do not intend any disrespect to them since they are only carrying out the wishes of their masters.</P>
      <P>The employer seems to be a continuous target for this Government. Without employers there can be no employment but in this section we are being asked to agree to a considerable increase in the cost of the stamp, the total cost of which up to now has been £4.11 in the case of male workers and £4.03 in respect of female workers whereas the new figures are to be £5.64 and £5.56 respectively. This is not good enough especially when one recalls that some firms have had to make representations to the Labour Court to be relieved of payment of the last wage round increase. In some cases the requests were met but now despite the fact that some employees did not receive the last wage round increase they and their employers are being asked to pay more in social welfare contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some companies who simply cannot afford to pay wage increases. In those circumstances why should they be asked to pay an increased contribution towards the cost of the social welfare stamp?  It is disgraceful that the Government should have included this section in the Bill. It is geared to put businesses out of operation.  I have tabled a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce which I expect will be on the Order Paper for written answer either tomorrow or Tuesday next.  It asks how many companies have gone out of business since the date the Coalition took up office.  I await the reply with much interest because I am satisfied that if I were to table a similar question in six or seven <Col N="180" /> months' time I should find that, arising directly from this section, there would be a considerable number of other companies out of business.</P>
    <P>The charges to the Exchequer in respect of social welfare are being reduced gradually so that the whole burden is falling on the employer and the employee and it is the employee whom the socialist element in the Coalition pretend to protect but the philosophy behind this section is to put people out of work.  Is it not ominous that the section is numbered 13?  It will be unlucky for many people&mdash;on the one hand for people who are giving good employment and on the other hand, for employees. The section is unfair.  It is a direct attack on employment.  There is hardly any point at this stage in appealing to the Parliamentary Secretary to change his mind but the genius who arrived at these figures will not have the gratitude of the people.  Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary must accept responsibility for the decision in the final analysis. The tragedy is that it will result in longer unemployment queues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I asked the Parliamentary Secretary for a guarantee that there would be some pause in the mad policy being pursued in placing the full burden of social welfare on the employer and the employee. Do the Government not realise that the stamp has moved outside the realm which was intended for it and has become a crippling tax on those who are struggling to keep their businesses going, as well as on employees? For a man who employs, say, about five people, and who is endeavouring to make ends meet, this increase is a crippling blow.  To continue to pursue this type of policy will put increasing numbers of businesses out of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each of us here must be concerned with this section because we have a duty in regard to both the employer and the employee.  So far as possible we need to seek out those who have something to offer by way of the provision of employment.  These are the people the country needs.  It should be the policy of the Government to encourage <Col N="181" /> development of this kind. Instead, this section will act as a major disincentive in this regard.  It is tantamount to a penal tax.  Social welfare contributions in so far as the employee is concerned were intended to help him in time of need.  Instead of that it is working in the opposite direction. More and more people will lose out as a result of the policy enunciated by the Government.  The Parliamentary Secretary must go back to the Cabinet and impress on them the necessity of this.  We have heard people in the Government making calls for this and that.  We heard the plaintive call of the Parliamentary Secretary this morning asking Fianna Fáil: &ldquo;Let us have your policy.&rdquo; That is the call of a person in distress. Surely the Parliamentary Secretary will call on the Government to have a change of plan in relation to this matter.  There is no point in the Parliamentary Secretary getting up and saying that Fianna Fáil's concern is not for the employee.  Fianna Fáil's concern is for every person in the country.  Never before did a country require a joining together of all sectors of the community to promote employment and to offer hope.  Instead of having a Government behind people backing them to provide employment we have a Government bringing in a penal tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The increase in the contribution could not come at a worse time.  A lot of employees are not aware that an increase in the cost of the stamp is taking place.  We hear a lot of talk from the Government about a pay pause.  Negotiations are going on at the moment between the Congress of Trade Unions and the employers.  When this increase comes into effect on 5th April it is bound to have a detrimental effect.  Some employees who did not get their increases last year are down 22 per cent to 25 per cent in their incomes against other people in manufacturing industries. When 5th April comes and this deduction is made from their wages I believe those workers will react very harshly to this aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the economy was buoyant and <Col N="182" /> there was expansion generally this iscrease could have been carried quite easily but this time of recession when the Government are calling day after day for a pay pause is not the time to come in with this reduction in wages. This is quite a substantial charge in unit costs.  Some manufacturers last year placed their case before the Labour Court and showed they had not the ability to pay the national wage agreement.  How will they carry this charge?  They will be reassessing their manufacturing unit and their work force to see how they can cut down on overheads.  There are only two realities left to a person when he reaches that stage.  The first is to go bankrupt and close down and the other is to try to reduce his overheads.  I would prefer to stay in business and to keep some of my employees.  There is nothing as bad as to see a company closing down.</P>
    <P>This year the Government were advised to do everything possible to try to encourage industry and to keep unit costs down in order to promote industry. In last year's budget we gave an employment premium to encourage manufacturers to take on additional employees.  I thought at that time it was a good move although it did not work very effectively.  We know that something more was needed to encourage people back into industry and to encourage people with money to go into industry.  This charge is bound to have an effect on unit costs.  This year when the economy is at its weakest point the Government are transferring £8 million from the Exchequer to the employers and employees.  I believe the Exchequer should have carried 50 per cent of the contribution at this difficult time.  If the economy becomes strong again and starts expanding that will be the time to make this move.  I cannot understand why the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary decided that this year the employees and employers should carry this £8 million. Before the budget economists pointed out that something should be done to try to alleviate costs in manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>There was no necessity to transfer this £8 million from the Exchequer.  I <Col N="183" /> know there is the guideline with regard to EEC directives but that is something that can be implemented when the economy improves.  I do not believe there is any firm directive with regard to the year when it should be transferred. I believe there is an up-swing in other parts of the world at the moment.  I believe we will get it here provided the climate is right.  It does not make any difference that the up-swing is in America or Japan or any of the EEC countries because if our manufacturing climate, our industrial climate and our wage costs are not right we will not have a similar up-swing. Any manufacturer who intends to come here to start an industry will look at unit costs.  Such a man would be anxious to know if the whole unit would be a viable enterprise.  Those increases are bound to be disincentive.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary interested me when he said the pay-related benefit is part of the social welfare fund.  I always had a different concept of the pay-related contribution part of the cost of the stamp.  Now we find it is cloaked under a different name.  It is not kept in any special fund. All these things combined together will have a drastic effect on employment.</P>
    <P>I know a group of people who did not get one penny last year of the national wage agreement.  The firm in which they were employed proved inability to pay.  That is only one group. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary has reliable figures.  A figure of 100,000 is being bandied around of people who did not get any of the national wage agreement last year.  I think that figure is a bit high but I can assure the House that a substantial number of people did not get the benefit of the national wage agreement last year.  Visualise the effect of that on a household with four or five children with the increase in prices right through 1975 on light, heating, fuel, food, and so on, every day in the week.</P>
    <P>These people will be told on Friday, April 5th, by their employers that they have to make an extra deduction. The Parliamentary Secretary should direct his attention very closely to that section of the community.  We all know <Col N="184" /> that if we did not get increases last year our standards of living would have been reduced.  A reduction of 20 to 25 per cent is very substantial in the case of a lower paid worker.  He will be told on 5th April that this amount will be deducted and, on the following morning, he will read that he is expected to agree to a pay pause.  It is very hard for an employee to tolerate that position. I am sorry for that section of the community.  I do not know how the Parliamentary Secretary will prove his case to them.  Has he anything in mind as to how they are to be helped?  This extra deduction should not be made from people who did not receive the benefit of the last national wage agreement. If they had received it there might be some justification for what the Parliamentary Secretary is doing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews said it is probably too late now to appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is not too late to transfer this expenditure to the central fund.  I see nothing wrong with that. Certainly the £8 million he is carrying forward should be transferred to the central fund.  It would not amount to a great lot when you consider the total budget.  We do not talk about £1 million or £2 million now.  We talk in hundreds of millions of pounds.  I do not know who advised the Parliamentary Secretary.  This was probably a Cabinet decision.  There is nothing in this to congratulate him on.  I would again ask the Parliamentary Secretary to review the situation.</P>

      <P>From their contributions they seem to have a policy which, with no increase in taxation, would provide a substantial increase over and above what is provided in the Bill in benefits.  Have a cutback of between £20 million and £30 million in social welfare.  Do not increase the cost of the stamp.  All and sundry are happy.  If a policy which allows us to do all those things simultaneously is produced, it will be very well received by everyone.</P>

It is a difficult and complex matter.  We hope to be able to come up with some proposals in the reasonably near future.  I am conscious of the difficulties of some firms and some employees.

      <P>I am glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say he is having a review.  The Minister for Finance has stated it is a policy decision of the Government to take the State out of the system.  Does the Minister for Finance know the Parliamentary Secretary is moving in this direction, because he is moving in another direction?  Is it another case of not knowing what is going on between one side and the other?  The Parliamentary Secretary is in one party and the Minister is in another in this ill-timed misfortunate coalition. I mentioned to the Parliamentary Secretary the possibility of having an occupational injuries stamp for people who wish to take some form of part-time fragmented employment, who do not wish to build up a number which will put them into total benefit, but who want simply a form of cover. This might be achieved by having a stamp to cover occupational injuries only.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary offer me some information on that, and I can continue when I have that information?</P>

      <P>I would like to develop it further but I want to know if the Parliamentary Secretary has been giving this some thought and if he thinks it is pertinent.  It has been brought to my attention by various people.  They feel benefits could accrue to them provided they are in some form of continuous employment, and provided they have reached the stage of having 26 stamps.  They are not interested in this.  They are interested in fragmented occasional employment.  We on this side of the House are concerned with each individual in the community.  Have the Government considered a system which would cater for these people? They might be catered for by having an occupational injuries stamp only.</P>

      <P>The financial allocations to health boards for 1976 have been increased by an average of 13 per cent over the provision made for 1975.  While health boards have not yet informed me of the proportion of their increased allocations which they <Col N="193" /> propose to spend on dental services, I have no reason to believe that funds available for dental services will be cut back in any health board area as compared with last year.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the waiting period referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Orthodontists are in short supply. This, coupled with an increasing demand for orthodontic treatment in recent years, has tended to give rise to lengthy waiting lists.  An added factor is that a higher priority must be given to basic dental services until these have reached a satisfactory level in the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>However, I have the position under constant review and every effort will be made gradually to expand orthodontic services, including those in the Eastern Health Board area, as soon as further development money becomes available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary agree that remedial treatment of this nature is urgent and if it is delayed, as it is being, for a criminal length the condition we are trying to rectify is likely to become permanent and may never be repaired?  Does the Parliamentary Secretary agree that something urgent should be done in this regard?  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned &ldquo;basic dental services&rdquo; but the amount of money given for dental services in the Eastern Health Board region would only permit the employment of two dentists even though 12 dentists are required.  The old excuse that dentists are not available no longer applies.  Dentists are available and the only thing that is not available is money.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary supply the necessary money or will the children who are ten years of age have to leave the national school before they are treated? <Col N="194" /> Are they to be criminally neglected by the Parliamentary Secretary?</P>

In view of the cost of electricity, television licences, rents and so on, there is tremendous poverty amongst those people and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of this.  We are not asking too much in asking for at least an extension of the service to the physically handicapped living alone.  I am not talking about families.

With regard to the second part of Deputy Colley's supplementary question and the management of the economy, I know from listening to speeches and comments by Fianna Fáil economic experts, both political and non-political, that were this Government not in office and were Fianna Fáil in office the number of persons unemployed, which is quite substantial, would be very greatly increased by the type of policy that they would pursue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Begley)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no foundation whatsoever for the suggestion in the question that there is a decision to refuse an increase in the pensions of retired teachers this year.  The facts contradict the suggestion.  In the 1974 budget I announced the introduction of a system for revising public service pensions, including teachers, on 1st July each year by reference to rates of pay in force on that date.  This system was an improvement on the system which operated previously and is still in operation.  The last revision was effective from 1st July last year and the next revision is due with effect from 1st July next.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances it will be evident that the arrangments for revising public service pensions are quite generous and that the allegation of unfair treatment of retired teachers is unfounded.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my financial statement on 28th January last, while the termination of the tax exemption enjoyed by agricultural and fishery co-operatives will not be reflected in tax receipts in 1976, the revenue gain thereafter could be up to about £3 million a year.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from co-operatives in the matter and I am giving careful consideration to the points raised.</P>
      <P>The implication in the second part of Deputy Gibbons's question is not accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the current redundancies in the meat processing industry and, indeed, in the dairy processing industry as well, and in the light of the need there is to foster more than any other industry in the country the food processing industry which is, as yet, in a state of development, does the Minister not recognise that this is the time when the exemption from company tax of these industries is of even more vital importance than the tax holiday that will presumably be enjoyed by the phantom industries that the Taoiseach has been announcing in the last couple of days which if they do materialise will presumably warrant a tax holiday of 20 years, whereas the industries that really require fostering are going to be taxed although they are under-capitalised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The industries are real; it is the Opposition that is phantom. I do not agree that a proposal which involves no tax being paid this year and £3 million being paid next year through the co-operative movement is one which could have a significant adverse effect on a sector of the economy whose income has increased and is increasing so rapidly as a result <Col N="206" /> of the measures taken by this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister seriously suggest that the profits to the shareholders from the co-operative meat processing and dairy processing industries have any reality at all, and does he not accept that both in the case of the very seriously threatened meat processing industry and in the case of the diary processing industry as well there is a very serious lack of capital that is at present leading to redundancies and that they will continue to lead to redundancies in the future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it equitable that co-operative societies should be taxed seeing that they are providing long-term credit facilities for farmers and providing educational facilities in the shape of fully qualified agricultural instructors to try to improve production and the wealth of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the taxation of co-operatives in an appropriate way, with a special provision for transitional arrangements, is entirely equitable and that failure to impose a measure of taxation of this kind upon them would merely maintain an increasingly serious inequity with private traders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that if he proceeds with this tax it will be impossible for co-operative groups to build up financial reserves?  Would the Parliamentary Secretary inform the House whether the money from the EEC Regional Fund which co-operatives may get will be assessed as trading for the year and if profits are made if half of that money will go back to the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear about the significance of the latter part of the Deputy's question.  If grants are paid <Col N="207" /> from the regional fund, they will normally be in relation to capital activity rather than current.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the money comes either through the IDA or through FEOGA, the various accountants in the co-operative movement have instructed all TD's that, if this tax comes in this money will be assessed as trade dealings for the year, and if that co-operative group show a profit half of it goes back to the State plus half the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a genuine problem in respect of this it is something which will be discussed in the negotiations at present going on between the co-operative movement and the Revenue Commissioners.  A number of issues have been raised in those discussions, and in respect of one important matter two alternatives have been put to the co-operatives and they are considering which of these they would prefer.  I am sure there will be many transitional matter which will have to be discussed to ensure that this new scheme is introduced equitably, and these discussions are proceeding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three supplementaries to put to the Minister.  First, does the Minister not regard it as anomalous that when these co-operatives are in the process of receiving large grants from FEOGA in an endeavour to help them to adopt to modern conditions, at the same time this Government should be taking from them by way of taxation funds which would go to supplement this process of modernisation on their part? Secondly, is he aware that since Horace Plunkett first launched the agricultural co-operative movement in this country, this exemption has been afforded to these agricultural co-operatives and that, in fact, it is bad taxation law&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to tax farmers who come together in a co-operative society to sell their own produce, that it is unjustifiable by any canons of <Col N="208" /> taxation?  Thirdly, is he aware that at a time when this Government are dealing this serious blow to our food processing industry, the French Government, much more enlightened I suggest, have appointed a full-time Minister to promote, encourage and develop their food processing industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that there is any anomaly involved in normalising the situation which has been anomalous in the past.  The anomaly was justified in the past, possibly, because of the small scale of the activities of co-operatives at an early stage in their development.  They have, however, been developing for a very long time and, as the Minister in his budget speech pointed out, in the last decade their activities have expanded enormously.  They now include some of the largest businesses in the country and the scale of operations is now such that the continuance of the exemption would be difficult to justify and inequitable to the general body of taxpayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>My third question was if the Minister was aware of the fact that in their anxiety to promote their food processing industry the French Government have appointed a Minister specially charged to encourage and develop that industry while, at the same time, this hapless Government are inflicting this mortal blow on our food processing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The French and other Governments have their own ways of handling their business.  Some Governments are not constitutionally restricted on the numbers of Ministers and some of them chose to appoint ministers for specific purposes.  There is a Minister for the Feminine Condition in France.  There is also a special Secretary of State for the Condition of Manual Workers.  These things are desirable in themselves, but we handle them here by different administrative arrangements more appropriate to a country of 3 million people than to that of a much larger country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister understand the co-operative movement? Does he realise the amount of voluntary effort which has gone into setting up these co-operatives in the interests of farm production?  I am <Col N="210" /> speaking particularly about the west. I am a member of a number of these small co-operatives and did not get a dividend from any of them.  They do not pay dividends because they have huge overdrafts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that these co-operatives have very large overdrafts?  If this tax is implemented it will sound the death knell on these small co-operatives in the west.  If the Minister does not understand co-operatives, he should ask people who have been associated with co-operatives all over the country.  I am one of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some co-operatives have overdrafts and being a collection of individuals working together, they share that disability with individuals who also have overdrafts.  Having an overdraft does not of itself mean that we do not pay tax, although it may to a limited extent, following the reform of the present Minister for Finance, limit the amount of tax to be paid.  There is no relationship between the two other than the provision that in respect of interest up to £2,000 for the individual there is a tax exemption. An overdraft running beyond that amount does not affect an individual's taxable capacity and should not in logic affect the tax of the co-operatives.</P>

      <P>In pursuit of their aim that the taxation system should be equitable and efficient, the Government have introduced many reforms, including the repeal of many unjustified exemptions, the closure of major loopholes in the tax code, and the determined pursuit of tax evaders.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision of the Council of the European Communities of 15th March, 1976, authorised the EEC Commission to raise four loans. The relevant particulars including the interest rates where they have been settled are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  A public issue of bonds, denominated in US dollars for a principal amount of $300 million for a period of six years.  The interest rate will be 8¼ per cent.</P>
      <P>(2)  A public issue of bonds denominated in Deutschemarks for a principal amount of DM 500 million for a period of seven years. The interest rate will be 7¼ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  A private agreement for a loan of $500 million US dollars for a period between three and four <Col N="212" /> years.  The probable interest rate on this loan is not yet available.</P>
    <P>(4)  A syndicated credit of $300 million US dollars with a life of five years and an interest rate of 1 per cent above the London Interbank Offering Rate for dollar deposits.</P>
    <P>The proceeds of the loans are to be on-lent to Ireland and Italy in the proportions of three-thirteenths and ten-thirteenths, respectively.  At present exchange rates Ireland's share will amount to about £155 million.</P>
    <P>The conditions attaching to the loan to Ireland are:</P>
    <P>(i)  Growth in the central Government borrowing requirement expressed as a percentage of gross national product should be halted in 1976 and should be reduced in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Every effort shall be made to finance the largest possible proportion of public sector borrowing requirements by non-monetary means, such as by placing long-term securities directly with the public, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  The Irish authorities shall exercise the utmost caution to avoid any relaxation of its monetary policy for the purpose of meeting both the borrowing requirement of the Exchequer and the demand for credit in the private sector, were the latter to expand more rapidly than at present foreseen.</P>

      <P>Off-hand I could not answer the first question correctly. It may be the first such case.  This is the first loan of this kind from the <Col N="213" /> European Community and the normal Community procedures in relation to its member countries operate.  These normal provisions include conditions of this kind which, in our case, create no problems as they represent Government policy as it was before the question of conditions came up.  It is merely an endorsement by the Community of the Irish Government's policies in these matters.</P>

      <P>As framed originally the Deputy's question appears to me to suggest that the policies of the EEC were being referred to by Minister of this Government as being the cause of our problems.  What the Deputy is raising now is a different question.  It is the case that this country operates in the context of a world and a European economic situation which has a major impact on us because our trade, taking imports and exports together, is equivalent to 90 per cent of our GNP. Of course external conditions impinge on us.  The Community's policies of the last few years have been directed at <Col N="215" /> minimising the impact of the world economic crisis, both in the Community as a whole and within member countries but in the circumstances these policies could not have been totally successful and this country has suffered grievously from the impact of external conditions both in Europe and in the world outside.</P>

      <P>With your permission a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to make a statement to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> As the House will be aware, my wife and I were invited recently by President and Mrs Ford to pay an official visit to the United States in connection with the celebration of the bicentennial of the American Declaration of Independence. I was accompanied during different parts of the visit by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I should like now to place on record in this House our appreciation of the President's action in extending this invitation and of the generosity and efficiency of the arrangements made for our work and comfort.  Everywhere the sympathy and understanding extended to us were most marked&mdash;and nowhere more so than at the meeting in the White House where the President, with the Secretary of State, met the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I. Indeed, the visit added a new dimension to relations between our two countries.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity of discussing with the President and American leaders many problems of common concern, including international political developments and economic matters. I used the occasion to indicate the appreciation felt by the people of Ireland for what America had done and for the principles for which America stands in the world today.  I said, in particular, that the Government welcomed American investment in Ireland and pointed to the benefits to our two countries which accrued from it.</P>
    <P>I discussed also with the President relations between the United States and the European Economic Community and certain possible dangers to those relations.  We both agreed on the importance of close consultations and co-operation between the United States and the Community.</P>
    <P>During the discussion with the President and throughout the visit, I took the opportunity of explaining the situation in Northern Ireland and the Government's policy in relation to that area.  I stressed in particular the repudiation of the Government and of the people of Ireland of violence as a <Col N="221" /> means of attaining political ends.  We appealed to the American and Irish people to refrain from supporting with financial or other aid, this violence.</P>
    <P>I invited the President to visit Ireland at a mutually agreeable time in the future and the President accepted the invitation.</P>
    <P>During my visit, I was invited to address a joint meeting of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States of America in Washington. I am arranging to have a copy of my address on that occasion laid before the House as soon as possible together with a copy of the communiqué issued following my meeting with the President.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for letting me have a copy of his statement a short time ago and I take this opportunity of welcoming him home after his exacting visit to the US.  I am aware of how exacting these visits can be and I trust that his metabolism has been restored because he will need all his physical resources to tackle the unprecedented economic difficulties facing the country.  I am sad to have to tell the Taoiseach that some difficulties accumulated even during his short visit abroad.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's path in the US followed that of many of his predecessors. He did much the same there as they did.  I was glad that he took the opportunity of asking the American public not to contribute in any way to funds that might be used for the purpose of purchasing instruments of violence and death.  I was glad in particular that he took that opportunity on the <i>Today</i> show.  In that, too, he followed precedent because not only Deputy O'Malley but myself also on two occasions made the same appeal on that show.  However, I compliment the Taoiseach on the degree of publicity given to his statement on the show, particularly through RTE.  I am not sure that I got the same publicity in respect of my two appearances on the show.  In welcoming the Taoiseach home I trust that his vigour has been renewed sufficiently to enable him to tackle the problems to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak briefly to the motion and to the amendment in the name of the Minister for Transport and Power.  The matter under discussion is not one which concerns Cork solely.  Neither is it a matter of regional concern only because when the harbour has been developed fully the benefits therefrom will accrue to the entire country.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the motion because certain developments have taken place in the Cork harbour area during the past two or three years and there has been a considerable amount of investment there, particularly in industrial development.  For example, there is the NET development at Marino Point, Cobh, a proposal which involves capital investment of more than £60 million of which approximately £20 million will be by way of local expenditure.  During the course of the construction of this enterprise there could be jobs for as many as 2,000 workers and the subsequent permanent employment content is expected to be in the region of 500 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, in my opinion, is a very considerable development in the Cork area.  The establishment of this project will also result in the saving of millions of pounds each year in the country's balance of payments because it will provide the situation where we do not have to rely on imports inputs for our fertiliser industries.  I hope once this is developed that cheaper fertilisers will <Col N="224" /> be available on the Irish market for our farmers.  This is a considerable investment to which I would like to lend my full support.</P>
    <P>The bringing of the natural gas ashore from Kinsale Head and the distribution of it to the users in the Cork Harbour area will involve a total expenditure of approximately £30 million of which £10 million will be spent by An Bord Gais.  I wish to thank the Minister for Transport and Power for establishing the headquarters of An Bord Gais in Cork city.  I believe, as the second city in the Republic, it has not got its fair recognition.  I hope the establishment of An Bord Gais here will be the start of other such investments in the second city in the Republic. We hope that this is the beginning because we have the facilities for many more institutions, either State or semi-State which could have their headquarters in Cork.  This would be an ideal location for the Minister's Department or for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  While we are speaking of sending the Department of Lands to Castlebar and the Department of Education to Athlone this would be an ideal time for the Minister to use his influence in relation to Cork because the facilities are available there for this type of development.</P>
    <P>We also have the development of oil and gas exploration.  The number of jobs which will become available here will be considerable.  I would like the Minister to give this his full support. Cork County Council have already approved a basis for this exploration work.  One can imagine the amount of employment which could be provided with the erection of rigs.  We also have the establishment of a new ESB station fuelled by natural gas at Whitegate and the considerable extension of capacity in the Marina station in Cork city is very welcome.  I wish to compliment the Minister on those developments.</P>
    <P>We have the development of the Verolme Cork Dockyard in this area where very considerable employment is given.  I understand that the Minister for Defence will be looking for a protection vessel from this dockyard. I hope that any ferry vessels which the B &amp; I Company will require will <Col N="225" /> also be provided by Verolme.  Those are very highly labour intensified developments.</P>
    <P>When one speaks of the development of Cork Harbour and the subject matter of this debate I consider there are three major aspects involved. There is the provision of land for industrial development, the provision of an adequate water supply for industry, which is very important, and also the provision of harbour facilities.  In relation to the provision of land for development the IDA have expended some millions of pounds on the acquisition of the most vital areas of land for industrial development in the Cork Harbour area. The important land bank adjoining the proposed deep sea berthage at Ringaskiddy is held by the IDA as well as a considerable area in the hinterland at Ringaskiddy, Currabinny and Shanbally.  There is approximately 700,000 acres of land required for this type of development by the IDA.  There is also land in this area zoned under the Cork county development plan as land for industrial purposes.</P>
    <P>As far as the development of Cork Harbour is concerned land is already acquired.  There was a difficulty in acquiring land by the IDA in this area.  It was expensive to buy, and it was difficult to acquire.  The local people had their roots there and negotiations to get that land were tedious and difficult.  However, I am glad there is a pool of land available for any type of industrial development which may come our way and also that the IDA have acquired land for industrial development in places like Ballincollig, Little Island and Carrigtwohill, which is also important in the Cork Harbour area.  This part of the strategy for the development of Cork Harbour is, therefore, well progressed and land is now available for further industrial development.</P>
    <P>This is tremendously important as far as any future industrial development of this area is concerned.  It is also worthy of note that this progress in industrial development has been made over the last few years by the establishment of such factories as the <Col N="226" /> Smith Kline &amp; French (Ireland) Ltd. chemical factory at Curraghbinny, which is giving some very valuable employment.  There are the Data 100 and Topps factories at Ballincollig, the Mitsui, Swissco, Pepsi Cola, General Mills and other such factories at Little Island.  There is also the project at Marino Point.  All those industries are giving very valuable employment. This is very essential to the Cork area at the moment.</P>
    <P>I say to those whose names are on this motion, deploring the lack of progress made in the development of Cork Harbour or in the implementation of the Cork Harbour development plan that all this is done at a time when we have the worst and most serious economic recession that the western world has seen in 50 years. None of those industries cannot be pulled out from under the armchairs in the Department of Transport and Power or any other Department.  It should be noted that this progress is made and that the Government under difficult circumstances have come to grips with this problem.  The development of the harbour reflects credit on the Government.  I would like to urge on the Minister for Transport and Power that we proceed as quickly as possible with the full implementation of the Cork Harbour plan.</P>
    <P>The second ingredient as far as the development is concerned is the provision of an adequate water supply for industry.  While Cork county, like many other counties, has a high average rainfall, the provision of a water supply for anticipated industrial development in the Cork Harbour area will need colossal expenditure.  We have seen this development taking place where a supply of water is taken from the Inniscarra area to Cork Harbour. This will be almost all for industrial purposes.  In the eighties we could have a situation where an adequate supply of water will attract industrialists for the processing of their particular materials or industries.  An adequate water supply will have exactly the same effect as coal and steel had over a century ago in places on the Continent.  I believe an adequate water supply will be one of the main <Col N="227" /> requirements for industrialists visiting this country in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I give full credit to everybody concerned in this development, Cork County Council and the harbour developers, where steps are being taken under this scheme to provide 50,000,000 gallons of water taken from Inniscarra right through to the Cork Harbour area.  Almost the entire supply is earmarked for industrial purposes. The first phase of this scheme is costing £17 million to take the supply to Douglas where it will be branched off to give a small supply for private use and for industrial development in the Cork Harbour area.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the Department of Local Government that the costs for this scheme are colossal.  The Minister for Local Government has made a certain amount of money available for the first phase.  The difficulty involved here is that the loan charges and the costs of maintenance in the initial period will be such a burden on the southern area of the Cork County Council that it will be impossible for the ratepayers to meet the demands that will be levied as a result of the cost of this scheme.  I should like the Minister for Transport and Power to use his influence with the Departments of Finance and Local Government to ensure that money is made available speedily for implementation of the scheme.  If money is not available, in the south Cork area the rate will be increased by £9 in the £ for sanitary services alone.  It would be unfair to levy that charge on the ratepayers in the southern area.</P>
    <P>This is not a Cork problem.  It is not only the people of Cork who will benefit solely from the development of the Cork Harbour area.  The country as a whole will benefit, and it would be unfair to saddle the ratepayers of the southern part of this county with the extra costs imposed because of the payment of loan charges.</P>
    <P>Once we start discussing the development of the Cork Harbour plan we must embark on a wider field of discussion. If we attract industries to <Col N="228" /> the Cork area we will be faced with the problem of improving facilities at the airport.  I might add that until the present Minister took over nothing was done to improve facilities there but now some improvements are being carried out.</P>
    <P>Another factor is the development of the harbour facilities and this is about to be done.  It is important that we develop and dredge the harbour to ensure that it will be able to cater for the heavy type vessels we expect will use it.  I expect this is a matter to which the Minister will direct his attention.  I am glad that the largest amount of money ever for this type of work&mdash;£500,000&mdash;was made available this year by the Minister for Transport and Power.  The material that will be dredged from the harbour area could be used for some kind of land reclamation or for the building up of the embankment.  This is an important matter that should be considered.</P>
    <P>There is a major job to be carried out in the harbour area, particularly around Ringaskiddy, but it will be well worth while.  In the last two or three years there have been developments in the Cork Harbour area.  We are ready for industry to start and the Industrial Development Authority should be doing their utmost to attract these concerns.  It will take at least two or three years to provide the heavy type of industry and to build the factories we have in mind.  The development of the plan could proceed at the same time.  It took two or three years for industries such as Pfizer and others to get off the ground.  The IDA should be trying to attract industries to the Cork Harbour area.  The Government and the Minister for Transport and Power are doing a good job and they are doing their best with regard to the plan for Cork Harbour.</P>
    <P>The motion put down by Fianna Fáil deplores the lack of progress made by the Minister.  The Government have been in power for three years but half of that period was during a very difficult economic situation that was not peculiar to this country.  One must ask what was done in the 16 years prior to the <Col N="229" /> Government taking office towards the development of the Cork Harbour plan?  Had Fianna Fáil Deputies a lack of confidence in their own Ministers with regard to this matter? I know that the Minister for Transport and Power who is present will ensure that progress continues to be made.  I am pleased with the progress that has been made to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker has given credit to the Government for the NET industry and for the ESB plant which is to be erected. I would remind him that it is not quite fair to give credit to the Government for those industries.  He should remember who started the exploration which led to finding the natural gas.  It was started in the late fifties by the then Fianna Fáil Government and, in particular, by the late Séan Lemass.  He had the foresight and the confidence to bring Ambassador Oil into this country to carry out exploration work.  They were the forerunners of Marathon who have made the gas find.  When the Bill was brought to this House some people who had been former Ministers in the previous Coalition Government treated it as a laugh and treated Ambassador Oil as a laugh.  Now, Deputy Creed is giving credit to a Government who have been in office for three years for the setting up of the industries to which he referred.  The credit should be given to the men who started the exploration and who were laughed at then.  NET or the ESB would not be erecting any new plants if we had not found the natural gas as a result of the exploration work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course it is good business to give access to natural gas to NET but it is questionable whether it is good business to give access to the ESB.  We must ask ourselves if it could be put to more profitable use for the nation when it is realised that nearly 70 per cent loss is incurred by using natural gas to generate electricity.  This is not my figure; it is the figure issued by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  It is important that natural gas should be used for the <Col N="230" /> greatest benefit of the nation as well as for the people of Cork.  As Deputy Creed correctly pointed out, this is not a local issue.  It is a national issue and all of us should remember this.</P>
    <P>We put down the motion for the purpose of highlighting the importance of the matter and for the speedy implementation of the Cork Harbour plan.  We are well aware of the national importance of this matter.  We had plans such as this in the past.  When in Government we set up various bodies to deal with industrial promotion&mdash;the Shannon Free Airport Development Company is an example we can all be proud of because it has added greatly to the economic growth, life and employment of the nation.  The Government should take the bull by the horns and provide the necessary investment for the Cork Harbour plan, a plan which will benefit the country.  The implementation of such a plan would be a great incentive to foreign industrialists.</P>
    <P>In their wisdom the Government put down an amendment to our motion.  In my view that amendment is like the action of the old lady who brought a kettle of boiling water with her when she went for a bathe in the sea off the west coast.  She wanted the boiling water to heat her own little swimming patch.  The provision of £500,000 towards the cost of the work at Cork Harbour will be as ineffective as the kettle of boiling water was when the old lady poured it into the Atlantic Ocean.  Irrespective of what the Minister says or the excuses he puts forward, the Government recognise that there is too much leeway to make up in the political sense in order that there would be a political advantage in the short term from the spreading of what has become a notorious exercise in State financial and political lubrication or spending.  The Government have repeatedly shown that they have only the capability to think and act in the short term.  The past years have been a constant exercise in political expediency and it would be foolish of anybody to expect that the qualities <Col N="231" /> and abilities lacking in the past three years will suddenly show themselves now.  At this late hour, with the economic life of the nation on its last gasp, I should like to offer some suggestions which could be used as a starting point in a movement away from the economic mess the Government have created.</P>
    <P>The proposals of the Cork Harbour Board offer the opportunity of harnessing the great work force available in the south of Ireland.  We should finish with all these paltry dole payments and associated subsistence.  If we accept that the primary source of wealth is labour, then let us harness what is available in the labour pool for the constructive and worthwhile development of the country.  We should utilise the opportunities for retraining our unemployed in conjunction with a practical proposal such as this.  Such a proposal is sure to create something lasting and will prove of great value instead of the continued fostering of a possible source of resentment amongst those lucky enough to be still employed but who are being heavily taxed in an effort to maintain the social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>To talk about unity in our country is one thing but we must first create the means of unifying the people in this part of the island in a common purpose for the benefit of the country as a whole.  We have had emergencies before and they caused a great mobilisation of our manpower in the defence of the nation.  The present economic climate demands the same amount of emergency action and the mobilisation of all our forces&mdash;in this case our manpower&mdash;to defend our economy. Every penny available for spending by the Government should be directed towards constructive development for the good of the country.  No Government should be afraid to lead because it is their responsibility to lead the nation.  Attempting to treat the symptom of the terrible disease of unemployment is not going to prevent the disease; it will not prevent the spread of the epidemic.  We must develop a new treatment to get rid of the sickness itself.</P>
    <P>We know it is difficult for a Government <Col N="232" /> which is staggering from one crisis to another to stop taking action which is motivated by expediency but, nevertheless, the nation demands honest leadership and is entitled to it.  The strategy of the recent budget is already in tatters although we were led to believe it would lead to economic recovery. The drop in the consumption of alcohol and use of fuel oil reduced the expectancy of the revenue increases we were told about by more than £30 million since the budget.  The diminishing external value of sterling has increased the servicing and repayment cost of the foreign borrowings engaged in by the Government and other semi-State bodies by £35 million.  The cost of this wastage is lost but the value of successful investment can prove profitable even yet and that is the opinion of most people.</P>
    <P>By implementing the Cork Harbour plan we maintain it will prove a profitable exercise for us all.  In any proposed industrial development it is recognised that we must provide the infrastructure in order to entice foreign industrialists to get involved in our economic life.  We must do this if we are to tempt them to come here. It is not enough to be giving tax holidays and other incentives.  The Cork Harbour plan provides a readymade opportunity for the Government to provide this type of infrastructure. The plan was well thought out and entailed a lot of work.  It is a golden opportunity for the Government to provide the necessary infrastructure which will lead to more employment and a reduction in the dole queues. The implementation of the plan will provide employment which in turn will provide more revenue for the Exchequer instead of the prolonged social welfare payments which are becoming more a part of our economic life.</P>
    <P>There were opportunities in the past of providing the investment in the Cork Harbour area which would not only have maintained existing employment but would have created a lot of new jobs.  The opportunity that comes to mind was the shipping order of Irish Shipping Ltd.  That order was placed with a Japanese firm and that caused great damage to the Cork Harbour area.  There was great emotional <Col N="233" /> play made about an order for £250,000 worth of furniture by a semi-State body with a foreign firm but surely an order which might have meant the spending of £13 million in the Verolme Dockyard was of greater importance to the nation and to the dockyard.  That order would have maintained existing employment and led to the creation of new jobs instead of maintaining employment in Japan.  It is only right that we should keep reminding the Government of this great mistake by the Government and Irish Shipping Ltd.</P>
    <P>The Government can justify the placing of an order with a foreign firm in certain ways but an order of that magnitude should have been placed with a home firm in order to reduce the size of the dole queues.  It is very important that we create more employment because if we do not become more productive and have increased employment we will not go ahead as a nation, our economy cannot succeed.</P>
    <P>We all remember that in the 1960s in particular when our economic life began to grow and more investment came into the country we were beginning to move towards a state of full employment.  We were able to provide jobs for people, if not in their own county at least in their own country instead of providing those jobs in Coventry, Birmingham, New York and other places.  New capital came in to the country for investment.  New industrial know-how came into the country.  People from North America, England and the Continent of Europe set up industry here.  At that time we did not have a great infrastructure. We had to provide it.  Now we have a plan and are more advanced in our planning.  We have plans drawn up in advance for the provision of what is required in order to attract industrialists. Here is one glowing example of a measure that should be adopted. The provision of the necessary infrastructure for incoming industrialists is as big an attraction as the tax holiday and the grants given by the IDA.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Taoiseach went on tour in America and one of his primary exercises there was to tempt more capital investment and more industry back to this country.  How much <Col N="234" /> easier would it have been for him if he were in a position to say that the necessary infrastructure was already provided.</P>
    <P>It is not right to say that when a proposal is activated is time enough to set up the infrastructure.  I have had some experience with foreign industrialists in my part of the country. People came in to see what was available. Potential investors and industrialists look for road structures and what we can provide by way of infrastructure. This is a major consideration. They know that in due course they can negotiate whatever grants are available and they are aware of the tax holidays for exporters.  To them the infrastructure is equally important. I know some of these who having surveyed the area have decided against coming here.  They went to other countries.  The fact that we had not the necessary facilities which were available in other countries was a serious consideration.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to lose potential investors.  We should not be at fault. We should not be seen to be at fault in losing a potential industrialist.  We have lost some very big ones such as Alcan and one particularly big one in Cork and another in Clonmel and there have been one or two proposals in my area which are not now coming. We should not be the people who are at fault.  We should do everything possible to help to create employment instead of borrowing more and more and paying out more and more in social welfare.  We should put some of this borrowed money into work such as this which would prove productive and would contribute to the economic welfare of our people and which would create employment for them at home and would reduce dole queues.</P>
    <P>The plan is of great importance because of the off-shore development which has been mentioned and which makes it all the more imperative that the infrastructure should be provided. The Government cannot ignore this fact.  It is more important now because we know we have natural gas and we are hopeful that we will strike oil if some people have not already struck oil&mdash;this we are not certain of <Col N="235" /> as yet; at least we are not told about it.</P>
    <P>We should implement the Cork Harbour plan and plans should be made for the Shannon Estuary and places in the west of Ireland because there is a great possibility of finding natural gas and, indeed, oil off the west coast and we will need shore installations if we are to develop these for the benefit of the economy, for the creation of the off-spin industries. The Government have the principal duty in this respect.  They are the people who have their hand on the till.  They are the people who can provide the necessary money for the implementation of such a plan.  It would be far better if those on the other side of the House were to prevail on the Government to provide the necessary money than to be congratulating the Government on the setting up of industries as a result of the finding of natural gas, which would have come about irrespective of what Government was in office.</P>
    <P>This is not a local Cork issue.  It is a national issue.  Increased investment in industry must be regarded as a national issue.  There should be concentration on the question of deep water facilities.  We are fortunate in having deep-sea ports.  The Shannon estuary is one.  Such deep-sea ports are not readily available on the Continent of Europe, as has been acknowledged by experts who have been investigating the possibilities. With the prospect of finding more natural gas and oil off our shores it is of importance to provide the necessary facilities at these port areas in order that we would be ready to develop these natural resources when they are found.  It has not yet been firmly established that there is oil off the shores in commercial quantities. Therefore, we should provide the necessary infrastructure for foreign industrialists.  It is as important to do this as it is to have Ministers going all over the world talking to potential industrialists.</P>
    <P>Surely it is not too much to ask the Government, in the light of all the money that has been borrowed and <Col N="236" /> all the money that has been spent in the last three years, to provide money for productive purposes which will be repayed many times over by productive industry and all that goes with it. It is not too much to ask the Government now to provide these moneys, instead of providing, as I have said, the kettle of boiling water that the old lady brought to the west coast when she was going swimming and to which we compare the £500,000 the Government are now providing which amounts to nothing in the light of the total plan.  It is like giving a sop to the Cork Harbour people, the council, the corporation and all the people involved.</P>
    <P>We put down this motion in order to highlight the importance and the urgency of implementing this plan, not only for the benefit of Cork but for the benefit of all the southern part of the country.  By doing so we will, as was pointed out by previous speakers, provide employment for people who are now on the dole queues and that employment will, in turn, provide more revenue for the Exchequer instead of having the present situation where a diminishing number of employed are providing more and more taxation in order to keep those on the dole queues in receipt of social welfare benefits because they are unfortunate enough to be unemployed.  We must get away from the social welfare mentality and put all the moneys available to the Government into the creation of productive employment instead of borrowing more and more money for longer and longer dole queues.</P>
    <P>These dole queues have been growing longer and longer over the last three years.  It is sad to think that people are going around actually bragging about the increase in social welfare payments.  Of course, we should have social welfare benefits for those who need them.  How much better it would be for those involved and for the morale of the country generally if we were in a position to brag about increased employment which would ensure the economic growth of the country in the context of the European Economic Community. <Col N="237" /> The only way in which we can brag is by increasing employment opportunities.</P>

      <P>This Opposition motion was tabled by a number of Deputies.  It reads as follows:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the Government's continued failure to provide adequate funds towards the implementation of the Cork Harbour Development Plan.</P>
      <P>To that motion an amendment was tabled by me to the following effect:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes that a sum of £500,000 towards the cost of certain harbour improvement works included in the Cork Harbour Development Plan has been provided in the harbour grants subhead of the Estimate for Transport and Power for 1976 which is the largest sum ever provided for any harbour authority in one year and requests the Government in due course to consider what further funds may be provided for the Cork Harbour Development Plan&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have had four speeches from the Opposition on their motion, the most extraordinary being that delivered by the last speaker, Deputy Barrett.  He ranged far and wide and his comments did not seem to have any bearing on the Opposition motion.  He talked about the 1960s and jobs for the people as against the paltry dole system.  Does he mean those on the dole are not getting enough or does he think they are getting too much?  Does he think they should be cut off and get nothing at all, these unfortunate people who are out of work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that there is unemployment in this time of recession is not unique.  Deputy Barrett spoke about the rise in prices since the Arabs cut off the oil supply in 1973 and the effect of that on the world.  In all the countries in the European Economic Community Ireland has been more successful than any of the other <Col N="238" /> eight in keeping unemployment figures down.  Our unemployment figure has increased less than it has in any other country in the EEC. Deputy Barrett spoke about the farseeing 1960s and the investment that was brought in and the jobs that were provided.  The fact is on 1st January, 1970, there were fewer people working than there were on 1st January, 1960.  Fewer were working at the end of the decade than at the beginning.</P>
    <P>The evolution was that Fianna Fáil exported their problems.  They sent the people to London, to Birmingham, to Coventry, to Manchester, to New York, to Melbourne and Adelaide in this alleged period of economic advancement.  It was the greatest scourge perpetrated on the people since Cromwell and the Famine.  It was deliberate Government policy to send our people away to be supported by other Governments. So much for the forward thinking and progress.  It was one of the most disgraceful decades.  But this is what the Deputy would like us to copy.  I am quite confident that those who are working will accept responsibility for ensuring that those who are not working will be able to remain in their own country instead of emigrating to ghettoes in the back streets of the big cities of the world. They will be kept here among their own in the environment in which they were born and bred and in which they want to stay.  That is the policy of this Government and it will continue to be the policy of this Government. I have no doubt but that this country is capable of maintaining twice its present population.  One cannot do everything overnight.  One cannot undo 16 years of Fianna Fáil misgovernment and the effects of the oil crisis on the whole western world in the last three years, in a short period.</P>
    <P>We are providing for the Cork Harbour Development Plan exactly the sum of money the Cork Harbour Commissioners said they required in 1976.  In fact, it is slightly more.  The Government have not moved away from the Cork Harbour Development <Col N="239" /> Plan.  It is not their intention that the plan will never come to fruition.  At the moment because of budgetary constraints what the Government are saying is that the sum of money provided is all that can be provided this year.  The next budget will be formulated in the autumn and come to a conclusion sometime in November or December.  Then we will see.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett was not here in the 1960s and possibly he does not know that the Cork Harbour Development Plan is not the first harbour or estuary plan.  In the 1960s there was a development plan for the Shannon estuary.  That was knocked by the Government of the day.  They said there could be no possibility of providing money in advance of development. I believe that was the subject of the longest answer to a parliamentary question ever given in this House. The Deputy can look up the record.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wyse last night quoted Deputy Lemass and spoke as if Deputy Lemass would not adopt this niggardly attitude being adopted, as he alleged, by the present Government. He said he was farseeing and looked to the future and he would have provided money for these things.  He was the great saviour and the creator of the industrial expansion. Here I want to quote from the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> published in 1964 when Deputy Lemass was Taoiseach.  Paragraph 47 reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Harbours should, in principle, be operated as commercial undertakings and should be self-supporting. There should be no question of State grants for harbour undertakings either to meet the cost of maintenance or to carry out improvements required by new or expanding trade, except in special circumstances such as where the establishment or expansion of a particular major industry requires improved harbour facilities.  It is desirable that any State assistance and, indeed, any investment at such harbours should be related to the specific and identifiable requirements of new trade or industrial <Col N="240" /> development and should not be undertaken merely by way of providing general facilities in the hope of attracting new and unspecified business.  It is equally desirable that the expected return on the investment be measured as accurately as possible and that an appropriate local contribution should be a condition of any State assistance.</P>
    <P>That was the policy laid down by the leaders of the Members opposite over ten years ago and it has not been changed.  It is the policy being pursued now by this Government and when Members opposite come in here looking for money and deploring the inadequacy of the funds being made available they either do not know the policy laid down by their own party or they choose to ignore it for some petty local political consideration. Now Deputy Wyse and Deputy Healy are genuine politicians and it is hard to be tough with them.  I do not think they were indulging in petty political considerations and so I presume they acted out of ignorance and that they did not appreciate what had been the position during all their term of office and which has not changed since.  In regard to the Cork Harbour development plan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I sat here through four Fianna Fáil speeches without interrupting once, and I think I am entitled to the same consideration.  I know that when the pin is going under the nail, Deputy Fitzgerald has to interrupt; he has to shout and rant and try to break up things.  Therefore in one way I welcome his interruptions, knowing I am being effective in what I say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cork Harbour development plan is an exceedingly good plan. There are a number of factors in this. There is the water, the land and the harbour facilities that are necessary. These are things the Government are working towards.  I am not so familiar with the Cork County Council's progress as regards the water pipes, but I do think the compliments that have been paid to the council are well deserved, <Col N="241" /> in that they have been exceedingly far-seeing and progressive in this regard.  They deserve all the help and encouragement necessary because of their commitment to this.</P>
    <P>The most necessary requirements of the plan are the harbour facilities themselves, and the most important of those facilities is the dredging.  Deputy Wyse spoke last night about dredging for 150,000-ton ships and the necessity for providing for these huge bulk carriers that are coming from around the world.  The Cork Harbour Commissioners have never asked for that. The dredging that is supposed to be done this year will be to the depth the Cork Harbour Commissioners require. This is what they are looking for. Deputy Wyse is a member of the Cork Harbour Commissioners and he will know from the documentation he has got that this is so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed made a point which I will look at.  I am not sure whether it is valid, that the dredging which is being done at the moment should be used as an infill behind an embankment on the Ringaskiddy site.  I have not had a chance to examine it in depth but from a first look at it I think it may not be feasible.  There are two types of dredging required here.  One is the dredging of the spit and the bar at the harbour mouth and there is the rest of the dredging, the infill for the land at what is called the Ringaskiddy basin which will be pumped dredging in behind an embankment wall.  The dredging at the mouth of the harbour and at the spit bank will be of a different type and would be loaded into barges and dropped into the sea.  However, I will be paying some attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>When the Cork Harbour development plan was first put before the Government, the harbour commissioners and the IDA came to the Government and said the Du Pont industrial concern were setting up a factory in Ireland and certain harbour facilities were needed.  On the spot the Government gave a guarantee that any such facilities would be provided and would be available before the Du Pont factory was ready to go into production.  That is still the case. <Col N="242" /> Deputy Healy said last night we should look forward because Du Pont may not have changed their minds for all time but only because of the world recession&mdash;Deputy Healy used the word &ldquo;recession&rdquo;&mdash;and Deputy Barrett, when he spoke of Alcan in the Shannon Estuary, said the same thing.</P>
    <P>These projects are not scrubbed as far as this country is concerned.  We have not heard the last of them.  Both of them are there to be reactivated should the world market improve.  If those or any other industries come to the IDA land on the Ringaskiddy site where they have 600 or 700 acres then &mdash;and I am not saying anything here I have not said a number of times before&mdash;the Government will provide the finance to make the necessary harbour facilities available when the factory is ready to go into production. That is as categorical as I can make it.  I should say the IDA had a number of people looking at that land on the Ringaskiddy site and not one of the people they have taken down there since Du Pont put their plan into moth balls said that.</P>
    <P>The fact that there were no harbour facilities available on the site at the time would interfere with their coming there.  I asked the IDA specifically about that, and they said this was so, and there were ten or 12 big industries involved.  We are talking about very big industries for that site.  Deputy Wyse listed last night the type of industry that would go there.  Because of the complexity of establishing these industries we are talking about a leading period of three or four years.  The Du Pont project involved four years. Any dredging, reclamation or establishment of jetties needed for such industries can be done in that time. The Government could have provided money this year for those facilities in the hope that some industries would use them, but if they provided that money this year they could not have provided for something else that might be equally important, for instance, the gas pipe line, which is far more important because it is there now. Marathon would have wished that this gas would not be brought ashore until <Col N="243" /> 1979.  We have been constantly pushing them for the last 18 months to ensure that gas comes ashore earlier so that the benefits will be available to the people earlier than they would have been in a normal, slow development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett said, and I suppose there is a certain amount of truth in it, that it was the farsightedness of Seán Lemass that allowed this exploration to take place, but it is not that that determines it.  If there was exploration there and this gas was found, it is the use that is made of it afterwards that can be of benefit or of no benefit to the country.  Deputy Barrett said we should not have used that gas for generating electricity.  Technically speaking there is some truth in that in as much as you do not get the fullest value from the use of natural gas by generating electricity from it.  We must remember, however, that at the time of the oil crisis in 1973-74 we were in a hopelessly overdependent position on imported oil for the generation of electricity.  The Government decided that the first thing we should do was to lower our dependence on imported oil as much as possible and ensure that we would be less exposed to that kind of situation in the future.  For that reason, we decided that 60 per cent of that gas should be used to generate electricity and 40 per cent for the generation of nitrogenous fertilisers in the NET plant.  These are two very large projects.  The Government could have decided not to use the gas in the Cork area.</P>
    <P>I remember reading a speech by Deputy Barrett some months ago where he criticised the Government for not shipping the gas from Cork to Dublin for use in that area.  We made a decision that all this gas should be used in the Cork area in the generation of electricity which will provide more permanent jobs than the 200 temporary jobs Deputy Wyse spoke about.  There will be twice as many jobs in the Nítrigin Éireann plant at Marina and another 1,000 jobs during the construction stage. The laying of the pipeline to Cork city, the availability of that gas to <Col N="244" /> the consumers in Cork, the conversion of the Marina power station from oil-fired generation, to gas generation, are all positive immediate benefits to the Cork region and must in themselves attract further industry, maybe even to a far greater extent than the harbour plan.</P>
    <P>I am being careful not to say anything here that will leave me open to criticism of being anti-Cork Harbour Development Plan.  I am not. It is imaginative, well thought out, correctly costed, and to move towards its fulfilment is the correct strategy from the Government's point of view but we must be conscious of other needs and demands on capital.  This year we provided £500,000 necessary for a vital part of this, that is, the dredging to allow big ships to come in.  This is the most important part, which could not be done in a hurry. It will allow the plant at Marina to be serviced, it will allow deep berth facilities at Cobh to be served by bigger ships; it will allow the oil refinery to have bigger tankers come in.</P>
    <P>An amount of play has been made about the exploitation and exploration of gas and the benefit this will be if the harbour plan goes ahead. The fact is that exploration for gas has been going on in the quays in Cork for five, six or seven years. There is a further site available to Cobh.  There are two members of the Cork Harbour Commissioners here today and they know that they have a planning permission and fore-shore licence application from another firm to establish on the east side of Cork Harbour to set up a service base for rigs and platforms.  This is outside the harbour plan at Ringaskiddy.</P>
    <P>Besides the existing site in Cobh, a site is being made available by the Cork Harbour Commissioners at Tivoli for pipe laying, the CIE site at Cobh, and a deep water berth at Cobh which will allow the servicing of rigs and platforms; there is a further application for the development of a site on the east side of the harbour.  I notice Deputy Brosnan has left, but Deputy Hegarty got the message very quickly.  From a purely <Col N="245" /> constituency point of view he would be crazy not to realise that every bit of the investment in Cork is going into Deputy Brosnan's and Deputy Hegarty's constituency.  Deputy Hegarty knows that quite well. None of the money invested in Cork harbour is going to the south side. The Little Island site is full.  Cobh, Marino Point, the oil refinery, the ESB generating station, the new Chelsea base, all are on the north and east sides of the harbour.</P>
    <P>On the south the land is there. That land was most difficult to acquire.  Deputy Fitzgerald will remember the hooha about that a few years ago.  Many people were disturbed when that very valuable land was acquired.  I am sure the IDA are as conscious of that land as anybody else, and there will be no possibility of it being given away for any other purpose than that for which it was acquired, that is, for a pulp related industry.</P>
    <P>Any industry that comes to the Cork Harbour region I guarantee, as I did previously, that the facilities necessary to cater for that industry will be provided before the industry is in production.  The first thing that must be done is to dredge the harbour to ensure that it is deep enough to take boats of a size necessary for these industries without any danger. That is being done with the money we are providing this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wyse, Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Healy were on a deputation from the Cork Economic Development Council which I received. Deputy Crowley, from the Cork County Council, was also on that deputation but I do not see his name on the motion.  Is there any significance?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not a harbour Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a member of the Cork County Council.  We might investigate that and see why his name is not on the motion.  The Cork Economic Development Council came to me on the 18th February and wanted to know the present position in view of the dredging of the harbour.  The <Col N="246" /> plan was discussed with them.  They were told that the dredging was done. They made the point Deputy Creed made here that things were being done in reverse.  If the dredgings had been put behind the embankment, it would move towards the implementation of the plan and it would seem to be a more feasible and rational thing to do.  That is technically not possible because a different type of dredging is necessary for the Ringaskiddy Basin and that being done on the spit and harbour bar.  At the time the assistant secretary of my Department inquired if there was any other means of financing the scheme except by a full State grant.  The leader of the deputation, the chairman of the harbour board, said that the present dues would not suffice.  He said that the European Investment Bank said that this was the right type of plan for their investment but they must have Government guarantees.  He wondered if the Government would underwrite the Harbour Commissioners borrowing of the money over a certain period of time, after which the Cork Harbour Commissioners would repay the Government when they started to earn money again.  If the Harbour Commissioners came to me with a proposal which they considered feasible, if they worked out the pros and cons, and pointed out the benefits, costs and the long-term position, I said I would be willing to look very favourably on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first time this was suggested and it might be the means of overcoming the difficulties of breaking existing policies while at the same time accepting responsibility locally for the repayment of the loan.  They mentioned, too, at that time that they would seek four groups of users who would be prepared to make commitments and I told them that if they did this and could put forward a scheme regarding the financing of the project with the Government taking up the interest on the loans until such time as the scheme became viable, I would be willing to consider their proposal favourably.  That was a month ago and I have not heard from them since but perhaps it would take longer than this <Col N="247" /> to devise a scheme of that nature.  If, in the meantime, or subsequently, any industry comes to the Ringaskiddy area and seeks harbour facilities I am happy that these facilities can be provided in less time than an industry can be established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Minister nor either of the other two speakers from that side of the House have spoken with any conviction here today or yesterday.  It was obvious that they were as disappointed with this long-awaited decision as were all Cork people.  Towards the end of his contribution the Minister referred to the Government underwriting a loan from the European Investment Bank.  In regard to Cork Harbour this would mean merely the underwriting of the future of Cork, of the future of the people of that area and of the opportunities for employment.</P>
      <P>This Government and the Minister can be charged, more than anyone else, with procrastination because they have continued to make promises in a halfhearted way regarding the harbour development plan.  Their attitude can be compared with a bait dangling at the end of a rod but this is in keeping with what we have come to expect from them.  Under a heading entitled &ldquo;Taoiseach impressed on Cork Visit Harbour Plan gets Big Boost&rdquo; in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of 27th May, 1975 the Taoiseach is reported as saying to the Chairman of the Harbour Commissioners:</P>
      <P>I can assure you that you have presented a most impressive case. Mr. Peter Barry and myself can report to the Government on the proposals that you have, and they will get adequate and full consideration. It would not be prudent to go beyond that, but if you get that, the outcome will be satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us compare that statement with what Deputy Hegarty said here yesterday when he referred to the plan and dismissed it as speculation, as gambling and as being irresponsible.  This is a plan that was prepared by Cork Harbour Commissioners with the assistance <Col N="248" /> of Cork County Council and Cork Corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy dismissed the plan as being no answer to the situation but I have not the time now to enter into controversy with him.  He went on to say that, possibly, the deep water could be taken farther down the harbour but I shall come back to that later.  Obviously, the Deputy, no more than some other people on his side of the House, has not read the plan.  The plan has the support of the various bodies in the area&mdash;urban councils, chambers of commerce, trade unions, employers' groups and anybody who had at heart the interests of the future of the entire southern region.  It is not necessary for me to expound on the excellence of the plan.  It was prepared by engineers, economists, ecologists, planners and others, all of whom put much research and study into it.</P>
      <P>We are citizens of no mean city or county but on this occasion we, in common with the people of the whole southern region, have been dealt a severe blow.  No industries that have been created on one side of Cork Harbour can compensate for the huge unemployment figures in the area. While new industries are being established, older ones are closing daily in the city.  To refer to this plan in the context of Cork Harbour only is misleading because it is something that will benefit the whole region.  Indeed, it is national in its concept and magnitude especially in the light of future developments off that coast.  The approach of the Dublin-oriented Government to this matter is similar to their approach to other suggestions from the Cork area, for example, the Fota issue, UCC, Verolme and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has gone out of his way to say that in relation to the plan a vast amount of money has been made available to Cork this year but <Col N="249" /> let me spell out clearly that approval has not been given yet to this sensible plan, a plan with which the Minister and every Member of this House would agree, with the exception of one Deputy who last evening dismissed it as being a waste of effort and completely before its time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The money needed for this venture is not great when taken over a period of four or five years.  The dredging operation is required especially at Marino Point. It is part of the overall plan but the Minister is not being totally honest with the House when he gives the impression that the wishes of the harbour commissioners have been complied with. This brings me to the question of the higgledy-piggledy sort of approach of this Government to any positive planning.  The first stage of this plan refers to the development of the deepwater facility at Ringaskiddy and although the Minister said otherwise I understood that the dredging could have been used to fill in the area behind that deepwater facility.  However, if the Minister says this is not so, I am prepared to accept his word.  If Stage one went ahead this year with the approval of the Minister the dredging next year would be in adequate time for the Marino Point project for which it is intended basically to service.  The other aspect of it is the overall financing question.  Apparently it has been agreed on all sides&mdash;certainly at EEC level&mdash;that here we have a project qualifying under every single condition as a desirable project for grant assistance from the regional fund.  I fully accept that would not meet all the expense on it but the underwriting of it is merely a small request from the Government.  It is not enough for the Minister to say here that a policy existed in 1964, 12 years ago.  If that policy existed, he will have to look at the position we are now faced with. The Minister tried to misconstruct figures earlier in his contribution.  The facts are that more than 116,000 people are unemployed in the country and more than 30,000 school leavers are at present on the unemployment market <Col N="250" /> plus those finishing school in June.  If that plan goes ahead, it will in the short term provide employment opportunities and in the longer term the facilities will attract the major industries we want to see attracted to the harbour.</P>
      <P>We have the IDA, a Government agency, with the permission of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, purchasing a very large tract of land, which makes them a major landlord, on the shores of Cork Harbour.  Steps must be taken to industrialise that land. We have to ensure that some of it is developed quickly in order to provide jobs.  Deputy Hegarty spoke last night about the moving of a deep water berth.  The Cork Harbour development summary says:</P>
      <P>Six locations in the lower harbour were considered for the proposed deep water berths and related industrial estate and the hydraulic implications of the alternatives were studied.  Of the areas, only two, namely Whitegate/Aghada and Ringaskiddy could provide adequate backup area and of these two areas Ringaskiddy was chosen for priority development as it had lower development costs and was more suited to a wider range of developments.</P>
      <P>Ringaskiddy was chosen.  The IDA have the land at Ringaskiddy.  Surely the development of that area is extremely urgent.  Surely the provision of industry and jobs in that area is also extremely urgent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The city harbour and water scheme has been referred to.  It shows how little homework was done by the Government side of the House when the Deputy who spoke last night referred to the figure of £11 million being provided while the Deputy who spoke today referred to the figure as being £17 million.  The position is that during 1974 and 1975 three phases of that scheme were approved by the Local Loans Fund to get water down to the lower harbour area to both Little Island and the Ringaskiddy side.  Two stages are in progress.  The third has not been signed because the Government have fallen short in their commitments to Cork County Council. <Col N="251" /> If that situation is not rectified, Cork County Council will be like New York city, despite the nice things that were said across the House.  There is no planning.  There is no control at the top by the Government to co-ordinate the IDA, the harbour authority and the county council development.  I call on the Cork Deputies in particular to stand up here and be counted and to say that the Government have not done what we have asked them to do.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 16th December, 1975, of a very reliable correspondent from Brussels who referred to the meeting of the Minister for Finance with Mr. Thomson, the Regional Affairs Commissioner, the previous day.  He said:</P>
    <P>There is speculation in Brussels that the new project which has been <Col N="252" /> agreed will be the Cork Harbour scheme, details of which were discussed in Cork a year ago by officials from the Commission and from the European Investment Bank.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's dilemma and I appreciate the pressures that have prevented him from doing what he has promised to do so often and which he would have dearly wished to do.  Our condemnation is not of him.  It is of the Government who, on this occasion, just as they have in the past with Fota, UCC and other areas, ignored Cork and have allowed the Cork Harbour Development Plan to go into cold storage.  It will affect not only the unemployed at present but the many young people who will, between now and 1980, be seeking employment each year once their school days are over.</P>

      <P>In view of the heavy burden placed on employers and employees by virtue of the increase in the stamp contribution, I was asking the Parliamentary Secretary if it would be possible for those on part-time work to pay a contribution to cover occupational injury only.  Following the increase in the amount of the contributions the employer must now pay £1.03 extra while the employee must pay an increase of 50p per week.  That is a sizeable levy for the employer and the employee to pay weekly.  Obviously, it will not encourage people to engage in part-time work.  In my view those who are engaged in part-time work would not be keen to have the necessary number of stamps to qualify for all the benefits and a stamp to cover occupational injury would suffice.</P>

      <P>I doubt if the people referred to by the Deputy would be interested in having their social security cover reduced as he suggested. In my view part-time workers find coverage for unemployment and pensions a tremendous protection. The Government have changed the regulations with regard to contributions by deserted wives and unmarried mothers in that such people do not have to pay their portion of the stamp; that is carried by the State.  I do not think there is much merit in the suggestion although I appreciate the Deputy's concern.  I do not think such a change would be welcomed.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary be good enough to explain the import of section 14?  It is the section which refers to voluntary contributions and the new increased rates to be paid by voluntary contributors. Would the Parliamentary Secretary give an explanation in nutshell fashion?  I do not want him to go into any great depth.  I have often said in the House that a layman finds difficulty in interpreting Bills.  I do not suggest that this section is not well drafted.  Unquestionably, it is drafted within the bounds of reason.  Nevertheless, if the Parliamentary Secretary can give a nutshell explanation it will be appreciated.</P>

      <P>This section increases the rates of ordinary contributions by amounts appropriate to the benefits covered by each contribution.  The rate of voluntary contribution which covers widows' and orphans' pensions and deserted wives' benefit only is increased by 27p to £1.10, and that covering the additional benefit on old age contributory pension, retirement pension and death grant by a further 39 pence, £2.70 to £2.80.</P>

      <P>That is it.  Prior to the abolition in April, 1974, of the limit of £1,600 for insurability for non-manual workers there were some 12,000 voluntary contributors most of whom are now compulsorily insured, but the need for voluntary contributions still exists to cater for those who for one reason or another do not fall into that category.</P>

      <P>The Leader of my party has continuously over the last six to nine months stressed the possibility of instituting community services for the unemployed and the setting aside of money for that purpose. This idea was also propagated yesterday by the Commissioner on Social Affairs in Europe, Dr. Patrick Hillery.  I accept that not everybody would be able to take up the type of employment that might be available but it is a question of providing services and we believe that the Government should have an immediate investigation into the possibility of setting in train schemes which would result in young people finding some occupation.  That is not to say that senior citizens are not entitled to the same consideration.  They are but I refer specifically to young people, particularly <Col N="259" /> school leavers.  Remember, thousands more will be leaving school in a few months' time.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made a number of points which were not totally relevant to the Bill.  However, I have made the point. Over the weekend the Parliamentary Secretary made a speech suggesting that he intends introducing a Bill in the near future which will increase the penalties for abuses.  This was a point I made in the first instance and I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary is following my reasoning in this. These abuses have a demoralising effect and the sooner the Bill is introduced the better it will be.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary of our co-operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I omitted referring to an injustice.  It deals with the position of farmers' valuations and allowances.  If a farmer opts for the multiple, it is £40 for every pound valuation but he is given allowances out of it which in certain cases bring him down to £25 per pound.  But in the case of social welfare once he is over £20 valuation he is assessed at £40 to the pound valuation and he gets no allowance. This is slightly unfair and I forgot to mention it on the Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point that was raised by Deputy Callanan, I did say earlier today in relation to any small farmers who feels the changed system of assessment constitutes a hardship <Col N="260" /> in his case, that he can apply to have a factual assessment of his income made on the same basis as, in fact, 7,000 small farmers are doing since the introduction of the scheme and are still doing.  That assessment would be made in the normal way in respect of everyone who would be applying for this type of benefit or assistance and all relevant factors would be taken into consideration in assessing means.  Deputy Andrews made two points.  As I said, one of the points he made does not come within the functions of the Department of Social Welfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but undoubtedly it would be our ambition to see that payments, whether they be pay-related, flat rate or assistance in respect of unemployment, would cease, in that we would hope in time to be able to create a society that will allow for full employment and make these payments unnecessary irrespective of what category they fall into. We have always stated that, irrespective of the level of payment for unemployment benefit or assistance, we regard this as a bad second best.</P>
      <P>As regards the new law on abuses. I can assure Deputy Andrews that I will welcome his support when the Bill comes before the House.  I indicated this morning that it will substantially increase the penalties that are now provided under existing law for abuses whether by employers for failure to stamp cards or by employees who may fraudulently draw social welfare benefit or assistance.  Deputy Andrews said he was sure the Bill was lying there all the time, but if it is any consolation I can tell him it has not been; it is still in the course of being drafted and is at an advanced stage.</P>

Under the 1965 Act there is power, in order to prevent inequalities or injustice, for the Minister for Social Welfare, in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, to have, if it is so requested by the applicant, a factual assessment of means made.  I can assure the Deputy that anyone who is adversely affected by the change in the means of assessment and who wishes to have a factual assessment of his income in order to qualify may have that done.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Health Contributions (Amendment) Bill, 1976: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health Contributions Act, 1971, established the principle that contributions towards the cost of services provided <Col N="262" /> under Part IV of the Health Act, 1970, should be paid by persons who have limited eligibility for services under that part of the Act.  The explanatory memorandum, which has been circulated with the Bill, defines the groups of persons who are required to pay contributions and the services to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The present level of health contributions, at 26p per week, or £12 a year, were fixed with effect from 1st January, 1975.  These are now, therefore, due to be increased, and I propose to fix them at 33p per week, or £15 per annum, effective from 1st April, 1976.</P>
    <P>The increase proposed in this Bill takes account of the general increases in costs and incomes since the level of contributions were last debated and agreed in 1974.</P>
    <P>When the original Bill was introduced in 1971 the then Minister made it clear that he was introducing the Bill &ldquo;because of the urgent need to find another source of income besides rates and taxes to finance the heavy and growing burden of health costs&rdquo;.  In further comment the Minister said that &ldquo;the traditional sources for health finance must be supplemented in some other way and preferably in a way which can be shown to be directly related to the services concerned&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The financing problems which faced the health services in 1971 have not diminished.  The reverse, unfortunately is the case.  In the first instance, health service costs are rising rapidly.  Health services are labour-intensive by their nature and rapidly increasing levels of pay in recent years have added very appreciably to costs.  In addition, the demand and take-up rate for public health services is increasing at a fast rate, while technological and other innovations within the health care system itself have also speeded up the rate of increase of costs.</P>
    <P>These and other factors have necessitated a rather rapid increase in health expenditure in recent years.  In 1971-72, when health contributions were first introduced, public non-capital expenditure on our health services was £86 million.  The Exchequer contribution was of the order of £45 million.  In 1976, it is estimated that public non-capital <Col N="263" /> expenditure on health care will rise to £262 million, while the Exchequer's contribution will increase to an estimated £242 million.  In other words, the Exchequer's contribution to health care expenditure will have risen from 52 per cent to 92 per cent between 1971-72 and 1976.</P>
    <P>This year, despite the competing claims of other public services, 18 per cent of non-capital Exchequer expenditure will be devoted to health care. This compares with a figure of 10.5 per cent in 1971.  Part of the reason for the increased proportion devoted to health care is, of course, that the undertaking to remove health charges from the rates is being honoured and has practically been completed.  In addition, however, major improvements in our health services have been achieved something which is demonstrated by the fact that expenditure on health has increased by some 16½ per cent in real terms during the last three years alone.</P>
    <P>As a percentage of gross national product, public health expenditure has risen from 4.3 per cent in 1971-2 to about 6 per cent in the current year.  In recent years, therefore, not only has public health expenditure been rising rapidly, but it has been rising at a considerably faster rate than the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>All of these statistics show clearly that health costs and health expenditure in our society are rising rapidly. Associated with this reality is the fact that public health expenditure is now funded almost entirely from the Exchequer. Local rates, which as recently as 1972-73 met over 40 per cent of the cost of health services, this year will meet only 1.8 per cent of the cost of these services.</P>
    <P>In this situation, health contributions constitute, and will continue to constitute, an important source of revenue.  Unless our general economic circumstances change to an extraordinary degree, we will have to continue to seek revenue from this source.</P>
    <P>Having said that health contributions constitute an important element <Col N="264" /> of revenue, I would like to point out, however, that the estimated receipts from this source&mdash;£10.2 million in the present year&mdash;represent only about 6 per cent of the estimated cost of providing limited eligibility services.  It is clear that, from the beneficiaries' point of view, the new rates of contribution represent a very reasonable bargain in relation to the services which are available to them.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have said that health services, together with social welfare costs, impose a very heavy charge on our Exchequer. The combined provision for Exchequer grants in the 1976 non-capital supply services is about £485 million which represents about 36 per cent of the total Exchequer provision contained in the Estimates.  The present system for financing health and social welfare services is being reviewed by an interdepartmental committee of representatives of the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.  This committee have been making good progress and I expect that they will be in a position to submit their report by the summer.  Before concluding my comments on the Bill, I would like to say that I will propose an increase in the present income limits for limited eligibility health services in the near future.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, while there is no income limit for insured manual workers at present, there is an income limit of £2,250 per annum in the case of insured non-manual workers and an income limit of £1,600 per annum in the case of all other adults, except farmers.  In the case of farmers, those with farm valuations of £60 or less are in the limited eligibility group.</P>
    <P>I had hoped to do away with an anomaly between insured manual workers and all others, by providing free hospital care to all.  This has not been possible to date, however, as the House is aware.  The present income limits of £2,250 and £1,600 were fixed in April, 1974, and October, 1971, respectively.  They are now due to be increased in pursuance of the normal practice of increasing income limits from time to time, in line with increases in incomes generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> Unless the existing income limits are increased in the near future, a very large number of people, who are now entitled to limited eligibility health services, will cease to be eligible. Indeed, in the case of insured non-manual female employees, a significant number of them will become ineligible from 5th July next, unless the present income limit is increased. In all, 85,000 people will become ineligible by the end of this year, unless the income limits are increased in line with income increases since the present limits were fixed.</P>
    <P>I propose to submit to the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval draft regulations which would fix a new limit of £3,000 per annum, as soon as present consultations with the medical profession are completed.  This should be in a matter of weeks.  If these regulations are approved and made, all those now entitled to limited eligibility health services will remain entitled and an estimated 85 per cent of the population will remain eligible for free hospital care.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that this Bill proposes no more than that the present health contributions be increased in line with incomes and costs generally.  The proposals it contains represent no more than the normal periodic increase in contributions in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In this legislation the Minister for Health proposes to increase the health contribution by 27 or 28 per cent.  The general public have had so many savage increases in taxes and charges imposed upon them by this Government that I believe this increase is unlikely to attract the attention and the opposition it would in normal circumstances and with a normal type of financial administration.  I believe the general public have become anaesthetised against impositions of this sort.  Many of them have simply given up the struggle.  They no longer try to order their financial affairs in any planned fashion.  There is a large section of the community these days who simply live from day to day.  It is, however, important in dealing with this <Col N="266" /> legislation that we, on this side of the House, direct the attention of the public clearly to precisely what is involved and to explain the nature of these increased charges and the real purpose for which they are intended.</P>
      <P>The House and the general public should clearly understand that this increase in charges which the Minister now puts before the House will not go towards improving our health services in any way.  The money which will be raised by this legislation and by these increases will not be used to provide any new services, to improve standards, to provide any extra facilities or to make improvements of any kind in our health services.  Neither those people who will have to pay these contributions nor anybody else will benefit in the slightest degree in regard to the health services provided for them by this increase in contributions.  This is not a health Bill; it is a taxation measure.  As such, it should have been included in the budget package of taxes last January.  The extra amount these increases will bring in, £1.7 million, has already been taken fully into account in the budget arithmetic.  It is important the House understand that.</P>
      <P>The amount involved here has been taken credit for as part of the budget revenue.  It has already been fully absorbed in meeting the budgetary situation.  These moneys will not be available to improve in any way the health services for those who will be called upon to pay them.  In fact, this money will be handed over completely to the Exchequer as a budgetary measure.  As I said, this is a taxation measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though the credit for this £1.7 million was taken in the budget, the Minister for Finance in introducing the budget did not mention this increase at all.  It was not until the Book of Estimates came out and we saw there the figure for Appropriations-in-Aid of the Health Estimate, £10.2 million, that it was clear that this money which is now being sought by the Minister by way of this legislation, had already been fully credited in the budget arithmetic.  That is the way this Government conduct their financial business.  They resort to petty deceits <Col N="267" /> I suggest that it would have been proper for the Minister for Finance in introducing the budget to say clearly and distinctly that he had already taken account in his budget arithmetic of these increases which the Minister is now bringing before us.</P>
    <P>Closely related to this legislation is the vexed question of the exclusion of non-manual workers with incomes in excess of £2,250 a year from limited eligibility benefits.  Persons in this category have been specifically excluded by the Minister for Health, by means of an order he made in 1974, from the very important benefits involved, hospital in-patient, specialist out-patient, maternity and child service, and the drug subsidy scheme.  These services are fully available to all insured manual workers.  Of course, this is an administrative anomaly and is guaranteed, as all administrative anomalies are, to cause friction and a certain sense of grievance among a large section of the population.</P>
    <P>It is absurd to ask a person in one type of employment to accept a situation in which he is denied a range of benefits available to a fellow worker with the same income and in the same family circumstances merely because he is in a different type of employment. This situation should be rationalised. Whatever may be the level of income decided on, it must be of universal application.  This anachronistic division can no longer be justified.  Further, the income level decided on must be a practical one because there is no point in making available in theory these limited eligibility services to a section of the public if in practice they cannot be provided by the hospitals and the medical profession.  That is the crux of the matter.  The principle of practicability should govern every extension of the health services.  In other words, extensions should always be related immediately and directly to the resources available.  It is because of his consistent refusal to adhere to that principle that the Minister has plunged our entire health administration into its present state of division.</P>
    <P>From the Minister's speech it is not clear whether he is proposing to deal <Col N="268" /> with this anomalous situation.  From a quick reading of the speech, a copy of which the Minister so courteously arranged to have me supplied with, it seems that he does not propose to make any change in the situation of non-manual workers who earn more than whatever may be the specified limit.  Therefore, I should like the Minister to clear up that point early on in the discussion because it is stated in his speech and I quote:</P>
    <P>I propose to submit to the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval draft regulations which would fix a new limit of £3,000 per annum, as soon as present consultations with the medical profession are completed.  This should be in a matter of weeks.  If these regulations are approved and made, all those now entitled to limited eligibility health services will remain entitled and an estimated 85 per cent of the population will remain eligible for free hospital care.</P>
    <P>I take it from that wording that if the new income limit of £3,000 per annum is introduced, non-manual workers, insured persons in excess of that figure, will still be ineligible for limited eligibility benefits.  If that is so, the Minister is perpetuating this anomaly, whereas I would have expected that in bringing this legislation before the House he would have given us some idea of the numbers involved and how many insured persons there are with incomes in excess of £2,250 who are excluded by reason of their being non-manual workers.  What is the extent of this problem?  A very large section of the working population have grievances in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have tabled an amendment for Committee Stage the intention of which is to ensure that, whatever the income limit, it shall be of universal application.  In other words, this anomalous distinction between manual and non-manual workers will disappear.</P>
    <P>This differentiation may be unconstitutional as somebody has suggested to me but I am never disposed to making prognostications as to what may or may not be constitutional. <Col N="269" /> However, should anybody wish to test the constitutionality of the provision which leads to this anomaly, I expect he would have a very good case.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister has caused a great deal of confusion in the public mind by his erratic behaviour and statements in relation to a number of these matters.  There was the blithe announcement of a free hospital service for all and even long after it had become abundantly clear that this was not a practical proposition, the Minister persisted in maintaining the fiction.  Indeed, he refers to it again today in his speech.  In addition, while professing a desire to provide a better service free of charge to an increasing sector of the public, he has acquiesced this year in what must be relatively the most severe cut-back in the national budgetary provision for the health services in modern times.</P>
    <P>At a time when our hospitals are already stretched to capacity with existing numbers and have had drastic reductions imposed on their operating budgets, the Minister proposes an increase in the numbers of persons eligible. Recently he increased substantially the cost of private and semi-private hospital accommodation thereby throwing an additional number of persons into the public sector persons who otherwise might have been prepared to pay for private or semi-private accommodation but who will no longer be encouraged to do that because of these increases but will add to the queue for scarce accommodation in the public wards.</P>
    <P>The general situation in regard to the financing of our health services this year is chaotic.  There are serious doubts as to the capacity of the hospitals to sustain an acceptable level of essential services throughout the whole year in their regions.  Similar fears exist in the voluntary hospitals, the allocations for which fall far short of their budget requirements in many instances.  There are real indications that the amount provided for the general medical service is inadequate to permit the service to provide a full <Col N="270" /> service for medical card holders throughout the year.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister in replying to advert in particular to that aspect of the financing of the health services this year.  Is the amount he has provided in the Estimate for the general medical services payments board adequate to meet the estimated expenditure of that board during the coming year or will it involve a serious cutback in the general medical service as provided for medical card holders?  It is clear that unless we are prepared to accept a serious reduction in the level of the health care provided for a large section of the general public this year, additional funds must be provided by the Exchequer.  The Minister must face up to that reality.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the Government as a whole must face the problem because it is at the Government table ultimately that fundamental priorities of this kind must be sorted out.  The Minister must insist on the Government making a decision now to provide the additional funds that are needed to maintain the health services at an adequate level throughout 1976.  If a decision is taken now and the necessary additional allocations announced soon to the regional health boards, the voluntary hospitals and the general medical services payments board, then serious dislocation of our health services can be avoided.  If this does not take place, I am afraid that programmes of economy and cutbacks will have to be undertaken and measures will have to be taken by boards and authorities which will cause widespread hardship and suffering to the people who rely on those services.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for anyone outside the official establishment to quantify what additional amount is required to finance our health services this year. From my own limited knowledge and using whatever information I can assemble, I believe that the regional health boards between them would require an extra £8 million this year if they are to maintain their services at a satisfactory and adequate level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, between them. That is the calculation I made to the best of my ability.  I have taken them all together and put particular emphasis on the Eastern Health Board and have looked at the others and the difference between their budgets and what has been allocated to them.  I believe that the eight regional health boards between them would require an extra £8 million this year to provide adequate health services at the same level as existed during 1975.</P>
      <P>I believe that another £7 million to £8 million would be required for the voluntary hospitals and the general medical services payments board.  This means that in the region of £15 million would be required in the Estimate for the Department of Health to enable our health services to get through this year without serious disruption.  It is very difficult for someone who has not access to the official figures, information and statistics to try to quantify the situation.  The best estimate I can make of it is that between the health boards, the voluntary hospitals and the general medical services payments board somewhere in the region of £15 million would make the situation reasonably satisfactory.  I suggest that the Minister should try to get it across to the Government, where the ultimate decision in these matters lies, that that additional money must be provided by the Exchequer.  I also want to make it clear that it is not my responsibility to propose how those funds should be provided as I have not the details of budgetary policy and the different demands and pressures which would enable me to decide where that £15 million is to come from.  That is the responsibility of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I am not demanding any new services.  This Government, and particularly the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, continually resort to the argument in relation to the Opposition of saying that if we demand some new service, some new facility or some additional improvement we must state where the money is to come from.  I do not think that is a valid argument but it is one the Government use <i>ad nauseam</i>.  I am not asking for any new service so <Col N="272" /> that argument does not apply in relation to what I am saying.  I am only asking that the existing services, which were there throughout 1975, which were built up to a certain level over the years and were maintained at a certain level during 1975, be maintained. I am only asking that an additional amount of money be provided by the Exchequer to enable those services to be maintained throughout 1976 at that level.</P>
    <P>I believe these additional allocations must be made.  It is my duty in Opposition to point that out to the Minister, the House and the general public.  At this stage of 1976 unless those funds are provided our health services cannot be maintained at an acceptable level during this year.  It is not for me to say if that would involve a rearrangement of existing budgetary provisions or whether it would involve some other measures.  I believe this could be done within the confines of existing budgetary provisions. I admit I have not the information to assert that positively or definitively. Whatever else has to be sacrificed, whatever other economies must be made, hospitalisation of the sick, medical care and attention for those in need are basic requirements in any civilised community and any rearrangement of the budgetary provisions that have to be made to enable those essentials to be provided must be and should be made now.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I am not purporting to the House to have the knowledge which would enable me to make any positive assertion about this matter but I want to put it before the Minister.  Perhaps a review should be made of the structure of the regional health boards.  I hope I am not one of those people who just look at any organisation and say that it is top heavy, unwieldy and bureaucratic. I believe the regional health boards have done a good job in developing services, in exploring needs and in endeavouring to provide new programmes to meet needs but whether or not there is excessive cost in the bureaucracy of the health boards is, perhaps, something that might be examined at this stage.  I <Col N="273" /> believe it is an area which would merit examination in the context of the rearrangement of financial provisions which I am suggesting to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I cannot escape, in that connection, a conclusion that there is a good deal of covering up going on between the health boards and the Department of Health over the budgets for 1976.  As I pointed out during the discussion on the Private Members' motion recently the allocations made by the Department of Health fell far short of the budgets prepared by the health boards and submitted by them. The shortfalls range from £300,000 approximately in one case up to £3.7 million in the case of the Eastern Health Board.  The chief executive officers of the different boards, as was their duty, submitted reports to their respective boards indicating the extent of the shortfalls and outlining proposals for cutbacks and reductions which the allocations would force them to adopt.  That process took place from January through February in the case of all the boards.  The chief executive officer and his management team pointed out to each board what the deficit was and how he thought it could be met.  Those proposals which were put forward by the chief executive officers varied in content and severity from board to board but they all followed the same general pattern.  Their decisions were to restrict the issue of medical cards, restrict visiting and prescribing by doctors for patients on the general medical service register, cut down or eliminate the transport service for patients to hospitals and other centres, cut back community services like meals on wheels, home help, free milk, dental services and so on; cut down on repairs and maintenance, on heating in homes and hospitals and reduce different benefits under their control; cut down on the child medical examination service in the schools.</P>
    <P>All of these and many other proposals were made by different executive teams to different boards throughout the country.  One of the most drastic proposals in this regard was <Col N="274" /> put forward by the Eastern Health Board in regard to St. Loman's Hospital. There, the suggestions put forward by the executives and the programme managers bordered on the ridiculous.  There were proposals such as removing corn flakes from the breakfast menu, making desserts simpler, cutting down on minerals and soft drinks, cutting out newspapers for patients and stopping taking patients to cinemas.  Various other almost ridiculous economies of that sort were proposed for the unfortunate inmates of St. Loman's Hospital, people who could not fight for their own rights in this matter.  The Minister has since tried to deny that the Eastern Health Board actually proposed these reductions, cutbacks and economies but they were seriously put forward in St. Loman's by the management and probably they are still in operation.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country in the different areas of responsibility of the boards all sorts of economies, cut-backs and reductions were put forward. Subsequently, discussions were held between the managements of the different boards and teams from the Department of Health and, arising out of these discussions, we were led to believe that the deficits had been eliminated and that the boards would be able to manage within the allocations that had been made.  I find that very suspicious.  So far as I am concerned it is all very dubious.  Were the budgets, as originally submitted, not genuine?  Were they not prepared on a prudent, economic basis?  Were the executives in the health boards guilty of irresponsible, careless budgeting and financing?  If the team of officials from the Department of Health could come along and revise the budgets so that the deficits disappeared, surely something was wrong in the first instance?</P>
    <P>In fact, I do not believe that the executives and the management teams submitted inflated, irresponsible budgets in the first instance which were subsequently pared down by the team of experts from the Department of Health so that the deficits could disappear. I do not think that happened. I think the deficits are still there in <Col N="275" /> reality.  They have been eliminated on paper and I think this is particularly so in the case of the Eastern Health Board.  There is a great deal of bluff and covering up going on in regard to this matter.  The real deficits are still there and they will manifest themselves as the year goes on.  These cut-backs and deductions will take place. It is all just a propaganda exercise resulting I am afraid from collusion between the Department of Health and the executives of the health boards. So far as I am concerned at this stage until I am satisfied otherwise there is a great big question mark hanging over this situation.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious situation.  All those concerned should know that the regional health boards structure has its very determined critics throughout the country, people who have never accepted the concept and who believe it is not the best solution to our health administration problems.  If it is going to be demonstrated that a big deceptive exercise has been engaged in throughout the health boards with the Department of Health, those critics of the health board structure will be greatly strengthened in their opinions and in their doubts about the value of the whole regional health boards structure.</P>
    <P>The situation that has arisen, that of a very inadequate allocation having been made in the budget for health services this year, is a reality.  I have tried to quantify the overall shortfall as somewhere in the region of £15 million.  I may be wrong about that but there is no doubt that there is a serious shortfall in the provision made by the Government.  However, it has this possible side advantage, namely, that it serves to focus the attention of all of us on the question of the future development of our health services and their financing.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a very passing reference to that in his speech when he referred to the fact that the present system for financing health and social welfare services is being reviewed by an inter-departmental committee of representatives of the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.  That is <Col N="276" /> very interesting.  There is an inter-departmental committee of the Departments of Health and Social Welfare dealing with the finances of the health services but there are no representatives from the Department of Finance.  Surely this is an absurdity.  How can there be any inter-departmental investigation into the financing of the health services without someone from the Department of Finance being present?  Is this a political gimmick?  Is it just because health and social welfare are under the same Minister?  Of course he has a Labour Parliamentary Secretary in charge of social welfare.  Is this a nice, friendly, Labour exercise?  In any event, I do not believe that an inter-departmental committee is the appropriate machinery in this instance. Certainly an inter-departmental committee that does not include a representative from the Department of Finance is meaningless.</P>
    <P>This serious situation in regard to the health services and their financing must dictate to us that we should look at the health services as a whole in total, their future development, the extent to which they are being developed and how that development will be financed. We must ask ourselves whether it is possible to provide for the development of our health services on a planned, orderly basis and to have that development financed in a way that would make those services either totally immune from budgetary crises from time to time or else put them in a situation where they would be only marginally affected.  That is the key question we must face up to.  Can we so devise the financing of our health services that if there is a budgetary crisis which involves the settling of a particular budgetary policy for economic or financial reasons that that budgetary crisis will leave the health services comparatively untouched? Must we go on with the situation where a budgetary crisis, brought about by economic or financial causes and with nothing to do with health, causes this serious dislocation of the health services?</P>
    <P>In that context I suggest that we must maintain a sense of proportion here.  We must realise that we are not <Col N="277" /> now having to deal with a situation, as some people suggest we are, where the cost of our health services has escalated to an unmanageable level in relation to national economic resources. It is important that we realise that.  Of course, we have the problem of providing the necessary finance for our health services but I do not think we should panic or that we should accept the argument some people put forward that it has got out of all control and has become unmanageable and can no longer be rationally related to the resources which we can provide.  I calculated that not more than £15 million extra would be needed this year to maintain all our existing services at a reasonably satisfactory level throughout the year.  In absolute terms that is a large sum but it is not a figure of intolerable magnitude in relation to an overall expenditure in this year's budget of £1¾ billion which is the total of our non-capital budgetary expenditure in 1976.  When one looks at the extra amount I am suggesting as being necessary to provide adequate health services this year it is not all that absurd in relation to that overall figure.</P>
    <P>I do not think we need to be totally intimidated in this House or in the inter-departmental committee by the level of our health expenditure in relation to our GNP or our total budget at this stage.  We have not yet got into an uncontrollable nightmare situation as they have in other countries.  I believe that a comprehensive set of decisions are necessary at this stage on the shape of things to come if we are not going to run the danger of getting into that sort of nightmare uncontrollable situation.  We must decide the fundamental issues about the sort of health service we are going to have and the rate at which we are going to progress towards that health service.</P>
    <P>A health service for this country must be designed for our own needs. It must be suited to our own circumstances and be directly related to our economic and financial capacity.  It is on those grounds that I have on occasions attacked the Minister.  In my view I was justified in doing so.  I believe that the Minister is inclined <Col N="278" /> to import ideas here; he is more inclined to look at some outside system which he admires and to transplant it in its entirety into our circumstances. I do not think that will work and that is where we have to have good sound basic thinking in regard to the whole future of our health services.  We are a very special sort of community. First, we have very special population characteristics which are, perhaps, unique in western Europe.  Our population is dispersed throughout the country in a way which is different from most other European countries. Our economic circumstances are different and, unfortunately our GNP and our <i>per capita</i> income are below European level.  We have different social traditions and a different outlook in many areas to other countries.</P>
    <P>All these things seem to dictate that we must design, evolve and work towards a health service which will be suited to our own circumstances, conditions and needs and, above all, which we will be able to afford to pay for.  I suggest that in the evolution of such a health service there are a number of guidelines we should follow.  It must be recognised that the provision of a free health service generates a continually increasing demand for that service.  Perhaps that is not something that was fully understood and realised a decade ago but it has now become increasingly obvious to everybody who studies the situation.  If in the area of health a free service is provided the provision of that service generates a continually increasing demand for it. That is an important factor which must be kept in mind in any planning of the evolution and development of a health service.</P>
    <P>A very important aspect of our thinking in this regard should be that an increasing emphasis must be placed on preventive medicine, on health education, on physical fitness and on the question of dealing with drugs, alcohol and tobacco.  In all these areas if we place an increasing emphasis immediately it will ultimately go to help in dealing with the financial implications of the entire health service.  Money spent in these <Col N="279" /> areas of preventive medicine will ultimately bring down the overall cost of health to the community.  In that connection it is important to realise what happened in Britain in regard to the health service there. The idealists and the visionaries in the early days of that service sincerely believed that if a comprehensive national health service was brought in ultimately the very operation of that health service would be such that it would be possible to eliminate, to a great extent, illness and disease in the community and, eventually, the wholecost of health would come down.  Of course, that has turned out to be a tragic illusion.  In fact, the inevitable law I mentioned earlier is the one which is manifesting itself instead, namely, the very provision of a free health service generates an almost insatiable demand for that service as time goes on.</P>
    <P>There must be a major shift from hospital to community medicine.  We must try to get more medical attention provided in the local communities. That leads on to another principle to which we should subscribe, the need to build up the general medical service.  I cannot understand the Minister's approach in this regard.  His mind seems to be fastened on this business of free hospital services for all and he has set his mind against the progressive extension of the general medical service.  That is a fundamental disagreement between the Minister and this side of the House.  We believe that it is in the general medical service that extension should come. That is related to the principle of trying to have more medical and health care provided in the community as distinct from the hospital. There is no doubt that that would in time result in a lesser burden on the community in regard to the finance that has to be provided for health services.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this is of course the principle which I believe we must adhere to, that is, that there is a very considerable reservoir of resources <Col N="280" /> available in the private sector and in voluntary organisations which must be fully availed of and not ignored and discouraged as at present.  In that connection I want just to mention an instance which I raised here a couple of times at Question Time with the Minister of the Ballindine Rehabilitation Centre provided by the Disabled Drivers' Association.  There is a case where a voluntary orginisation by their own efforts have done a magnificent job in providing a centre for rehabilitation and training of their members.  They have been tremendously successful in raising money and in getting on with the provision of this centre.  The Minister has set his face against their efforts.  He refuses to entertain any question of giving them a grant and in fact one detects a general air of hostility on the Minister's part towards that activity.  This is something I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>Our resources are scarce enough between what the general body of taxpayers can provide through the State and what can come from private sources and voluntary organisations. If we are ever to get anywhere near a reasonable level of a satisfactory comprehensive health service for all the people we will have to use every possible resource. We should not let ourselves have any blind spots about a particular area and if a voluntary organisation can do a job, encourage them to do it as in the case of the Disabled Drivers' Association.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, if in the private hospitals and nursing homes there are facilities and services available why not avail of them, why try to discourage these people from providing the services?  Certainly, I want to say that in our case on this side of the House, when it is our responsibility to propound a comprehensive health service we will certainly have as a central principle the full utilisation of all the resources which can be provided in the private sector and by voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>Also, I believe that the principle of insurance must be availed of to the greatest possible extent.  It is becoming increasingly clear in modern communities <Col N="281" /> that it is only through voluntary personal insurance that a really satisfactory standard of health can be provided for a large section of the community.  The value of voluntary health insurance in this country has been proved beyond any doubt. The Voluntary Health Insurance Board is the most successful State organisation ever established in this country.  It has proved that this is a way in which a satisfactory level of health services can be provided for a particular section of the community and I believe that part of the answer to a satisfactory health service for the future lies in that direction, bringing more and more people into the framework of voluntary health insurance.</P>
    <P>As I said, these are some indications of the way in which I believe we should proceed.  I believe that there is a very real danger at this stage that an appropriate level of services is not going to be provided in the community where they are needed because of a shortcoming in the financial provisions made by the Minister and the Government for health this year, and I believe the first thing to do is for the Minister to persuade the Government to make available the additional moneys which are needed to enable our services to be maintained at a satisfactory level in 1976.  That is the first thing which I want to impress upon the Minister.</P>
    <P>The second thing I want to say is that this situation in health which has arisen because of the budgetary crisis which the Minister for Finance has brought upon all of us, should be used to focus our attention on the need to plan our health services for the future, plan for their development and plan for their financing and I believe that that planning is needed now. There is still time to do it.  There is still time to develop a programme of development for health services which would be sensible and rational, which would be suitable to our needs and which would be within our capacity to pay for, particularly if built up upon the lines I have very briefly suggested. We still have time to do that.  I believe we should do it very soon.  I do not believe an inter-departmental <Col N="282" /> committee of officials of the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare is the way to do it. There are other vehicles and approaches to do that job.  I do not expect that this Government or this Minister is going to do it but I can assure the Minister that when it is our turn we will tackle this thing in a sensible, rational, progressive-minded fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with some interest to Deputy Haughey's contribution. I gather his argument is that he is looking for another £15 million which he says is the figure required to keep the health service going but I do not know that he approached the subject from the point of view of any constructive economies that should be made.  While he prefaced his remarks by saying that he had not got the facts that would enable him to make suggestions I would have imagined from the very ample brief which he has been supplied with that something on that line might have been forthcoming. We have to realise that health is not just a luxury; it is a necessity and as such a health service is an absolute necessity in a civilised society.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey made a very relevant point when he said that a free health service generates increasing demand for services.  This is all too evident.  Might I give an interesting figure in relation to how costings can escalate in accordance with the demands made on health services?  In relation to the dispensation and consumption of drugs as dispensed by doctors&mdash;I am talking about ethical drugs on doctor's prescription&mdash;two thirds of the entire drug consumption is consumed by one-third of the population and that one-third of the population are entitled to the general medical service.  These figures bear out what Deputy Haughey said.  They bear out another theory, that there seems to be a certain over-consumption and over-prescribing of drugs in a certain section of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If those figures which I have been given are correct it would seem to me that the paying patient is able to have his health for lesser drug consumption <Col N="283" /> than the patient who gets it free.  This appears to me to indicate a certain abuse of drugs.  I am talking about drugs handed across the counter.  My own experience and that of others is that drugs are prescribed and not used. One can go into a house where there is a general medical service card and see drugs lying around.  There is considerable abuse and it was right for the Department to issue a recommendation to health boards to tighten up in regard to prescribing drugs so far as they could.</P>
    <P>What positive steps can be taken? I suggest we are overdue a national formulary.  I know there will be objections because certain people will say certain drugs are incompatible in the case of certain people but medical advice can be obtained and if a person wants to go outside the national formulary or a doctor wants to prescribe outside of it, then let there be a charge. We are not in a position to pay for all we want in the way of health services. It has to be a mix, partly contributory and partly free, partly State-orientated and partly assisted by the private sector.  If what I suggest is done, there should be a considerable saving in costs.</P>
    <P>One need only look at a well-known publication on every doctor's desk which lists the drugs that can be obtained, their dosage, and price.  In this publication I have seen two drugs for an upper respiratory infection, one costing £1.50 and the other £6.  That was some time ago.  I happened to go into a house to find that two doctors had been treating members of the family and one had prescribed the £1.50 drug and the other had prescribed the £6 drug.  The family were having a feast of pills.  They were trying each others.  It was during the flu epidemic. With this kind of abuse one might as well write off the health services because there will be a lack of control and the end result will be that people will harm themselves.  It is time the medical profession took cognisance of this.  We are all paying for these abuses irrespective of whether we are insured workers or paying <Col N="284" /> from our own pockets.  It is adding a tremendous amount to the cost of the health services.  I have been advised by an executive in the health service that it is just short of scandalous the abuse that has taken place in the ordering and prescribing of drugs.  I know it is not easy at times for a doctor to tell a patient just to go to bed and keep warm for three or four days and he will be all right.  The doctor feels he must prescribe.  Indeed, very often patients demand a prescription and even name the particular antibiotic.  When we get to that stage the doctor ceases to be a medical adviser.</P>
    <P>I also believe that there is considerable abuse of out-patient departments in our hospitals.  That I put at the door of the doctors who do not like working after certain hours in the evening and, if there has to be a repeat injection, they send the patient to the out-patient department.  This adds considerably to the cost of hospital services.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one plea for one section of our community which has not been referred to so far.  I refer to farmers with abnormally high valuations like the farmers in the Macamore area in Wexford.  The valuations there are quite scandalous. In many cases the valuation is over £1 per acre.  Anybody under 70 acres should be eligible for certain services. I know they pay a yearly sum but I know the present position is having an adverse effect because their children are not getting the treatment they should.  We are neither unChristian nor uncharitable but there does come a time when parents simply have not got the money to meet the expense of hospital treatment for their children.  There is a good deal to be said for adopting the Isle of Man approach where all children, be they the children of paupers or millionaires, are entitled to free medical services.  We should be thinking along these lines.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey referred to the role of the private hospital.  There should be a better <i>per capita</i> subvention to the private nursing home and <Col N="285" /> hospital because these are taking a great part of the load off the general hospitals in making beds available for patients.  It is interesting to note that in England an increasing number of those entitled to free hospital services are now availing of treatment in private institutions.  Part of the reason is that they have to queue for the free service.  When a person is sick we should do everything possible to avoid a queue taking place and patients having to wait weeks or months for treatment.  We should also provide drugs free for those suffering from terminal illnesses no matter what their circumstances may be.  I am aware of cases where such people would not avail of these drugs because they felt it would be a waste of money and they did not want to burden their families with increased medical costs but in this day and age if people have this hardship and this tragedy before them, they should be able to go to the grave with an easy mind without burdening their family.  There is provision for certain conditions to be dealt with but there is room for further enlargement of the categories that qualify for free medicine.  I do not know if cancer qualifies, but if not I think it should.  It is obviously a terminal case and hospitalisation in those circumstances can be very expensive.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be said also for not using the absolute rule in respect of medical cards.  There should be a graded medical card whereby a person with a condition would be entitled to free service up to a certain amount. In Australia, for instance, people have a <i>per capita</i> allowance per year for dental services and if it goes beyond that they pay.  At least it gives them a start, and it is given by way of negative allowance against their tax bill. We have something of the same sort here if medical fees go beyond £50. There is a taxation allowance in that regard but very few people know about that, as far as I can gather.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters that the Minister just touched on.  There are new techniques in hospitals that are giving rise to greatly increased costs. It is interesting to note that there is <Col N="286" /> only approximately a 4 per cent improvement in cardiac cases with the intensive care units.  They provide only another 4 per cent with life, but it is an essential 4 per cent.  It is a very expensive service but it has to be provided to keep standards right.</P>
    <P>Another service provided is the medi-scan service.  Many people are complaining at the considerable cost, but it is a great thing to know that in 24 hours you can have a medi-scan.  You go into hospital for the night and they work through the night on you even in your sleep.  These are modern phenomena in the hospital service that require a very skilled team.  It is an around-the-clock service and it is very costly.  Naturally enough, a large part of this has to be met by State subvention. It is a good thing that the ratepayers do not have to pay for these services as they used to.  It has been a great relief, and in my own constituency transferring it to the Exchequer probably means relief of about £4 in the pound.</P>
    <P>While it might be easy to talk about providing another £15 million for propping up the health services, we have to look at ways of achieving economies, and we might have to consider a prescription charge for certain sections of society.  If a service is being abused by some people in the way I have referred to, possibly a charge might bring them somewhat to their senses, as it has gone completely beyond a reasonable attitude.  There is considerable abuse of the drug system and it is about time, in the interest of good health for the nation that something was done.  I am not speaking just from what I am told.  I am speaking from what I have observed.  I come from a medical family and I am aware of what is happening in this field.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Haughey in all that he says.  One thing I take exception to is his comment that on his side of the House they lay emphasis on the general medical service rather than on hospital care for all.  The most expensive element of medicine is hospitalisation.  Most of us are in hospital only once or twice in a lifetime, but it is something that a normal person has to be very <Col N="287" /> wealthy to carry himself.  Were it not for the voluntary health service many people would have to keep a very large nest egg, if they had a family, to face the medical charges that now have to be met when people go to hospital.  We can all be very grateful to the voluntary health service for what they have done in that regard.  I am one of the people within that category.  I do not know what I would do if there was not such a service for people like myself and those who do not qualify for the £12 or £15 payment per annum.  I am not decrying the voluntary health service when I say that comparing what one pays towards that service with what people are asked to pay under this service, it is fantastic that it can be done so cheaply, that there is such a small contribution asked of people.  It is a well worthwhile investment for people and I do not think they should complain about the small increase that is asked for in this Bill having regard to the greatly escalated costings that have to be faced in the health service. What we should be directing ourselves to is the avoidance of waste in the health service, and if we did that we might be able to provide a much better service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this measure before the House for increasing health contributions, I am baffled as to how the Minister was going to give a free for all service when he is now unable to provide the necessary finances to keep the present programme in operation.  All of the health boards had to make cutbacks in the estimates.  Some of the health boards are unable to make the cut-backs, and the Midland Health Board cannot do it without causing hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the estimates the health boards sent up to the Department were wrongly calculated, but from the information I have in the Midland Health Board area there is a general tightening up in all the services in operation.  There is going to be a tightening up as regards medical card holders.  The personnel have been told to cut down on bed clothing, laundry <Col N="288" /> work, drugs and also in regard to the menu.  If that takes place, I cannot see any great saving in that line because in the Midland Health Board region there was never any such wastage.  Transport is going to be curtailed also.  I do not know of any abuse in that regard.</P>
    <P>In the estimates sent to the Department of Health by the health boards, I do not think they allowed for at least 20 per cent inflation when they were paring down those estimates.  If there is 20 per cent inflation, that will mean that even if the additional money is provided for the health boards, they will have to come back in the middle of this year and look for more money from the Department of Health.  This is the kernel of the problem.</P>
    <P>As I was saying earlier, others may be better qualified than I to speak on this aspect but I would like anybody from the Government benches to tell me how you can give a free for all health service if you are not able to maintain the existing service at last year's level.  That is all I am asking. Now the Minister is trying to bulldoze a health scheme through this House which will provide a free for all health service.</P>
    <P>I want to talk now about the voluntary hospitals.  The Minister allowed them to increase their charges very substantially.  What I see happening here is that patients, instead of going in semi-private or private may now decide to go in public. That will bring additional pressures on the voluntary hospitals. As far as I know, notices have issued from the voluntary hospitals to the effect that they will have to watch their overtime, replacements during vacations, sick leave and so forth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde spoke about drug abuse and the over-prescribing of drugs.  This may happen in the area of mental illness.  We all know that that type of illness is very complex.  There may be some misuse of drugs in that area and that could be brought about when the patients attend the out-clinics. They will take home the drugs they get there, or they may put the <Col N="289" /> drugs in presses or the people in charge in the homes are allowing that to happen.  In the ordinary way, I do not believe doctors are putting extra expense on the health boards.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made, inside and outside the House, to the fact that people with medical cards are abusing them and that the medical profession are calling on them too often.  That is a problem.  If a doctor does not attend a patient when he is called and something happens to the patient, who is in trouble?  I am not backing the doctors but this is a fact which must be cleared up.  Since I came into this House several questions were put down to Ministers for Health about an ambulance being slow to come to a patient, to an accident or something happening in a hospital which should not have happened.  I cannot say whether that was right or wrong but this is the awkward position in which the medical profession find themselves. As far as I know they are carrying out their duties to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>There has been talk about prescriptions being expensive and cheaper drugs could be used instead of expensive drugs.  I do not know enough about this to speak on it and I do not intend to.  In my region the medical profession and the chemists carry out their jobs to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>Some homes which could take patients from surgical wards have not been paid the grants they should have got from the Department.  I said this over the years.  This has put an extra burden on the county hospitals.  I am referring specifically to my own county hospital when I say that.  Some of our wards are full.  Some of our aged have nowhere to go and others cannot go home because of circumstances outside their control.  Not alone is this happening in the midlands but it is happening all over the country.  The care of the aged is a very big problem at the moment. People are not prepared to look after them.  Some people do not want to care for these people but they want to take all they have and use it.  They want everything they can get from <Col N="290" /> the health boards and blame everybody else if they cannot get them into suitable homes.  They do not want to pay for them.  There is a limit to what we can do in that line.  If we got a little more help from the public at large, it could relieve the burden on our institutions.</P>
    <P>For quite some time I have been harping on home care allowances from the health boards.  In my opinion they are on the skimpy side and are no help.  An allowance of £2 or £3 is no good.  When cases are being examined by the boards their rules are found to be too strict.  It is my contention that if the health boards paid a little extra towards the care of the aged in their own homes, our institutions for senior citizens would not be called on to look after so many of these people.  We know, too, that it costs about £25 per week to keep a person in one of these institutions. Would it not be better that the Department direct the health boards to be more flexible in the allocation of moneys towards such items as home care allowance, fuel and so on? So far as the Midland Health Board are concerned there is much stringency of late in this regard and this situation is imposing an extra burden on the welfare homes.</P>
    <P>Recently the CEO of the Midland Health Board stated that they will have to keep within the estimate approved by the Department.  I do not know how this can be accomplished especially when, recently, they could manage only to reduce their estimate by about £500,000.  I do not know how they achieved that but now they must cut their spending by about another £400,000 and up to a week ago at any rate there was no sign of that money being made available by the Department. This can mean only a cutback in services and, unfortunately, the cutbacks start usually with the weaker sections of the community who are unable to defend themselves.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to be too critical of the health boards but it is said in some quarters that they are top heavy on the administration side with one fellow looking after another <Col N="291" /> so that, one would not know where he stands.  It would be worthwhile if economies could be effected at that level.  If the health boards are not given the money they require such services as meals on wheels and the care of the aged generally will be reduced. I understand that throughout the country the heads of geriatric units are in the process of carrying out examinations for the purpose of determining which patients might be sent home but, unfortunately, some of these people have no homes to go to. I had such a case last year.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to visualise the Minister thinking in terms of implementing a free for all hospital service when he is unable to maintain the level of last year's services.  So far as I am aware the health boards are being left short by about £10 million and I suspect that by the end of the year the shortfall will be in the region of £15 million.  If this money is not made up, there must be cutbacks.</P>
    <P>Regarding eligibility for medical cards, I would suggest including in that category regardless of income all those suffering from cancer, a disease which is very prevalent nowadays.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest organisations to be set up here was the VHI.  This body have been doing wonderful work and great credit is due to whoever instigated their establishment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>It was set up by a former colleague, Mr. Tom O'Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  Those who were not members of the VHI should consider becoming members. The average contribution is £1 per week which, in terms of today's values, is not a great amount.  Since the Department of Health cannot provide these medical services, the people must think in terms of how best they can provide them for themselves and that is why I advocate membership of the VHI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand, too, that school medical examinations are being curtailed and that this will have an adverse effect in so far as our children are <Col N="292" /> concerned.  As I said earlier, in making an attack on any health service, the Minister is getting into deep water although I am not blaming him entirely because he must have sanction for expenditure from the Minister for Finance and from the Government as a whole.  The cutbacks that will result from the shortage of money must have a serious effect because it is generally the people at the bottom of the ladder who suffer. They will affect the care of the aged, medical cards, home assistance, disabled allowances and all other such allowances and community facilities. Such cutbacks never affect the people at the top of the ladder, it is always the weaker sections of the community who suffer.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the position will be with the health boards in the financial state they are in now, but if they have to turn, like some of the county councils all over the country, to borrowing money from the banks to keep the services in operation that will be a very poor day.  Some of the county councils have to borrow money at the moment in order to maintain employment.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to talk to the Government and ask them to provide the additional money to keep the health boards in operation in the same way as they were last year. Nobody can deny that there is a lot of scaremongering going about to the effect that there will be cutbacks here, closures there, and some place else will not be open.  People all over are saying it.  The Press are also saying it.  They cannot all be wrong.  If in the middle of the year there is a shortfall in capital and the health boards have to resort to going to the banks, it will be a very bad day for us.  I do not believe money should be borrowed unless it is for productive purposes.  I do not believe in borrowing money to put the bread and butter on the table.  People who do that in their own homes are on the road.</P>
    <P>The CEO of the Midland Health Board stated that if that board did not contain their financial spending within the amount of grant they received from the Department the Minister would invoke <Col N="293" /> section 31 of the Health Act.  That is a serious position for any board to find themselves in because it will mean they will not be able to borrow money and must remain within the limit.  In order to do that, the health boards throughout the country will have to cut back on the services they are providing. The Midland Health Board cannot operate unless they get an additional £400,000 from the Department of Health.  I presume the Department have been asked for that money.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to let me know if that money has been granted to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to see this relatively small innocuous Bill which has created quite a furore between the medical profession and the Minister for Health.  The Bill merely intends to collect revenue.  It is merely to ensure that the direct contributions from those who are obliged to pay for the health services should be increased in line with inflation.  That is not even one-fourth of the answer to the problem.  Each working person in the country is paying £5 a week without getting anything.  This is a tiny drop in the ocean to what is happening. This should be borne in mind by the public at large.</P>
      <P>We have got to nail once and for all the myth that the more we pump into the health services the better services we will have.  In Britain after more than 20 years they find the waiting lists as long as they were in 1947 and the problems now are as great as if not greater than they were at that time. If you create the money the demand will increase and we are not solving the problem of our health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know there are urgent needs in the health services but these are not being served by the way we are deploying our resources.  A sum of £262 million is being spent this year on health services while many people are crying out for assistance towards the cost of a family doctor service; the drugs position is deplorable and a terrible indictment of the Department of Health.  There is abominable waste going on and the Department of <Col N="294" /> Health are responsible.  When I say this I am not indicting the Minister but the Department who have asked the Minister merely to carry on this tremendously wasteful programme they have.  They have never attempted to rationalise or to look at the matter from outside.  They are inside and they cannot see the wood for the trees.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health continue with each Minister to tell him the way this is to be done.  There will have to be changes in the Department of Health.  While £262 million is being spent on our health services a large number of people are saying that our health services are far from satisfactory, are inadequate and are not filling our needs.  The same old policy is being operated in the Department of Health.  When I suggested some time ago that an all-party committee of the Dáil be set up to investigate this terrible extravagance that is going on it was not accepted.  I was deluded into thinking that the Minister had approved my suggestion that an all-party committee of the Dáil be set up to investigate the structure of the health boards, how they were functioning and to see if we were getting proper value for money.  The Minister says he subscribes to the idea, but that means nothing.  I should like the Minister to say in reply to this debate, that he will, in the interests of the public, set up such a committee.  There is public disquite at the terrible extravagance that is going on in our health services.</P>
    <P>We do not have proper health services. Money is being wasted.  A sum of £262 million is no small sum.  I have a right to ask on behalf of the people that we get proper value for money and see that the money is going into areas which need it.  The problem which has arisen now between the medical profession and the Minister is one which we cannot debate because we do not have figures.</P>
    <P>The Minister says there will be no increase in the numbers eligible.  The medical organisations on behalf of the medical profession say 300,000 extra people will become eligible for the <Col N="295" /> health services and for the hospitalisation services.  I cannot ascertain what is right and what is wrong.  No Department can give the answers to this problem.  I do not know where the Minister gets his information when he says 85,000 people will become ineligible. I cannot get that information. I cannot find out the number of non-manual insured workers earning below £3,000 a year.  I cannot get information about their families.  We have an abysmal lack of information in regard to statistics.  We are the worst country in Western Europe in regard to statistics.  You can spend the whole day going from one Department to another and you will get no information.</P>
    <P>It is important to ask the Minister to clarify this.  What information has he to suggest that the numbers will not increase?  I will explain why I am saying all this.  If 300,000 extra people are added to our hospitalisation service, I am telling the Minister and the House that our hospital services will collapse.  It is as simple as that. The disadvantaged will suffer.  The people who are most in need, the people at the lower end of the ladder, will suffer because they will be relegated to the end of the queue.  Instead of waiting for two years for attention to be paid to an eye complaint, they will have to wait four or five years. That is what we are faced with.  If the medical organisations are correct in what they say about an extra 300,000 people added to our medical services, then I predict a total collapse of our health services.  That is a very serious charge to make.</P>
    <P>For the Minister's edification I will explain where those 300,000 will come from.  The medical profession say an extra 10 per cent will qualify, and that is 300,000 people.  That is what we must bear in mind.  That is what we must talk about.  At present our hospitals are bursting at the seams.  I am tired saying that in this House. Those who try to refute what I am saying, those who say I am exaggerating, should visit the hospitals, not the private hospital which was given £3 million by the State but the other <Col N="296" /> hospitals.  They should go and see how bad they are.  By normal sanitary standards some of them should be closed.  Infection is rife and disease is prevalent.  We hear talk about a national hospital plan being on paper but to me that is a myth.  Nothing is being done about it.  We had this in 1936.  We had it in 1966.  One Dublin hospital have a site since 1934.  They have been awaiting a decision from the planners, awaiting a decision from the Department of Health and waiting for Ministers for Health to make positive decisions to go ahead.  If an extra 300,000 people become eligible for our hospital services, our hospitals will not be able to cater for them. They will not be able to cope with this problem.</P>
    <P>I will give some details.  At present it takes two to two and a half years for inclusion for an operation for hip replacement.  Thousands are waiting on this.  In the north-west of Ireland, it takes two years for admission to an outpatients' department for an eye examination.  It takes two years for admission for a tonsil operation. These are some of the basic facts about our hospital services.  A previous Minister for Health denounced me in the Dáil because I said a famous professor said the health services for the coloured in Africa were better than ours.  He saw our hospitals and he said the coloured in Africa were treated better.  What he meant by that was that the coloured do not get a fair share of the service in southern Africa, but they are getting better attention and better hospital services than we were giving here. He made no bones about this.  We must look at the problem and see what is wrong.</P>
    <P>I believe the problem is not money. It is the waste and the extravagance and the wrong set of priorities.  You can throw in as much money as you like.  To me it is like throwing paper into a furnance.  It will burn up as fast as you throw it in.  The answer is not to throw in the money but find out what is the best thing to do.  You say: &ldquo;Let us rationalise.  Let us get proper value for this money.&rdquo;  We are not doing that.  No Minister has <Col N="297" /> taken on this task.  They all say: &ldquo;Let us call in consultants.  Let us employ the American system.&rdquo;  It does not call for any expertise to know what is wrong with our services.  It has been spelled out over and over again.  It is obvious to us all and we must decide what to do about it.  That is why I suggested we might set up an all-party committee to examine the whole structure and to see that this £260 million is being properly spent on behalf of the public.  I have a right to ask for that.  The public are paying for it.</P>
    <P>It is important for me to refer to drugs now.  We all have a notion that doctors are abusing the whole question of drugs.  There are life-saving drugs which are vital to the community. Properly used they can save lives.  I should like to refer to the recent tragedy when a child was not seen in time.  Without knowing the full facts of the case, I think it is important to dwell on it now to see what we can do to avert further tragedies where a life could be lost.  I am not saying that if the doctor had arrived in time that life could have been saved but we must think about this.  One life is very precious in our society.  If one life is lost accidentally it is up to us to have a proper investigation and to see that this does not happen again.</P>
    <P>We are living in an age when everybody wants time off.  People are making more demands on doctors. They are going to them more often and with more trivial complaints.  A doctor is tired when he has done a lot of work and he wants time off to study and to keep up to date and also for leisure.  It seems to me that in the case to which I am referring they had no family doctor.  Everybody should have a family doctor who could educate them on health as well as illness.  From my information there was no family doctor and they looked up the yellow pages.  A doctor who is overburdened is reluctant to take over the case of another doctor.</P>
    <P>In a situation like that where people cannot get a doctor and where they think the problem may be serious, we <Col N="298" /> might have the task assigned to one hospital of having a telephone number which would be regularly advertised to the public.  This would be open to abuse.  As I said about social welfare, it is open to abuse, but you cannot close down the labour exchanges or the Department of Social Welfare because the system is open to abuse.  I am suggesting that you could have doctors at the end of a telephone as part of a national public service.  When they learned what the case was, and when they heard a doctor was not available within a reasonable time they could undertake the task of contacting the doctor or his <i>locum</i>.  If he was not available they would have the right to direct an ambulance to take the case to a hospital.  There is a lot of work and extra expense involved but one life is very precious and if we can avert further tragedies such as happened we will be serving a very useful purpose. We must look at this matter because I do not think it will be the only tragedy. I know the Minister is sympathetic to this problem and I would ask him to consider whether this service might be made available.  Many people do not know what is an urgent case, when they telephone a doctor they may not give the message correctly.  I remember having an answering machine on my telephone.  On one occasion a child was sent out to phone and just gave the message that I was to come to Mrs. Smith.  When I got the message I had to go through a whole file and it took me hours.  A hospital could easily take on the task of a central service; it might be regarded as part of the postgraduate work of doctors.  I felt very sorry about the case that was mentioned because I realised it could have been my child.  If it had been perhaps I would have gone berserk.  Perhaps an antibiotic drug could have saved that child.</P>
    <P>There are life-saving drugs and they have relieved the pressure on hospital beds.  In the past where there were cases of severe chest and other infections we could not take a chance but now we can prescribe antibiotics. There is a certain feeling of confidence because we know that the antibiotic will hold any secondary infection <Col N="299" /> at bay and it is not necessary to see the person every few hours.  There are some magnificent drugs for heart, blood pressure and for kidney trouble. They have revolutionised the treatment, they have made doctors' lives much simpler and have improved the outlook for people.</P>
    <P>There are other drugs that are unnecessary and ones we could do without. There is a little too much reliance on tranquillisers and sedatives. I have consistently maintained the view that unbranded drugs not only may be ineffective but may be dangerous.  I have seen what happened in dispensaries prior to the introduction of the choice of doctor scheme and I saw literally tons of tablets being destroyed.  They were bought in bulk by the combined purchasing section of the Department of Local Government.  They came in tins containing 10,000 or 20,000 tablets with a label stuck on the outside. They were unmarked white tablets. The adhesive on the labels was not secure, the labels fell off and the result was that the whole cannister was unmarked.  This, of course, was a complete loss.</P>
    <P>A company was set up here called Intercontinental Pharmaceuticals.  I can name the man concerned; he is in Cyprus at the moment inflicting himself on the poor people there.  His name was Sigmund Ziecko.  It was not his right name&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not his right name; he had five or six names.  The name he used was not the right name, as they found out in Britain.  He started to import a drug here and he told everyone he could let them have it at quarter the price.  My own mother died because the drug did not work.  It was only syrup and there was no antibiotic in it.  I did not realise this until I saw a similar case in Britain.  In that instance a child died, the pathologist had the drug tested and it was found that it was <Col N="300" /> only ordinary syrup.  I questioned the then Minister for Health, the late Donogh O'Malley, and courageously he said that the drugs were bought by the Department but that they had to withdraw many of them.  They were not effective and they did not have the right potency; in fact, some of them had nothing at all.  I remember that the Dublin Health Authority, despite a warning from the Minister for Health, bought drugs to the value of £28,500 and they had to be discarded. It was a game of conmanship in selling these drugs.  They were available at a special price to the health service here.  In Britain this man did the same kind of thing.  He had powder formed into capsules and he called it ampicillin but it was not that at all.  All of the people connected with this case started to sue this man but he formed £100 companies and nothing could be done. There is the danger that in the interests of economy we may be providing inferior type drugs and, secondly, that we may not have enough control over them.</P>
      <P>I am open to correction on this, but I think the National Drugs Advisory Board have quality control of certain drugs but I do not know if they can do this with regard to unbranded drugs.  We must be careful in this area.  Of course there are abuses with regard to drugs.  The choice of doctor scheme has been in operation for only three years and it is inevitable that there will be abuses.  If there are frequent pleas to doctors to be more discriminating and selective in their use of drugs we will reach a situation where drugs will be used for their proper purpose.  We must educate the public not to expect a prescription at the end of every medical consultation and we must dispel the notion that there is a pill for every ailment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drugs cost about 3.5 per cent of the health service&mdash;certainly not more than 10 per cent&mdash;but in comparison with the saving effected by way of easing pressure on hospital beds they are serving a good purpose.  If we are more selective and if patients do not ask for drugs for every sickness we can eliminate any waste.  However, <Col N="301" /> that is only one small aspect of the cost of the services.  We must look at some of the other problems.  The greatest costs in hospitals are labour costs.  The costs in respect of doctors form the lowest proportion and the costs for nursing personnel are the highest.  We must have regard to the fact that we have only so many hospital beds.  There is a tremendous demand on them and the waiting lists are so long that I get fed up trying to get a patient into a hospital.  I can see the answer all the time.  We must remember that the out-patient departments of the hospitals can be streamlined. I have said that over and over again but nobody listens.  We must tell the medical and nursing professions and other ancillary bodies that the out-patient departments must be streamlined.  We must have X-ray departments working around the clock.  It is expensive equipment and to close down such a department at 5 o'clock in the evening is ludicrous. It is unnecessary waste.</P>
    <P>If we had the X-ray departments working around the clock we would get proper use of them and reduce considerably the waiting lists for these out-patient departments.  We should introduce proper diagnostic centres so that patients would not have to be admitted to hospital for investigation.  I am opposed to a person being admitted to a hospital for investigation because there is no more unpleasant or depressing place than a hospital, particularly when a person is sent in for investigation.  It should be possible to carry out all the investigations on an out-patient basis, if we were properly rationalised and organised.  This is long overdue but the Department of Health are ignoring this important aspect of the matter.  We could arrange to have a person X-rayed and blood tests taken in a short time.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the questions of appointments to see specialists.  I have looked at this on many occasions and wondered what is wrong.  I came to the conclusion that one would have to see the problem first.  Nobody seems to realise until he comes in contact with the situation <Col N="302" /> what is wrong.  Anybody who has had the misfortune to look for an appointment for eye examination finds himself in a terrible predicament and having to wait for months.  I have suggested&mdash; I have written about this matter on many occasions&mdash;that we might take in the opticians.  I talked to the ophthalmologists and they say that clinical assistants should be taken in.  The clinical assistants they are referring to are doctors who have a diploma in opthalmology but who do not wish to become absolute specialists.  They could assist by doing routine examinations of the eyes.</P>
    <P>I do not take the word of the medical profession as gospel and I do not hold any brief for the medical profession, and they know that, but we have a precedent for the employment of opticians in our health services.  I cannot see why an optician cannot be employed in an out-patient department to check eyes.  It is ridiculous to have an eye specialist whose skills should be employed in complicated eye work doing routine testing of the eyes.  This is where the expense is being abused. The whole system is wrong.  It is wrong to have an eye specialist earning £12,000 a year just testing eyes when an optician could do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister may tell me that it cannot be done but I intend to show him that he is wrong because the Minister, as Minister for Social Welfare, is already doing it for social welfare patients.  If it can be done for such patients why can it not be done in the health service? It is the most ludicrous thing I have ever heard of.  I do not see why the Minister does not call in the opticians tomorrow and make an arrangement with them to work under the supervision of doctors in out-patient departments.  If that was done instead of waiting for one year for an appointment in a hospital a patient would only have to wait one week.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as Minister for Health, bears a great responsibility.  I should like to tell him that a lot of people have gone blind&mdash;I say that without intending to cause alarm&mdash;as a result of this waiting list.  There are certain conditions that if treated in time would result in people keeping their sight. <Col N="303" /> Glaucoma is a dangerous condition and if not attended to in time can cause blindness.  Patients have to wait up to two years but in the end it is too late and there is nobody to tell them that it was the cause of the Department of Health because the people do not know otherwise.  The blame lies with the Department of Health and I have no hesitation in indicting that Department for not looking at that situation.  Is that rationalisation?  Does that indicate that we are providing a proper health service?  I do not think so and I do not care what the Minister, or his advisers, say.  I could not have respect for advisers who do not advise their Minister properly, especially when people go blind.</P>
    <P>I said this two years ago but nothing was done.  I will be saying it again two years hence unless I force the Minister into doing something about it.  Why can we not get such rationalisation in the hospitals so that we can get a higher bed occupancy rate?  Does a patient, after an operation for appendicitis, have to stay in the hospital under skilled care and attention for the duration of his stay?  Such a patient is out of bed one day after the operation. Why can he not be moved to a hostel attached to the hospital where he can be watched and where he can go to a canteen to get his own food?  This would reduce the cost enormously and get beds for those on the waiting list. This is the way we must talk about improving the service when we are talking about £260 million which I say is being wastefully used in this service. It is costing the people a lot of money and they have a right to ask questions. Nurses and doctors are very expensive. I do not think a nurse should be employed to take in a meal to a person who is up and about when that person could be moved to another section of the hospital.</P>
    <P>I said this five or six years ago but nothing was done about it.  The Minister has boasted that he is giving more to the health services than was ever given but to me that is an indictment of a Minister.  It means that there is more expense, more waste and more inefficiency.  It would be possible to <Col N="304" /> have a proper health service without that amount of money.  Were I Minister I would not boast that I was giving more of the GNP to the health services. I would be afraid to say that.</P>

      <P>Unless we look at this in a rational manner we will not improve the service.  We could get in 2,000 dentists but does that solve our problem?  We can have all the teeth extracted and everything done but that is not solving our problem.  We must look at each facet of the problem to see what is wrong.  The officials of the Department of Health must think that I am paranoiac about them because I attack the Department at every opportunity.  I wrote to the Minister for Health in 1959 having seen patients, while I was working as a doctor in a hospital, delayed and kept in hospitals because the consultant did not come in. I thought it was terribly unfair to these patients.  I wrote to the Minister for Health, Mr. McEntee, about this, and put forward a suggestion to him.  I said how we could reduce the number of days a patient spends in hospital. No doubt, the Minister never saw the letter.  The adviser in the Department wrote back and said: &ldquo;The Minister has asked me to reply to your letter and to tell you that he has no function in the matter.&rdquo;  That is typical.  That was the Department of Health to me and from then on I lost respect for the Department of Health.  I could never have respect for the Department unless there are major changes made in it.  The Minister knows that I feel that way about it.  I have seen several mistakes made by the Department over and over again.  I have seen the cover up about things.  I could not say enough against that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have we seen any evidence of proper <Col N="305" /> output budgeting?  Have we seen any testing and monitoring of different programmes coming from that Department? We have not.  We have seen nothing.  They just say that they need more money but they never say why. That is the question we have to ask&mdash; why?</P>
    <P>We are forced into this situation at the moment.  I condemn the situation at the moment because these cutbacks did not come from the Department of Health in an effort to rationalise.  That is different.  If organised cutbacks had come from the Department of Health I would be the first to stand up and pay tribute to the Department.  If the Department of Health had said: &ldquo;We are doing this because&mdash;&rdquo; I would pay tribute to them.  This was the problem of the health boards.  The cutbacks were crisis measures imposed by a Minister for Finance who said: &ldquo;There is not any left&rdquo;.  They were not planned cut-backs. There was no adequate notice given of them.  If they had stemmed from that motive I would have seen merit in them and would have been the first to praise the Department.  They came as crisis measures.  They cut back everything.  That is what caused the trouble.  There was no planned action. I do not see any evidence of planning within that Department under this Administration.  McKinsey and Company thought they might structure it on the lines of the American&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have seen no proper budgetary programme from the Department of Health.  Maybe I have seen evidence of conversion to rationing health services from Michael B. Cooper's book in Britain but I do not see any policy objectives.  The day I see that is the day I will be paying tribute to the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>I have been preaching for a long time that we should pay more attention to health education.  What do we see in health education?  We see a pretence at educating the public about health, a few advertisements on television. Do we see proper courses of instruction in schools about the functions of the body, about the need for health, about the need for exercise, the need for proper recreation?  We do not see anything like that.  Do we see proper liaison with the Department of Education about including such courses on the curriculum?  Is the Minister aware that there is a very high percentage of people who do not even know the normal physiological functions of the body?  This is what we should have in health education, not just an advertisement about drink, tobacco and drugs. That is one facet.  When I get up and talk about health education they say: &ldquo;That is it.  We will do that&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It is a drop in the ocean compared with the £262 million being spent on health.  It is very small. That money could have been quadrupled to produce what we are aiming at, that is, teaching people to pay more attention to health so that they will not have to avail of drugs and doctors' services, so that they will be able to assess their problems, so that we will be talking in terms of a healthy nation instead of an illness orientated nation, which is now the policy that is so prevalent. I would not be proud of the fact that we throw so much money or such a percentage of the GNP into <Col N="307" /> the service.  I would prefer to talk about what we spend on educating the people about health.  I may be perverse. I may be too unorthodox to meet the norms of our society but I believe we should talk about health education on a vast scale.  not just in the area of drugs and drink and tobacco.  It is more than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will come to that.  Perhaps I will mention some problems in our own profession, for whom I hold no brief.  We have to look <Col N="308" /> at the whole question.  I said this a long time ago.  First we have to decide who is to decide the priorities.  Is it the doctors?  We have so much money and we have to spend it to the best advantage.  Who is going to make the decision as to where that money is going to be spent?  Who will decide the priorities?  A replacement operation may make a person ambulatory but the question of age comes into it.  I mentioned in the Dáil a year ago the case of an 80-year-old man who had a hip replacement operation.  To me that was an abominal waste of money because of the fact that he was 80 years of age.  The chances of his wanting to run in the Olympics were remote.  I wondered why we should spend the money involved on an 80-year-old person.  I do not want to deprive anyone of anything.  The risks involved in a major operation on a man of that age were too great.  He survived the operation but he was never mobile again. That is what I want to say.  Therefore, I must ask who will make the decision and I have asked this before.  Are we to decide that an operation which may cost £1,000 and involve £300 a week in maintenance for that person is the best thing to do or are there greater priorities?  Is it better to think of children who may need vital operations? These are problems that will face any Minister for Health.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners inform me that in assessing nine employees of the Office of Public Works for the year 1975-76 allowances to which the employees had been entitled for earlier years were granted.  Due to pressure of work in the office of the inspector of taxes in connection with the proposed application of the PAYE system to the public service there was delay in completing the examination of the return forms lodged by the nine employees concerned, which showed that some of the allowances granted were not due.  As a result, there were undercharges to tax amounting to £60 to £64 in individual cases which normally fell to be recovered by the end of the tax year, that is, April 5, 1976, and this resulted in higher weekly tax deductions.  The Office of Public Works have now been advised by the Revenue Commissioners to revert to the original amount deductible in each of the nine cases, and to make an appropriate adjustment in respect of the increased deductions already made.  The underpayments will be recovered over the year 1976-77 under the PAYE system.</P>
