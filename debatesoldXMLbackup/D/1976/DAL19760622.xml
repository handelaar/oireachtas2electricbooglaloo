      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of individuals, in the building and construction category, who were on the live register in May, 1975, and May, 1976; and the actual and percentage change as between the two years.</P>

      <P>Data from the industrial analysis of the live register for May, 1976, are not yet available. However, the corresponding figures for April are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The number of persons in the building, contracting and works of construction industry who were on the live register on 18th April, 1975, and on 15th April, 1976, were 19,857 and 24,907 respectively.  This represents an actual increase of 5,050 or 25.4 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health why a child (name supplied) who was referred for orthodontic treatment to Marino Clinic by the Vernon Avenue dental clinic, Dublin, in September, 1973, has not yet received it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. P. Barry) Richard Barry">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment in this case is the responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because other dental complications were present and had to be treated satisfactorily this patient was not <Col N="1304" /> ready for active orthodontic treatment until April, 1976.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated in reply to previous parliamentary questions&mdash;Official Report, 27th April, 1976, Volume 290, columns 7 and 8&mdash;the board have decided in the light of the resources available to them for dental services generally to give priority to basic dental services for children and to defer for the time being the commencement of active orthodontic treatment.  Such services are generally accepted as having a higher priority than orthodontic treatment.</P>
    <P>The board will review this child's case in September next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the child in question is one of a family of 11, that the intermediate dental treatment to which the Parliamentary Secretary refers was carried out a long time after it was prescribed, that it was paid for by the father out of his own pocket at a cost of £28 and that, in effect, this child, whose parents were informed that the orthodontic treatment was urgent approximately two years ago, is still without that treatment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the treatment of this child was going on for two years.  All this treatment was a necessary prerequisite to the orthodontic treatment.  As I said in reply to a previous question, orthodontics have not got a high priority and basic dental treatment is considered by the Department and the board to be the essential just now in the present stringent financial circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary accept that in this case the basic dental treatment to which he referred was not prescribed for a considerable time and when eventually carried out was paid for by the father, not the Eastern Health Board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Information that anything was paid by the father is new to me.  The Deputy will appreciate that the Eastern Health Board decided that new cases for orthodontic treatment would not be treated until later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1305" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it that anyone in need of orthodontic treatment under this scheme, whether urgently or not, will not get it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not implied in the answer.  I said it will be reconsidered in September of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Although it was required almost three years ago in this case, it will not be reconsidered even until September next and may not then be granted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that there was a delay of a couple of years was not the fault of the Eastern Health Board or the Department of Health. Extra treatment had to be given to this child to prepare the child for orthodonic treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider the manner in which this child was examined and eventually prescribed for was satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the reports of the dental surgeons.  Everything done over the past couple of years was done at the request of the dental surgeons involved in the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it did not take nearly three years to get fillings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only go by what the dental surgeons tell me.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to a statement (details supplied) that by the end of this year there will be 1,000 children awaiting ophthalmic services in the Eastern Health Board region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the statement referred to by the Deputy. Waiting lists for children seeking ophthalmic services in the Eastern Health Board area are increasing. Officials of my Department and the board are examining the situation to see if improvements can be effected within existing financial constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1306" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The last few words of that answer are most worrying.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the present financial structure or words to that effect.  We have to face the fact that the eyesight of some of these children may be permanently injured because of the waiting period entailed by the failure of somebody to provide proper services.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary consider this as a matter of urgency and even emergency so that we can offer some hope to these children that their eye problems will be dealt with in the next few months, not years?  The last boy or girl on this list may have to wait years for treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately for years some children had to wait for many months before obtaining an appointment with an ophthalmologist. I agree this delay is annoying for the parents and for the children themselves. I can only hope that, with the discussions which are taking place now between the Department, the Eastern Health Board and others, the situation will be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the discussions be finalised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>They are on at the moment.  I assure the Deputy I will ask to have them expedited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the amount of money in current and in real terms allocated for roads in 1974, 1975 and 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>Road Fund grant allocations were £16 millions for the nine-month period of 1974 and £21.006 millions and £20.4 millions for the full years of 1975 and 1976 respectivedy.</P>
      <P>It has been estimated that there were cost increases affecting the building and construction industry of 20.8 per cent between 1974 and 1975 and 19 per cent between 1975 and 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Deputy that since 1973 the total provided by <Col N="1307" /> Central Government to local authorities by way of grants, including Road Fund grants, subsidies and capital allocations has increased from about £103 million to £235 million.  In other terms, 58 per cent of the total estimated spending in 1976 by local authorities will be met by funds provided by the State, compared with 50 per cent in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>Finally, as I have already indicated, Road Fund grants in 1975 and 1976 have been so allocated and are so expended as to afford the maximum protection possible to the employment of road workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister has a bad case he invariably endeavours to compare two things which are not alike.  Would the Minister agree that the cutback in real money terms for roads will result in further unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rather strange, if we can employ more people with less money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of work being done has a big effect on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if he has instructed local authorities to cutback on the buying of road building materials&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, if that were so, would he not agree it would create a further source of unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not given any such instruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He is cutting the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not cut the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The money has been cut very considerably if we take it in real terms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A question, please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and compare the amount that is given this year <Col N="1308" /> with last year.  Is the Minister satisfied that, with the amount of money being made available, the roads will not deteriorate to an extent which will leave them almost unusable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am perfectly satisfied. As a matter of fact, a great deal of the money will be spent this year on roads which have not had attention for many years, because there are some new construction works which normally would be done but which are not being done this year.  That will not result in a deterioration of the roads.  I grant the Deputy that it will result in new roads not being built, but the money so saved will be spent on roads for which the county engineers have been asking for extra money for about 20 years and have not been able to get it.  As a matter of interest, the estimated road expenditure for 1974 was £42 million; 1975, £45 million; and 1976, £48.5 million, that is, counting the State grants and what is put up by the local authorities.  Therefore I do not know how the cutback Deputy Faulkner is talking about could have occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that, if inflation is taken into consideration, very much less money is being made available this year than last year and that instead of workers being seen on the roads, now all that is seen are whitewashed tar barrels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner is obviously referring to the national primary roads.  He does not see workers on some of the big jobs where machinery would eat up the money made available, but it would not do the Deputy any harm to go on to the side roads and take a look at the many workers employed on roads where they have not put a shovel for 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister let the House know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was asked for the figures in current and real <Col N="1309" /> terms.  He gave them in current terms, but I do not think he gave them in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I have not got that here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I will get the figures for Deputy Faulkner.  I have not got them in my brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister enlighten the House as to why he does not have this figure, considering that is what he was asked for?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister reconcile his statement that more money is available for roads this year with the circular he has sent to local authorities asking them to ensure that permanent staff would be kept in employment, something we did not need to have before?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a misunderstanding, because what I said, in fact, was that the money should be expended for the purpose of ensuring employment for road workers, because there are more than the permanent people employed.  Deputy Gallagher must be aware that his party did a rather peculiar thing; they divided up the money between the councillors so that a certain amount would be spent in each area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. May I ask your direction as to what the position is where a Minister is asked in a written question for information and then does not produce it? If you have no function in this matter, which may be the position, I would <Col N="1310" /> suggest that to allow this to pass without comment is affecting the rights of every Member of the House.  If it is your position, Sir, that you cannot control this, could I ask if you would refer the matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Sir, when you say you have no control over the Minister and his replies, surely you have the same control over a Minister as you have over any other Deputy, and if a Minister misleads the House, you have a function to correct the situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the deteriorating supply position and the sharply increasing prices of timber used in house building; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware through the recent report of An Foras Forbartha on the materials supply position for housing that certain difficulties have arisen in the supply of timber in recent <Col N="1312" /> months.  These, I understand, arise from the policy of importers and merchants to reduce the high level of stocks they were carrying coupled with the policy of buying forward on a cautious short-term basis.  I understand also that the practice of allowing price discounts when large stocks were being carried may have been affected by these policies leading to some increase in prices.  My information is that, at this stage, it seems unlikely that a serious shortage of materials will develop leading to prolonged delay.  The position, however, in regard to supply and price is being kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the complete loss of confidence in Government policy in relation to the building industry by those involved in that industry has been responsible for the running down of the stocks of timber and that the new stocks now being purchased at vastly increased prices will result in increases in the price of new houses in the future and that those who would normally buy or build their own house will be unable to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that at all.  When I took office one of the first things I ran into&mdash;Deputy Faulkner made me aware of it if he was not then in charge&mdash;was that there was a shortage of timber.  It could equally be said then that this resulted in an increase in house prices but I never made that claim and I do not think it applies now any more than it did then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that large stocks of timber were in the merchants' timber yards because they were led to believe by the Government that there would be immediate use for it?  Instead such merchants have now lost complete confidence in the industry because of the policy of the Government and this will create a serious problem for those who have to buy houses in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Must I repeat again that for the last three years Fianna Fáil were in power the average number of houses built was 14,600 per year?  Nothing <Col N="1313" /> less than 25,000 houses per year were built by the present Government. Bearing that in mind Deputy Faulkner should try and face reality.  He should realise that nearly twice the number of houses are being built annually compared with when his party were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister has side-tracked this issue will the Minister agree that in the second last year of Fianna Fáil administration 15,000 houses were built while in the last year of Fianna Fáil administration 21,500 houses were built?  Would the Minister agree that preparations were made for the building of more houses in the following year and that he built the houses on the basis that the plans had been prepared for him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only go on the basis of a statement issued by Fianna Fáil in November, 1972, when they stated that there might be as many as 17,000 or 18,000 houses needed by the 1980s, if the money was available. Deputy Faulkner should look up that statement and see what the position would be had they remained in Government. Do not try to get away from that; it is around your neck and it will stay there.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the sharp drop in the number of local authority and private dwellings authorised or begun in the first quarter <Col N="1314" /> of 1976 as compared with the corresponding quarter of 1973; and if he will state the steps he proposes to take to improve the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that there has been a drastic fall in the number of dwellings completed in the first quarter of 1976 as compared with the corresponding quarter of 1975; and if he will state the measures he proposes to take to improve the output of the house-building industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the statistics for dwellings completed for the first quarter of 1976 issued by my Department recently show a drop in the level of completions as compared with the first quarter of 1975 and that the number of local authority houses commenced in the first quarter of 1976 is slightly down compared with the first quarter of 1975.</P>
      <P>These figures are accounted for by the accelerated pace of the local authority building activity in 1975 arising from particularly favourable building conditions during the year, which resulted in a substantial proportion of dwellings being completed last year which would normally have reached completion stage in the first quarter of 1976.  Deputies are aware that in fact 8,794 local authority dwellings were completed in 1975 or about 1,300 more than the estimated level for that year.  Resources available for local authority housing have been increased by 20 per cent, but because of the high level of commitments the amount available for new starts was necessarily restricted.  I am reviewing the level of expenditure and output on the local authority programme at present and I will make additional allocations for further new work later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the non-local authority sector, while dwellings completed in the first quarter were down in comparison with 1975 and were not as high as I would like, they were still in excess of each of the last three quarters of 1975.  I understand that <Col N="1315" /> recent indications suggest a recovery of the position in that sector.</P>
    <P>Generally, factors which will influence house-building activity arise from the provision for housing in the public capital programme for 1976 and the availability of loan finance from the principal lending agencies, which in total is estimated at approximately £228 million.  Investment of this order should ensure that house-building activity should continue at a high level in 1976.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that a drop of 27 per cent in the total number of houses completed in the first quarter of this year as compared with the same period last year is a disaster?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the repercussions in the employment aspect of the house-building industry will be more severe than they have been?  We have already been given figures by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach to show how severe the position is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>About 1,300 more houses were finished last year than it was estimated would be finished because of a number of matters, particularly the fine weather and the fact that the money was available for them.  This resulted in the number of houses which would normally be finished in January or February this year being completed in November or December last year.  It is simple to understand that and I am amazed Deputy Faulkner, a member of a Government who could not exceed 4,100 local authority houses in any year, is complaining about 8,974 local authority houses being erected last year.  As Deputy Lynch is still present I should like to point out to him, although he denies this, that on 17th December, 1975, at column 1788 of the Official Report he stated:</P>
      <P>What has gone wrong is that there are too many local authority houses being built as against houses owned by the people which is what most Irish people aspire to.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are becoming, and have been for many years, the biggest landlords in the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner now tells us that we are not building enough local authority houses although Deputy Lynch in December maintained we were building too many.  There are two voices now.</P>

      <P>The Minister, when he is in serious difficulties, tries to side-track the issue.  I am again asking the question: does he not regard a reduction of 27 per cent in the number of houses built in the first quarter of this year as compared with the first quarter last year&mdash;8,381 houses were built in the first quarter last year compared with 6,134 in the first quarter this year&mdash;as a disastrous situation? Over a period we have had a very severe fall in the number of people employed in the building industry and this will create a further problem.</P>

I do not know whether the Deputy can count or not, but if there is an average of almost 26,000 a year as compared <Col N="1317" /> with an average of 14,600 it is hard to know what he is talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the withholding of State grants from 50 per cent of the people entitled to them, coupled with the low level of SDA loans, the shortening of the repayment period from 35 to 30 years and the high interest rate of 12½ per cent on these loans created chaos in the private house-building sector?

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not.  In view of the fact that Deputy Tunney made a statement which was not correct, may I be allowed to correct it?  I told local authorities that where they had more than three years' estimated supply of land they should not expend money they get to build houses on buying more land. <Col N="1318" /> If they feel there is a special reason why they need more, they should apply to the Department and they will be given authority to do so.

      <P>Would the Minister agree it is generally accepted that it takes approximately three years for acquisition, provision of services and building and completion of houses, and that what is happening now is that the Minister, having operated on the basis of what was available to him from the previous Government, is now operating on his own and in conjunction with his Coalition colleagues, and the result is a drastic drop in the number of houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a lot of nonsense. Deputy Colley should know, although he may not, it is true that it takes a considerable time to acquire land in certain cases.  Houses which were planned in the middle of last year have been finished and people are living in them.  That is what was wrong with Fianna Fáil&mdash;they spent seven years planning houses and put off building them.  All the excuses in the world were given but they just could not do it.

I said there were 1,300 local authority <Col N="1319" /> houses, and I do not know how many private houses completed last year that were not estimated for completion until the first, second or even third month of this year.  This has shown a reduction.  All the repetition in the world by Deputy Faulkner will not alter the situation&mdash;there are 8,792 people living in local authority houses, following their commencement and erection last year.  By the end of this year we will be up on our target and the Deputy need not worry about this.  It has happened for three years in succession and I expect it will happen in the fourth year also.</P>

This matter has been engaging the attention of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for some time.  This new development is causing concern as it has important implications for the future of the sugar industry in this country.

Chomh fada siar leis an 20ú lá de mhí na Nollag, 1973, thairg mise mar Aire na Gaeltachta deontas ó mo Roinnse, deontas 70 faoin gcéad, chun foirgneamh nua agus gléasra áirithe a chur ar fáil don comharchumann. Fuarthas litir ón gcomharchumann á rá go rabhardar sásta leis an deontas sin.  Iarradh orthu ansan plean agus meastachán chostais a chur chuig mo Roinnse ach go dtí an lá seo ní bhfuartas an plean ná an costas sin.

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Supplementary Protocol to the Association Agreement between the European Economic Community and Turkey consequent on the accession of new member States to the Community, signed on 30 June, 1973, and the terms of the related Supplementary Internal Financial Agreement concerning the aforesaid Supplementary Protocol signed on 30 June, 1973, which have been laid before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Ireland, Britain, and Denmark undertook under article 108 of the Accession Treaty to apply the provisions of agreements of the Communities with certain third countries including Turkey, and this motion is before the Dáil today in order to enable Ireland to comply with her legal obligations under the article. The evolution of the association between the Community and Turkey is basically one of three phases: an original agreement, an additional protocol and further financial protocol and, finally, the supplementary protocols consequent on the accession of new member states to the Community.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the original agreement of association with Turkey, which was signed in 1963, was &ldquo;to ensure a continuous improvement in living conditions in Turkey and in the European Economic Community through accelerated economic progress and the harmonious expansion of trade, and to reduce the disparity between the Turkish economy and the economies of the member states of the Community&rdquo;.  The eventual accession of Turkey to the Communities was envisaged in article 28: but in fact, Turkey has not applied for membership.</P>
    <P>The agreement provided that the association would be implemented in three stages: a preparatory stage of at least four years' duration to enable Turkey to strengthen its economy; a transitional stage during which a customs union would be established; and a final stage entailing the intensification of the co-ordination of the economic policies of the parties of the agreement.  In November, 1970, the Community and Turkey signed <Col N="1344" /> an additional protocol to the association agreement, a further financial protocol and an agreement on products within the province of the European Coal and Steel Community. The additional protocol acknowledged the completion of the first &ldquo;preparatory stage&rdquo; and instituted the second &ldquo;transitional stage&rdquo; of the association agreement.</P>
    <P>The additional protocol, which like the further financial protocol was ratified in December, 1972, and came into force on 1st January, 1973, provides for:</P>
    <P>(i)  total customs exemption for all Turkish industrial goods exported to the Community with partial exemptions only for certain textile and petroleum products,</P>
    <P>(ii)  considerable and increasing preferences for Turkish agricultural products exported to the Community, with full free movement planned at the end of a 22-year period, during which the Turkish agricultural policy would be aligned to that of the Community, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  the dismantling by Turkey of its tariffs against Community exports over a period of 12 years or 22 years in the case of certain sensitive products.  Within that period Turkey will gradually apply the Community customs tariff.</P>
    <P>Certain provisions are also included in favour of Turkish migrants to the Community and it is envisaged therein that free movement of labour will be achieved between 1985 and 1995.</P>
    <P>The financial protocol provided for financial assistance from the Community in the form of special loans for Turkey distributed by the European Investment Bank acting on the authority of the member states.  The European Coal and Steel Community Agreement applies the trade provisions to products within the province of the European Coal and Steel Community.</P>
    <P>Negotiations took place between the nine member states of the European Community and Turkey during the period January, 1972, to May, 1973.  Agreement was reached in these negotiations on the texts of two supplementary <Col N="1345" /> protocols, one adapting the provisions of the association agreement and the other adapting the provisions of the agreement on products within the province of the European Coal and Steel Community to take account of the enlargement of the Community.  At the same time the member states concluded among themselves a supplementary internal financial agreement which sets out the conditions governing the provision of financial aid to Turkey by the Community.  These supplementary protocols and the supplementary internal financial agreement were signed on 30th June, 1973.  In order that the implementation of the main commercial provisions might not be delayed pending ratification of the protocols, an &ldquo;interim agreement&rdquo; was also signed on that date bringing the trade provisions into force with effect from 1st January, 1974.</P>
    <P>The full texts of the supplementary protocols and the supplementary internal financial agreement are available to Deputies, but I will briefly describe the main provisions:</P>
    <P>Title I of the supplementary protocol adapting the provisions of the association agreement provides for certain &ldquo;adaptation measures&rdquo;. These involve alteration of the basis of certain calculations to take account of the enlargement of the Community.  It also provides for increases in the annual level of tariff quotas in favour of Turkey in the case of certain sensitive products.  In addition, under article 8, the amount of 195 million units of account to be provided in the form of loans from the European Investment Bank is increased to 242 million units of account.</P>
    <P>Title II is entitled &ldquo;Transitional Measures&rdquo; and sets out a timetable for the alignment of Customs duties by the new member states on the duties provided for in the association agreement.</P>
    <P>Title III concerns the final provisions and sets out the procedures for ratification and entry into force of the supplementary protocol.</P>
    <P>There is also included a final act <Col N="1346" /> in which the contracting parties adopt a number of joint declarations, the most important being on the industrialisation of Turkey.</P>
    <P>The supplementary protocol on products within the province of the European Coal and Steel Community, which is not included in the motion before the Dáil but which it is hoped to ratify at the same time, provides for the extension of the provisions of the agreement on products within the province of the European Coal and Steel Community to the three new member states. This protocol does not involve a charge on public funds.</P>
    <P>The supplementary internal financial agreement defines the internal conditions for the application of the financial provisions of the supplementary protocol.  Article 2 of the supplementary internal financial agreement apportions the 242 million units of account among the nine member states.  Ireland's share amounts to 1 million units of account.  It is envisaged that this sum will be disbursed over a period extending to 1979.</P>
    <P>Assuming ratification of the necessary instruments by all parties by July, the European Investment Bank estimates the rate of call-up of Ireland's one million units of account in the following manner:</P>
    <P>In 1976 we would pay either .15 or 21&mdash;the fraction has yet to be worked out.  In 1977 and 1978 we would pay .32 of the total sum.  In 1979 we would pay either .21 or .15. depending on whatever fraction of our contribution was called up in 1976.</P>
    <P>I commend this motion to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am standing in for our spokesman on Foreign Affairs who has been delayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the importance of this motion, the amount of paper work that has to be undertaken by the average Deputy dealing with it in so far as it talks about the original agreement, the additional protocol the further financial protocol and the supplementary protocol dealing with the European Coal and Steel Community aspect of it, which the Parliamentary Secretary says is not under discussion <Col N="1347" /> on this motion because it does not constitute a charge on the Exchequer, the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks are rather scant in their explanation of what this is all about and what will be its overall effect on our economy. As far as I can ascertain, the whole object of the exercise is basically to arrange for a situation in which this Parliament, in conjunction with other Parliaments, can clear this agreement so that the financial arrangements may be finalised.</P>
    <P>In outlining the provisions the Parliamentary Secretary talks specifically about the overall financial agreement apportioning 242 million units of account to this work, spelling out that Ireland's share is one million units of account.  Again, from the point of view of the average Member of this House, it is rather unfair of the Parliamentary Secretary to come in here and speak in this manner about the proportions involved, saying that in 1976 we will have to pay either .15 or .21&mdash;the fraction has yet to be worked out&mdash;without indicating how much that will cost us in itself.  To come into the House and talk in terms of one million units of account, saying that we propose to pay it over a period extending to 1979, without telling us exactly what that will cost seems rather remarkable.  We are given a sort of time table of the percentage of the one million units of account to be paid in 1976 and in respect of what is to be paid in the years 1977 and 1978.  Then the Parliamentary Secretary says that in 1979 we will pay either the .21 or the .15 depending on whichever fraction of our contribution was called up this year.</P>
    <P>We are now approaching the end of June and Estimates must be cleared before the recess.  Yet the Parliamentary Secretary did not tell us in introducing this motion what cost is involved. Perhaps when he is replying he will let us know whether it is more or less than £500,000.  My reckoning is that the cost is slightly more than this figure, on which basis I reckon that the amount we must contribute this year is between £75,000 and £100,000 or, even, £115,000, taking <Col N="1348" /> the percentage at 0.15 or 0.21.  It was a serious omission on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary not to inform us of the actual cost this year.  He might have told us too whether in the Estimates we shall be dealing with before the recess the amount of money involved in respect of this protocol has been provided for in respect of this year.</P>
    <P>In his introductory remarks the Parliamentary Secretary said he would describe briefly the main provisions, having pointed out that the full texts were available to Deputies.  However, the full texts are exhaustive and, even if one had the capacity to read through them, it would be difficult to analyse and understand them.  The Parliamentary Secretary describes the main provisions under titles 1, 2 and 3 and refers to what each sets out.  I would have preferred him to adopt the sort of line taken by Ministers and civil servants in the various Departments so far as this House is concerned in that, in relation to the presentation of Bills we are supplied with explanatory memoranda.</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary reached the point at which he told us he would describe briefly the main provisions involved, I took it that it was his intention to give us a précis of what each title involved.  Since he did not give this information one must ask the inevitable questions which arise from a glance through the protocol and papers.  I wish to refer to Title II which deals with transitional measures.</P>
    <P>Annex 1 includes those areas of industry in respect of which we have had difficulty, especially the textile industry. In this regard I note that Annex 1 includes such items as silk yarn, yarn of man-made fibres, yarn of fine animal hair, flax, cotton yarn, carpets and general textile fabrics.  This is a side of the industry which has been the cause of considerable concern to the manufacturers involved and also to trade unionists.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 1 of article 9 of Title II reads:</P>
    <P>The reductions in customs duties and charges having equivalent effect which are provided for in the Association Agreement shall be <Col N="1349" /> applied in the new member states, in accordance with the percentages and time table laid down, upon entering into force of this Protocol.  The rates resulting from application of these reductions as regards Annex 2 and Annex 6 of the Additional Protocol may, however, in no case, be lower than those applied by the new member states to the Community as originally constituted.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 reads:</P>
    <P>By way of derogation from paragraph 1, in respect of the products listed in Annex 1, customs duties equal to the duties applied to member states other than the United Kingdom may be applied with regard to Turkey by Ireland until 31 December, 1975.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 of this Article reads:</P>
    <P>By way of derogation from the preceeding paragraphs, should the application of these provisions temporarily result in tariff movements away from alignment on the final duty, Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom may maintain their duties until the level of those duties has been reached on the occasion of a subsequent alignment, or they may apply the duty resulting from a subsequent alignment as soon as this alignment reaches or passes the said level.</P>
    <P>These paragraphs are not easy to comprehend from the point of view of ordinary Deputies and that is why I had been looking forward to the receipt of some explanatory memorandum as to the effectiveness or otherwise of article 9 as it relates to ourselves and Turkey.  It would be wrong of me to create the impression that we were opposing this measure in any way, the whole object of which is to aim at a united economic Europe.  It was in persuit of this aim that we, both in Government and in Opposition, strove down through the years to achieve a successful European Economic Community.  During the past couple of years though individual countries are becoming adept daily at protecting themselves.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to accuse the <Col N="1350" /> Government or speak in a derogatory way about the fact that they are honourably trying to carry out their responsibilities as a member of the European Economic Community, which is something that might not equally be said about some of our partners.  Unfortunately, however, some members of the present Governments are adept at saying when in difficulty: &ldquo;We told you so and it is not our fault that we are in this spot of bother&rdquo;.  It makes us feel on this side of the House that we have a situation whereby members of the present Government are anxious and willing to see things slide and not work out. I do not want to make the accusation. I do not believe it, but there are times when I would tend to believe that certain members of the present Government, particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce, smile within themselves, at least when they see things not going too well and say: &ldquo;Well now I can create an alibi.  I have a ready-made excuse when I come up to defend our failure, or my failure, in that regard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is why I am inclined to be critical of the Parliamentary Secretary. I know it is not exactly his brief, no more than this is my brief.  But he is closer to it because he is Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I take it he is fully <i>au fait</i> and will be able to deal adequately with the criticisms I am making in relation to this.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from leaving us short on explanatory data in relation to the protocols we have here and the agreement under the various titles of transitional measures, final provisions and so on, I feel that this motion should not be introduced into the House on the assumption that the spokesman on the Opposition side will know what this is all about so that we can have an intelligent discussion about it.  We may find that the ordinary Deputy arrives into the House to deal with this and finds the Minister's outlining of the situation is not as elaborate as it might be from the point of view of getting the message across to Parliament and <Col N="1351" /> justifying the passing of this motion in the House.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in his statement said, and this appears to be further evidence of what I am tempted to term the glossing over of this subject:</P>
    <P>The supplementary protocol on products within the province of the European Coal and Steel Community, which is not included in the motion before the Dáil but which it is hoped to ratify at the same time, provides for the extension of the provisions of the agreement on products within the province of the European Coal and Steel Community to the three new member states.  This protocol does not involve a charge on public funds.</P>
    <P>I assume that, because this protocol does not involve a charge on public funds, that is the reason the Minister responsible does not include it in the motion.  This is again unfortunate.  It should not be so.  It is part and parcel of the collection of agreements and protocols that have been drawn up in relation to this, and there is no reason at all why it should not be included and there could be discussion on it.  I presume by reason of the fact that it has been mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary in introducing the motion that it puts the House in a position that they are entitled to talk about it.  I would like to know, it not being covered by the motion, whether I am in a position to discuss the implications of the supplementary protocol on products within the province of the European Coal and Steel Community or whether I am out of order in trying to go on to that subject, because it is one on which I might have something to say.  It is not covered in the motion and this is my difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced it as a helpful explanatory background matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my problem. The Parliamentary Secretary said he introduced it as explanatory.  Perhaps he should have said &ldquo;exploratory&rdquo;. Introducing it as a helpful explanatory background I find difficult to accept, because the difficulty is that he could have kept off it and spent a bit more time in giving explanations.  However, we will not go into that in detail.</P>
      <P>If I might go back to what the Parliamentary Secretary said when he talked originally about the additional protocol.  He said:</P>
      <P>The additional protocol, which like the further financial protocol was ratified in December, 1972, and came into force on 1st January, 1973, provides for:</P>
      <P>(i) total customs exemption for all Turkish industrial goods exported to the Community with partial exemptions only for certain textile and petroleum products.</P>
      <P>I am not interested in the petroleum products aspect, but the total customs exemption is for all industrial goods and petroleum products.  I may be interested in petroleum products from the point of view of whether it means there are petroleum products we get from Turkey at a cheaper rate because of this total customs exemption.  I am taking it that (i) covers customs, that the EEC are to withdraw the customs barriers from Turkish exports of petroleum products and of certain textiles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has got me around to the subject matter of what I spoke about a few minutes ago.  In his introductory remarks the Parliamentary Secretary might have told us whether we at present are in any way helped by article 9, section 2.  It would appear that up to the 31st December of last <Col N="1353" /> year there was a protocol whereby we might be allowed to protect our textile industry against potential imports from Turkey but that that has been removed since 31st December.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will cover that in his reply.  I would be interested to know what is the volume of such importation.</P>
    <P>The additional protocol provides for considerable and increasing preferences for Turkish agricultural products exported to the Community, with full free movement planned at the end of a 22-year period, during which the Turkish agricultural policy would be aligned to that of the Community. That is a long exclusion period but I am fully in agreement with it as it was ratified in December, 1972. I take it that the main imports of Turkish agricultural products are sultanas, raisins, currants, and so on. I am all for getting those things as cheaply as we can if they do not compete with the currants, raisins and sultanas packaged at home.</P>
    <P>This protocol, which was ratified in December, 1972, and came into force on 1st January, 1973, provides for the dismantling by Turkey of its tariffs against Community exports over a period of 12 years, and 22 years in the case of certain sensitive products. I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate which of our products are affected by those tariffs.  I have not done any background study on this and I do not know what the balance of trade is as between ourselves and Turkey.  I clearly recall that our volume of exports to Turkey was not enormous and I am sure we hardly export sufficient products to Turkey to pay for the dried fruits we import from there.  Therefore, there would be an adverse trade balance.</P>
    <P>We fully support steps taken to encourage associate membership, and full membership in the long term, by Turkey of the Community.  I wonder what the hopes are of Turkey applying for membership.  The Parliamentary Secretary said the eventual accession of Turkey to the Communities was envisaged in article 28 but, in fact, Turkey have not applied for membership. Is it hoped that, by getting these agreements <Col N="1354" /> and protocols cleared by July of this year so that the money we are talking about can be made available, Turkey will become a member?  What is the Government's view on this?  Are we anxious to get Turkey in speedily, or are we happy enough to sit back and let the thing take its course?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>The financial protocol provided for financial assistance from the Community in the form of special loans for Turkey distributed by the European Investment Bank acting on the authority of the member states.</P>
    <P>Has any assistance been given to Turkey by the European Investment Bank and, if so, how does it compare with the assistance we have received from the European Investment Bank?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>The agreement provided that the association would be implemented in three stages: a preparatory stage, of at least four years' duration to enable Turkey to strengthen its economy; a transitional stage during which a customs union would be established; and a final stage entailing the intensification of the co-ordination of the economic policies of the parties of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The additional protocol acknowledged the completion of the first preparatory stage and instituted the second transitional stage of the association agreement.</P>
    <P>I should like to have it spelled out that the EEC were satisfied the preparatory stage had been completed, that is, that the four-year period had been completed during which time Turkey had strengthened its economy.</P>
    <P>From my point of view the most serious aspect of the Parliamentary Secretary's &ldquo;non-forthcomingness&rdquo; with information was that he did not tell us what it would cost.  I hope we are not so far removed from reality that we cannot ask a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary introducing something with a State cash involvement how much did it cost.  If I go <Col N="1355" /> into a store down town to buy a hat, the salesman will tell me how well the hat looks on me, what it would do for me, and how much better I look when I have it on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I take it or leave it, the obvious question to ask is: how much does it cost?  I do not think even the Parliamentary Secretary would say I should take it or leave it without asking the obvious question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If your boss told you to go down and buy it, if he gave you the money and told you not to come back without it, you would not spend too much time asking about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very interesting observation.  I should hate to think the only reason he is here today looking for the approval of the House for this money was that the boss said: &ldquo;Go down and get approval.  I cannot be there.  Do not bother to tell them how much it costs.  Those fellows on the far side know nothing anyway. We are the brains.  Tell them you want this motion and tell them to blow up if they ask any questions.  My instructions to you are to go down and get it.&rdquo; That is what the Parliamentary Secretary has told me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I should not have interrupted the Deputy.  What I meant was that this country in applying Community agreements domestically does not have the same range of discretion as the Deputy would have if he went down to buy himself a hat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were really on the ball I would know exactly the pounds and pence value of a 1 million unit of account, but I am not.  I have not the <Col N="1356" /> same access to that information as the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I am, as has been said before, the bogman; I am anxious to know how much this will cost us, and it is logical that I should ask this question on behalf of the taxpayer.  I should not be told that the equivalent has not been worked out.  We have been taking a certain amount of coaching and training recently in changing over to the metric system.  As far as I know, the units of account keep changing.  Therefore I would hope the Parliamentary Secretary would clearly tell us how much, in all, we would be liable for over the period extending to 1979.  It is remarkable that we are almost at 1st July when the first instalment of this is due, and so far we do not quite know whether it is .15 or .21, and I reckon that this makes a difference of roughly £50,000.  In a case such as this the Parliamentary Secretary should be able to tell us whether we are going to pay the .21 now and the .15 in 1979 or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
      <P>While I am criticising the manner in which the Parliamentary Secretary has introduced the motion, I do not see any justification for opposing it, because I would be opposing something that we ourselves as a Government in our time were instrumental in inaugurating and getting off the line.</P>

      <P>What I, as a business man, find lacking in the Parliamentary Secretary's introduction to this motion is that there is no reference to the sort of goods produced industrially by Turkey and exportable to here.</P>

      <P>It is not criticism. It is just that, scanning through this, I find myself asking questions.  Never having been in Turkey and not knowing much about the Turkish economy, I am at a loss to answer the question I put to myself: how does this affect us?  It says here:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional protocol, which like the further financial protocol was ratified in December, 1972 and <Col N="1357" /> came into force on 1st January, 1973, provides for:</P>
    <P>(i) total customs exemption for all Turkish industrial goods exported to the Community with partial exemptions only for certain textile and petroleum products.</P>
    <P>It may be that I have not read back on this, because it is not an area I deal with normally, but I would like to have this information; it must be available some place.  Other information which it would be interesting to have is: what do they buy from us? Again perhaps I should go back to the trade statistics and see what our exports consist of.</P>
    <P>I am also puzzled by the reference to the cost here.  Ireland's share will amount to one million units of account which will be payable over a period of years by way of .15 in 1976 or .21, and in 1977 and 1978 .32 of the total cost and so on.  The total cost of the financial provisions of the supplementary protocol would be 242 million units of account.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary indicate how this money will be paid?  Is it in addition to the ordinary cost, which I think is around £11 million and for which we are liable as a member of the EEC?  Is it a payment that will come under what I would describe as ordinary tax revenue?</P>
    <P>I would also like to know a little more about Turkey itself.  The Parliamentary Secretary said it was thought that Turkey would become a full member.  Again I confess to a little ignorance on this.  Is Turkey qualified in political terms to be a member? Are there any particular reasons why she has not applied for membership? Again it is curiosity on my part.  When such matters are referred to, these are the question that come to one's mind.</P>
    <P>There is also reference to the free movement of labour.  As I understand it, there has been quite a lot of movement of labour between Turkey, in particular, and the West German Republic, which is a member of the EEC. I am told that the labour movement between West Germany and other <Col N="1358" /> countries is with southern Italy, Yugoslavia and Turkey.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has the information, it would be interesting to know the extent of the labour movement to date between Turkey and the EEC, and also, from the point of view of the possible development of Turkey as a full member of the EEC, how this would affect us.</P>
    <P>It is this kind of question that the man in the street would put, because when the Parliamentary Secretary refers to free movement of labour, that raises a different picture for people in this country.  As far as I understand it, there is the right to work in the Twenty-six Counties on the part of citizens of any of the other eight member states, but only where work is available.  In other words, one cannot have crowds of Italians, French or Dutch arriving here and taking up the jobs of Irish citizens.  It is in that context that I would be interested in hearing the views of the Parliamentary Secretary on the reference in his speech to the eventual free movement of labour between Turkey and the EEC.</P>
    <P>There is another interesting reference in one of the documents relating to agriculture.  I am referring to the agreement establishing an association between the EEC and Turkey, dated, Brussels, 1973, and signed in 1963. It states that the association shall likewise extend to agriculture and trade in agricultural products in accordance with the special rules which will take into account the Common Agriculture Policy of the Community.  It states that agricultural products mean the products listed in the annex to the Treaty establishing the Community as at present supplemented in accordance with article 38 (3) of that Treaty. Has there been any substantial trade in agriculture between Turkey and the Nine?  I would appreciate hearing about that.  Mainly, what interests those of us who look at the whole question of competition which arises out of our membership of the EEC is how it may affect our own situation. In dealing with the EEC, and, indirectly, with Turkey, we are dealing with countries that are larger and <Col N="1359" /> more powerful than us.  As a citizen and a Deputy I must be concerned about what the effect may be on our industry and trade.</P>

      <P>In considering the terms of the motion one has to place it in the overall context of the Community and its association agreements and also in the context of application for membership from other countries, notably Greece, within the Mediterranean area.  Undoubtedly, we all recognise that the whole motivation of the Community is not just limited to the betterment of those countries that are members at present.  By its terms, nature and priorities, the Community has undertaken from the start a range of association agreements recognising the obligations the Community has, as a highly developed and prosperous economic area, to other countries on the European Continent and, as is clearly evident from the Lomé Convention, to countries outside the European mainland.  To that extent when one considers agreements of this nature we are not in a position to ask: &ldquo;Is this the right of the individual existing members to reject according to their own immediate national or supernational community interest?&rdquo; Those of us at present within the Community have no more right to limit the advantages or benefits that accrue from the operations of the Community to the existing Nine, than had the Six before we became members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole basic attitude behind the Treaty of Rome, and the father figures of Europe, was to extend to all those countries who could take on the obligations and conditions of membership &mdash;significantly, one of these is the proper and appropriate obligation and condition of working democracy&mdash;as quickly and as effectively as possible either the benefits of membership or, as in this case, of association agreement. The Parliamentary Secretary is correct in stating that article 28 of the agreement with Turkey envisaged that in the final analysis Turkey would apply for membership.  He is correct in stating also that Turkey has not as yet <Col N="1360" /> applied for membership.  One cannot look at this agreement without casting it against the background of a country which will, if the Community is to develop, and if we are to have the type of Europe we all hope for, inevitably be applying for membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>To an extent this is a preparatory stage to that membership.  Obviously there are political problems at present in the Eastern Mediterranean that may make it seem undesirable for Turkey to apply for full membership and difficult for Greece to obtain membership.  However, whether that may be so or not and whether we, looking at it from our own narrow confines, would wish to have them as members we will have to recognise that this is, hopefully, a step towards membership of the EEC.  It is also important to recognise that in the whole development of the European Community inspiration the central issue was the maintenance and development of peace within the confines of the original members of the Community, not just to ensure their economic betterment or development. Above all else the intention was to ensure that only through a common membership of a common Community could one guarantee that the conflicts of Europe in the first and second World Wars could not be repeated.</P>
    <P>If there is a problem in the Community at present it is that the essential inspiration and motivation which launched the Communities of Europe are not there now to the same extent.  This may be because the generation since have taken peace and normal order for granted.  If they have they will have overlooked the fundamental purpose behind the Community. Just as that was the fundamental purpose behind the Treaty of Rome so also must it be the fundamental purpose behind any association agreements which the Community make with other countries and any extension of membership which the Community undertake with other countries.  For that reason the whole Mediterranean, particularly the Eastern <Col N="1361" /> Mediterranean, comes very much into focus.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, we must always recognise that it is not possible to make meaningful political progress even in a narrow economic area, where political turbulence, unrest and violence exist, as we have on this island.  The first thing is to try to cure these basic causes before one can get the normal programme of economic development which has applied in Germany, Holland, Belgium, France and Italy since the war.  For Turkey there is a flashpoint at present, the island of Cyprus.  We all welcome any moves the Community can make towards healing this sore point between a country which has signified her intention of becoming a member, Greece, and the other, Turkey, which has full membership as a long term aim.  Through the agency of the Community both of them can try to solve this long standing problem between them which some of us may be happy enough to tolerate as long as it is reasonably remote from us but which, from time to time, has caused considerable international tension and considerable physical suffering. Obviously, the first priority of all concerned must be to help ease those tensions and abolish suffering.  For that reason it is appropriate that this motion is before the House.  Obviously it is not timed because of the Greek application, but it allows us to consider the matter at this stage.</P>
    <P>On a recent visit to Greece I was glad to note that that country wants to take on the rights and obligations of the Community.  Some people may say that neither Greece nor Turkey is ready and that they would be a very great burden on present members. It must be remembered that that might have been said of us when we were outside the Six.  Now that we are within the Nine we cannot say to others who want to develop extension agreements or association membership with us, that they are not ready and that it will cost us too much to bring them to the point where they can become full members of the Community.  If we did this we would be narrow and selfish and we would <Col N="1362" /> not be true to the tradition and spirit of the Community.</P>
    <P>Greece has set her face in this direction.  From my discussions with representatives of the Government there, they see the eventual membership of Turkey as an inevitable and desirable step, not just towards the fulfilment of the European dream but also towards the lessening of tensions, if not hopefully towards the abolition of the divisions which have existed between them on the island of Cyprus.</P>
    <P>We all engaged in eliminating regional imbalances when we were very preoccupied with the regional fund of the European Community. The fundamental problems of regional imbalances is that you do not have normal political activity.  There is a very significant regional imbalance by European Community standards along the border areas of the North of Ireland and a very serious political problem.  In the sense that the Community have set themselves the target to get at the causes of these problems and to eliminate the regional imbalances economically, the Community must recognise that they have a role to play in solving political problems also.  They can do this not by way of direct intervention or interference, because that is not called for, but simply by way of programmes of economic development which will work to the betterment of all concerned.</P>
    <P>For that reason we would have to support the position in Turkey, even if the association agreement were to cost us considerably more than it is. In the same way, I take it, we will support whatever application Greece submits for membership of the Community in the knowledge that by doing this we are working towards peace in Europe and economic betterment and we are showing the commitment which the founders of the European Community showed to those areas of Europe and of the world that are less privileged than some of the more highly developed countries, many of whom are now within the existing European Community.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a consequence <Col N="1363" /> for all members in any new association agreements, and even more so in any new accessions by way of full membership, by way of direct contribution towards the operation of these agreements.  As the Parliamentary Secretary indicated in his opening address, article 2 of this supplementary internal financial agreement apportions the 240 million units of account among the nine member states.  Ireland's share will amount to 1 million units of account, something of the order of £400,000.  This is not the type of contribution over a four-year period at which we could baulk with regard to extending the benefits of the European Community, if not by way of full membership, then by way of association agreement to Turkey.  We should readily and enthusiastically make that contribution and I am sure the House will do that.</P>
    <P>During the last year we have been very significant beneficiaries of the European Community through the operation of the fundamental policies, notably the agricultural policy.  Our net benefit from CAP last year was of the order of £98 million, a very sizeable sum.</P>

      <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not take too much issue with me on the next point because obviously we cannot always interpret things in the same way.  The Government should recognise this point because on a number of occasions they have pointed to the damaging external factors affecting our economy.  If we were operating without that £98 million which we get from FEOGA alone&mdash;leaving out the grants from the Social Fund, the Coal and Steel Community and so on&mdash;we would be in a very bad way.  We have done very well from our membership of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only fair to say that 1975, 1976 and maybe 1977 would be years of much more critical economic recession here if we were not members of the Community, and if we were still, <Col N="1364" /> as in the days of the last Administration, subsidising our agricultural exports to the United Kingdom market. I wonder how we would manage at the moment if we were not members of the Community.  It is important that the Government recognise that our membership of the Community has made a major contribution to the economy.  The public should know this and judge us on this basis.  It is also important that, when we come to considering applications or association agreements from other countries, we should not judge them in the narrow confines of what it will cost us.  For instance, in this case it will cost us approximately £400,000 over a three- to four-year period.  We must say in a loud voice that we support the purpose of this association agreement, we support its extension in any way necessary and we support the principle behind it, particularly the principle which envisages that Turkey as well as Greece in time could become full members of the Community. For as long as they are not, it will be, if you like, one of the soft underbellies of the Community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of them is here on our doorstep.  We must all face the political problems which exist in Europe.  Those who do not like the Community&mdash;and I am referring particularly to the socialist states of Eastern Europe&mdash;always refer to it as the Common Market, never the European Community, thereby implying that the only motivation is one of national gain for each member state, that there is no community or political motivation behind it, which of course there is.  The Community itself has been inclined to drop the tag of European Economic Community <Col N="1365" /> and now speaks in terms of the European Community.</P>
      <P>To a certain extent something is missing if they are taking the interpretation of the Community as being a community in the real sense, subject to whatever developments that may occur&mdash;and there has not been a speedy development within the political institutions in Europe, although it is nonetheless a community.  The Parliament may not be a very effective one, but it is an indication of a community.</P>
      <P>For that reason we have to look at every proposal from inside or outside the Community, not just in terms of economic benefit but in terms of the political implications for the development of this Community.  I sincerely believe that the Lomé Convention enabled the Community to spread its obligations to the African sub-continent and that it was a major step in the development of the European ideal, even in Europe.  I believe that this step here is an equally consistent step within the development of the European Community ideal.  For that reason, we have to recognise it as such and support it.</P>
      <P>There will, of course, be questions in connection with the agreement we are now discussing.  One of them will be the question of migrant labour within the Community.  Most of the Turkish migrant labour in the Community is based in Germany, possibly to a lesser extent in Holland and Belgium.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a high proportion of migrant labour from Turkey within the Community.  The Commissioner for Social Affairs, Dr. Hillery, has made this issue the central plank of his programme.  A community cannot be true to itself when there are workers within its political boundaries who are not enjoying the same rights, social or otherwise, as its citizens.  If we are to consider for a moment the possibility that within the Community a significant section of the working population come from <Col N="1366" /> outside and work under conditions which are not nearly as good as those which apply to the more fortunate citizens of the member states, then we have not to look too far to see what the consequences for Europe will be.</P>
      <P>For instance, we can see the problems that occurred in the United States and in the island next door to us, problems that are still occurring there because the country was not geared to integrating these people into full and active participation in the normal life of that country.  You have constant flashpoints within the United Kingdom and, indeed, problems that ruthless politicians are sometimes willing to exploit to the detriment of those underprivileged people, politicians who raise the flag of nationalism by saying &ldquo;This land is our land. We are going to close our doors on all outside undesirable elements&rdquo;.  That attitude is not consistent with the obligations of any country to migrant workers.  If migrant workers are to be allowed and welcomed, allowing for the educational or social deprivations they may have experienced, one must try to compensate for all these things to ensure that there can be no danger and that there can be no continuing or festering sore of confrontation between the settled and migrant communities.</P>
      <P>The European Community is in a better position.  I have sympathy for the position of the United Kingdom because their problem has come at a time when they are not able to cope economically or socially.  Maybe they should have been able to cope.  Maybe it is true to say that their political history has been the cause of their trouble.  They made no preparation for it.  Now is the time for the European Community to make that preparation. The Community is in a period of considerable unemployment, but our unemployment level is obviously more critical than the level within the Community as a whole. Nevertheless, there is still a great demand for migrant labour.  This may be because of the nature of the work which many of these migrant labourers undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> I am pleased to acknowledge the very considerable efforts made by the Commissioner for Social Affairs and the whole Commission in general to make the rights of migrant workers a fundamental preoccupation of that section of the Commission.  This is not because the Commissioner previously sat on our benches.  I hope it can be taken as being serious praise of his efforts.  If Europe did not recognise those rights it would not be true to its ideals.  This is a time when Europe needs to re-examine the purpose of the Community and the ideals which inspired it, and to that extent the adoption of this agreement is consistent with the originating ideals of the Community.  At the same time the benefits which the Community will apply to Turkey raises the question of the attitude which the Community is taking to the underdeveloped parts of the member states within the existing Community.  Every member of the Community can expect an opportunity to realise the aims of the Community, given the entitlement and assistance which they can expect as members of the Community.  The Community cannot be cast constantly in the role of the fairy godmother giving everything and asking nothing.  It must recognise, that a fundamental programme must be the development on an equal and fair basis of every geographical area in every country within the Community.</P>
    <P>There has been less than urgent direction from the existing Community members in that area.  If for instance the Community had been consistent in its stated aims in connection with the regional fund and regional policy of the community, they would have tackled within the existing confines of the Community the regional imbalances which we have heard about so much.  They would have recognised for instance that there is great potential in this country in the agricultural sector, the industrial sector and the fishery sector.  This potential should be developed fully, not as an independent entity, but as a cog and unit within <Col N="1368" /> the Community.  If we get assistance and encouragement from the Community in accordance with its principles, we should in turn fulfil our responsibilities as members of the Community.</P>
    <P>We do that by extending the benefits of that membership to other countries who need to be assisted&mdash; Turkey in this case&mdash;to a higher level of economic activity, and to countries who need to be rescued from an unbearably low level of economic activity.  That is our obligation.  That is the only reason we have looked to the Community in terms of our entitlements, not on a narrow limited short-term basis but in the knowledge that, given proper direction at home, given proper application of the benefits of our membership when our economy expands, we can as a full and active member of the Community confer benefits on those countries who are as yet not in that position. That is a matter which we have to define as a fundamental concept in this country.  I find that concept lacking at the moment.  Most of us when we became members of the Community talked in terms of the immediate benefits.  We have got them in great measure.</P>

      <P>Not <i>vis-à-vis</i> Turkey or Greece.  The same principles apply, they must apply consistently.  While I can appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary's impatience at the fact that I am ranging fairly broadly I must say that I feel these questions have not been asked often enough.  I think the Community is just floating gaily on, without asking what they are doing, why they are doing it and what the purpose is. I hope I will not test the Parliamentary Secretary's patience any longer, but if we cannot spare ten or 15 minutes to do some reappraisal of what the Community's function is, we are very pressed for time indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been casier for us to say &ldquo;Yes, we agree with this&rdquo; without trying to analyse all that is involved.  I do not <Col N="1370" /> want to interrupt the business of the House, so I will not delay longer on the fundamental analysis of the role of the Community <i>vis-à-vis</i> applicant members or other countries in the association, but I will say that when we see that there will be free movement of labour between Turkish migrants to the Community between 1985 and 1995 the Parliamentary Secretary will have to recognise that that will have a very significant impact on the employment position in the Community.</P>
      <P>This is a matter which the existing members must not look to as protecting our own interests; we must also look to the contributions which we must make to ensure that those migrant labourers who come to Europe will have the rights and entitlements, housing and education, social rights and so on that the Commissioner has set his face in favour of. Because we are beneficiaries to a very considerable extent we will have to see ourselves turning that corner to ensure that we too, can become contributors as much as beneficiaries, because the long term problems of the Community are great and one of the most crucial and critical problems is that of migrant labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I have not tried the Parliamentary Secretary's patience too much.  He has agreed with me much of the way and I am glad he has acknowledged that publicly here.  We have, and the Government have done very well and if I may say it, let us get up off our bottoms and do something for ourselves so that we can do more for the Community.  If we do not, I fear the Turkish, Greek, Spanish and Portuguese problems, all of which will arise one after the other, will be something we can do very little about. By comparison with any of those countries in southern Europe we are&mdash; and it should never be forgotten&mdash;very prosperous indeed.  We have a great potential&mdash;and shame on us if we do not realise it&mdash;in comparison with Turkey or Portugal or Greece.  Anybody who has visited any of these countries and compares our agricultural, industrial or any other sectors with theirs will see that our problems <Col N="1371" /> are essentially problems of management and policy&mdash;there are marginal differences&mdash;while their problems are very much deeper.  That is why we among other members of the Community welcome this association.</P>
    <P>The obligations are really minimal and we on this side gladly welcome them, but we would like to think that the Community will be consistent with itself and also look to its obligations within its existing confines in the areas of the regional fund and fisheries, among many others, so as to enable us, by enjoying our rights and benefits under the Community, as one member to reach our potential&mdash;this has not been done&mdash;and thus enable us to play a fuller role in the Community so that its extension and the further association agreements it will enter into can be more enthusiastically adopted here and, if I may say it, more effectively supported.  I hope that when our time comes, our contribution will be considerably more&mdash;this is related to GNP&mdash;to any further extension, and that maybe in two or three years time, than the 100 million units of account which we are being asked to contribute between now and 1979.  It will be a test of our success or failure whether in two or three years time that will have been achieved.</P>

      <P>Needless to say I intended nothing personal to Deputy O'Kennedy.  I am always interested in his remarks in this field and I agree with nearly everything he ever says along these lines.  I hope he appreciates that when I showed impatience it was because I am getting uneasy about the general programme of the House for which I am responsible.  This debate has far exceeded my estimate of how long it would take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is before the House because the material it covers involves a charge on public funds.  The other agreements I mentioned in my opening remarks did not have to come to the Dáil for ratification; it would be a wanton waste of Dáil time if we were deliberately to seek Dáil approval for <Col N="1372" /> them.  I agree with Deputy O'Kennedy in regard to our obligations towards countries outside the Community whether they are associates or non-associates of the Community.  I am glad that the Community has recognised responsibilities to the wider world and that association with countries such as Greece and Turkey has been such a useful one from their point of view.</P>
    <P>Our share in this effort is at present limited to supplying a very small fraction of the money which is being lent to Turkey in order to help them to improve their economy.  It would not be inappropriate to say here that this may be the first chance we have had since the Famine, 130 years ago, to repay the Turks in some concrete way for the contribution which the Sultan then made, a very large and handsome one by the standards of those days.  We learned about it at school but we do not have very many contacts with Turkey and perhaps the House would not think it frivolous or inappropriate if I say that we were all touched to read about this event 130 years ago when a potentate so distant and, according to legend and the popular image, so wrapped up in his own affairs and in those of the people he ruled, some of them not with their own consent, that he still found time to post a donation to relieve Irish suffering.  Now that the world has moved on, if, in a small way we can repay that by our membership of the EEC and by going along with the EEC obligation towards Turkey in the framework of the association agreement, we should be glad to do it.</P>
    <P>The situation regarding the question I was asked by Deputy Brugha or Deputy Lalor&mdash;I am not sure which&mdash;is that this contribution will be made from the amount which we are obliged to pay in connection with our EEC commitments.  We shall probably be paying about £16 million this year.  That is only an estimate because the Community budget is not finalised.  The maximum amount which we will be obliged to provide under this protocol, this year, will be .21 per cent of our one million units of account which will probably be <Col N="1373" /> about £120,000.  It might be as low as £90,000 if the lower figure is called up.  In the succeeding two years, 1977 and 1978&mdash;I give this information because Deputy Lalor asked me to do so&mdash;we think the sum will be about £192,000 in each year and in 1979, depending on how much is called up, it could be as low as £90,000 or as high as £126,000.  To put this into context, apart from Deputy O'Kennedy's welcome reminder that we have been a very substantial net beneficiary from EEC membership, I can add that, up to the end of 1975, we have had from the European Investment Bank, the same organ that is administering this loan, a total of £58 million in loans. The Turks, in the context of their association, have not done very much better, given the enormous disparity in the sizes of the populations.  They have been lent by the European Investment Bank from 1973 to 1976 about £90 million.</P>
    <P>I do not think I should spend too much time on the question of Turkish membership.  I understand the Turks intend to apply and probably the reason they have not yet applied is that their own economy would not stand the draught at present.  No doubt when they become stronger&mdash; and this loan may be of some assistance to them&mdash;they will be applying.</P>
    <P>The political difficulties which we associate with Turkey are of an international kind, their invasion of Cyprus, their hostility to the Greeks. These are very disturbing factors in southern Europe and in Europe generally. I know the Community are very concerned about this and would not be happy about absorbing two new members who were in postures of mutual hostility in this way.  Quite by accident&mdash;it has no connection with the fact that I am moving this motion today&mdash;I attended the Association with Turkey council meeting on behalf of Ireland in Copenhagen last year.  Almost the entire day was taken up with questions, not in regard to sultanas or raisins, but in regard to the political situation which the Turks had provoked or at least for the acuteness of which they must certainly be held responsible and which <Col N="1374" /> threatened to be a very disturbing element in the Community if they and the Greeks were admitted simultaneously. All we can hope for is that this question will be solved to the ultimate benefit of the people who live on the island of Cyprus, of both traditions, and so far as our goodwill will go any distance towards that result, of course it is freely available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brugha&mdash;and I think Deputy Lalor also posed some questions. They asked me to say something about the trade relationships between this country and Turkey. Actually, they are quite interesting and I shall give them to the House. In 1975-76 we imported approximately £2,394,000 worth of goods from Turkey and we exported £381,708, an adverse trade balance of almost exactly £2 million.  The main products which we got from the Turks &mdash;naturally, the House will not expect a full list&mdash;are not things which represent any competition for Irish industry at all and could not, as far as I know, represent any competition at present.  Deputy Lalor was dead on the mark: raisins were the biggest single item by far&mdash;£1,101,000 worth; chrome ore £339,000 worth; magnesite&mdash;whatever that is&mdash;£110,000 worth; citrus and other fruits, £87,000 worth and timber, £93,000 worth. That accounts for the vast bulk of the £2 million odd, leaving approximately £500,000 left distributed between various things.  There does not seem to be any substantial item on that list which offers a threat to Irish industry. In case the House is interested, we exported, in the main, anti-biotics&mdash;a very welcome new industry of ours&mdash; to the value of almost £100,000, horses to the value of £62,000 and hormones to the value of £100,500.  I understand also that the exemption, <Col N="1375" /> or whatever it is called, in this protocol which allowed us to keep textiles walled out until the end of 1975 was availed of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor's question, mainly whether this whole matter ought not to be gone into with a fine comb&mdash;in other words, the nuts and bolts of this protocol&mdash;seeing that it was potentially so important, was raised by him in the context of a criticism of me for not having given an encyclopaedic introduction to this motion.  I cut down the draft shown me because I think the House tends to be too verbose, particularly on matters where there is not really a discretion left in the House.  Deputies opposite will appreciate that this is really not a motion in which the House saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; is something which can be forgotten about the following day.  It is something which we are obliged by external ties to pass, as Deputy O'Kennedy appreciates.  The nuts and bolts side of the protocol should have been questioned, not now but on previous occasions; in other words, Deputies opposite who were not happy with the Turkey association, had they been following it up, could have questioned it.  I do not intend to impute blame about this, but they could have questioned it in various ways&mdash;by parliamentary question, by a Private Members' Motion or by making use of the Government motion still before the House, which has been debated on two or three occasions, about developments within the EEC, or they could do it on a Foreign Affairs Estimate or, no doubt, in other ways.  It is not reasonable to wait until this very last moment arrives, when the thing is being finally seen off, to raise these questions about whether it was wise to take this or that line in the construction of the protocol itself.</P>
    <P>All three Deputies mentioned in one way or another the question of what full Turkish membership would imply for us, what Turkish products would be likely to impinge on our economy.  The general picture in regard to Turkey is that the Community as a whole does not envisage any difficulty from the advent of Turkish <Col N="1376" /> products except in so far as Turkish production of citrus fruits represents competition for the areas of the Community which grow such fruits&mdash; in other words, the southern parts of Italy and, I suppose to a lesser extent, the very far south of France.  The essentially temperate production of Irish agriculture will not be threatened in the slightest degree by Turkish association or even by Turkish full membership.  There will be no competition for the kinds of things which our agriculture produces.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy, and I think also Deputy Brugha, mentioned the question of the Turkish economy generally. Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned the factor of the migrant population in the EEC which comes from Turkey.  Of course, that is a very important feature not only of the EEC's economy but of the Turks' own because the contribution made by these migrants to their own economy is a very substantial one.  Since the matter has been raised, I can remind the House that Turks working in Germany, France or Switzerland, making what are, by Turkish standards, enormous incomes, are frequently loosely organised in such a way that they send back a very substantial proportion of their earnings, not as individuals to their families, but as a contribution to their home community&mdash;many of these communities in Asiatic Turkey are poverty-stricken&mdash;to enable it to carry out works of development, irrigation and God knows what which will make their home district a more prosperous one.  The amount of patriotism, practical love of country and self-sacrifice shown by these Turkish migrants, and by other migrants as well, of course, should be an example to us and should perhaps give us ideas of our own.</P>

To be talking like this is somewhat unreal.  We are not able to provide fully yet for our own people in terms of housing.  While I do not regard that as an excuse for not doing our best for others, to be talking in terms of migrant suburbs or absorbing migrants when we have still got&mdash;certainly in my constituency and I suppose the same must happen in north Tipperary&mdash;people living 14, 15 or sometimes more to a three-bedroomed house, with perhaps one or two young couples waiting for the corporation or the council to house them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare (No.2) Bill, 1976: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution on the last occasion was very short having regard to the fact that I came <Col N="1378" /> in rather late in the evening.  Consequently, it would be no harm to recall the initial observations of the Opposition in relation to this Bill on the basis that, if nothing else, repetition is the mother of study.</P>
      <P>My general views on the Parliamentary Secretary's Second Reading speech were that the speech was excellent, that the documentation was easy to follow because of cross headings and so on; but, having said that, one must come to the Bill itself.  The piece of legislation before us is extremely complex, lengthy and technical in content.  The Parliamentary Secretary has said that one of the main planks on his platform as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare is to introduce comprehensibility into any legislation in this area which comes before the House.  However this Bill, to say the least, is no indication of his intention to do away with the complexity and confusion of certain parliamentary instruments which come before us from time to time.  Although the Bill contains only 14 sections, it is of a very technical nature.  It is a Bill aimed at bringing about dramatic increases in penalties for abuses of the social welfare code.  To that extent it might be regarded as a draconian piece of legislation were it not for the fact that it is directed at a very small group of people who, for reasons best known to themselves, think that social welfare is fair game.  In those circumstances it would be our hope that the Bill would have the effect of deterring this minority.  If it achieves even that much, it will be worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we must question the need for the Bill in the light of abuses in the past and of the penalties that have been imposed for such abuses.  I am talking about the recent past.  When we were given notice of the Government's intention to introduce this Bill I tabled a series of questions to the Minister for Social Welfare in relation to abuses generally of the social welfare code. In my opening remarks last week I quoted these questions fully so I shall not burden the House with a repetition of them today.  In so far as the Minister's replies were concerned it was <Col N="1379" /> good to learn that, for instance, few if any crimes had been committed in regard to children's allowances.  The questions and the replies to them are reported at columns 13 to 16 of the Official Report for May 25, 1976.  The replies showed that in respect of children's allowances for the year 1973 there was no prosecution, and that the information sought under the other headings&mdash;the number of dismissals, number of persons fined and amounts of fines, number of persons sentenced to terms of imprisonment, the amounts sought to be recovered and the amounts recovered&mdash;did not arise.  For 1974 we were told that there was one prosecution under the heading of children's allowances and that there was no prosecution under that heading in 1975.  It is good to note that people do not abuse their entitlement under the social welfare code in so far as children's allowances are concerned. Consequently one wonders why it is considered necessary to increase fines and the length of prison sentences for abuses under this heading.  Is it not clear that there is no need for such action?</P>
    <P>In regard to the old age non-contributory pension the replies to the questions indicated that the number of prosecutions in 1973 was one, that, by definition, there was one person fined and that the amount of the fine was £2. Again, in 1974, there was one person fined under this heading, the fine in that case being £5.  There was no prosecution in 1975 under this heading. We were glad to learn that in this sphere, too, people did not abuse their entitlement.</P>
    <P>When we come to the question of the payment of employment contributions we find that the situation is very serious and grave.  It may be well to inform those people who have engaged in these very serious offences that this Bill provides for dramatic increases in fines and in terms of imprisonment for abuses of this system.</P>
    <P>We come to the heading of the number of persons sentenced to terms of imprisonment and length of term arising out of the reply I received to my parliamentary question on 25th <Col N="1380" /> May.  The number of prosecutions for failure to pay employment contributions in the year 1973 was 324; the number of dismissals three; the number of persons fined an amount and the amount of fine, 274 persons fined in 1973 and the total of those fines was £1,515.50; the number of persons sentenced to terms of imprisonment and length of terms, nil.</P>
    <P>Again, we must query the need to increase prison terms on foot of the fact that 324 people have been prosecuted in 1973 and the number of persons sentenced to terms of imprisonment in that year is nil.  One wonders at the reason for the dramatic increase in the terms of imprisonment imposed by this Bill in the light of the fact that, thank God, no persons have been sentenced to prison for abuses of the payment of employment contributions, and in this regard the Parliamentary Secretary might inform the House why the terms of imprisonment have been increased so dramatically despite the fact that again the courts obviously saw there were mitigating circumstances, very good reasons possibly why the people who abuse the social welfare code were not sent to prison.  Why under those circumstances does the Parliamentary Secretary wish to increase the terms of imprisonment so dramatically?</P>
    <P>In 1974 under the same heading of the failure to pay employment contributions we had 349 prosecutions, 13 dismissals and 306 fines totalling £1,980.50.  Again, there were no terms of imprisonment under that heading. In 1975 the total prosecutions were 192; number of dismissals nil; 177 fines totalling £1,231.</P>
    <P>It appears to us on this side of the House that we are dealing with legislation which fundamentally does require fairly stiff increases in fines, but whether in fact we should be dealing with a situation which is increasing terms of imprisonment which are non-existent under existing legislation in the past three years is a different matter, and whether we are being given a dose of Coalition law and order sunburstry, is a question which must be raised with some sincerity and is raised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> On the question of abuses relating to another area, disability benefit, in the year 1973 the number of prosecutions was seven, in 1974 the number of prosecutions was three and in 1975 the number of prosecutions four.  Again, we must pay tribute to those people who are in receipt of this social welfare entitlement.  These people are quite clearly not abusing their entitlement to any great degree but, again, we must query the need for increases in the fines and sentences of imprisonment, having regard to the fact that it appears that existing legislation is good enough.</P>
    <P>Regarding unemployment benefit, I agree here with the Parliamentary Secretary that there is so much off the top of the head talk about abuses in the pay-related benefit, unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit schemes.  People suggest that these are systems that are being abused up and down the country.  I wish these people would put their facts where their mouth is and give us some examples of exactly what they are speaking about. Here we have a perfect example of the Department of Social Welfare doing their work in regard to abuses which come to their attention either by way of information they receive or by their own detective work and the abuses in the social welfare code are not all that bad.  Certainly the last years indicate that.  This is not to suggest for a moment that all the abuses are being brought to the attention of the Department of Social Welfare, and indeed the Department of Social Welfare themselves are actually detecting a number of abuses which no doubt are going on.  Nevertheless, we can speak only of the record and the record is here for those people who would like to examine it.  The abuses under the social welfare code are not all that bad having regard to the statistics available to us, particularly in relation to the following entitlements.</P>
    <P>Unemployment benefit: year 1973, number of people prosecuted 67, number of dismissals, six, and there were 48 fines totalling £363 ranging from fines of £1 to £30.  The number of persons sentenced to terms of imprisonment and the length of terms were <Col N="1382" /> two in that year of 1973.  One was sentenced to prison for three months which in fact was suspended and one was sentenced to a term of two months imprisonment again which was suspended. So here we have a situation where out of the vast number of unemployed beneficiaries only 67&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; though of course the figure should be zero&mdash;in fact only 67 out of the vast army of unemployed under the heading of unemployment benefit abused the system. Only 67 people were detected in the abuse of the system.</P>
    <P>In 1974 only 31 persons were prosecuted, again detected; 30 persons were fined and the total amount of the fines for that year was £405.50 ranging from fines of 50p to £60. There were no terms of imprisonment in that year.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of unemployment benefit for the year 1975 there were only ten persons prosecuted and the number of dismissals in that year was two.  Six persons were fined a total of £49 ranging from fines of £3 to £15. There were two persons sentenced to imprisonment.  One of these was sentenced to 14 days which was suspended. The other person was sentenced to one month, again which was suspended.</P>
    <P>We come to the heading of unemployment assistance and here the lie is finally nailed as far as the suggestion that there is that much abuse of the social welfare code is concerned.  Let us not delude ourselves.  There are abuses of the social welfare code but those persons who are so histrionic about these abuses might do well to research their facts before they make those statements and the facts and the statistics are here in front of us. These are the official statistics.  These are the known statistics.  This is what we go by.  This is what we are guided by.  Under the heading &ldquo;Unemployment assistance&rdquo;, in the year 1973 the number of prosecutions was 11.  There was one dismissal. Seven persons were fined. The fines totalled £87 ranging from £2 to £24.  No term of imprisonment was given.  In 1974, the number of prosecutions was nine.  The number of dismissals was zero.  Four persons were fined and the total of the fines was £66, <Col N="1383" /> ranging from £10 to £21.  In 1975, the number of prosecutions amounted to the large total of two.  There was no dismissal.  Apparently there were no fines and no terms of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>It behoves us all to be realistic about these hysterical outbursts against the suggestion that there are large-scale abuses of the social welfare code.  My own view of these hysterical and histrionic outbursts is that they bring the code into disrepute and do harm to the confidence of those persons who are in legitimate receipt of their social welfare entitlements, particularly unemployment benefit and assistance.  It is well that message should go from this House about those people who make statements condemning the social welfare code and its operability.</P>
    <P>This code was introduced by successive Fianna Fáil Governments over the years and we were particularly proud of it when we were in Government. Undeniably that code is being developed, however piecemeal.  We have been promised consolidation Bills and other matters which will make the social welfare code more comprehensible and more understandable to the man in the street.  We have a pamphlet, a summary of social assistance and social insurance services, which is quite understandable. It outlines in a nutshell fashion and quite succinctly a person's entitlements under social welfare code.  For that the Department deserve credit. This type of booklet has been in existence for a number of years.  This is not a new idea.  Naturally with the process of evolution the booklet becomes more understandable by virtue of the experience of the officials.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us does not reflect the thinking of those who produced this pamphlet I have been speaking about.  When he is replying to this debate, the Parliamentary Secretary might indicate to us the methods whereby the officials of the Department go about detecting abuses in the social welfare code.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary any plans or any new ideas to increase the efficiency of the detection of abuses?  This would <Col N="1384" /> concern us all.  Any assistance he may want from the Opposition in this respect will be willingly forthcoming.</P>
    <P>To come back to the question of understanding legislation, Bills are not the preserve of Dáil Éireann, or individual Deputies or groups of Deputies. Nor are they the preserve of the Government.  As I understood it, the Government gave an undertaking that they would codify social welfare legislation.  No doubt this is an ongoing situation.  It will be a difficult and lengthy process without any shadow of doubt.  This is a 14-section Bill.  It is a highly technical, highly complex piece of legislation.  It will add to the burden of the people who will be charged with the codification of social welfare legislation.  We have already adverted to the fact that there are in excess of 350 separate pieces of social welfare legislation in existence.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of this Bill has 161 lines. That is the record.  Section 4 has 140 lines.  This legislation touches the everyday life of individuals.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us the number of people with social welfare entitlement of one type or another including children's allowances.  The figure must be in excess of a million. The Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>There are, at present, approximately 88,000 recorded employers and about 500,000 claimants of the wide range of weekly payments available under either the insurance or assistance schemes together with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I would have imagined that should be &ldquo;in addition to&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;some 405,000 families in receipt of children's allowances.</P>
    <P>My figure of a million people touched by the social welfare code in one way or another is not that far out.  In fact, it might be an underestimate if the real truth were told.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation to introduce understandable legislation, non-complex legislation.  The legislation now before us flies in the face of that proposition. It is a most difficult piece of legislation.  As I have already stated, legislation must be available to all. <Col N="1385" /> Lawyers are entitled to a living but if we become involved in litigation this involves added expense.  The more legislation we can keep out of the hands of lawyers, as it were, the better from the point of view of expense, from the point of view of dealing with problems quickly, and so on.</P>
    <P>I would imagine the most high-powered lawyer would find it very difficult, on a quick perusal of this legislation, to make sense out of it.  He would have to burn the midnight oil for quite a number of evenings to arrive at any conclusions that might be demanded of him relative to whatever points might be brought to his attention.  Therefore, the onus is on Dáil Éireann to introduce legislation which does not contain sections of 161 lines and 140 lines.  Legislation coming before this House is open to all and must be understood by all.  If it does not reach that minimum standard, then it might be described as not necessarily bad legislation but bad in a sense that it is difficult to understand. However, I do not want to labour that point.  I would hope to make a constructive contribution to the debate on this Bill.  It must be a short contribution in view of the need to bring forward much of the legislation which remains to be dealt with having regard to the legislative logjam which faces us.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as I have already stated, appears to be increasing fines and prison sentences, under the heading of various social welfare entitlements, for non-existent abuses.  For that reason alone the Bill reeks of illiberality. It is unfortunate that the Parliamentary Secretary who is a liberal person and has in the past, and more particularly when he was in Opposition expressed, along with his colleagues, the most dewy-eyed liberal sentiments, should introduce huge penalties, whether by way of fine or imprisonment, for abuses which do not exist or for actions which are not abuses to any great degree, having regard to parliamentary replies received to my questions in the Official Report of 25th May last.</P>
    <P>This illiberal tendency on the part <Col N="1386" /> of the Government I described on the last occasion as an effort&mdash;and an effort that appears in some way to be succeeding&mdash;to clothe this Government with the law and order mantle, to engage in, as I have already stated, law and order sunburstry.  It is all very well to be introducing penalties and to be giving the appearance of doing something, but that, in my respectful submission, recks of hypocrisy, because we have quite clearly shown during the contributions here to date on the Parliamentary Secretary's complex and highly technical Bill that, according to his records and according to the records produced by him for the three years of the Government's term of office, the abuses are not as large as was imagined.</P>
    <P>One wonders why, in these circumstances, existing legislation is not adequate. No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will reply&mdash;he is quite entitled to say what he will&mdash;that if these fines and draconian prison sentences frighten off the recidivist abuser, that is the person who continues to abuse the social welfare code despite the existing penalties and fines, then that is all to the good.</P>
    <P>I would accept that the Parliamentary Secretary's processes in that direction are correct but again it would appear that there does not exist such a large problem in relation to social welfare abuses as was thought.  No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will disabuse my mind of that, but my proposition is taken from the information received from the Parliamentary Secretary in answer to my six questions in the Official Report of 25th May last.  It is good to see that the social welfare system, according to the figures, is not being abused as much as we thought it had been abused.  Nevertheless, it is fair to say that there may be hidden abuses going on daily, and it is to come to grips with this very small minority that I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to get his detection team out and about, because those people who consider the social welfare code fair game are anti-social citizens and what they are effectively doing is making less money available to those people who <Col N="1387" /> would be most in need.  We all hope that social welfare benefits would increase to cope with inflation and with the reduction in money values.  I think our philosophy is that the persons most in need should obtain most in terms of finance.  Those people who consider the social welfare system a sort of gaming casino where they can have a bet that they will not be caught are the people who are doing damage to those we would wish to help most and who are taking money out of the pockets of the old age pensioners, contributory or otherwise, or of the person who is on unemployment assistance or the person who, to use the old expression, is in need of home assistance.</P>
    <P>These anti-social creatures are engaging in an attack on the social welfare code, a code which is designed to help those most in need.  The message cannot be sent out often enough from this House, that the social welfare abusers are a sorry lot who should be seen for what they are. Their anti-social behaviour is a credit to no one, least of all themselves.  We re-echo what the Parliamentary Secretary said, that there is such a trend in this society.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me in reminding this small minority who practice this that the social welfare code is not fair game and must not be seen as fair game.  The collection of unemployment assistance and not accepting work when it becomes available is an abominable and soul destroying abuse.  I should like to make the point again that there is no open season on the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>The people who have to pay for social welfare, apart from the moneys borrowed from external sources, are in the main ordinary taxpayers.  It is well to remind these social welfare abusers, the anti-social citizens among us, that they might as well be putting their hands not alone into the pockets of the taxpayer who pays for social welfare but into the pockets of those most in need who could do with more social welfare assistance. They are lessening the entitlement of those people in need.  The amount <Col N="1388" /> given in relation to social welfare payments weekly is incredible, £2 million per week, and I have no doubt that this figure will increase with inflation over the next two or three years.  It will increase with the lack of job climate we are harassed by on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>I should now like to advert to a section which may be dealt with in amendments tabled by the Parliamentary Secretary which have just come to hand, section 4.  This is the tragedy; the unlicensed moneylender in society, the peculiar species who holds himself up as some sort of a do-gooder.  We all know that there existed&mdash;I have no up to date evidence of its continuance&mdash;a practice where-by the children's allowance book changed hands.  Section 4 is introduced to ensure that the people engaging in this practice will be stopped. Obviously, it was introduced to attempt to bring about a closure in relation to any person who buys, sells or offers for sale, takes or gives in exchange, or pawns or takes in pawn any insurance card or any used insurance stamp.  The same applies in relation to children's allowance books. It appears unfair that both parties, the holder of the children's allowance book and the person who takes the book on the foot of some outstanding debt or on foot of some cash transaction, will be liable to the same penalties.  After all, one is by nature the oppressor and the other is by definition the oppressed.  It is a tragedy that this sort of situation exists in our society.  Clearly, it must exist if the Parliamentary Secretary is introducing a section of this nature. It is proper that the penalties in this respect have been increased.</P>
    <P>In the context of the example given it is a tragedy that the oppressed should have the same penalties hung around his or her neck as the oppressor.  There should have been a clear distinction made in relation to that point.  There are oppressors in our society, a small minority, a group of Christians who no doubt attend their services in a Christian fashion but at the same time abuse their fellow citizens with this sort of behaviour.  I cannot think of <Col N="1389" /> anything more despicable than an unfortunate woman having to exchange her children's allowance book for the 30 pieces of silver and that is what it amounts to.  It is an appalling prospect and it is an appalling commentary on a society that such a situation may exist.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Bill must go through all its Stages and in this regard I should like to state that I was under the impression we would have an opportunity to place amendments in relation to it.  I should now like to deal with a section which is of great concern to this side of the House, section 11.  The section deals with the presumption regarding truth of information in applications for certain benefit, allowance, pension or assistance. Again, we must query this.  I have no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will have an adequate answer but is the onus of proof being shifted under this section from the accused to the accuser?  We understand the situation to be that if a person is reported, anonymously or otherwise, for abusing the social welfare code but more particularly where a person claims unemployment assistance or benefit while working, entitlement is cut off pending investigation.  After that it is a matter for the person accused to prove his innocence on the basis of facts given to the Department.  That is a fairly reasonable proposition but on closer scrutiny one finds that in a number of cases the report is made anonymously by somebody who has not the guts to make the allegation publicly against his or her neighbour.  Now it appears that this is being given some form of legislative effect.</P>
    <P>In this society our legal code is accusatorial.  It now appears that the Government are introducing an inquisitorial system.  The Parliamentary Secretary, on behalf of the Government, seem to be copper-fastening in section 11 the inquisitorial form of accusation, which to us is not proper. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to clear the legal air in this respect.  The shifting of the onus of proof from the accuser to the accused is a very serious departure.  We may be reading more into this than we <Col N="1390" /> should but if we are, naturally we will accept that position.  Subsection 11 (2) reads:</P>
    <P>Where in a prosecution for an offence under any of the Acts to which this applies...</P>
    <P>The Acts to which this section applies are substantial in number.  They are the Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1976, the Unemployment Assistance Acts, 1933 to 1976, the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, 1935 to 1976, the Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Acts, 1942 to 1976, the Social Welfare (Children's Allowances) Acts, 1944 to 1975, and the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1976. This is not only a substantial number of Acts but it could be described as a plethora of legislation so far as this section is concerned.  Therefore, it becomes even more serious in the context of the reading of subsection 11 (1).</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. Nevertheless the Parliamentary Secretary is making the point that it is confined to that specific problem, but the section itself does not relate specifically to the examples given.  If it did, and if a person made a statement, by any normal standards and without having regard to the inquisitorial and accusatorial form of legal system, he would, by definition, have to stand over the statement.  Subsection 11 (2) reads:</P>
      <P>Where in a prosecution for an offence under any of the Acts to which this section applies, or under regulations made under or applying the provisions of any of those Acts, it is shown to the satisfaction of the court&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> (a)  that an application has been made by a person (in this section referred to as the defendant) for benefit, allowance, pension or assistance under any of the Acts to which this section applies, and</P>
    <P>(b)  that as a result of that application benefit, allowance, pension or assistance under any of the Acts to which this section applies has been paid to any person (whether or not such benefit, allowance, pension or assistance was that applied for and whether or not it was paid to the defendant),</P>
    <P>the defendant shall be presumed to have given any information contained in the application (or to have caused it to be given on his behalf) and, where such information is false, with full knowledge of such falsity and with intent that it should deceive; but this presumption may be rebutted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the conclusion the Parliamentary Secretary has come to and that is his logic operating on my argument.  That type of corollary would be totally unacceptable to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Parliamentary Secretary's logic and <Col N="1392" /> there is nothing I can do to shift him from his argument.  If he would let me continue along these lines, he will have an adequate opportunity to pursue his line of logic later.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made one good point&mdash;there are precedents for the shifting of the onus of proof in a number of related areas.  While these precedents exist, they are nevertheless anathema to the legal structure under which we operate.  The Parliamentary Secretary, no matter what kind of logic he takes or what line of argument he pursues, will agree that a person is presumed innocent until he is proved guilty.  It appears to us on this side of the House that it is proper in all circumstances that the onus of proof should not be shifted from the accuser to the accused.  It is a matter for the accuser to make his case before a court.  When that onus is shifted, we are getting on to very dangerous grounds.</P>
      <P>I will now get back to the Parliamentary Secretary's line of logic.  We are dealing here with complex and highly technical legislation and a highly technical social welfare code.  If criticism is to be meted out in equal portions, successive Governments must take whatever criticism is going.  If we are talking about logic in relation to legislation, this Bill does little.  If the argument is one of logic, comprehensibility, understanding and reason, then the Parliamentary Secretary must see that the enforcement of this legislation will give rise to many problems, having regard to the rather confused fashion in which it was presented to the House and the fact that there are 161 lines in one section and over 140 in another.  If we are talking about logic, we should be very careful to use the word correctly. The Parliamentary Secretary gave us an example in relation to the operation of section 11 and the shifting of the onus of proof.  He also said that if a person could get away with an abuse by convincing the court that what he had done was not wrong we would welcome that.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our argument in relation to this Bill has been that the social welfare code is fair game for nobody, it is <Col N="1393" /> open to nobody to see it in that light and that anybody who engages in abuses of the social welfare code is engaging in anti-social behaviour. That might give the lie to the suggestion by the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to our proposition that the onus of proof is shifted in this fashion.  We understand this is the first time that a section of this nature has appeared in the social welfare code. Again, that is subject to correction.  If we were to search through all the social welfare legislation to prove or disprove the suggestion that such a section does not exist, we should be here until the end of the 26th Dáil. This is an extremely complex area and one would need a large staff to prove or disprove some of the contentions that may or may not be made from time to time in this House.  The Parliamentary Secretary is charged with the proper running of the Department and no doubt he will give us the information we seek in this respect.</P>
    <P>Having looked at section 44 of the 1952 Act, it appears that a number of words have been omitted in relation to section 2, which reads: &ldquo;Section 44 of the Act of 1952 which relates to appeals and references to appeals officers under that Act, is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (9).&rdquo; Then subsection (9) is substituted. Did the Parliamentary Secretary leave out the words &ldquo;who refuses or wilfully neglects ... wilfully fails ...&rdquo;?  These are very important words and should not be omitted in this legislation as, indeed, they are not omitted in the 1952 Act.  In section 11, which appears to shift the onus of proof from the accused to the accuser, the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; should be inserted because the law is all about intention.</P>
    <P>The various sections are dealt with at considerable length but the Parliamentary Secretary might have considered the second half of section 4, which is a very lengthy section.  Does disqualification run from the time the proceedings are instituted or does it run until the person is found guilty of the offence?  Again, it is in six-months disqualification.  If a person finds that <Col N="1394" /> he has no income whatsoever as a result of disqualification, what happens in those circumstances?  Can the Parliamentary Secretary give us an assurance that such a person will not be in need?</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with winding-up and bankruptcy under the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy (Ireland) Act, 1889.  My reading of this section is that social welfare debts get first call on assets.  If that is the correct reading I believe it is the right reading. If the social welfare code is under attack, and if a company finds itself in a bankruptcy position, it appears to be proper that in those circumstances first call on the assets should be made by way of payment to the Department of Social Welfare of any outstanding debts in relation to social welfare contributions. I hope that is the proper reading of section 7.</P>
    <P>Section 8, subsection (4) (b) reads: &ldquo;Any sum paid by an employer under this subsection shall be treated as a payment in satisfaction of the unpaid weekly contributions, and the insured person's portion of these weekly contributions shall not be recoverable by the employer from the insured person.&rdquo; The situation appears to be that the amount not paid by the insured is the employee's share which may not have been collected. In those circumstances the employer has to pay his own share as well as the insured's share.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary accept that my reading of that subsection means that the employer would be liable for the full amount?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  It is my intention to conclude and to raise these points in a spirit of constructive criticism and to refer particularly to the question of the exchange of children's allowances and so on, or any other negotiable instrument under the social welfare code.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary take the view that the oppressor rather than the oppressed should be the person to <Col N="1395" /> suffer most.  It appears inequitable that the penalties for one should be equal to the penalties for the other.</P>
      <P>During the course of his apparent revolutionising of the social welfare code can the Parliamentary Secretary tell us when he intends introducing this whole question of the codification of the social welfare code?  Can the Parliamentary Secretary give us times and dates?  There is no question but that whatever Government introduces such a scheme in relation to social welfare will receive the undying thanks of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of delaying the Parliamentary Secretary. I understand he is anxious to get all Stages of the Bill.  A time has come to have a look at the whole structure of social welfare.  I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary in his three or four years of office must have quite a lot of knowledge at his disposal so that he could now sit down with officials who have many years of experience in the Department of Social Welfare, and draft something so that, perhaps an all-party committee may be set up in the House under the chairmanship of the Parliamentary Secretary.  There is a need for this because a year has not passed that we have not had a Minister coming into the House making amendments, adjustments and things of that kind.  Here is an opportunity to look at the whole structure and bring in a more comprehensive social welfare policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that fines will not prevent abuses and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary what is wrong with existing legislation.  We on this side of the House should have this information. If it has failed why has it failed?  I do not think we have sufficient proof or that the Parliamentary Secretary has sufficient proof to substantiate the failure of existing legislation. Deputy Andrews quoted a number of prosecutions.  If there is abuse on such a large scale, one would expect a greater number of prosecutions. I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary why he is introducing <Col N="1396" /> this legislation and if he would give us some reasonable explanation as to why existing legislation has failed. We do not know to what extent abuses are going on but the people who indulge in this kind of abuse where social welfare is concerned should realise that they are inflicting hardship on those who are fortunate enough at the moment to be in employment.  These people have to pay increased social welfare contributions and increased income tax and people should realise this.  People should also realise that sooner or later those at present employed will not be able to carry this burden.  Abuses where social welfare are concerned have a bad effect on the potentials of employment.  I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of what I am talking about. Some of the abuses are to my mind depriving many young people of employment in certain industries in this country.  The quicker people realise this the better.</P>
    <P>People will say there is little use of complaining about abuses when we have not sufficient personnel in the Department of Social Welfare to investigate abuses.  This is true and that it why I say that bringing in legislation and talking about fines will not prevent abuses.  The Parliamentary Secretary should give very serious consideration to recruiting more inspectors or investigators so that when a complaint is made the Department will be in a position to make a thorough investigation. I have noticed in recent times the abuse where an employer fails to stamp the cards of an employee.  Just this week I have something in the region of half a dozen unfortunate people who have applied for social welfare and are now informed that their cards for the previous year are not in the Department.  This is to my mind one of the greatest abuses because you have an unfortunate man working and not knowing how he stands when he is compelled to make a claim for social welfare benefits.  The extraordinary thing about it is that the applicant may have to wait for months while the Department officials are investigating his case or may even have to wait until such time as the Department <Col N="1397" /> institutes proceedings against the employer.  Here, again, there is not sufficient personnel to go around and examine the books of employers where employees are concerned.  It is a terrible shame that where a person produces evidence of his employment for a year to two years that he must still wait until such time as the Department have sufficient information that this employee was in employment over a period.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to bring this matter to the notice of the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is appalling to have people awaiting a decision from the Department because an employer fails to stamp a card.  Too many young people are being abused in this respect: they are brought into employment for a short period.  It is like begging: they are told: &ldquo;We will take you in and you can do odd jobs but we will not stamp your card&rdquo;. This is openly going on.  &ldquo;You can have a job if you are willing to take it but we will not pay any contribution towards social welfare&rdquo;.  This is true.  I agree with Deputy Andrews that there is urgency now about looking at the whole structure because this abuse is going on for a long time and little or nothing was done to prevent it.  As a result, the whole community suffers, those employed and those mainly dependent on social welfare, the old, the permanently sick, the physically handicapped.  They are crying out for increased social benefits, but because of abuses these people are deprived of any increase to cushion them against the ever-increasing cost of living.  I do not know the extent of this abuse but I hope those guilty of it realise what they are doing to the less fortunate in the community, those really entitled to social welfare benefit and, above all, to our economy.  People look to the Government: they are elected to run the country.  They must show leadership and take responsibility to ensure that those who abuse the social welfare code are brought to justice.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Andrews about children's allowance books being held by moneylenders.  This is a form of blackmail.  Because a person runs into <Col N="1398" /> a lean period he must produce his children's allowance book as a guarantee against a very small amount of money given by way of loan.  At present the fines are not sufficient to prevent such abuse.  Not only are people asked to produce children's allowance books but documents regarding any other benefit they may be receiving from the Department.  This is an appalling state of affairs but it is happening all over.  During our period of office&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary may also have some in his hands&mdash; we were able to lay hands on some such people and prevent the continuation of this abuse.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Parliamentary Secretary's stand in trying to prevent further harm being done to the social welfare code.  We support this effort 100 per cent but at the same time there is urgent need now to examine the whole structure from the experience of the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials and we are at the stage when some proposals in this respect should be introduced in the House.  I sincerely hope that those engaging in those abuses realise the danger they are in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that Deputy Andrews as spokesman for his party supported the introduction of this Bill.  His contribution in many respects has been a valuable and a very balanced one in that he went to considerable pains to point out that he agreed with my assessment of the limited amount of abuse that is occurring against the social welfare code. By expressing his agreement on that he has done justice to a great many people who are dependent on social welfare payments and who have been indiscriminately slandered by people who, under the rules of this House I can only describe as the media describes them, as leading industrialists.  I have spoken about this before.  On a number of occasions they have made wild attacks on people who, in my opinion, are victims of our society and who find themselves out of employment and dependent on social welfare benefit which is theirs by right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> The amount of coverage these so-called leading industrialists have managed to acquire on the media has built up a climate of opinion here which in my estimation is dangerous and dangerously anti-social welfare. We often hear of the tremendous amount of money paid out annually by the State in social welfare payments of various kinds.  Unfortunately the most vocal of the critics of social welfare, particularly in relation to pay-related benefit, are those who have taken the least trouble to find out how precisely that scheme operates.  I have seen some deplorable distortions of the operation of that system by newspaper columnists, usually those who engage in gossip columns, not political commentators, and who make sweeping statements implying to the country at large that everybody drawing unemployment benefit or assistance is spending that money solely on drink.  That is the impression such people have managed to convey through their access to the media.  It is only right to say that they have done a grave injustice and disservice to many less fortunate people in our society.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews quoted from a parliamentary question he had tabled to ascertain the number of prosecutions taken under the social welfare code over a number of years; I think 1973, 1974 and 1975 were the years. It was revealed that in some cases, as he was at pains to point out, no prosecutions or convictions had taken place.  The ones on which he concentrated that fell into that category were the children's allowance and old age pensions.  For both of those benefits the qualifying facts are very easily ascertained.  If one is going to draw children's allowances, one produces a birth certificate in respect of the child or children involved.  The Department know precisely the age of the child or children and what will be the duration of their eligibility for benefit.  It is very difficult to defraud as far as children's allowances are concerned.  Naturally, there would be less prosecutions under that heading.  The same applies to old age pensions.  There is a qualifying <Col N="1400" /> age in respect of which a birth certificate is also necessary for substantiation. In the case of contributory old age pensions, there is a stamp record at the disposal of the Department&mdash; indeed the record is kept within the Department&mdash;so that it is easy to determine whether or not a person qualifies under the law.  Therefore it is very difficult to defraud under that heading of the social welfare code.  I do not think they were very good examples.  Deputy Andrews continued and came to the same conclusion as I did: that the number of prosecutions that take place show clearly that the number of people engaged in this anti-social welfare practice is relatively small.</P>
    <P>I accept that not all abuses come to light; of course they do not.  Also, it should be known that not all abuses go to court.  The Department of Social Welfare are not out for blood; they are out for equity and justice.  If they come across a particular case and it is clear that it is not a practice or has not continued for any length of time, that the money can be recovered and they are satisfied that no further abuses will be engaged in, up to now they did not necessarily insist on a prosecution.  Therefore, the figures in that respect do not totally reveal the number of detections made by the Department. Like Deputy Andrews, I hope that the penalties provided for in this Bill will not be imposed.  We are hopeful that their existence will be a deterrent.  We are hopeful also that the limited amount of abuse being engaged in will cease in the knowledge that those penalties are now being provided by the Oireachtas and can be imposed by the courts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wyse said, first of all, that he could not understand the need for the Bill and then, towards the end of his remarks, welcomed it.  Therefore, I am somewhat confused as to what is his attitude to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>But all the Oireachtas can do under our system is determine what are to be the maximum penalties <Col N="1401" /> for a particular offence that can be imposed by the courts.  There is no obligation on the courts to impose those maximum penalties.  This House, rightfully so&mdash;and I am sure everybody else will agree with me&mdash; cannot bring pressure to bear on the courts, cannot influence the courts in their decisions, cannot say to them that in this particular case they should impose the maximum penalty and in some other case impose a lesser one, or that they should acquit a person.  That is a matter, rightly, solely for the courts.  The courts have within their power the right to use their discretion in individual cases coming before them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews said he could not see the necessity, in one sense, for the increased penalties being imposed. Then he cited a few cases in which prison sentences had been imposed and were then suspended by the courts.  I do not see anything wrong with that; I rather welcome that.  It is proper that justice be tempered with mercy and compassion.  In an individual case coming before a court, all of the relevant facts of that case being presented to the court, it is right that extenuating circumstances, if they exist, be taken into consideration by the court.  I should not like to see a change in that compassionate approach by some&mdash;and I underline some&mdash;of the Judiciary.  I do not think there is any case to answer with regard to this House embodying maximum sentences in law.  It is a clear indication of the seriousness with which the Houses of the Oireachtas view a particular crime or breach of the law.  It is then up to the courts to judge individual cases on their merits and, if they see fit, impose up to the maximum penalty allowable under legislation passed by the Oireachtas, or, should they see fit, to impose a lesser penalty than the maximum laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the important aspect of this matter is that there is building up a climate of opinion against progress in the field of social welfare as a result of the illegal activities of a small number of people.  Such a trend will impede progress in this area, progress <Col N="1402" /> which undoubtedly is necessary because despite all the irresponsible statements and attacks that appear in the media these days in relation to the big benefits being paid under the social welfare code, the fact remains that in relation to the other EEC countries, we have a considerable way to go in relation to many aspects of social welfare before we can boast of our achievements.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, more than anyone else, I am very conscious of the considerable increases that have been granted in social welfare payments during the past three years but we must bear in mind that old-age pensioners receive only a little more than £10 per week. Let us have regard to the facts and disregard the distorted and nonsensical comments that come to us through the media, comments which give a false impression of the whole picture.  It is reasonable to request that, before making these general statements, the people concerned would at least take the trouble of ascertaining the facts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews made a valuable and a balanced contribution to the Second Stage debate.  Among the questions he raised was that of the situation in regard to disability benefits&mdash;the number of cases concerned and the number of prosecutions that were brought in respect of abuses of such payments.  This area of social welfare is one of the most difficult in which to detect fraudulency because benefits can only be paid fraudulently if there is collusion on the part of members of the medical profession.  It is high time that some members of the medical profession introduced more integrity and became more conscious of their responsibility to society as a whole rather than to hand out glibly medical certificates, sometimes, I understand, on request and without examination.  Perhaps there will be some reaction to this criticism of them but if what I say will have the effect of instilling a little sense of responsibility into some members of that profession, it will be worth while.</P>
    <P>During this Second Stage debate the whole emphasis of the Opposition on abuses of the social welfare code has <Col N="1403" /> related to the making of claims against the code but there is another form of abuse which is at least as widely practised as that in relation to claims and which is much more serious because not only does it result in defrauding the State but it involves engaging in direct theft from employees.  I refer to those employers who deduct at source employees' contributions in respect of social welfare payments but who do not return those payments to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Very often such practices are not detected until an employee concerned submits to the Department what is a legitimate claim for benefit.  At that stage it is discovered that although his contributions were deducted by the employer week after week, the employer not only has not paid his share of the contribution but has pocketed the employee's share.  Can anyone think of a more despicable practice or of one more deserving of our total and unreserved condemnation? The Government are determined to put an end to this type of abuse.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews referred to the complex nature of the Bill.  I accept that it tends to be technical but as was pointed out in the explanatory memorandum, much of the Bill is a repeat of previous legislation, the reason for this being to allow Deputies to read the new provisions in their full context.  However, the Bill is not as complex as Deputy Andrews suggests. Every possible care has been taken by the parliamentary draftsmen, by officers of the Department and those of the Attorney General's office to ensure that the Bill was simplified in so far as possible.  Having regard to the nature of the Bill and to the complexity of our laws as well as to the essential element of closing off as many loopholes as possible, the Bill can be seen as one of the least complex pieces of legislation ever to come before the House in connection with social welfare.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies Andrews and Wyse raised the question of the redrafting of our entire social welfare law.  I <Col N="1404" /> spent a good deal of time in Opposition and, consequently, I am aware that when a Government announce their intention to take some specific action, the Opposition pick on the announcement and continue to call for the implementation of whatever is involved.  I am not criticising that attitude. I regard it as a legitimate part of political life.  Some time ago I announced that we were updating the social welfare laws.  Deputy Andrews was fair enough to concede that, as I have discovered, this is a long, difficult and complex operation.  We have made a very considerable amount of progress, and in fact new legislation updating all our previous social welfare legislation is in the Attorney General's office at the moment and we hope that it will be possible to circulate the Bill some time in the coming autumn.</P>
    <P>I have asked for this Bill to be passed tonight.  I am appreciative of the fact that Deputy Andrews has indicated he is prepared to do that, so in view of that I do not intend to take up too much time in my reply. If there are any other points that need clarification I am sure we could do this at some of the further Stages that still remain to be gone through.</P>
    <P>I would like again to express my thanks to Deputy Andrews and to the House for the way this Bill has been dealt with and also for their co-operation in bringing it to a conclusion tonight as I have requested.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take Committee Stage after the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1976, Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objects of this Bill are to postpone elections to boards of fishery conservators due to take place this year until 1977 or such later time as the Minister may by order decide, and to abolish the present limit of 100 per <Col N="1405" /> cent in the increases which may be made by order in the scale of fishing licence duties.</P>
    <P>The postponement of the elections to 1976 was effected under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1974.  I had hoped that it would be possible to introduce legislation providing for a new administrative regime for our inland fisheries by October next, the latest time for holding elections to boards of conservators under the existing system. However the examination of the recommendations of the Inland Fisheries Commission and of the many submissions from fisheries' interests has taken longer than expected and I am afraid that it would not now be possible to meet the October deadline.  As I consider that it would be undesirable to hold further elections to the boards under the existing system, I am seeking power in the present Bill to postpone the elections, thus prolonging the life of the present boards beyond October next.</P>
    <P>I am confident that it will be possible to have the necessary legislation for a new system of inland fisheries administration ready for enactment by the end of this year or very early next year.  The Bill before you contains a provision enabling the Minister to postpone the elections beyond 1977 but this is merely a safeguard clause and I do not anticipate that it will need to be invoked.</P>
    <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to express once more my appreciation of the work in the conservation and protection of our fisheries which has been accomplished by the boards of conservators.  The members of the boards have worked on a voluntary basis and they have been most generous and helpful in their work for the good of the fisheries.  I look forward to the boards' members being prepared to continue their help by remaining in office for a further year.  I know that this may be putting a burden on them but I would hope that they will find it possible to do so.</P>
    <P>The second proposal in the Bill is to abolish the present limit of 100 per cent in the increases which may be made by order in the scale of fishing <Col N="1406" /> licence duties.  I have in mind raising the existing rates of licence duties beyond that limit with effect from the 1st January, 1977.  Such increases are overdue, the licence duty payable in respect of most commercial fishing engines having remained at the same figure since the middle of the last century. Higher licence duties would provide much needed additional funds for the further protection and development of our inland fisheries.  Increases in the licence duties would be made by order the draft of which would be submitted to each House of the Oireachtas for approval.</P>
    <P>I recommend this short Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to express my disappointment at the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary finds it necessary to introduce a further amendment in relation to this Bill.  On 17th July, 1974, when seeking an amendment he said at column 1315, Volume 274 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that for some time I have been considering what improvements could be made in the constitution of boards of conservators. Indeed I had hoped that prior to the elections due to take place in October this year, I would have been in a position to bring before the Oireachtas the necessary legislation to effect the revisions I had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now here, two years afterwards, we get practically a verbatim statement from the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to this.  In reply to a parliamentary question in May, 1974, the Parliamentary Secretary stated that he intended introducing legislation when the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission would be available. We on this side of the House find it rather strange to see that even though the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission has been in the Parliamentary Secretary's office since July, 1975, there is still no action being taken in relation to having any part of the report implemented.  We believe it is necessary to implement the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission, particularly in relation <Col N="1407" /> to the question of the existing structures and the boards of conservators as we know them.</P>
    <P>There are many anomalies in relation to this question of the boards and how they function, and I do not intend to detain the House on this matter because on the previous occasion when the Parliamentary Secretary introduced his amendment many aspects of the working of the boards were dealt with.</P>
    <P>One point should be mentioned on the anomalies that exist in the various boards in regard to drift net licences.  A number of areas seem to have a bigger number of these licences than others.  There is also a situation where the Foyle fishermen pay £42 for drift net licences but those on the other side of Malin Head pay only £3, although both use the same harbour.  It is past time we had legislation to iron out questions of this kind.</P>
    <P>Another reason why it is necessary to implement the recommendations of the Inland Fisheries Commission would be that industry at present is making greater use of water.  We have a situation in my county where industry is developing rapidly and the fishery and industrial interests can be at variance on the best use of water. There is also the question of pollution. Agriculture has changed during the years and we find several instances of pollution damaging fisheries; yet we can do very little about it because, I suggest, the present boards of conservators have not sufficient power to apply penalties in cases of pollution. The entire emphasis is on conservation without any mention of fishery development as such.  One can hardly blame the boards for this because they have not the necessary finance to go into development of inland fisheries to the extent they would like.</P>
    <P>We should have a look at the existing structures and try to do something positive to ensure that our fisheries are developed to the full.  In the commission's report there have been suggestions as to how development might take place and I agree with most of these.  The time has come when we <Col N="1408" /> should go further than the commission's suggestions on the use of our rivers and lakes.  We could very well take the example given by our friends across the water in getting water and river boards formed to consider usage of water in relation to industry, fishing and so on.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing that the Parliamentary Secretary has not implemented any of the suggestions in the commission's report.  We hear a good deal of talk about the importance of our fishing industry: in the last few years we have had much public debate in relation to this industry yet the only place no action has been taken in relation to it is this House.  Fishermen and others have been issuing good reports but we here seem to be sitting back.</P>
    <P>For that reason I find it hard to agree with this amending legislation. The Parliamentary Secretary has had ample time to bring in legislation to improve present structures and to come before us with something positive. In the Government's three years the only items we have had are the few small amendments introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am not happy with this Bill and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us when some action will be taken on the commission's recommendations. Obviously we will not get legislation in this term, but can the Parliamentary Secretary tell us if the report has been considered and if any thought has been given to the suggestions in it relating to the structure of the boards of conservators?  Can he tell us if any steps are being taken in the Department to ensure we will get new legislation in the near future in relation to this very important aspect of the industry?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am greatly surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary had to come before us again seeking an extension of the life of the boards of conservators.  I have not had time to peruse the debate on a previous occasion when the permission of the House was sought to continue the life of these boards, but the sentiments expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary then led me to believe he was <Col N="1409" /> sincere about seeking to introduce new legislation following the abolition of the boards as previously constituted. He told us he was awaiting the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission and that the minute he had the report, and he was pressing them for it, we would see action.  He has had the report since last July but there is no evidence of action from him or the Fisheries Division.  This is a great disappointment because the recommendations in the report are far-reaching and indeed radical in certain respects.</P>
      <P>Though I do not agree with all the recommendations they made I certainly agree they were thinking in the right direction.  There is need for these new structures to be established and the Opposition here are patiently waiting the opportunity of discussing the terms and the changes.  It seems to have been the pattern since this Dáil came into being for the Fisheries Branch to play a very conservative role, to say the least of it, and not to come forward with any legislation other than bits and pieces like this.  I expressed my personal views on the old boards of conservators quite forcibly on the last occasion on which we had an opportunity of discussing the matter and I do not intend to go over that ground again, but there are anachronisms from the old days of occupation.  The powers vested in these boards should not be vested in bodies appointed in the way these boards are and now we are being asked to continue the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the important functions of these boards is the issue of drift net licences.  There are many anomalies in the manner in which these licences are distributed.  A game of ping-pong is being played in every coastal county between the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the boards of conservators.  Applicants are unjustly turned down in many cases and, when the Parliamentary Secretary is approached, he says it is not a matter for him; it is a matter for the boards of conservators.  When the boards are approached they say it is not a matter for them; their functions are controlled by the Parliamentary <Col N="1410" /> Secretary.  The whole situation is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The number of licences in each fishery district is controlled by the Parliamentary Secretary.  Strange as it may seem, the Parliamentary Secretary's first love is down around the southern corner of the country.  The number of licences there is astronomical in comparison with the number permitted up along the west coast. One can draw one's own conclusions why this should be so.  It has caused very great resentment along the Galway coast and I am sure Deputy Gallagher will agree that the same resentment exists along the Mayo coast.  I can speak with knowledge of the Galway coast.  There we had the unusual situation where drift netting for salmon in the sea had only been permitted in the year 1969.  There was a complete ban on drift netting for the three fishery districts off the Galway coast up to that year and there could not therefore have been a tradition of drift netting for salmon off the Galway coast in the years before that because it was not permitted under an old British statute which was repealed by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The concern about conserving numbers arose early in 1970 shortly after drift netting had been permitted off the Galway coast.  I believe an exception should be made in that case and the situation should have been reviewed at the end of a period of five years' operation.  We are now being confined to the number of licences originally permitted and, because of that, a number of injustices have arisen.  One injustice is that perpetrated on fishermen resident on the islands remote from the mainland. They have only two ways in which to earn a livelihood.  They can rear cattle and stock.  There is no tillage other than a few spuds in the back garden.  Rearing stock is all that is left. The grass is good in the summer but very poor in the winter.  The only other source&mdash;it is becoming a primary source&mdash;is sea fishing.  I have appealed on numerous occasions to the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the position of the islanders in relation to the issue of salmon drift net licences. <Col N="1411" /> It is most unfair to deny them the opportunity of moving out into the seas that surround them to fish whatever species are available.  They are prohibited from catching salmon.  Side by side with that the Parliamentary Secretary tolerates the wholesale slaughter of salmon in the estuaries where they are caught by fixed engines and where there is scarcely any control whatever over the number taken.</P>
    <P>I appeal once more to the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the position.  I would like to quote for him the sentiments he expressed as far back as July, 1974, when he said in Volume 274 of the Official Report of 17th July: &ldquo;I believe every fisherman should as far as possible be entitled legally to fish for whatever kind of fish is most remunerative to him.&rdquo; The Parliamentary Secretary has had two full years to do something about that but nothing has been done.  The unsatisfactory situation is allowed to continue and it is quite impossible to give island fishermen a logical explanation as to why Michael Pat Murphy, as he is known, the Parliamentary Secretary, is refusing even to consider their case.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an almost incomprehensible obstinacy whenever representations are made.  No progress is made.  Those making representations are directed back to the boards of conservators who may not issue licences above the limit set by the Parliamentary Secretary.  The fishermen of Inishmore&mdash;unfortunately neither Inishere or Inishmaan have any facilities&mdash;have no large lobster boats but, using currachs, they are prohibited from fishing for salmon in the sea.  The same prohibition applies to Inishturbot, Inishboffin and Lettermullen.  The latter is not in the same category as the islands because it is connected with the mainland, but the same resentment exists there, as it exists around Rossaveal, because of the refusal to increase the number of licences.</P>
    <P>The number actually issued is tiny in comparison with the numbers issued in the southern counties.  We are in the unique position that Fianna Fáil abolished the ban following on a public <Col N="1412" /> inquiry instituted by the then Minister, an inquiry I attended.  I was one of the investigators in the move to have the old British statute repealed.  I worked for that continuously over a period of 12 months until the hearing was held. There was one hearing in Letterfrack, one in Carna and the final one in the courthouse in Galway.  I said my piece at the first hearing in Letterfrack and I was supported by the fishermen of the fishery districts.  Then conservation entered in and a limit on the number of salmon licences.  It is now six or seven years since the first licences were issued and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the position as it applies in County Galway and the position where anomalies exist in other coastal areas.</P>
    <P>I have made my point.  Those affected cannot understand why this attitude should prevail.  Apparently the logic of their request has not yet sunk in.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the Inland Fisheries report.  He said he is still considering the report and he is not yet ready to bring in legislation providing for the abolition of boards of conservators and the establishment of new structures.</P>
    <P>We have not seen anything from the Parliamentary Secretary for our party to take any official stand on the matter.  I make a personal appeal to him to reject out of hand the proposal in that report to impose a £2 licence fee on every rod and line cast into fresh water or salt water in the country. Many people spent valuable hours working on the Inland Fisheries Commission Report and made a valuable contribution to the development of fisheries.  They produced a remarkable document which gives a very clear and concise résumé of the progress and the history of fishery development over the past 100 years. The report gives very acurate information on the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The report is a wonderful document in most respects but I must thoroughly disagree with some of its specific proposals.  If a citizen wishes to cast a line into his local river or lake or into the sea off his local promenade or pier it is a very retrograde step for the State to demand that he must pay a £2 licence fee <Col N="1413" /> before he can indulge in that little luxury.  I believe in social justice but I do not believe in that kind of socialism, where the State takes over every little pleasure and every little activity of every citizen.  If we allow that kind of thing to creep in there will be very few things we can consider free in the country.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this proposal with people who sat on that commission and who signed their names to the report.  I have discussed this matter with what I would describe as some of the most conscientious members of that commission about how they arrived at that final decision.  The only reason they were forced to put that in was because the State was reneging on its responsibilities towards our fisheries, and the control of pollution. Those people feared that the State would not provide the funds to take care of the necessary developments so they felt it was incumbent on them in order to save our fisheries to ask everybody to pay a licence fee.</P>
    <P>We have traffic wardens looking after the parking of cars in cities.  We will now have some type of water wardens going around patrolling our canals, rivers and lakes, trying to find the small law breaker who has not got a red docket in his pocket to say he has paid his £2 licence fee.  The people of this country have enjoyed fishing for generations.  I oppose the imposition of this licence fee as vigorously as I can.  I am opposed to the principle.  There is also the fear that if the licence fee is imposed it will not remain at £2.  It will be soon raised to quite a substantial sum because of the cash hungry Minister for Finance.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not stated his views one way or another.  He has kept quiet about this proposal in the report and has not disclosed what his views are.</P>

I have made my position clear and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will agree <Col N="1414" /> with me.  It would be a great relief to many small fishermen in the country if when the Parliamentary Secretary replies to this debate he gives a clear indication that he feels the same way as I do.</P>

I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to be outspoken in demanding exclusive fishing limits for this country.  This would protect our small fishing industry and allow it to grow.  I am afraid the Chair will intervene if I go on to discuss the size of boats which we have seen along our coastline.</P>

      <P>It is a tragedy to find that we have a Government and a Parliamentary Secretary who have had the benefit of a most concise and praisworthy report but who have taken no action on it.  The Inland Fisheries Commission were established by the Fianna Fáil Government to make this report, so the Parliamentary Secretary has taken no initiative in relation to fisheries since he took office.  His record will be a very poor one unless he does something soon, because we all know that this Dáil is petering out.  We are marking off the months on the calendar.  It will only last for up to another 12 months so the Parliamentary Secretary has very little time to do something positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak long on this but I felt that it was very provocative of the Parliamentary Secretary to come into the House with this Bill at this stage.  The speech made by him tonight establishes that, of all the members of the Cabinet and of the Parliamentary Secretaries, he has introduced a Bill <Col N="1415" /> to establish that he is the most incompetent of the lot.  He promised a great deal in connection with fisheries but now we have an amending Bill to a Bill rushed through the House two years ago before the summer recess. This Bill is now being rushed through because the Parliamentary Secretary is not in a position to make the necessary alterations in time to have the elections next October.</P>
      <P>I have had experience of being Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I came in on this Bill because of my knowledge of the activities of the civil servants in the fishery section of that Department.  I know those people have a great deal of industry if they are given the chance.  Two years ago the Parliamentary Secretary was awaiting the report from the Inland Fisheries Commission and that is the reason he had to bring in the amending Bill in that year.  He said he did not want to have conservators elected again until he could have amending legislation brought in following the presentation of the report.</P>
      <P>We know that this report has been in the hands of the Parliamentary Secretary since last July.  Today he said casually that the examination of the recommendations of the Inland Fisheries Commission and the many submissions from fishery interests took longer than expected and he was afraid it would not now be possible to meet the October deadline.  The Parliamentary Secretary should be ashamed to make that statement.  The commission were set up to bring in that report which the Parliamentary Secretary has had for a year.  The Parliamentary Secretary has come into this House and has blamed the Inland Fisheries Commission and the many fishing interests for holding him up. There is a summary session every year and it must have been obvious to the Parliamentary Secretary that new legislation should have been brought in before now, as was promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that he hopes to have the necessary <Col N="1416" /> legislation ready for enactment by the end of this year or very early next year.  Yet, he has the audacity to provide in the Bill that if he falls down on the job again he will not have to suffer the indignity of having to come to the House asking for a further postponement.  The Bill makes provision that the elections shall be held in 1977 or in a later year, possibly in 1978 or 1979.  This provision is inserted in the Bill in case the Parliamentary Secretary is not able to pull himself out of the lethargy into which he has fallen since he was given responsibility for the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>As Deputies Gallagher and Molloy have pointed out, the fishing industry is very important.  It could be called the cinderella industry despite its enormous potential.  The Parliamentary Secretary has paid lip-service to the industry in the last three years but nothing has been done to help it.  We looked forward to entry to the EEC in order to effect an improvement in the state of the industry, but nothing was done.  There is a report on the industry gathering dust on the Parliamentary Secretary's desk for the last year and it is liable to continue doing so according to his statement to the House this evening.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that he is confident he will have the necessary legislation before the House by the end of this year or early next year but he added a further paragraph to the effect that the Bill contains a provision enabling him to postpone the elections beyond 1977. He further stated that this is a safeguard clause, that he did not anticipate that it would need to be invoked. It boils down to the fact that he was more confident two years ago that he would do something than he is now.</P>
    <P>The second part of the Bill deals with an increase in licence fees, another form of invisible taxation.  The Parliamentary Secretary does not share the inhibitions of other Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries.  Other Ministers tell us that measures are delayed because of financial implications but the Parliamentary Secretary has no such defence.  I have knowledge of the administrators in the section dealing <Col N="1417" /> with fisheries and I know that there they are most anxious to go ahead with their work.  However, officials in a Department cannot make headway when the top man is lying down and this is what is happening so far as concerns the person who is in charge of our fishing industry.  We have noted his smart-aleck incompetence in the last few years in general debates on the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>In this case we have readymade recommendations. As Deputy Molloy pointed out, there are pros and cons regarding the matter but the fact remains that people have spent a lot of time in making these recommendations to the Parliamentary Secretary.  He has paid tribute to them but his real thanks is to leave the report lying on his desk.  It epitomises the general overall approach of the Coalition to all legislation.  Their attitude is to make promises but not to follow them through.  We have been told that the legislation will be introduced at the end of this year or next year but there is the built-in codicil in case the Parliamentary Secretary cannot keep his promise.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary has any sincerity regarding this matter, on Committee Stage he should introduce an amendment to withdraw the option he is building in for himself with regard to postponement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other Deputies I am very disappointed regarding the further delay in introducing this Bill.  We have heard the Parliamentary Secretary on other occasions saying he hoped he would not have to postpone the elections.  I am not sure that it is entirely the fault of the Parliamentary Secretary. During the Mayo by-election I heard Government speakers state outside church gates that the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission would not be acted upon and that there would not be any legislation introduced to deal with the matter.  That gives me reason to believe that the Parliamentary Secretary is not entirely to blame, that it is a Government decision to delay further action in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The boards of conservators have <Col N="1418" /> the distinction of being the oldest surviving form of elected local authority and they have given their services voluntarily.  They do not even get travelling expenses and this is something that should be rectified.</P>
    <P>There is another provision in the Bill to abolish the present limit of 100 per cent in the increases in fishing licence duties.  This is an amazing provision to put into any Bill.  What type of licence duty does the Parliamentary Secretary propose for salmon fishermen? He has damaged them quite enough.  It is time he did something positive and constructive in the area of conservancy and in the development of salmon stocks.  Recently I asked him a parliamentary question, regarding the amount of money being spent on the provision of spawning stocks, particularly salmon stocks, and I was told that the figure for last year was approximately £2,000.  With expenditure of that amount I do not see how anything constructive could be done in providing salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not delay any further, that he will come forward with the legislation both he and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries have promised.  I hope he will act on the recommendations in relation to the rationalisation of the boards and in regard to proper working conditions for people employed by them.  At the present time inspectors and others employed by fishery boards are working on a day-to-day basis.  They have no permanent salary arrangements and there is no guarantee of continuity of employment. These are serious matters that should be covered in any legislation. It is all very well to introduce legislation rationalising the boards and making them more efficient but it is necessary to introduce legislation which will make the staffs of the boards fairly sure of their employment. This is not the case at present. As I have said already, individual members of staffs of fishery boards can be dismissed at the whim of members of the boards.  This is undesirable. They should have proper working conditions written into the law.  We should also cover their <Col N="1419" /> salaries and the continuity of their employment.  It is not fair to expect people to work a seven-day week with no guarantee of continuity of employment from one week to the next.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will keep this in mind when he is framing legislation.  I was disappointed that we were having a rehash of this matter.  We had it all before. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will get the message and get down to doing something positive and constructive in this area in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would much prefer to be dealing with the main Bill rather than the present one. Speaking here last year and on previous extension Bills, I had hoped to have the main legislation before the House by the summer recess.  What has happened?  We got the inland fisheries report in August, 1975.  It took around five years to compile it. It contains a number of representations which had to be closely examined and scrutinised.  As well as that, I invited recommendations from all other interests irrespective of who they were.  I invited them to send in written recommendations on our fisheries development which they though should be implemented.  We got a number of views which are quite valuable.  In fact, some recommendations came to us as late as December, 1975.  I was very grateful for them.  I realise our fisheries are important and that, when we had in mind a measure which I hope will be reasonably comprehensive, we should not only have the advantage of the recommendations of the Inland Fisheries Commission but also the advantage of recommendations and suggestions from many other groups and bodies and individual fishermen with an interest in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally it takes a great deal of time to examine these recommendations. I do not believe in rushed legislation.  I am here long enough to know rushed legislation is not good <Col N="1420" /> legislation.  Even though we are looking for an extension of the present system beyond October of this year, I do not think the sky will fall down on our fisheries as a result.  One would think some disaster had overcome our fisheries by virtue of this Bill if one were to interpret literally the statement of the second last speaker, Deputy Lalor.  We are continuing our efforts to develop our inland and sea fisheries competently and efficiently.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go outside the terms of this Bill but I am a great believer in affording the House an opportunity of expressing their views. During my time over there, I always expressed the view that Members of the Oireachtas should have the opportunity of debating important matters affecting our country as frequently as possible.  I am disappointed that we had no opportunity earlier in this session of debating the Fisheries Estimate generally.  I had hoped we would have that opportunity.  Unfortunately, pressure of business ruled this out so far, but I have no doubt that, when the Dáil resumes, not only will we have legislation ready, but we will have an opportunity of debating the fisheries industry generally.  It would be an advantage to me and to the Department to have a general review before the proposed Bill reaches its final form.  I accept that there are Members on both sides of the House who have valuable suggestions to make which could be embodied in the proposed measure.  Wherever valuable suggestions come from, irrespective of whether it is from the Opposition or Government side of the House, they will get the attention they deserve and if they are worthwhile suggestions we will try to embody them in the pending legislation.</P>
    <P>The last major Fisheries Bill which came before the House was in 1959, 17 years ago.  Any measures introduced in the intervening period were minor ones.  I hope we will be as comprehensive as possible in this measure, that we will take cognisance of the changes in the industry since the Bill was approved in the House 17 years ago and that we will also take cognisance of the changes surrounding <Col N="1421" /> certain species of our fish and the position of salmon generally so far as our inland fisheries are concerned. This applies to sea fisheries also.  Salmon are very important to our economy.  The figures last year, and in the previous year, indicate that the value of the catch was more than £3 million, and that is a sizeable percentage of our total fish catch.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher, the main Opposition spokesman on fisheries, did not go into detail on this Bill because he realised it was of a confined nature. I do not want to go into detail either, but the salmon question is a very vexed question.  Views differ very much. People representing inland centres in particular have an idea that our fishery laws need drastic changing in relation to drift netting.  That question came up during the term of office of the previous Government and they dealt with it in the way they thought necessary and essential at the time.  As everybody knows, they imposed grave restrictions on drift net licences, and it was very difficult to measure up to the criteria laid down by my predecessor, Deputy Fahey, to qualify for a drift net licence.  The Government and I felt we would take a more liberal stance and that we could do that without endangering our salmon stocks.  As a result, we amended the order that existed in 1972 and changed the qualifications particularly for drift net licences and thus enabled fishermen who are to a large extent dependent on fishing for their livelihood, and many of them to a reasonable extent on salmon fishing, to acquire licences.</P>
    <P>Whether that was a good policy or bad policy remains to be told.  I expressed the view that it was good policy, and judging by the fact that our catch volume last year was somewhat in excess of the previous year, I am satisfied that time shows that the orders made up to the present are justifiable.  But if the trend should change as a result of what will happen this year, it can be reconsidered.  Fortunately we will have the advantage of knowing what will happen in regard to salmon this year before bringing legislation to the House.  That is one favourable aspect I have in mind, that <Col N="1422" /> we will have this year's trend in the volume of salmon catches as well as those for 1973, 1974 and 1975.</P>
    <P>The questions of conservancy and pollution are very important.  I do not think it is necessary to deal with them here in this Bill&mdash;because it does not lend itself to a wide debate on such matters&mdash;other than to say in passing that the conservancy and pollution questions are taken up actively by the Department.  Last year we appointed six pollution officers, and I am satisfied it was a beneficial move in as much as the work being done by these officers, to say the least, is well worth the cost.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy was worried about the issue of licences and implied that licences were not issued on a uniform basis, that there were some anomalies or peculiarities and that possibly to some extent there were wilful irregularities on the part of boards of conservators in the issue of licences.</P>

      <P>It is my responsibility to make an order.  The orders were made in 1973 and 1974 and continued in 1975 and 1976, laying down certain regulations for qualification for drift net licences.  It is no harm to repeat this because drift netting was the main point made by the speakers in the debate.  We make the regulations, but I have no authority to issue licences.  It is the 15 boards of conservators and the two administrators who are vested with that authority.  What they must do is to examine all applications in the light of the criteria set down by the Department. If the applications measure up to those criteria the licences are granted, provided the boards have a sufficiency of licences to do so.  There is a ceiling on the licences that boards can grant <Col N="1423" /> at present.  If the qualified applicants exceed the number of licences that can be legally granted by the board, then they must make a choice as to who is least deserving and rule out those applicants.  However, I do not know if that actually happens in any cases because my knowledge is that some boards are not issuing the number of licences they are legally entitled to issue, because there is not a sufficiency of qualified applicants.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy suggested that County Galway was faring badly in regard to the number of licences allocated. Take the Ballinakill district of Galway.  They could issue 47 licences, but there were only 35 qualified applicants. Therefore that board was able to issue only 75 per cent of licences through lack of qualified applicants, and I think that is true of other boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and there was a great easement of the regulations. I am sure of this that in the three Galway areas, for Deputy Molloy's information, in 1973 under Deputy Fahey's order, the number of applicants who could qualify was 72. By virtue of the easement, up to 115 could qualify, that is, 43 more, an increase of 55 to 60 per cent in the number who could qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we cannot be more liberal in regard to the granting of drift net licences.  I have not the slightest doubt that we could get 5,000 applications around the coast at present and that many of those applications <Col N="1424" /> would be from people who are connected all their lives with the fishing industry, but we just cannot grant them.  I did make use of the term quoted from the Official Report by Deputy Molloy, that a fisherman will try to fish for any species he thinks will give him the best return.  He is entitled to do that in so far as he complies with our laws and regulations. Unfortunately the day is gone when we can allow people to fish <i>ad lib</i> for our salmon.  If we were to do so the salmon stocks would be wiped out.  We have tried to devise regulations, particularly in relation to drift nets, which are fair in the circumstances obtaining, and I am hopeful&mdash;and I have no evidence to the contrary&mdash;that the boards of conservators allocate these licences fairly and in accordance with the regulations. I have, in the preamble to this Bill, paid tribute to the work of the fishery conservators.  It is a difficult and unpleasant task and we know that when an applicant is turned down, even though his application is not justifiable, he is at times critical of those who turned him down.  The board has to put up with criticism, but if on the other hand, as I think alleged by Deputy Molloy, there are people who feel aggrieved, boards usually will consider any new factors that may be adduced by applicants. Particularly boards who have not allocated their full quota of licences are in a position to review cases.</P>
    <P>This Bill is asking the House to give approval for the postponement of the elections.  I am sure that any fair-minded Deputy will agree that this postponement arises from circumstances outside our control.  We did not want, last May, June or July, to try to get this Bill through the draftsman and then rush it through the House.</P>

      <P>The husband of the person named by the Deputy died on 16th February, 1976.  He had been in receipt of unemployment assistance up to the date of his death and in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1974, this assistance continued to be paid to his widow for the period of six weeks after his death.  Where such payment is made the Act provides that entitlement to widow's pension shall not commence until after the expiration of such period of six weeks.  Entitlement to widow's pension did not, therefore, commence in the case referred to by the Deputy until 2nd April, 1976.  A pension order book payable from 23rd April, 1976, was issued on 20th April, 1976.  The arrears of widow's pension due for the period 2nd April, 1976, to 22nd April, 1976, were paid to the local authority in refund of advances of home assistance made to the widow during the same period.  Authority to make such refund is contained in section 55 of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy claimed disability benefit from 22nd March, 1976, but was not entitled to benefit as he had no paid or credited contributions in the contribution year governing his claim. When advised of this position the claimant furnished information regarding his employment in the United Kingdom and this information was sent to the Department of Health and Social Security with a request for details of contributions which could be taken into account for the purpose of the claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 5th May, 1976, that Department advised that only 18 contributions had been received in respect of the governing contribution year and, as this is less than the minimum of 26 required, the claimant was again advised that he was not qualified for disability benefit.  On 14th May, 1976, the claimant's United Kingdom insurance card for the year ended 6th April, 1975, was forwarded to my Department and this was transmitted to the Department of Health and Social Security to ascertain if any additional contributions were reckonable for the purpose of the claim.  On 14th June, 1976, a revised record was received from the Department of Health and Social Security which gave the claimant an entitlement to disability benefit.  On 18th June, 1976, payment of the amount of benefit due up to 12th May, 1976, was issued <Col N="1337" /> after which date his claim has been disallowed as he was found to be capable of work when examined by a medical referee on 13th May, 1976.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The necessary arrangements for the erection, extension and improvement of national schools are, once the contracts have been placed, entirely in the hands of the Commissioners of Public Works.  In recent months contracts have been placed for the erection of new schools at Ballycasheen and St. Gertrude's, Killarney, Ballyhearney (Valentia) and Kilgarvan; and for major works of improvement or extension at Ballybunion Convent and Fossa national schools.  I am not in a position to say when the schemes may have commenced or will commence.</P>
      <P>The following projects are in the final planning stages, namely, proposed new schools at Ballinskelligs, Ranalough (Killeentierna) and Scartaglen and a major extension at Tarbert.  It is not possible to say at this juncture when the works will commence.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers is a progress report submitted recently by the National Co-Ordinator for Education of the National Council for Travelling People.  The report was submitted in the context of a policy document issued by my Department in 1970 arising out of the report of the Commission on Itinerancy and it reflects the policy lines laid down in that document. It records the progress achieved to date and indicates areas in which further development is required.  The programme of development is being implemented progressively in accordance <Col N="1342" /> with the resources available and the inherent difficulty of coping with the circumstances of some of the families involved.</P>
