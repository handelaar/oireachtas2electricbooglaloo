      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £26,088,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st of December, 1976, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of Public Works; for expenditure in respect of public buildings; for the maintenance of certain parks and public works; for the execution and maintenance of drainage and other engineering works; for expenditure arising from damage to the property of External Governments; and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>

      <P>The net amount sought for Vote 9&mdash;Public Works and Buildings&mdash;for this year is £26,088,000, an increase of approximately <Col N="758" /> 38 per cent on the total amount voted for this purpose in 1975.</P>
      <P>The major part of the increase is required to meet expenditure on works with a high employment content, which I will refer to in more detail as I comment on the various subheads that make up the Estimate.</P>
      <P>Subheads A1, A2, B and C cover the administrative expenses of the Office of Public Works.  Subhead A2 is a new subhead, included this year for the first time.  The provision of £5,000 is required mainly to meet the balance of the cost of the Shannon Recreation Study which was commissioned jointly by the Office of Public Works and Bord Fáilte.  The main objective of the study was to establish guidelines for the conservation and co-ordinated development of the River Shannon for tourist and recreation needs.  The consultants' report has recently been received and, while it is still being studied, I am confident that it will be of invaluable assistance not only to the two bodies who commissioned it but to the various local authorities and other public bodies who have interests in this great natural resource.</P>
      <P>The provision under subhead D covers purchases of sites and premises for various Government services, including the acquisition of the fee simple of some existing leasehold properties. The subhead provides also for the purchase of land required for the national monuments service and for national parks and amenity areas.</P>
      <P>In previous years, reference was made to the policy of the National Parks and Monuments Branch of my office in relation to the creation of new national parks.  Good progress was maintained in this field over the past 12 months and I am glad to report the successful conclusion of negotiations for the acquisition of two substantial areas in County Galway which will form the nucleus of a proposed Connemara National Park.  A total of approximately 2,540 acres of land at Kylemore and Letterfrack are being purchased and I expect these transactions to be completed within the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the support of Bord Fáilte a comprehensive planning study is being <Col N="759" /> undertaken to assist the commissioners in formulating a long-term plan for the management and development of this park.  Announcements will be made from time to time as to the extent to which the park will be available to the public for recreation.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the creation of a national park in Connemara will in time provide a tremendous boost to the economic and social life of the region and both my office and Bord Fáilte will be working closely with Galway County Council and other local interests to achieve this end.</P>
    <P>The amount being provided under subhead E, £9,350,000, covers the cost of new and improved accommodation for various Government Departments and the services they administer and of improved facilities for these services.  This involves the implementation of a planned building programme for Dublin and the provinces.  The cost of works in connection with national parks, waterways and monuments and marine works is also included under this subhead.  A list of all the works for which provision is made has been supplied to Deputies.  I will comment on the more significant items.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to complete the installation this year of standby generators to provide emergency lighting for Leinster House and certain areas of the Government Buildings complex in the event of power failure.</P>
    <P>Additional accommodation has been provided for staff of the Oireachtas and space vacated in Leinster House is being reallocated and refurbished.  Further additional space has been secured and will be fitted out for use inside the next few months.</P>
    <P>A total of £2,431,000 is provided for items falling under the heading of the Department of Finance.  As usual, this heading covers a wide variety of works ranging from the fitting out of new offices for various Departments to development works at national parks and harbour improvements.  Apart from provisions for some specific projects, the cost <Col N="760" /> of the office building programme which was shown in this section of the subhead in previous years is now separately listed.  It appears as item 170 in this year's list.</P>
    <P>The biggest single item remaining under the Department of Finance heading is the provision for the fitting out of office blocks, mainly rented, for various Departments in Dublin and the provinces.  My predecessor mentioned last year that difficulties which had been encountered in relation to the site for a new customs road station at Monaghan had been resolved and that tenders had been invited.  Work is now in progress and will be completed this year.  A site has been acquired for additional office accommodation, examination sheds and parking facilities for lorries at Dundalk customs road station.  Planning is in hands.</P>
    <P>Adaptation works at Government Buildings, south block, are well in hand and occupation by staff on a phased basis will commence shortly.</P>
    <P>The new printing building for the Ordnance Survey Office is virtually completed.  Staff are already in part occupation of the building.</P>
    <P>The new buildings which my predecessor referred to last year at Drogheda, Letterkenny and Roscommon have now been occupied.  It is hoped to place a contract in the near future for new offices at Ballyshannon and planning is proceeding at Navan, Waterford and Mullingar as part of the provincial office building programme.</P>
    <P>Temporary additional accommodation is being provided in part of the former St. Vincent's Hospital premises at Lower Leeson Street for some of the State Laboratory staff. Planning is well advanced on a scheme for the adaptation for concert hall purposes of portion of the UCD premises at Earlsfort Terrace.  It is hoped that it will be possible to complete the planning stage by the end of this year which would allow of a start being made on the adaptations in 1977, but this will depend on how soon the UCD authorities can release the space required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> I am glad to state that planning for the next stage of the restoration of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, which my predecessor mentioned briefly last year, is proceeding satisfactorily. It is hoped that tenders for building work can be invited early next year.  This is a large and complex project involving as it does careful restoration and it will extend over a period of years.</P>
    <P>Tenders have been received for the first phase of the internal rehabilitation of Scoil Éanna and a contract will shortly be placed.  This phase of the work is expected to take about 18 months to complete.</P>
    <P>Items 33-42&mdash;National Parks&mdash; accounting for a total provision of £178,000 cover developments at our national parks for the improvement of both visitor and staff facilities.  A sum of £10,000 is being allocated for the provision of a Natural History Exhibition Centre and for garages, offices, stores, and so on, for the park maintenance staff at St. Enda's, Rathfarnham. It had been hoped to have these provided last year but the project was delayed.  It is now expected to go ahead this year.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Estimate last year my predecessor referred to the urgent need to instal new water supply and sewage disposal systems at Muckross House, Killarney.  Difficulties were met in the course of planning the water supply scheme, the first stage of the project, and it was not until the end of the year that a contract for the work was placed.  In the circumstances expenditure during 1975 was minimal.  A provision of £40,000 has been made for this year. This should be adequate to complete the water supply scheme and to make a start on the sewage system, which will include tertiary treatment, the planning of which is in hands.</P>
    <P>Items 35-37&mdash;Killarney National Park&mdash;provide for other improvements at the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park.  Work on the roads development project is continuing satisfactorily and will be pursued further this year.  Modern visitor facilities are proposed for Muckross House and for Gearhameen where improved staff quarters will also be provided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> Last year my predecessor expressed the hope that the picture gallery wing of Kilkenny Castle would be opened to the public later in the year.  However, although good progress continued to be maintained on the work of restoring this wing it did not prove possible to complete the work on time. I do not now expect the contract to be completed until the early summer but arrangements are being made to have this part of the castle opened to the public in time for the Kilkenny Arts Week which will be held towards the end of August.</P>
    <P>My office hope to make a start this year on the provision of additional public toilets in the Phoenix Park.  During the last few years there has been comment about the need for such facilities and about the condition of those existing.  It is hoped that the position will be improved in stages over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Our overall scheme for the development of the Phoenix Park extension is still being re-examined in the light of Dublin Corporation's proposals for road improvements in the area. Although I am not yet in a position to say what the outcome of this reconsideration will be, some general developments will be undertaken during the year.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that we are now in a position to undertake the first of our development proposals at the recently established Glenveagh National Park.  A sum of £8,000 is being allocated for the provision of car parks for visitors to the park.  A number of these will be required because at present there are no such facilities at the estate.  They will be provided in stages over the next few years.  As in the case of Connemara, a comprehensive planning study is being undertaken for this park with the help of Bord Fáilte and in consultation with the Donegal County Council who have promised full co-operation with the scheme.</P>
    <P>A total of £112,500 has been provided for inland waterways.  This figure includes a sum of £2,000 for the continuation of the survey of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal but otherwise the money is required for <Col N="763" /> the development of the Shannon navigation. The River Shannon continues to grow in popularity for pleasure cruising and other recreational uses and the investment which the Office of Public Works are making in the provision of facilities is very well worth while.</P>
    <P>The new boat harbour at Mountshannon, County Clare, has recently been completed and the new quay at Rossmore, County Galway, is nearing completion.  Work will commence shortly on the new jetty at Hodson's Bay, near Athlone, and it is hoped too that, with the co-operation of Galway County Council, the provision of the new harbour at Portumna Castle will be put in hands during the year.</P>
    <P>The restoration of the Lough Allen canal from Battlebridge to Lough Acres in County Leitrim is now at an advanced stage and I expect that within the next 12 months boats will be navigating this stretch of canal for the first time in 40 years.</P>
    <P>A total of £61,500 is required this year for some new works in connection with the national monuments service. Last year my predecessor mentioned the proposed national heritage exhibition centre to be set up jointly by Bord Fáilte and the Office of Public Works at Cahir Castle, County Tipperary.  I am glad to say that sufficient progress was made with this to enable the centre to be opened to the public in August last.  However, further work remains to be done this year.  In the meantime, I hope that this exhibition centre, in its admirable setting, will help to create an increased public awareness of our national heritage.</P>
    <P>Another major work in progress is the restoration of the Vicars' Choral at the Rock of Cashel to serve as a visitors' reception area.  Improved visitor facilities at Clonmacnoise are being planned.  Special emphasis will be placed on attracting the river traffic on the Shannon.</P>
    <P>Some improvements in accommodation at the depots from which the national monuments are serviced are proposed and also the setting-up of a new depot in Killarney.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> Provision is again required for some new works at harbours.  Good progress is expected this year with the scheme for the improvement of the landing facilities at Clare Island, County Mayo, which unfortunately suffered protracted delay due to a contractual dispute.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to carry out a boring survey at Inishbofin, County Galway, to determine the feasibility and estimated cost of dredging a channel which is necessary to improve transport facilities and communication with the mainland.</P>
    <P>Provision is also included for the balance of expenditure on the erection of a ramp and causeway at the Mail Boat Pier at Dún Laoghaire Harbour to enable the pier to cater for vessels with accommodation for passengers travelling with or without cars.  This work, which has been completed, increases the capacity of the harbour to handle tourist and other traffic.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that the three schemes mentioned above are only a small portion of the total marine works programme of the Office of Public Works.  The greater part of this programme is financed from the Fisheries and Gaeltacht Votes.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provision of a building to provide office accommodation for the staff directly associated with the Public Service computer system, construction work has commenced and the building is expected to be ready by the end of 1977.</P>
    <P>The provision for the Department of Justice amounts to £1,101,000, of which works for the Garda Síochána account for £1,041,000.</P>
    <P>The programme for the erection of new Garda stations and the major improvement of existing stations was speeded up considerably last year and provision is made for further acceleration this year.  Work was completed at 13 centres last year and is in progress at 22 centres.  It is hoped that contracts can be placed for works at about 20 other centres before the end of the year.  Planning is in progress in a number of other cases.</P>
    <P>A new district headquarters has been opened at Ballyshannon and <Col N="765" /> major improvements have been completed at Mountjoy and Store Street metropolitan stations.  The new divisional headquarters at Limerick will be completed this year and work is proceeding on district headquarters at Castlerea and Granard.  It is hoped to place contracts shortly for new buildings at Castleblayney and Newcastle West and planning is at an advanced stage for a new district headquarters at Kanturk.</P>
    <P>Improved accommodation is being provided at a number of stations near the border to cater for additional personnel. A scheme of major improvements to Portlaoise Garda station is also expected to commence this year. The programme of improvement of the Dublin suburban stations is also proceeding.  A contract for work at Swords will be placed shortly and it is hoped to commence extension works at Blanchardstown and Finglas stations later this year.</P>
    <P>In regard to court accommodations no further progress has been possible on the provision of improved court accommodation because of site problems. It is hoped that it will be possible to make some progress with planning during the present year.</P>
    <P>The new buildings at Athlone to house some sections of the Department of Education will be completed, it is expected, early in 1977.  Installation of special equipment and the provision of storage and furnishing requirements will take some time after that.  Occupation of the building is expected to take place in the latter half of 1977.</P>
    <P>Schemes for the rewiring of the National Museum buildings and the renewal of defective stonework are being prepared.</P>
    <P>Planning is now in hands for a scheme of adaptation works at Nos. 2/3 Kildare Street, part of the former Kildare Street Club premises, which has been acquired to provide much needed expansion space for the National Library.  Planning is also proceeding for the adaptation of Nos. 1 and 1A Leinster Lane for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>The new offices at Castlebar for the Department of Lands and for local <Col N="766" /> staffs of other Departments are nearing completion and it is planned to occupy the buildings about June of this year.</P>
    <P>Some revisions may be necessary in the plans for the new offices for Roinn na Gaeltachta in Furbo, County Galway, and this matter is under urgent consideration at present.</P>
    <P>We now come to works for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for which a total of £680,000 has been provided.  The items include alterations and additions to buildings at various agricultural centres, improved accommodation at the Botanic Gardens, including a new herbarium, to provide better research facilities for students, and a new office at Raphoe for the district veterinary staff.  The following is some additional information on particular items.</P>
    <P>A design team has been appointed to investigate the alternative layouts of the proposed buildings at the Botanic Gardens.  A preliminary report has been submitted and planning is proceeding.</P>
    <P>Work has commenced on the erection at Abbotstown Farm of new accommodation including laboratories and office space for the scientific and research staff of the Fisheries Division.</P>
    <P>The performance testing station for beef bulls at Tully, County Kildare has been completed and planning is proceeding for the provision of additional facilities including a new office building and equipment store.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the erection at Thorndale of a new building to house the butter and seed testing stations are at present under consideration in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>The pig progeny testing station at Thorndale is completed and in use. Planning of alterations to the old laboratory is at an advanced stage. Work should commence this year.</P>
    <P>Planning is well advanced for the provision of a new office building for the district veterinary staff at Raphoe, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>There is provision to meet outstanding <Col N="767" /> commitments in relation to the fitting-out of the office block in Kildare Place, occupation of which was completed last year.</P>
    <P>An enlargement of the fishery research station at Dunmore East fishery harbour centre is required to cater for the expected expansion of the station's activities.</P>
    <P>A new training school and synoptic reporting station for the meteorological service of the Department of Transport and Power is to be built at Murrough, County Galway while new meteorological stations are proposed for Claremorris, County Mayo and Johnstown Castle, County Wexford.</P>
    <P>A sum of £565,000 is required for works for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  A new post office at Listowel and an extension to Phibsboro post office have been completed while a new post office at Donegal town and an extension to Letterkenny post office are in course of erection.  Planning for new post offices at Clonmel, Longford, Mullingar and Tipperary is well advanced. The modernisation of Ballyhaunis and Cobh post offices is in progress while modernisation schemes are planned for Enniscorthy, Limerick, Roscommon, Thurles and Waterford post offices.  A new sorting office at Baldoyle has been completed while additional sorting office accommodation at Dublin and Cork is planned. A new philatelic sales office in the GPO Arcade has been completed. The installation of a ventilation system in the central sorting office, Sheriff Street, and of a sprinkler system at St. John's Road depot are virtually completed.</P>
    <P>In addition to the schemes covered by this Estimate, the Office of Public Works will carry out works in connection with the telephone services at an estimated cost of over £3 million which will be met from the telephone capital account.</P>
    <P>An amount of £300,000 is provided for works for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This covers the fitting-out of new embassy buildings abroad and improvements to existing buildings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> Fitting out has been completed at the office at the UN mission in New York, the combined chancery and residence at Moscow, including furnishing of staff accommodation, the embassy office at Madrid and the offices of the consulates general at Boston and Chicago.</P>
    <P>Work has also been finished at the chancery building in Vienna and the fitting out of the residence there will be undertaken this year.  Because of the situation in Beirut progress cannot be made on the acquisition of a chancery building there; fitting out of the residence is, however, virtually complete.  Improvements have been completed at Ottawa chancery and at the embassy at Paris.  Other improvements being planned include the residence at Ottawa and the consulate general at New York.</P>
    <P>A sum of £15,000 is provided for works for the Department of Social Welfare.  They comprise the erection of a new employment exchange at Manorhamilton and the fitting out of premises which have been acquired in Dún Laoghaire for the purpose of an employment exchange.  Planning is proceeding in both cases.</P>
    <P>Reference was made last year to the commencement of a programme whereby the State would design and erect its own office buildings.  I am glad to say that work is now in progress on stage 1 of new headquarters for the Garda Síochána on a site adjoining the Depot, Phoenix Park, and on a building at Ballsbridge, part of which will provide badly needed extra space for the veterinary college. A tender has been accepted for the new meteorological office headquarters at Glasnevin and work is expected to start in the near future.  A new office building will shortly be commenced at 13-14 Earlsfort Terrace and tenders for the new geological survey office headquarters will be invited later on this year.  Works are nearing completion on the refurbishing of the former nurses' home at Leeson Street which will be used to rehouse Government staffs now occupying unsatisfactory accommodation.</P>
    <P>Planning on a number of other projects is proceeding, including a new <Col N="769" /> metropolitan Garda headquarters at Ship Street and a new headquarters for the Department of Defence at Parkgate. Reference was also made last year to the proposed reconstruction of Blocks 8-10 at the east side of the entrance to the Upper Yard, at Dublin Castle.  As long ago as 1956, a survey indicated that the rere of the buildings which were partly built on the moat surrounding the castle had developed cracks due to subsidence because of the depth and poor quality of the filled material on which they are built.  The buildings have deteriorated further since then; they are in part dangerous and have now reached the stage where reconstruction has become urgent.  Because of the historical and architectural importance and the archaeological significance of this part of the castle, the best possible advice from inside and outside the Office of Public Works is being obtained to ensure a faithful reconstruction.  Before any reconstruction work is done it is proposed to arrange for an archaeological investigation of the site as was done previously before the reconstruction of the adjoining Cross Block.</P>
    <P>This exemplifies the care which the Office of Public Works take in relation to buildings which might be affected by development schemes and in such matters they will continue their policy of calling upon outside expertise as well as upon the expert knowledge which is available within the office.</P>
    <P>In addition to offices in Dublin and to individual projects already commented upon, this provision covers a programme for the erection of offices in the provinces where the accommodation available is inadequate and, to a large extent, of poor quality.  As an immediate measure, temporary buildings have been provided for the Revenue Commissioners' staffs at Kilkenny, Sligo, Thurles and Waterford and rented accommodation has been fitted out at Dundalk, Galway, Athlone and Limerick.  Planning is proceeding for the erection of permanent new Government offices at other centres including, Cork, Kilkenny, Athlone, Thurles, Sligo, Carrick-on-Shannon and Mallow.</P>
    <P>Subhead F.1, for which an amount of £4,730,000 is sought, provides for <Col N="770" /> the normal maintenance of State-owned property.  This includes such varied items as Government offices, Garda Síochána stations, post offices, agricultural institutions, embassies abroad, State harbours, national parks and the River Shannon navigation. Maintenance work has, of course, a very high employment content and, for this reason, I am pleased that it has been found possible to increase the provision for this subhead by over 21 per cent.  A large part of the maintenance work is done by our own direct labour staff and, in fact, almost 50 per cent of the provision will go on the wages of this staff.  The other 50 per cent of the provision will, of course, help appreciably the employment situation in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Subhead F.2 provides for the supply of replacement furniture and of additional items required for existing State buildings.  Furniture for new buildings is paid for out of subhead E.</P>
    <P>Subhead F.3, which provides for rents, shows an increased rate of expenditure over that of 1975 arising out of the leasing of new premises to accommodate additional staffs, to replace old premises which had become unsuitable and, in some cases, to clear State-owned buildings, the sites of which are to be redeveloped.</P>
    <P>Subhead F.4 bears the cost of fuel and light for Government offices and other State-owned property.  Continuing increases in the cost of all fuels account in large measure for the increase in the provision needed for this subhead.</P>
    <P>Subhead F.5 provides for the cost of compensation and so forth arising from damage to the property of external Governments.  The provision of £30,000 is required to meet outstanding expenditure on the reconstruction of the former British Embassy premises at Merrion Square.  The premises were acquired by the Electricity Supply Board who carried out the reconstruction on behalf of the Office of Public Works.  The work has been completed and the final statement of cost is being prepared.</P>
    <P>Subheads G.1 to G.3 provide for expenditure in connection with the arterial drainage programme which is <Col N="771" /> being carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  Subhead G.4 is for a small residual payment in connection with work done under the River Fergus Act, 1943.</P>
    <P>Subhead G.1 provides for the carrying out of certain hydrometric studies and of comprehensive drainage surveys which are a necessary preliminary to arterial drainage schemes.  For this purpose £79,000 is requested: last year's provision was £55,000.  As in the case of previous years, most of the provision of £79,000 is needed to continue hydrometric investigations: the amount included for catchment surveys is £9,000.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be interested in developments regarding cost/benefit of drainage schemes.  Studies have now been completed, on the Maigue scheme and on the Corrib/Mask/ Robe scheme.  It is hoped to continue with two further studies this year on proposals for the Bonet and Boyle catchments respectively.  The report on the Maigue study, the prototype in the field, has been edited and will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>Subhead G.2 provides for expenditure on drainage works in progress. £2,321,000 is being requested this year, an increase of £367,000 over last year's provision.  Operations on the Boyne and Maigue schemes are being continued and it is hoped that the Corrib/Mask/Robe scheme can be commenced about the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Subhead G.3 provides for the maintenance of completed schemes and embankment works.  £1,029,000 is being requested for 1976, an increase of £135,000 over last year's provision. The cost of the work is recoverable from the county councils and is brought to credit as an appropriation-in-aid.</P>
    <P>A total of £850,000 is sought for subhead H for the purchase and maintenance of engineering plant and machinery, mainly for arterial drainage work, the purchase of stores and the payment of wages to the central engineering workshop staff.</P>
    <P>Subhead I bears the cost of the construction and maintenance of <Col N="772" /> coast protection schemes.  The maintenance costs are repaid by the county councils involved, and the repayments are taken in as appropriations-in-aid. Six schemes are at present being maintained.  The subhead provides for an outlay of £30,500 on this service. The balance of the provision, £34,500, is required for prospective outlay on a new scheme at Enniscrone, County Sligo.</P>
    <P>The amount of £710,000 which I am requesting for the national monuments service under subhead J.1 is required to maintain the present level of conservation activity and of archaeological research as well as to allow of some desirable improvements.  It seems important on the one hand to maintain the impetus given by European Architectural Heritage Year, 1975, to architectural conservation by enabling the national monuments service to set a good standard of maintenance and presentation for the monuments in its charge, and on the other hand, to do a little more to protect and investigate the great volume of information on Ireland's cultural past which lies buried in the soil in the earthworks and other field monuments which in increasing numbers are falling victims to the bulldozer.</P>
    <P>I am happy to be able to say, however, that thanks to the co-operation of the land project, forestry and Land Commission personnel, many field monuments are now being preserved from destruction.  In general, the farming community is willing to cooperate in the preservation of monuments once their significance is explained.</P>
    <P>During the past year, major repairs have been commenced at Ross Castle, Killarney, which had become dangerous and was closed to visitors before being placed in State care by Mr. J. McShain, the former owner. Works of conservation are continuing at, <i>inter alia</i>, the Casino in Marino, Dublin, Portumna Castle, County Galway, Kilcooley Abbey, County Tipperary, Lusk Tower, County Dublin, Kells Priory, County Kilkenny, Charles Fort and James Fort near Kinsale, County Cork, at the Boyne Valley sites of Newgrange and <Col N="773" /> Knowth, at St. MacDara's Island Church, County Galway, and at the Early Christian Monastery on Inishmurray Island, County Sligo.</P>
    <P>Grants for archaeological research are to be made again this year on the recommendation of the Royal Irish Academy.  This will enable the investigation of the major site at Knowth to continue as well as the archaeological excavation of the site of the Church of the Holy Trinity at Cork. This latter is an urban excavation and is, therefore, of importance at a time when several of our cities are about to witness the redevelopment of their most historic areas.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed to me regarding unauthorised interference with historic wrecks, for example, wrecks of the Spanish Armada, in Irish territorial waters.  I have arranged for urgent consideration to be given to the question of what protection the Commissioners could afford to the wrecks under the National Monuments Acts and I assure the House that any action permitted by the Acts will be taken to protect them.</P>
    <P>I would like to see information plaques erected at all major monuments in order to heighten the interest and education value for the visitor. The coming year should see this objective achieved.</P>
    <P>The conservation and restoration of Holycross Abbey, the cost of which is borne initially by the grant-in-aid provided by a special subhead&mdash;subhead J.2&mdash;was virtually completed by last autumn when the building was reopened for public use after three hundred years' closure.  Minor completion works are still in hands but it is expected that all will be finished this year.  The cost of the restoration is being refunded by the diocesan authorities. Holycross Abbey restoration was one of this country's two national projects for European Architectural Heritage Year and is attracting worldwide interest.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned some of the most important of the activities covered by the Vote for Public Works and Buildings. It should be borne in mind that, in addition to these, the Office of <Col N="774" /> Public Works are responsible for other construction work, the cost of which is met from other sources, for example, primary schools, telephone exchanges, prison buildings and harbour works for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and for Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Expenditure on these works this year is expected to be of the order of £18 million.  It will be seen, therefore, that the Office of Public Works are making a major contribution to the development of employment and of the economy generally&mdash;a fact which will, I am sure, be reflected in the Deputies' comments.  I will be happy to deal, in my reply, with any points raised by them.</P>
    <P>I will be looking forward in particular to hearing the views of Deputy Seán Moore, the Opposition spokesman for the Office of Public Works, and I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating Deputy Moore on his promotion.</P>
    <P>I could not let this occasion pass without saying a word or two about my predecessor, the late Deputy Henry Kenny.  His kindliness, sincerity and unfailing courtesy were well-known to everyone in public life not only here but throughout the country and at the time of his untimely death tributes were generously paid by both sides of this House.  Since I succeeded him as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, I have been impressed also by the efficient and conscientious manner in which he discharged his public duties and by the high regard in which he was held by everyone.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always felt that this was one of the most interesting Estimates to come before the House. Since I was appointed Fianna Fáil spokesman for the Office of Public Works I have taken an even greater interest in it.  First, I welcome the Parliamentary Secretary to his post.  I cannot wish him an extended tenure of office, but personally I wish him all the best and thank him for the many courtesies I received since we were both appointed to our august <Col N="775" /> offices.  I hope the same co-operation will continue in the future.</P>
      <P>Because I have started off by complimenting the Parliamentary Secretary, that does not mean that I do not intend criticising the Estimate because, like the curate's egg, it is good in parts.  There are serious omissions in regard to work which should be done.</P>
      <P>I will start with Leinster House and a problem which has existed for quite a long time&mdash;heating.  I do not hold the Parliamentary Secretary to blame for this but I hope we will soon have proper heating in the House.  I do not mind the cold but I realise that certain members of the staff cannot have the same mobility as Deputies and must sit in the cold offices.  I would also like to refer to the excellent state in which the House is kept.  I compliment the staff, from the ladies on the cleaning staff right up to the superintendent. Accommodation for Deputies is still not all it should be and some steps could be taken to improve it.  These are only small items in a very large Estimate.</P>
      <P>I note that when introducing Estimates, Ministers are anxious to emphasise the increase being allocated this year compared with last year.  In this instance the increase of approximately 38 per cent may seem impressive but one does not have to be an economist to realise that a lesser increase would mean a minus amount on last year in real money terms, having regard to the rate of inflation and the possibility that this rate may be greater by the end of the year and also that prices will probably have increased by then.  In effect, this would mean that much of the good work that has been planned would have to go by the board.  Therefore, the Parliamentary Secretary must press for a greater increase than 38 per cent. While appreciating the present economic difficulties, one must bear in mind that it may be false economy to cut back in the areas of certain important works which may cost only what is proportionately a small amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> About two years ago Deputy Lynch advocated the provision of an official residence for the Taoiseach and I am now raising the point again.  In putting forward this suggestion we are not thinking in terms of a status symbol. Democracies older than ours and better versed in the study of politics have an official residence for prime ministers.  The Government here might take a leaf from the book of Dublin City Council who provide a splendid city residence for the Lord Mayor.</P>
    <P>It would be my hope that the Office of Public Works would become a kind of programmer or catalyst in the field of the development and improvement of the whole economy.  When visiting various parts of the country one is impressed by the work being undertaken by this department but one realises, too, the additional work which could be engaged in.  The Minister may say that money for additional works is not available but when we realise the vast amounts of money being paid in social welfare to the 116,000 unemployed, we must ask ourselves why some of this money is not transferred to enable it to be used in the provision of gainful employment on the programmes of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Last week this point was made by Dr. Hillery when he talked of putting people to work.  It is time that we freed ourselves from the type of doctrinaire thinking that is so much in evidence today and that we used the Office of Public Works as a programmer in the development of the economy.  This is a policy that is being pursued by many democratic governments. I am convinced that any such move on our part would have the backing of the trade unions as well as of every person interested in the betterment of our country.  I trust that the Parliamentary Secretary will give this suggestion some consideration and endeavour to have co-operation with the Departments of Labour and Industry and Commerce in an endeavour to bring about a new programme in the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the amount being allocated in the Estimate for <Col N="777" /> coast erosion works.  Earlier I had referred to the Book of Estimates in the hope of finding accounts of large sums of money being provided for this purpose but I found that the amount was only £65,000.  This is confirmed by the Parliamentary Secretary this morning.  Some time ago the Office of Public Works supplied me with a list of the various schemes before them for the prevention of coast erosion.  Apart from the operations carried out at Youghal and the one promised for Enniscrone, the picture is very bleak.  Not far from us&mdash;in North County Dublin&mdash;there is a crying need for coast protection works and this is the position in many other areas around the coast.  In many instances there are programmes which have been lying in the Office of Public Works for many years but it is fair to assume that in all of those areas there are many people unemployed and who could be put to work on schemes of this nature either in a skilled or an unskilled capacity. Despite what may be said from time to time it is my contention that most people wish to be employed and we should ensure that they have the opportunity of working.  While the sea continues to wash away more of our island we drag our heels in taking steps to protect our coasts from erosion.  I urge that this work be given the highest priority in the programme for next year.</P>
    <P>This is a comprehensive Estimate and one on which one could spend many hours if the rules of the House permitted.  Therefore, I do not think I can do it full justice in the time allocated to me.  When dealing with the provision of office blocks and various buildings, whether multistorey office block or just a local inquiry office, the Parliamentary Secretary should ensure that the entrances are so constructed that handicapped people can get easy access to them. Very often when handicapped people and those confined to wheelchairs come to Leinster House they have to be carried up the steps.  The only redeeming feature is how willing each person, whether he is a member of the staff, somebody serving the House or a Deputy, is to help.  At the same <Col N="778" /> time, it is important to ensure that all office blocks have access for people who are handicapped or confined to wheelchairs.  In the case of old office blocks we should spend some money on making provision for handicapped people.  It may be only a small point in the total Estimate but it is a matter we should attend to.</P>
    <P>There is provision under subheads A1, A2, B and C of £5,000 which is required mainly to meet the balance of the cost of the Shannon recreation study which was commissioned jointly by the Office of Public Works and Bord Fáilte.  We welcome this.  I look forward with anxiety to the consultant's report.  I am sure it will be a good one, but I hope it will not be left aside after it is received as happens with so much Government work and the Establishment generally. We look for reports and then put them into pigeon holes.</P>
    <P>There is provision under subhead D to cover the purchase of sites and premises for various Government services, including the acquisition of the fee simple of some existing leasehold properties.  The Government should acquire, wherever possible, the fee simple and the ground rents of such properties.  It is very wrong that the ground of government property should be held in some cases by people who do not even live in the country.</P>
    <P>In relation to national parks and monuments, the Parliamentary Secretary stated:</P>
    <P>Good progress was maintained in this field over the past 12 months and I am glad to report the successful conclusion of negotiations for the acquisition of two substantial areas in County Galway which will form the nucleus of a proposed Connemara National Park.</P>
    <P>I welcome this.  It gives one great heart to see that 2,500 acres in the Kylemore/Letterfrack area will be preserved and in that national park I feel confident that the Parliamentary Secretary will ensure that development there is carried out so that it will be evocative of the national feeling. This is a very historical area and <Col N="779" /> we should ensure that we do not create in Connemara National Park some kind of an Anglo-influenced institution but that this park will preserve everything that is good in that part of the country.  I include in this the language.</P>
    <P>I hope we will not see garish notice boards in English, dreadful advertisements for beer or something else near the park.  We should ensure that the Connemara National Park is one of the finest monuments in the country and that we will be able to tell visitors and natives to go to see what the nation have done to preserve that most historic part of the country.  I also hope it will be a means of bringing prosperity to that area.  I detest the cliché about saving the west but I believe that this is a practical way where we can do something about saving the west which will repay us in every way.</P>
    <P>I notice that it is hoped to complete the installation of emergency lighting for Leinster House in the near future.  This is to be welcomed. I also welcome the provision of much needed additional accommodation for the staff.  A total of £2,431,000 is being provided for items falling under the heading of the Department of Finance.  This covers the various Departments which have to deal with the development of national parks and harbour improvements.  One must deplore the small amount laid aside for harbour improvement works. When one goes on holidays to various parts of the country it is very depressing to see the light standard which has no light, the lack of a coat of paint which is causing decay and the lack of seats which visitors would appreciate.  The Board of Works should ensure that those small harbours are a safe anchorage for ships. When we realise that the harbours of our main ports are growing too big we could well carry out a revolution by improving facilities in the smaller harbours.  I know this is something not peculiar to Ireland.  When one travels along the coast of Cumberland in England one sees the places which have silted up because of the change <Col N="780" /> in the coal trade.  I mention that point to show that vigilance is always necessary if we are to ensure that our harbours, small and large, are well kept.</P>
    <P>The provision of a concert hall at Earisfort Terrace is a chestnut if ever there was one.  The Parliamentary Secretary tells us:</P>
    <P>It is hoped that it will be possible to complete the planning stage by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>This is only the planning stage.  After all our great promises over the years to provide a truly national concert hall we now hope to have the planning finished at the end of the year. After that what will happen?  Will UCD have vacated the premises by then and gone out to Belfield?  Do the college authorities intend to leave Earlsfort Terrace?  We do not want to have a confrontation with them.</P>
    <P>I realise the college has its own accommodation problems despite the magnificent buildings at Belfield.  Perhaps there is a touch of nostalgia on the part of the college authorities for Earlsfort Terrace.  There certainly is history attached to it.  I can only deplore the fact that, having sacrificed the great ideal of providing a big concert hall in memory of a great American President, we have not even kept faith by providing a smaller concert hall.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to do everything possible to speed up this work.  Many people have worked over the years towards the provision of a concert hall.  It is terrible that in our capital city we have not got such a hall.  I am disappointed to see we will only have finished the planning stage at the end of the year. After that we will reach the building stage when the students and professors have all gone to Belfield.  We do not know when that will be.  The outlook for the new concert hall is not at all bright.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the restoration of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, is proceeding apace and it is hoped that tenders for building work can be invited early next year.  This ancient hospital is an historic place.  We must guard very jealously every brick in the walls.  This is history.  Some years ago <Col N="781" /> Dublin Corporation sought to acquire it as municipal buildings.  That did not happen and they have their own buildings now.  I am very glad we are not neglecting the Royal Hospital.  I hope that as soon as possible it can be thrown open to the public so that people can see one of the most historic buildings in the city.  It is a beautiful building.  I do not know what use it will be put to eventually. We certainly will find good use for it.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision made for the development works at Scoil Éanna in Rathfarnham.  I want to pay tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor.  I should like to pay special tribute to Deputy Lemass.  When he was Parliamentary Secretary he gave great attention to the development at Scoil Éanna.  He was very keen to see that work completed.  I am glad to see there is provision in the Estimate for carrying on this work.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to see provision for the new water supply and sewage disposal systems at Muckross House, Killarney.  As the Parliamentary Secretary probably knows, there is local demand for an extension of the nearby cemetery.  I am not quite sure whether this is appropriate to the Office of Public Works.  It may come under the Department of Health.  I am told by some local people that they are seeking an extension to the cemetery.  I am also told the people there are very conscious of the improvements to the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park.  They would like to see much more attention given to work such as cutting the undergrowth and so on.  This is only a small item but they feel it should be done.</P>
    <P>It is a disappointment to the people of Kilkenny that the picture gallery wing of Kilkenny Castle is not open to the public.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will see to it that this work is done as soon as possible.  The people of Kilkenny have engendered a wonderful local spirit.  They are constantly seeking to improve the city of Kilkenny. Whether in municipal or historical development, Kilkenny always seems to do things very well.</P>
    <P>Phoenix Park is one of the greatest gems in the whole national scene.  Very often in the spring and summer I go to <Col N="782" /> the park.  I should like to sound a note of warning.  We will have to pay more attention to the preservation of the park.  Car parking is one of the biggest problems.  People are inclined to run their cars in on the grass.  This is understandable. The roads are not all that wide and there is the danger of cars being damaged.  One feels the urge to get off the road and on to the grass. That is not the way to treat a park.  The attendants have an almost impossible task.  Perhaps car parks could be provided on a bigger scale.</P>
    <P>We want to maintain the essential wildness of the park and not to make it into a nice little park with trimmed hedges.  That is all right in the People's Gardens.  Apart from that, it should be as wild as possible.  It is wonderful for a city person to go to the park and walk for miles, away from the city and yet within the city.  We must spend a lot more money and do a lot more thinking on the preservation of this wonderful park.</P>
    <P>The question of horse riding in the park has been raised in the House several times.  This is a problem.  In most cities there is a place where people who indulge in this type of pastime can exercise their animals and enjoy themselves.  Perhaps part of the park could be reserved for that pastime. Phoenix Park is unique in Europe. People can walk around and see wild life and move on a little further and see sophisticated pastimes such as polo, cricket or hurling, all in the one space. Surely this is a great asset to the city and the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the allocation of £8,000 for the provision of car parks at Glenveagh National Park.  While this park may not rank in size with the Phoenix Park, I am glad to see that, in consultation with Bord Fáilte and Donegal County Council, improvements are being made there.  I assure the Parliamentary Secretary that Dublin City Council will give him every possible help in making Phoenix Park a better park if that is possible.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Estimate for the country's inland waterways. I am not convinced we are doing enough with regard to the preservation of our waterways or their improvement. <Col N="783" /> I have been pressing for some time for the Office of Public Works to take both the Royal and Grand Canals under their wing.  I thought, perhaps mistakenly, that had been promised some years ago.  Were the Royal Canal or Grand Canal under the wing of Dublin Corporation it would have a better chance of preservation within the city boundary. In the case of the Grand Canal there is necessity for its continuation, preservation and improvement right down to the Shannon.  The Office of Public Works have done such good work in the past one is confident that they could do considerable work on the Grand Canal.  That canal is in a better state of preservation than is the Royal Canal, at least in city areas.  I am sure also that CIE who have sufficient problems on their plate and do not possess the necessary machinery or organisation for that purpose would be very pleased to hand the Grand Canal over to the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>If we are to make our waterways more attractive, not alone for the natives but for tourists also, their development would constitute one of our biggest tourist attractions.  On the Continent the Rhine looks very attractive if one does not examine it too closely but, if one does, one can observe considerable pollution.  Europeans, in any of the countries through which the Rhine flows, still utilise that river because there are tremendous pressures on them to do so.  In some parts, however, it has lost all its beauty.  Therefore, we must be careful not to let the same thing happen our waterways.  While it is not a job solely for the Office of Public Works that office have the responsibility of ensuring that anything they can do to preserve our waterways will be undertaken.  Money utilised for that purpose certainly will not be grudged.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to note that the Ballinamore/Ballyconnell Canal is to be improved somewhat.  It may not be known generally that, with the waters adjacent to that canal, there could be a continuous canal almost <Col N="784" /> to Belfast.  When we speak about building bridges with the North perhaps the development of our canals would be a well received gesture. We might well obtain money for such a worthy project from the EEC Regional Fund, in the form of a grant towards the development of our waterways on both sides of the Border.  Such would appeal to the heart of any man whether he lived in the Falls Road in Belfast or the Grand Parade in Cork.  It would illustrate also that we do not want to become insular on either side of the Border, rather that we could come together in improving our waterways, in a gesture towards the peace we would all like to see in our country.</P>
    <P>The national heritage projects are also to be welcomed, particularly that to be set up jointly by Bord Fáilte and the Office of Public Works at Cahir Castle, County Tipperary.  That is the type of local development we all welcome.  We should make sure to involve local people in such projects so that they might look upon such buildings as part of their local heritage. That would also ensure the success of any such undertaking.  We must not initiate our programmes simply by saying&mdash;the State will do this work, full stop.  After the initiation of any such project on the local scene there should be a person designated in the Office of Public Works whose job it would be to try to generate enthusiasm amongst the various local organisations.</P>
    <P>I note that there is provision for new harbour works.  There is specific mention of the improvement of the landing facilities at Clare Island, County Mayo, which, it is said, suffered protracted delay due to a contractual dispute.  I hope that dispute has been terminated because, while it may continue for quite a long time, the seas will not be so patient and will continue to batter our harbours, particularly those on the west coast, rendering them useless.  As there is some urgency in this respect I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will have such work expedited as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> I am glad to notice that the Mail Boat Pier at Dún Laoghaire Harbour is to be improved further.  It is a beautiful harbour and the Office of Public Works have spent vast sums of money on its improvement over the years.  Irish people and tourists alike using that port are very conscious of the good works carried out there over the years.  However, I feel that Dún Laoghaire Harbour has an unfinished look.  Perhaps the Office of Public Works, in conjunction with Dún Laoghaire Borough Council, might consider the provision of swimming facilities there.  While it is pleasant to look across Dublin Bay or take a trip by boat, the swimming facilities are not adequate unless one goes to Sandycove, which is generally reserved for men.</P>
    <P>The provisions under the heading of the Department of Justice bring to mind the many bitter remarks one hears about the provision of proper facilities in courthouses.  No matter how good our society may be unfortunately there will exist the need for such courthouses.  I am sure the staff of these courthouses, including the justices, would appreciate a more active programme for their reconstruction than exists at present.  The same applies to the provision of Garda stations.  I do realise that progress is being made in this field, that the Garda stations are being improved. In the future Garda stations should be regarded, not merely as places where people go when in some kind of trouble with the police, but they should be so designed as to become the focal point on the local scene and the Garda personnel there should be regarded as helping the public. It is impossible to have any kind of privacy in these stations at present when one has to recount one's troubles.  There may be a queue behind one&mdash;perhaps for parking offences, loss of animals or some such happenings&mdash;but, in any event, one is not afforded any privacy in such circumstances. I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, to proceed with the provision of far better quarters for the Garda Síochána.  In <Col N="786" /> the present troubled state of the nation they need all the help they can get.  In the Estimate there is mention of several areas where there will be new stations.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary about a new station at Irishtown where it is badly needed.  I once read in Wolfe Tone's diary that he spent a holiday in Irishtown. He said he spent that time in what he called &ldquo;a box of a house&rdquo; and I have always thought that it might have been the Garda station.</P>
    <P>The schemes for the rewiring of the National Museum building are to be welcomed.  I have often wondered if the fire precautions in the National Museum and the National Gallery are the best.  One shudders to think what would happen if there was a fire in any of those places.  An office block can easily be rebuilt but if a fire occurs in a museum or art gallery the loss is enormous.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the new offices at Castlebar are nearing completion. Some of us had to spend some time in Castlebar last year and it was quite rewarding to walk through the town and see a place that had plenty of life in it.  I hope that the civil servants who go to Castlebar will be very happy there.  It appeared to be a nice place in which to live and I am sure there will be no shortage of applications from civil servants to go there.  With regard to plans for Roinn na Gaeltachta in Furbo, County Galway, I understand that premises are being acquired and this is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate there is mention of improvements at the Botanic Gardens, Dublin, and this is to be welcomed also.  All these schemes are an indication of the varied activities of the Office of Public Works.  They are involved in improvement works from Raphoe to the south of the country and, consequently, we can only deplore the small amount of money given for this valuable work.  There is also reference to a new training school and a synoptic reporting station for the Meteorological Service and these appear to be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate there is a sum of <Col N="787" /> £565,000 for works for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and here we must take the Parliamentary Secretary to task.  The phone service is hopeless and it is heartbreaking to try to get a call from this House in the afternoon.  I am quite convinced that the faulty telephone service in this House will give many Members of both Houses a touch of heart trouble.  The frustration of trying to get a local number is frightful. I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary for the state of the telephone service but I would ask him to get in touch with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in the hope that he will do something to improve the service rather than speaking on wider social aspects.</P>
    <P>A sum of £300,000 is provided for works for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This covers the fitting out of new embassy buildings and improvements to existing buildings.  We were told that work has been completed at the office of the UN Mission in New York and at the combined chancery and residence in Moscow, including furnishing of staff accommodation. Part of the Estimate includes the purchase of furniture for the embassies and for offices at home.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary is ensuring that all the furniture is Irish made.  Whether it is in New York, Moscow or Beirut. the fact that Irish furniture is used will be a good advertisement for the excellence of the products of our craftsmen.  We should not lose any opportunity to display it.</P>
    <P>The Estimate also provides for better sorting offices for the Post Office.  In my area of Dublin SouthEast, in Ballsbridge, the office building is almost completed and the sorting staff will be transferred there from the Edwardian building in Shelbourne Road.</P>
    <P>Work on the preservation of Dublin Castle is to be welcomed.  I am glad to see that there will be an archaeological survey of the site before there is any further development. I want to record my appreciation of the care taken by the Office <Col N="788" /> of Public Works during the years in the preservation of ancient historic buildings.</P>
    <P>With regard to the arterial drainage policy, I am a Deputy from an urban area but it appears to me that there are vast tracts of land that are marshy or are under water.  We have a problem with regard to land and I have often wondered how we can afford to leave so much land in that state.  The Parliamentary Secretary should look for more money so that drainage work may be increased. This would bring more land into production, land that could be allocated to people in rural areas who seek additional land.  We could be doing far more with regard to this matter.  We could help to keep more people on the land.  It would show them that we are concerned about the few natural assets we have and that we are not going to let our most priceless asset, our land, lie unused much longer.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Estimate for the continuing of hydrometic investigations at a cost of £79,000.  In this regard I suggest that the Office of Public Works, and the Department of Defence, investigate the possibility of carrying out our own hydrometic surveys. It may not be realised that since the foundation of the State we have not chartered any of our seas.  We rely on the British Admiralty to do this work for us.  Our maritime fleet has been built up in recent years and our naval resources are being increased annually and for those reasons my suggestion should be given serious consideration. One of the new naval vessels should be fitted for the purpose of carrying out surveys to prepare the necessary charts. I am aware that the work is very costly and I appreciate why it was not done in the past but I hope in the near future we will see a token Estimate for the carrying out of these surveys. If a small survey was undertaken for a start it would be good experience for our naval personnel.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary dealt with the cost of the construction and maintenance of coast protection schemes.  In this regard I should like <Col N="789" /> to state that £65,000 is a mere pittance to carry out this work.  During the coming year I will impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary the necessity for providing more money for this valuable work.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told us that he is concerned about the unauthorised interference with historic wrecks, for example, wrecks of the Spanish Armada, in Irish territorial waters.  People from abroad, from our neighbouring island in particular, adopt a kind of buccaneer attitude to this. They plunder all the wrecks around our coast and take away whatever they find.  While I am sure they are prepared to hand over their finds to the British Museum it should be remembered that these wrecks are situated in Irish territorial waters and are part of our history.  We will have to adopt stern measures against these people.  I do not know if they need permission to search for the wrecks&mdash;I doubt if they look for it&mdash;but we will have to make it known that we are going to take steps to ensure that these wrecks are protected.  If I do not see any evidence during the coming year of the concern of the Office of Public Works I will continue to highlight the matter until the Parliamentary Secretary brings forward a proper policy.  In fairness to the Parliamentary Secretary I should like to state that I am aware of his concern in this regard.  I hope he will regard my concern as being an effort to help him.  We want to see foreigners enjoying our facilities but we do not want the type who indulge in this type of piracy on these craft which have remained in our territorial waters for up to 400 years.  We want those craft taken ashore and restored in a civilised way.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has also told us that he would like to see information plaques erected on all our major monuments in order to heighten the interest and education value for the visitor.  I agree with him in this regard.  India give a good example in relation to monuments. When this State was founded many people wanted to tear down every monument which commemorated anything connected with the old regime. <Col N="790" /> It was a pity that so many of those monuments were taken down.  Even though we may not have agreed with what those monuments stood for some of them were wonderful pieces of sculpture.  We should erect a plaque on all the monuments that remain pointing out that while we do not agree with what the monuments stand for we are preserving them because we consider them to be fine pieces of sculpture. That would be a more civilised way of dealing with monuments.  It is very easy to knock down monuments but very hard to rebuild them.  There should be an information plaque on every monument, irrespective of what it commemorates.  We would then be able to understand history better and if we understand history we will understand each other better.  If the Parliamentary Secretary requires money to do this he will be supported by this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Office of Public Works have carried out restoration work on ancient buildings.  If one travels on the Continent one can see how ancient cathedrals are being cared for by the State.  I welcome the present trend that when ancient buildings are being restored everybody supports the work.  This Estimate brings home to us the amount of work done by the Office of Public Works.  I agree with all the work being done on schools, telephone exchanges, prison buildings and harbours but I believe it was carried out in a better manner when we were in power.  I welcome most of the Estimate but I find fault with the fact that some of the things we are anxious to see done will not be done because of lack of money.  We will support granting of money for all necessary works.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have been fortunate for many years in the person chosen as the Parliamentary Secretary in charge.  I include the present holder of the office, and his predecessor. He was also very helpful indeed when one sought information.</P>
    <P>Now I do not want to be taken as approving of every item and line in this Estimate.  The Estimate provides food for thought.  We find out what has been done and we also find out <Col N="791" /> what still remains to be done.  It is not just a financial statement illustrating progress made.  The Office of Public Works have an important role. They are not just the dispensers of grants and repairers of old buildings. To a certain extent they are unique. I believe they should take precedence over Departments of State.  To a certain extent also they are a link between the past and the present.  They are involved in the lives of the people. They are the guardians of our historic heritage.  If they did not exist we would have to create them.  They are one of the oldest institutions we have, going back over 100 years.  Yet they are up to date and that is a tribute to the personnel and to the fact that people welcome the activities of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I believe their scope should be far wider and they should be upgraded and given more power.  Their role should be examined in a European context.  I am thinking now of the rebuilding of Warsaw by the Poles after the last war and the preservation of Williamsburg in the United States. Having seen these one realises the great potential there is in the Office of Public Works.  I know it is said money is scarce but I hope that in the future more money will be made available to the Office of Public Works to enable them to widen their scope.  We should endeavour to make them a real catalyst between the past and the present.</P>
    <P>As well as building barracks, schools and so on, the Office of Public Works are also engaged in arterial drainage, a most important and vital task from the point of view of the economy.  We are developing our mineral resources and one hopes that development will not result in despoliation of our countryside.  We do not want the slag heaps that disfigure so many parts of England and Wales. The Office of Public Works can play an important part here by being vigilant and jealous for the preservation of our natural scenery.  We escaped the horrors of the industrial revolution and we must ensure now that we do not allow anything to destroy our countryside.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> Far from the role of the Office of Public Works diminishing in any way I believe it will increase.  What we would like to see is planning at Government level to ensure the Office of Public Works will be given enough money and scope to play their proper part in helping to boost morale and reinvigorate the economy.  I rather envy the Parliamentary Secretary because he is in a position to do many things for the good of the country. Many items in his Estimate have been tackled in some way but, even he must admit, not 100 per cent satisfactorily because he is inhibited by lack of money.  He has very competent staffs around him who I am sure would like to break out of the straitjacket or the doctrinaire way of thinking which has somewhat relegated the Office of Public Works, in the minds of many, to playing a minor role.  They have done tremendous work and have great potential for the future.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should consider getting in touch with Departments like the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Department of Labour in an effort to work out a policy for providing employment, particularly in the rural areas, as a means of improving these areas, so that we will not see a river which is not properly drained or one which is no more than a refuse receptacle, and so that local authorities will be encouraged to do their own work.  The Office of Public Works have a very important part to play here because they can breach local boundaries whereas a local authority must keep within their own boundaries.</P>
    <P>When King John many years ago started to divide up the land into counties, it was done with the knowledge available at the time.  We have 800 years of hindsight and can do better things now.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary not to be just an administrator but to be a Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and he has done some good work&mdash;who will expand on what has already been done and who will not take no for an answer from the Government when he asks for more money for all the important works <Col N="793" /> contained in his Estimate.  I hope he will turn down and scorn the allocation of £65,000 made for coast erosion work.  If I am reading that correctly, it is a joke.  It should be remembered that some of the schemes submitted to the office have lain there for many years and much of this island has been washed away by the sea on all our coasts.  That is one place the Parliamentary Secretary could start off.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered adequately the matters contained in the Estimate and that the Parliamentary Secretary will benefit from what I have said. There is such a colossal amount of work to be done that he has great scope for making improvements in the coming year.  I can assure him that if there is a change of Government at any time we will try to carry on the best traditions of the Office of Public Works.  There is one point about archaeological surveys in the city, which is a very ancient city, that any time local authorities wanted help from the Office of Public Works in regard to archaeology that help was always forthcoming.  That is just an inking of what the Office of Public Works could be in the enlarged scheme of things I would visualise for them.  Despite the recommendation of a certain gentleman, I think the Office of Public Works will soon realise their full potential, and no matter what political changes take place the future of our ancient heritage is in safe keeping in the hands of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Again I want to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his many courtesies since he took office.  This does not mean that we are not going to criticise him on many occasions but, whether it is on this side of the House or on the far side of the House we speak, we realise that both sides have a great responsibility to the people who sent us here.  We all have a duty to ensure that we play our part in trying to make the country a better place to live in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the other speakers in paying tribute to the late Henry Kenny who did such fine work and who was a very sincere <Col N="794" /> and approachable man.  I would also congratulate both the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Begley, and the Fianna Fáil spokesman on the Office of Public Works, Deputy Moore, on their recent promotions.</P>
      <P>In dealing with this Estimate, we must take very important items into consideration.  This office deal with physical features and, as has already been pointed out, with our historical heritage.  They also play a big part in promoting recreational facilities.  The most important area with which they deal in my constituency&mdash;and I am sure this is true for many rural Deputies&mdash;is arterial drainage.</P>
      <P>First, let me say that some people say the Office of Public Works are merely agents for the Departments. This is very unfair.  They certainly perform this function, and the quality of the buildings they erect is usually of a very high standard, but their function is more than that.  I have been particularly happy that many practical buildings are being built.  There is not much sign of over-extravagance or generosity in them.  Over-extravagance is something that should be avoided at all costs.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed that more reference was not made to national monuments.  I am concerned about them because I am a member of the national monuments advisory committee in our county council.  Every monument which is marked on a map or otherwise should be a national monument.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us how many national monuments there are in State care.  I have heard the figures of 400, 500 and 800 mentioned but there are probably thousands of monuments in this country.  I understand that in Scotland every monument marked on an ordnance survey map or other record is considered a national monument. To make my recommendation practical, a proper survey would have to be taken of all monuments in Ireland.  This is being done at the moment but with a minimum of staff. It is a pity that more surveys are not carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some excellent surveys have been done throughout the country.  Two full <Col N="795" /> county surveys have been carried out, one by a student doing a thesis for a master's degree and the other by a professionally appointed archaeologist. Roscommon County Council led the way by appointing an archaeologist.  He was the first, and I believe the only, archaeologist to be appointed in the Thirty-two Counties.  His appointment was to last for one year only but it was so successful that it continued for two years.  During that time all known monuments were visited and surveyed and others discovered during that time were also surveyed.  Monuments which had disappeared were listed.  By doing this, the archaeologist indirectly saved the county council a considerable sum of money.  The Roscommon people are to be congratulated on what they did.</P>
    <P>On at least two occasions the appointment of an archaeologist was raised at Galway County Council.  My colleague, Councillor James Joyce, raised this matter and was given a reply which was recorded in the minutes of the meeting as follows:</P>
    <P>The county manager informed Councillor Joyce that the work which would be carried out by a county archaeologist, as suggested by the councillor, was work which was, in fact, carried out by the Office of Public Works.  While the preservation of archaeological heritage should be of deep concern the appointment of a county archaeologist was not an urgent need.  A survey of archaeological and other conservation items for the county was completed some time ago by An Foras Forbartha and this will be incorporated in the review of the county plan.</P>
    <P>An Foras Forbartha emphasise that their lists were only to be used as guides, and would show the type of monuments that should be preserved and what should be looked for.  Every county should appoint a county archaeologist. If this is not done quickly we will soon find that there will be a severe shortage of archaeologists for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary contact county councils and the departments of archaeology in the <Col N="796" /> various colleges.  I know one person in Galway who could be employed to study the monuments in County Galway. If there is much more delay, many of our graduate archaeologists will emigrate or will be absorbed in other employment.  There is other work they could do.  I am only referring to this one aspect of their work. They could survey existing field monuments and list those known to have existed.  They could vet all planning permissions and road alterations. They could carry out minor rescue investigations.  They could lecture local schools, youth clubs, parish groups and so on and bring visiting groups around the various ancient sites in the county.  They could also prepare guidebooks and pamphlets on the more important and interesting archaeological sites in the county. This work could be done in co-operation with the National Museum, the national monuments branch of the Office of Public Works, the Ordnance Survey Office, Bord Fáilte and many other bodies.  The cost involved would be an indirect saving to the Office of Public Works, if they negotiated with the various local authorities.  The overall cost of such a project would, I presume, be between £3,000 and £4,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>We all hope the Office of Public Works will do what they say they will, especially where monuments are concerned. They have been talking about roofing the 13th-century castle at Athenry.  They have made detailed plans for roofing this castle and using it as a place to store loose carvings, pieces of stone and sculpture lying around the west.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will let us know when it is intended to carry out this roofing.</P>
    <P>Mention was also made of the schools being built by the Office of Public Works as agents for the Department of Education.  It is very important that this building programme should continue if we are to tackle the very high pupil/teacher ratio problem that exists at the moment.  We must proceed with the school building programme. I am anxious that the use of prefabs be phased out but within the last two school years in our county for <Col N="797" /> which we have figures there was an increase in the number of these buildings used as additional classrooms in national schools.  However, I understand that it is the policy of the Department to phase out the use of these structures.  Primarily this is a matter for the Department of Education but I am taking the opportunity of referring to it here because of the importance of providing proper accommodation both from the point of view of children and teachers.</P>
    <P>There is the question, too, of the provision of schools for children who are handicapped either physically or mentally.  There is a large number on the waiting list for places in such schools.  We are hoping that shortly such a school will be built at Clonberne.</P>
    <P>There are complaints from contractors of the non-payment of money in respect of school building.  I trust that in any case where there is such delay, payment will be effected as soon as possible.  There is reference in the brief, too, to decentralisation.  This is a welcome development and we hope that the programme in this regard will proceed as quickly as possible and that in the process we can look forward to an exciting time in the field of educational development.  In a policy of decentralisation it would be proper that the National Council for Educational Awards would have their headquarters west of the Shannon.  I say this for a number of reasons but mainly because the regional technical colleges and the non-university sector colleges are located mainly in the west. Galway would be an ideal location for the headquarters of these institutions.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the building of Garda stations is to continue and I hope that existing buildings will be maintained properly.  We should ensure that those on whom we depend to maintain law and order have accommodation that is comfortable and heated adequately.  Many of these buildings have not got proper living quarters but we trust that any complaints brought to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary will be considered with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the aspect of the work of <Col N="798" /> the Office of Public Works which affects us most in the west is that of drainage.  The Parliamentary Secretary is well aware of the Dunkellin drainage scheme.  We have been told that not much can be done in this regard since the levels are not correct. This is true, too, in so far as many of the other schemes in the constituency are concerned, particularly the Shiven and the Clonshee which, we are told, cannot be tackled until work on the Suck has been completed.  We have been told already that work on the Suck cannot commence until the necessary operations have been carried out in relation to the Shannon so that the whole situation is very frustrating especially for those farmers who are anxious to develop their land.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would let us know if there is any money available from the EEC for works of this nature.  Maybe he would be the one to make application for such funds.  It is important that the Office of Public Works continue their various programmes because they provide a high level of work potential particularly for school leavers who are experiencing so much difficulty in obtaining employment.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of progress was made in the field of architectural heritage during the year devoted to that subject but I hope that progress will continue in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to speak only briefly to this Estimate but first I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment while, at the same time, sympathising with him in being allocated such a miserable amount of money for his very important office.  I compliment, too, our spokesman, Deputy Moore, on his fine contribution but I cannot let the occasion pass without paying tribute to the late Henry Kenny, a very fine gentleman who will be remembered especially for the good humour with which he approached matters here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While an increase of 38 per cent in the Estimate this year compared with last year may seem fine on paper, <Col N="799" /> it is not even sufficient to keep the ball rolling at its present pace.  It leaves no room for expansion.  The largest proportion of the allocation seems to be going to the Dublin area. For instance, I note that out of the £26 million about £8 million is being devoted to the improvement of accommodation in the various Government Departments.  I expect this is essential work but going through the country one realises how much other work needs to be tackled.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to note that there is a national park proposed for Connemara.  This will be an additional tourist attraction in that area.  I welcome, too, the proposed development of a harbour at Portumna and Deputy Kitt has mentioned proposals for Athenry Castle.  However, these are about the only projects I can see in the offing so far as the west is concerned. I am not blaming either the Minister for Finance or the Parliamentary Secretary for this situation. It is obvious that the money required for such works is not available but I am convinced that if the necessary pressure were put on the EEC they would make money available for drainage, because the land is the most important asset we have. Income from the land is a source of income we badly need at the moment.  There are thousands of acres in the west which would be very good for production if the land were drained.  The Dunkellin river was mentioned by Deputy Kitt.  I asked a question about it last week.  There is not a sign of the cost/ benefit survey being done.  It was No. 10 on the list when I came into the House and I believe it is still in the same position.  There is no movement with regard to arterial drainage. They will tell you that you have the local improvements schemes.  As stated by Deputy Kitt, we have put these schemes for drainage under the LIS and many of them have been turned down because the levels are not correct because of major drainage.</P>
    <P>The Dunkellin river goes through County Galway.  This particular area along the Dunkellin basin is not <Col N="800" /> designated as a disadvantaged area. It should certainly be designated as a disadvantaged area.  There is reasonably good land there provided it is drained.  The Parliamentary Secretary was honest enough to tell us he did not know when a cost/benefit survey would be done on that river.</P>
    <P>As far as the Suck and the Shannon are concerned we can quote the old saying: &ldquo;It may be for years and it may be for ever.&rdquo;  I have no hope of either of those rivers being drained. The people who live along the banks of both those rivers have to suffer with hundreds of acres of reasonably good land, which could be good productive land, under water every year. The best asset we have in the country is the land and if we are to survive as a nation we must get the maximum production from that land.  It is all very well to talk about development farmers but before any man manures his land or brings it to fertility he must drain it.</P>
    <P>We have a big drainage problem in the west and nobody seems to care. I am very disappointed that no person has gone to Brussels to pressure the EEC to provide money for drainage. I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary.  He is doing the best he can with the small amount of money he is provided with.  There is only one page in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech devoted to arterial drainage. There was a time when pages of a speech were devoted to this.  The Parliamentary Secretary could not give any more space to it because he had not any more money.  The EEC should be told that this is where we should spend large sums of money.  I would not have spent so much time pressuring people to vote for our entry into the EEC if I thought the promises we got that the west would get an injection for land settlement and arterial drainage, would not be fulfilled.  These are the two most important things as far as the farmers in the west are concerned. We have a fair amount of land but a lot of it is under water.  We also have a fair amount of land which we want to give to small farmers to enable them to become more viable but it needs to be drained first.  I expected <Col N="801" /> the Board of Works to get a huge injection from the EEC funds.  The Parliamentary Secretary should be provided with more than this paltry sum out of the Exchequer to do the very important work which needs to be done.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that our national monuments are being preserved. The Board of Works are doing a very good job with the limited amount of money available.  It seems to me that the vast majority of money provided in this Estimate will be spent in the east and the west is left out in the cold all the time.  Since I came into this House we have had the Estimates for Defence and the Board of Works discussed but we have had no discussion on the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture or Industry and Commerce.  We seem to deal with the least controversial Estimates.  It is a disgrace to see other Estimates rushed through the House before we adjourn for Christmas.  Ample time should be given to discuss them.  I presume this paltry sum which is allocated for the Board of Works will be discussed for a few days.  I will not hold the House up very long on it because it is not worth discussing.  That is no fault of the Parliamentary Secretary. There are other Estimates for which huge sums of money are provided which are never discussed in the House.  If the Parliamentary Secretary was given a large sum of money it would be certainly worth our while spending many days discussing his Estimate.  All he can do at the moment is maintain the standard of the buildings. He would need a large sum of money to look after Government buildings and offices alone.</P>
    <P>We should make an application to the EEC for money for drainage and tell them that unless we get it we in the west of Ireland cannot survive. Our bogs are very important to us. When we raise the matter here we are told we have the LIS.  As far as the LIS is concerned we put in a scheme for over £1,000 which is a very small one now, but we cannot get it for a bog.  Why can the Board of Works not carry out large schemes on the bogs?  There are many bogs in my county on which we could spend <Col N="802" /> £5,000 and do a good job.  There are eight engineers in the area and approximately £8,000 is provided for each engineer's area.  A sum of £5,000 cannot be given to one scheme so nobody can say that the LIS schemes are there for bog roads.  They are no use for bog roads because we cannot spend enough money on them.  We have been told, and rightly so, of the importance of developing our bogs and getting the turf cut to save other fuel.  We have no way of doing that. Money is the whole problem.  There is no money in the Estimate to enable the Parliamentary Secretary to do a reasonable job in this area.</P>
    <P>This is the fourth year I have spoken on this Estimate.  The first year I spoke for about an hour because I was very hopeful.  The late Deputy Kenny in his honesty told me where to get off and I had to say that was that.  The money in this Estimate is sufficient only to maintain the standards of the work in hand.  There is no money for major schemes dealing with bogs and drainage.  There is no programme, no plan.</P>
    <P>I wish the Parliamentary Secretary well.  He would do a good job if he had the money.  There is an old saying that you cannot get blood out of a turnip and another that you cannot take the britches off a Highlander.  If I held the Parliamentary Secretary's office I would draw up plans.  The Office of Public Works could do an excellent job if they had the money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with the chronic housing problems confronting us in this city.  The Office of Public Works have houses vacant in the Ordnance Survey in the Phoenix Park.  The houses which are occupied there lack the essential facility of bathrooms.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to examine this situation immediately and to ensure that people who are homeless are housed in houses which have been available for a considerable time in the Phoenix Park.  The accommodation which the Office of Public Works service in one way or another should be brought up to proper modern standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not blame the Parliamentary <Col N="803" /> Secretary, but it is sad that for so long promises have been made, plans have been drawn up, and indications have been given that proper services would be provided.  I would ask him to ensure that accommodation which is not occupied is handed over at the earliest possible moment to some deserving case.  Within the Ordnance Survey there are many people who would be glad to get this accommodation. It is substantial.  Some of it is occupied and some is unoccupied.  I was in the Ordnance Survey recently and I was in these houses.</P>
    <P>Complaints were made to a previous Parliamentary Secretary and victimisation appears to have taken place because it appeared that information was supplied to me by an individual. A letter of mine making representations was discovered.  I hope we will not have Star Chamber tactics again such as happened elsewhere and that the proper facilities will be provided in the houses serviced by the Office of Public Works.  If this happens in the Ordnance Survey it can happen elsewhere.  I am sure one standard applies throughout the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>If accommodation standards are higher elsewhere than in the Ordnance Survey, something is seriously wrong. Is it victimisation against this section of the service?  Is it victimisation against the officers who occupy that accommodation?  This is a very important area.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said a new printing building for the Ordnance Survey is virtually completed and the staff are already in part occupation of the building.  This should have been completed some time ago. In this sector where maps are produced and brought up to date, it is essential to have modern equipment and buildings.  The buildings in use were used by the British a long time ago.  At that time they were probably unsuitable for this type of work.  We must be in a position to supply information in relation to mineral resources and deposits to companies and maps are required of different areas of the country.  We are not in a position <Col N="804" /> to supply up-to-date information on minerals.  Surveys carried out in the past were either haphazard or are now completely out of date.  I hope special attention will be given to this important section which has so often been overlooked.  It is doing valuable work.  I hope that at the earliest possible moment this new printing building will be available and in operation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the heating of the National Gallery, the museum and other important offices and buildings throughout the city, I understand that due to some problem between the staff who control the heating, there is some type of &ldquo;go-slow&rdquo; on.  An immediate effort must be made to solve the problem with the heating engineers or the maintenance men who control the heating.  There are paintings and materials of substantial value in the museum which have to be kept at certain temperatures.</P>
    <P>These people work 365 days of the year, are available for 24 hours and are subject to various pressures.  To allow this matter to drift until 1st January next constitutes negligence on the part of the personnel in the Office of Public Works who are responsible for the heating of this House and indeed other important buildings. If they want to forsake this job, let them hand it over to another group who will do it efficiently.  If this matter is not solved in the near future it will mean great expense for the State with regard to many important works housed in the Art Gallery, the National Library, the National Museum and the various other places heated from the central system.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to make a renewed effort in this respect because we observe that another effort is being made outside in relation to wages and conditions. These men work under very difficult and extraordinary conditions. Their case is much different from that of the average worker outside and warrants the special attention of the Department.  Members of this House are suffering considerable discomfort as a result of lack of heating facilities here from time to time.  Indeed, the facilities were ineffective before the <Col N="805" /> strike, go-slow, or whatever one wants to call it; either one was cooked or too cold and, in either case, one could not work.  A thorough examination of the heating system throughout the new building must be undertaken. The question of a prolonged stoppage or go-slow, endangering the valuables the State possesses is one of a serious dimension.  I cannot over-stress the necessity to terminate this unsatisfactory situation.  We are told that temperature is important in respect of valuables.  If the Government have no desire to protect the valuables we possess now, then they will have failed in their responsibility to the nation because many of those treasures are housed in some of the buildings affected by the central heating system.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have failed in their responsibility with regard to our canals.  At one stage we were told the Board of Works would be taking over the canals because neither CIE nor the corporation were properly equipped to deal with the problem of canal maintenance. Indeed, were canal maintenance to be dealt with by Dublin Corporation only portion of the canals could be serviced; other local authorities would have to service the remaining sections. It is not a practical proposition to ask local authorities to be responsible for the sections within their jurisdiction.  Specialised machinery is required, I understand, the type of machinery available to the Board of Works and used in drainage schemes and so on.  If the canals are to be maintained it must be in a proper manner and subject to proper standards. If we want to dispense with them, then do so but do not leave them in their present filthy condition. Anyone who has lived close to the canals for a period and who passes along their banks can observe the problems confronting people living along their banks, where dead animals and all sorts of junk and rubbish are tossed, with no real cleaning system obtaining.  It is imperative that a comprehensive survey and plan be undertaken for the maintenance of our canals.</P>
    <P>I note that the Parliamentary <Col N="806" /> Secretary says that his office hope to make a start this year on the provision of additional public toilets in the Phoenix Park.  He said that during the last few years there has been comment about the need for such facilities and about the condition of those existing.  He said it was hoped that the position would be improved in stages over the next few years. One must realise immediately that such facilities are an absolute necessity in an area of the dimensions of the Phoenix Park.  Ever-rising transport costs mean that the demand on the Phoenix Park will be greater than heretofore.  Indeed, any facilities existing there at present are well below the desirable level.  The numbers of people whose spare time is spent in the Phoenix Park at weekends is increasing constantly.  I do not believe this is a matter that can be improved in stages in ensuing years because that would mean it would cost more with each year that passes.  Such basic necessities must be provided and existing standards improved. If public toilet facilities are not available then other means will be found, again necessitating further expense in an endeavour to maintain the park in a fit condition.  I know much has been done in the Phoenix Park and indeed in many other parks throughout the country over the years, nevertheless we must view the situation in relation to the pressures that will continue to be applied to such parks in the future.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note also that the new offices for the Department of Lands in Castlebar and for local staff of other Departments are nearing completion and that it is hoped they will be occupied around June next. I have seen these offices in the course of the election campaign.  They are fairly impressive buildings, of a standard one would expect for the benefit of the personnel employed by the State.  It is sad to observe some of the dungeons still occupied by the State.  It is sad to observe some State personnel and the difficult conditions in which some civil servants have to work.  Indeed, conditions in the offices of the Board of Works in St. Stephen's Green were not too good some years ago when I visited <Col N="807" /> them.  Perhaps they have been improved since.  We should have absolute respect for the maintenance of proper standards for the people employed by the State, whether it be by the Board of Works or any other Department.  It is only fitting that civil servants should be housed in offices of the same standard as those obtaining in outside employment. Far too often civil servants are asked to work in conditions nobody else would endure.  The same applies to local authority workers.  They too are often asked to work in dungeons that no trade union would tolerate. I do not know how some of the civil servants and members of local authorities are expected to work in such conditions.  I hope that the buildings will be made more up to date and comfortable and that we will have more decentralisation.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should give some consideration to improving conditions in offices used by civil servants. If we have not sufficient money to provide new accommodation, at least we should ensure that the existing accommodation is of a suitable standard so that people may be able to work with the least amount of interference and with a degree of comfort. We know that there are substantial opportunities outside the civil service. We do not want to lose to outside jobs many of the valuable civil servants who are highly competent and who have given valuable service during the years, perhaps because of lack of ventilation or lack of natural lighting in their offices or because of facilities that are available elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the staff of the Office of Public Works. Whenever I have sought information from them I got it without hesitation. It was absolutely factual and unambiguous and this is not always the case with every Department.  The Office of Public Works operate throughout a large part of the country and in parts adjacent to my constituency.  I hope that the high level of co-operation and courtesy shown by the staff will be maintained and that that high standard will be an example to other Departments. <Col N="808" /> In many instances it is a case of &ldquo;passing the buck&rdquo;.  We are told that they cannot answer questions without ministerial sanction or that it is necessary to contact certain people who never seem to be available.  Ultimately, it is necessary to write and after a long delay the information is sent.  I am glad to be in a position to pay a tribute to the staff of the Office of Public Works for the manner in which they handle queries from public representatives.</P>
    <P>A matter I wish to raise concerns the amount of material purchased by the Office of Public Works.  When new buildings are being provided for staff of Government Departments I hope that a special effort will be made to ensure that the materials and furnishings used are of Irish manufacture.  I hope that the furniture and fittings of embassies abroad are made in Ireland because there is no reason why we should buy these items abroad.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us about the position in this matter.  Perhaps he will tell us if the criterion used is that of economics when the question of furnishing premises abroad is being considered. I see no reason why carpets, curtains, furniture or even the paper used in the embassy should not be Irish made.</P>
    <P>Our workmen are as competent as workers abroad and, at a time when we have high unemployment, we should ensure that we use Irish-made goods.  I have often thought of studying this matter because I have suspected for some time that we may be spending a considerable amount of money on foreign purchases.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to clarify this matter in his reply so that he will not be tainted in the same way as were other Ministers who purchased materials from abroad.  On other occasions I mentioned the Minister and the areas where the materials were purchased from abroad.  They could have been purchased on the home market just as easily as buying from foreigners.</P>
    <P>There was mention in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement about the sad passing of his predecessor, the late Deputy Henry Kenny.  During his <Col N="809" /> term in office he was most co-operative, had great understanding and he went out of his way to assist public representatives.  I wish the present Parliamentary Secretary well and I trust that the high standards set by Deputy Kenny and his predecessors will be maintained. I realise he has a big job on hands. I hope he will give early attention to some of the matters I raised to ensure that the basic facilities required by personnel in Government offices will be available and will be of a reasonable standard&mdash;a standard that we, as individuals, would expect. Some of the conditions in which people are living and working would not be acceptable to me, and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary would not tolerate them either.  I realise that improvements cannot be carried out overnight.  I know that finance may be a problem but if there are not sufficient resources perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary may be able to transfer them from one sector to another.  I wish him well and I hope that when he comes to the House next year with his Estimate he will be able to report some progress on the matters raised in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Parliamentary Secretary every success in his new post.  I should like to avail of the opportunity to pay tribute to his predecessor, the late Deputy Henry Kenny, who tackled his job with great efficiency.  I feel sure that the new Parliamentary Secretary will be as successful in charge of the Office of Public Works as he was when Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government.  This year the Estimate for the Office of Public Works is £26,088,000, an increase of approximately 38 per cent over last year's figure.  While I accept that that is a substantial increase it must be borne in mind that the cost of materials and other services increases weekly.  I was pleased to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that the major part of the increase in the Estimate is required to meet expenditure on works with a high employment content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all in favour of spending <Col N="810" /> money on such works but the second priority should be drainage.  Drainage is one of the major problems in my constituency and, irrespective of what amount of money is spent, many acres of land are still flooded and non-productive. It is a source of a discontent among the farming community in Sligo and Leitrim.  One cannot blame them because it is discouraging to see so much land being flooded and, consequently, non-productive. We all know about arterial drainage schemes and where rivers in our constituencies are on the priority list but what about the schemes not classified as arterial drainage schemes?  I am thinking of schemes which are too expensive to be classified as local improvement schemes but are too small to be considered as arterial drainage schemes.  What will become of such schemes?  The rivers concerned are causing a lot of damage in my constituency.</P>
    <P>Arterial drainage schemes only apply to big rivers while work under the local improvements scheme is on a small scale.  That work must necessarily be confined because the amount of money allocated is very little.  It would be possible to use up all the money allocated to any county on any one of those local improvements schemes.  The number of applications for local improvements schemes in Leitrim last year was so great that we had to postpone them all.  Instead, we decided to devote the money to improving some of the roads.  It is unfortunate that nothing will be done to relieve the problem of drainage under local improvements schemes this year but we did not have much option.</P>
    <P>The Bonet river has been listed No. 8 on the priority list for arterial drainage schemes but nobody knows when work will commence.  Even if it was fourth on the priority list it would be a long time before anything would be done.  The Parliamentary Secretary should endeavour to channel more money into drainage works.  It is important that every acre of land is made productive.  This fact was brought home forcibly to the farming community last year when cattle prices tumbled and everything went wrong for them.  I agree that livestock prices <Col N="811" /> have improved and that the future looks bright for our farmers but we must intensify our drive to make all our land productive.</P>
    <P>At election time we hear that schemes are to be put into operation to relieve the flooding caused by the River Shannon but as soon as the elections are over those schemes are forgotten.  During a number of by-election campaigns in the constituencies involved we were told that such schemes would start but nothing happened. The Parliamentary Secretary should treat arterial drainage schemes as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that many public buildings in my constituency are in need of renovation.  For as long as I can remember the Sligo Garda station has been in need of renovation.  For many years I have called for an improvement of the Manorhamilton Garda station.  With regard to the latter I was pleased to learn that work will commence soon on a new station there.  The social welfare office in that town is not suitable and I hope it will soon be replaced.</P>
    <P>Last week I asked a question about decentralisation.  In this regard I hope the Parliamentary Secretary, when he is planning new buildings in provincial areas, will bear in mind my call for decentralisation.  Moving of Government offices from the city to provincial towns would help the towns considerably.</P>
    <P>Last year quite a substantial sum, some £20,000, was spent on the restoration of historic castles, monuments and so on.  Many of us were ignorant of the historic importance of these and it was not until the trained personnel who had studied these things came in that we learned of the importance of these from the point of view of our national heritage.  This restoration work has provided valuable employment.  It is very satisfying to see the way in which these important monuments are preserved.  They will be there, of course, for generations after we have passed on.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have spent a good deal of money on <Col N="812" /> national parks.  I would make one appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary about the provision of toilet facilities. These are essential particularly now that we have such a great deal of tourism.</P>

This is a problem along the western seaboard from Donegal to Enniscrone.  A few months ago the Parliamentary Secretary received a deputation from Bundoran and he made it clear to that deputation that the first steps would have to be taken by the local authority concerned.  It is at that level the spade work must be done and he assured us that he would meet us half-way in getting the job done.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment to the Office of Public Works and I am glad he paid a special tribute to his predecessor, the late Deputy Henry Kenny.  I always found Deputy Henry Kenny a man of tremendous understanding and a very capable man.  His was an onerous task and I wish the Parliamentary Secretary success in his onerous task.</P>
      <P>One of the main considerations in my area is arterial drainage.  I am glad the cost/benefit analysis for the Corrib-Mask-Robe has been completed and I hope the findings will be published as soon as possible.  The scheme will benefit a large number of farmers and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make certain that work on the scheme will start this year.  Many representations have been made by farmers in my area in regard to the advantages of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see money provided this year for coast erosion works at Enniscrone.  I wonder what the words &ldquo;prospective outlay&rdquo; mean.  This is a matter of tremendous importance. Already there are notices on the road <Col N="813" /> warning against heavy traffic.  Any outstanding matters in relation to this scheme should be settled promptly and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to use his good influences in that direction.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary had to fight for every penny he could get but the sum allocated for coast protection is very small compared with, say, the £300,000 for work on embassies abroad.  There would seem to be something wrong with our priorities. At Kilcummin the situation is very bad.  Six houses are in danger of being washed away.  Given certain conditions of wind and tide, water has actually gone in the back door and out the front door.  Rocks and stones have been thrown up at doors and windows.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is only natural that one should be a little parochial on an Estimate like this.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary let me know what the position is in regard to the design for the new school at Swinford? At a meeting held in Swinford last week it was decided by 22 votes to 21 to go on strike but, on the advice of the local officer of the INTO, the strike was deferred until such time as the people get an opportunity of properly evaluating the present position.  Agitation for a new school in this area has been going on for a long time.  I understand there were some site difficulties in relation to maps, but I would urge that action be taken at once to stop a strike here and that the people would be informed what the position is.  I would appreciate if the Parliamentary Secretary would let me know about this.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary might also let me know what is the position in relation to Ballyhaunis.  Again, there were some slight differences of opinion in the town as to the suitability of the site.  I understand that has been sorted out and I would ask that the planning of that school would go ahead as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>A new school was erected some years ago about 2½ miles from Ballina. <Col N="814" /> It is called Behy.  They were given an assembly room which could be used as a luncheon room and there was a kitchen installed.  There is only one problem : the water is polluted.  Some time ago they brought me a sample which I discussed with the late Henry Kenny and, unfortunately, one of my children got a taste of that water and spent four days in bed as a result.  I understand that the Board of Works have, in one or two cases, taken advice on pollution from England, particularly in relation to a Garda barracks outside Mullingar, and I wonder why the expertise of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards was not used.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have the institute carry out an examination of this water before somebody else becomes very ill.  Again the parents are not very happy.  They have spent a considerable amount of money trying to get the problem solved, and I would appreciate any suggestions the Parliamentary Secretary or the section involved could make.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see reference to the work carried out by the Board of Works during European Architectural Year.  They are the body most qualified and with the greatest expertise to carry out works like these.  The expertise and experience that is available is not used to its full extent and is often hidden.  The influence on areas in which the officials of the board have operated for some considerable time is very wide and remains long after they have left.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose the Parliamentary Secretary has had time to go into the Devlin Report to see what reorganisation can take place in the Board of Works so as to give it a 20th-century look.  The situation there is somewhat archaic.  That may be too harsh a word, but there appears to be a complete lack of knowledge on the administrative side of the type of work being carried out in the field.  To quote an example, some years ago when a major job was being done in the Mayo area a note went in from the engineer in charge asking for permission to dismantle a machine with an 80-foot jib.  He did not mention <Col N="815" /> that there was an 80-foot jib but he did mention the name of the machine. He was told this would cost too much and that he should make provision to garage it.  Anybody who had been dealing with a machine of that size would know there was no way that could be garaged, that it would cost ten times more to do that than it would to dismantle it.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that office accommodation in Castlebar is nearly complete. I note the Parliamentary Secretary says the accommodation is for offices for the Department of Lands and other Departments.  Could he let me know if any application has been made by or on behalf of any other body, either a county council, a committee of agriculture or a body like that, for accommodation in this building?</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Dowling I also welcome the provision of extra toilets in the Phoenix Park.  Anything that can be done for this park should be done because it is one of the largest open spaces in Europe.  Not near enough use has been made of it.  The Board of Works could do a much better job generally in this area.</P>
    <P>I hope the harbour works on Clare Island will be completed this year.  As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, they have been long sought and people on the island will look forward to the completion of these facilities.  We also look forward to seeing a start on Ballyglass Pier this year.</P>
    <P>A matter which has caused considerable comment around Killala is the way in which the pier has been left for the past number of years.  This is something that the former Parliamentary Secretary saw for himself, on which he had considerable correspondence and on which there has also been a great deal of correspondence from the Mayo County Council to the Office of Public Works.  There is a lot of activity on and around that pier and it is in a dangerous condition. Therefore, I would ask that the work on this pier be finished this year.</P>
    <P>In March, 1973, I, with Deputy Finn, attended a meeting at Kilcummin at which there were representatives <Col N="816" /> of the engineering section of Mayo County Council, the Board of Works and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  Certain recommendations were made by the fishermen. I understand from communications received from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Murphy, just before and again after Christmas, that the scheme was being examined. I would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would let me know what is now being offered the fishermen in this area and when the scheme is likely to start.  This is something the late Parliamentary Secretary saw and he was impressed by the way in which the fishermen made their claim.</P>
    <P>One can only hope that the residence in Beirut is all right and that it is not money wasted.  The Parliamentary Secretary should ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the possibility of damage being done there and to ask the authorities to take every action they can to protect the interests of this nation.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see work is going ahead on the improvement and modernisation of a number of post offices. I hope the situation that has arisen in Ballina, where a new office was erected and is now lying idle, will not also happen in other areas.</P>
    <P>The staff of Leinster House have vacated rooms which are being refurnished. I welcome that move because at times accommodation has not been all it should be.  Perhaps it is because this is the lunch time that for the last 45 minutes I have been getting a great smell of onions in the Chamber.  This is probably because the ventilation system is picking up all the smells from the restaurant kitchen.</P>
    <P>It is essential that Garda barracks should be of very good quality.  Gardaí should get the accommodation they need because in a number of cases, especially in Border areas, these men are being quartered in very poor and old buildings.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to continue his policy of phasing out these archaic buildings.  Again, I wish him well and assure him that I will be annoying him from time to time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I too wish the Parliamentary Secretary well in his new post.  Judging by this Estimate he will need our good wishes.  We find it hard to say anything new on this Estimate because appeals for funds for barracks &mdash;both Garda and Army&mdash;schools and drainage, have already been made. Over the last year, there was very little increased effort at getting this work underway.</P>
      <P>When speaking on this Estimate the first thing one thinks about is schools. Mention was made today of the prefabs, how unsightly they are and how important it is to have suitable structures erected to replace them because they have a very short life.  Because so many parishes are changing over to central schools, extensions are being built.  In most cases these extensions are fairly elaborate but they are being erected on very limited acreage.  This will militate against us in years to come when we have large attendances at schools but very few playgrounds. The Office of Public Works should ensure that lands adjoining schools are acquired so that in future children will have suitable playing facilities.  Because of the increasing value of land and housing developments along roadways, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure land adjacent to schools for playgrounds.</P>
      <P>All schools, especially primary schools, should have small plots for flowers and plants.  This would instil in young students a love for flowers and plants.  In many areas local authorities&mdash;and they are to be complimented for this&mdash;are planting trees along arterial routes.  In many cases those trees have not a chance to survive because they are broken by vandals. If those vandals had had a civic spirit instilled in them in their primary schools they would not have broken the trees.  If seeds and plants were provided for schools, the children could tend them and this would give them an interest in growing things and make them more civic minded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was also made of Garda barracks.  In my area this matter is very important.  I was glad to see that mention was made of the erection of a barracks in Castleblayney.  Of course, <Col N="818" /> mention was made of it last year too. The gardaí in that area have a very onerous task and it is important that their accommodation should be the best possible.  At the moment they are housed in buildings which were designed in many cases to house a fraction of the present numbers.  For that reason, attention should be paid to this problem.  In years past the standard set was probably much lower than today's standard.  In some areas there might have been only one garda serving at that time, but there could be four or five in those areas now.  As gardaí are very involved in road checks, they should be provided with the best possible equipment&mdash;flashers, signals and so on&mdash;in order to make their jobs both easier and safer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely mention it in passing.  The Board of Works have responsibility in many areas&mdash;schools, public buildings, drainage and so on. Because of the importance of drainage to our economy we should think in terms of setting up a separate board to deal with this area exclusively. We had hoped that the Minister for Foreign Affairs would have exerted more pressure on the EEC in an effort to get from them an allocation for arterial drainage works and we are disappointed that this has not been the case.  When one considers the amount of water pollution in our rivers one realises the need there is for a separate board to deal with drainage matters.  In so far as my own area is concerned most drainage work would have to be conducted in conjunction and in co-operation with our friends across the Border.  Yesterday I tabled a question to the Minister for Finance regarding the position on the priority list of certain catchment areas in County Monaghan and asking when it was likely to begin work on certain rivers.  The reply was to the effect that the Erne catchment is No. 10 on the priority list of major catchments&mdash;more than 100,000 acres &mdash;that the Blackwater is No. 19 on the list of minor catchments&mdash;25,000 to <Col N="819" /> 100,000 acres&mdash;and that having regard to inherent difficulties in these catchments as well as to other urgent commitments and limited funds, it is not possible to say when drainage will commence.  That reply does not give much reason for hoping that the work will commence shortly.</P>
      <P>In the Northern Ireland Assembly a member tabled a question in January, 1974, regarding the drainage of the River Finn and he was told that the Office of Public Works in the Republic had put forward certain proposals for consideration by the relevant department in the North, that it had not been possible up to that time for security reasons to carry out the detailed ground survey which was an essential preliminary to a proper evaluation of those proposals. The member was told that as soon as the security situation permitted, the department would put the survey in hand.</P>
      <P>In my area there is not alone the serious problem that arises in relation to the drainage but also the problem of the operation of the necessary schemes.  During the past two weeks a number of people, myself included, in that area who are interested in the question of drainage and who had arranged meetings with people concerned on both sides of the Border, inspected work that is being carried out in south Fermanagh by the northern drainage board.  Admittedly, this operation is not as extensive as would be an arterial drainage scheme &mdash;it involved the drainage of minor water courses and the removal of blockages from the rivers&mdash;but there appeared to be in progress a very worthwhile and well-planned job.  It may be said that in this type of work a comprehensive scheme is imperative and that what is involved must be arterial if it is to be effective but in the interim money should be provided, even at county level, to deal with matters such as blockages in rivers, a problem that can be very serious in the context of pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to recall a letter sent from a group of people to the Minister for Finance regarding the <Col N="820" /> condition of a river in the Clonkeen-Clonkirk area near Clones.  The complaint concerned the impeding of the flow of water and the serious pollution problem which this was causing. The Minister replied that he had no responsibility in regard to the pollution of the river in question.  This is another reason why I say a separate board should be set up to deal with the question of drainage as distinct from the other public works undertaken by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>We note that the amount being allocated for expenditure on drainage works in progress is £2,321,000 which is an increase of £367,000 on last year's figure but taking into account the rate of inflation and increasing costs, it is doubtful that the provision of this extra amount will allow for the same amount of work as it was possible to undertake last year with the lesser amount.</P>
    <P>There is a sum of £850,000 being allocated for the purchase and maintenance of engineering plant and machinery to be used mainly for arterial drainage works and also for the purchase of stores and the payment of wages to the central engineering workshop staffs.  One wonders whether the £850,000 is meant to be sufficient also for the purchase of additional plant.  If this is so the situation is very serious.</P>

      <P>My main purpose in limiting intervention purchases about a year ago was to encourage <Col N="821" /> the factories to make more use of commercial outlets.  Since the limitation was imposed intervention intake has in fact been consistently below the maximum level permitted.  This is an indication that the course 1 set was the correct one and is in itself an argument against any raising of the limit.  Indeed, the reduction in slaughterings this year makes it even more desirable that there should be less recourse to intervention and that we should continue to supply our commercial market outlet.</P>

      <P>The bulk of our live cattle exports are to the United Kingdom and eligible cattle exported to that country will continue to benefit from the variable premium payable there.  Since the end of February no FEOGA premium has applied to such cattle exported to other member States but these exports are relatively small, accounting for only about 5 per cent of the total on which the premium was paid up to the end of 1975.  I should also point out that the termination of the FEOGA premium has been more than offset by the strengthening of the beef market, the recent change in the representative rate of the Irish £ and the further transitional step under the Accession Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the extent to which the effects of the most recent devaluation of the green £ will be dissipated by the fall in the value of sterling.</P>

      <P>The advantages arising from the change in the representative rate for the Irish £ secured by me at the recent meeting of the Council of Ministers continue and are not affected by the fall in the value of the £.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the relationship between the representative rate and the market rate for the £ in any week determines the level of the monetary export charge.  Consequently, the recent fall in the market rate for the £ results in a higher monetary charge on our exports to non-UK destinations, thereby negativing the benefit which would otherwise arise from the floating downwards of the £.  The net monetary position in regard to exports to the UK is not affected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not.  It means that by getting that 2 per cent we reduce the charge by 2 per cent. Whatever the charge increases to we get the benefit of that 2 per cent so we do not lose the benefit of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy in my reply to a previous similar question a number of schemes designed to help the sheep industry are already in operation.  These include the mountain lamb subsidy <Col N="823" /> scheme, the hogget ewe subsidy scheme, the extension to the mountain lamb subsidy scheme and the export guarantee scheme for carcase mutton and lamb.  Expenditure under these schemes in 1975 amounted to almost £3 million.</P>
      <P>Obviously decisions about expanding sheep production must be taken by farmers themselves in the light of such factors as its relative profitability <i>vis-á-vis</i> other enterprises.  In fact the decline in numbers has been most marked in certain lowland areas where alternative remunerative enterprises are available.  A common organisation of the EEC market for sheep meat would, of course, help greatly and, as the Deputy is aware I have been pressing strongly for the introduction of this for some considerable time past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission's proposal for a transitional common organisation of the market for sheepmeat was discussed at the meeting of the Council of Minister's on 15th/16th December.  In the discussion, it was clear that the positions of some member States are very far apart.  I pointed out the shortcomings of the proposal from our point of view and urged that it should be amended so as to include worthwhile support for sheep producers, adequate control of imports from non-member countries and precise arrangements for phasing out the proposed compensatory amounts on imports into France from Ireland and the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent meetings of the Council were devoted almost entirely to the <Col N="826" /> fixing of agricultural prices for 1976-77.  It was, however, agreed at my instigation that the question of sheepmeat should be taken up again at the first meeting after the price-fixing. This will take place on 5th/6th April.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go too deeply into the question of the importation of frozen meat.  I have a question down on that for next week.  Surely even if there is not a sheep policy, the Treaty of Rome has to be respected in regard to the importation of sheep.  The general principles of the Treaty of Rome have been broken brazenly with regard to Ireland getting into the French market. Would the Minister agree that the general principles of the Treaty of Rome have been broken?  Surely something can be done about that. If not, the Community seems to be falling asunder.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a person cannot race a dog on a greyhound racetrack unless he is a member of a coursing club? If he does not subscribe to blood sport or does not agree with it, such a person still has to be a member of a coursing club before he can race on a greyhound racing track.

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Simply and solely because the coursing club is like Wetherbys, it is the registration authority.  One does not have to course to run a dog on a track, if that is what the Deputy is saying. One can race a dog without ever coursing a dog or taking any part in blood sports as the Deputy says.  They are the registration authority.  Therefore, one has to operate through them.  Just as in horse racing one has to operate through Weltherbys to prove the horses are thoroughbreds.</P>

      <P>The decline in the catch of salmon by netting in the Foyle area in recent years is a direct result of reduced runs of fish into the system. The reason for this decline have not been clearly established but may be due to a number of factors such as the expansion of drift net fishing off the Donegal coast outside the Foyle area, the effects of salmon disease or some measure of overfishing within the Foyle area itself.</P>

      <P>The projects will not be confined to any particular type. They will be projects of such a type that will provide benefit to the community wherein they are carried out. They will be able to provide training for young people engaged in them. They will have to satisfy the criterion that they will not compete with normal employment in the area.  It will be a requirement also that materials required for the work will be provided by the community organisation.  Therefore, there is no hard and fast rule as to what particular type of project will qualify.  It will depend on those general criteria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if any records are available or if any analysis has been made to show, under the following headings, why unemployment and redundancies have increased: (a) loss of market for products due to reduced consumption and/or demand, (b) loss of market as a result of reduced competitiveness due to price and/or lack of quality of product, (c) inability to get raw material due to scarcity or cost and (d) bad management; and, if so, if the records will be made available to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Employers proposing to make workers, who have at least two years' service, redundant are required by the Redundancy Payments Acts to notify my Department and to state the reason for the redundancy. The purpose in requiring the employer to state the reason for redundancy is to establish that the dismissal constitutes a genuine redundancy as defined by the Act.  The most common reasons given by employers for redundancies are &ldquo;lack of work&rdquo;, &ldquo;reorganisation&rdquo;, &ldquo;fall in demand&rdquo; or &ldquo;closure&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reasons given are not sufficiently detailed to provide the kind of information under the headings listed by the Deputy, but it is evident in most cases that the reduction in employment is brought about by a number of factors and not by one single reason.</P>
      <P>Managements of firms facing employment difficulties, and their workers, have a variety of services to call on to help them in solving their problems.  These services are mainly the concern of the Minister for Industry and Commerce but they also include training and retraining, the operation of the National Manpower Service, the redundancy payments code and the premium employment programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it would be important to monitor job losses and establish the precise reasons for them. This is something that would come under the Department of Industry and Commerce and the agencies under that Department principally the IDA. Inevitably they would be involved in any closure, probably having been involved in the setting up and expansion of the industry.  In addition, possibly some of the rescue agencies of the State would also be involved.  There would be a considerable amount of detailed intelligence regarding the job losses between all these agencies.  So far as the Department of Labour are concerned, they can only look to the records under the Redundancy Payments Acts and these provide reasons in general terms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an obligation, if that is the right word.  He is concerned, as I am sure are all Members in the House, with regard to redundancies. The important thing is to ascertain why precisely they occur. That information is available in other State agencies, not in the Department of Labour.</P>

      <P>D'fhonn aon mhíthuiscint maidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta a ghlanadh chuir mé ráiteas amach ar an 2 Márta agus, le cead an Cheann Comhairle, cuirfear timpeall sa Tuairise Oifigiúil é.</P>
      <P>Dhearbhaigh mé sa ráiteas sin nach bhfuil athrú ar chinneadh bunúsách an Rialtais go mbunófar an tÚdarás. Nuair a bheidh an Bille chun é sin a dhéanamh os comhair na Dála beidh deis ag Teachtaí gach gné de a bhreithniú go mion agus beidh mé féin ag éisteacht go cúramach lena gcuid tuairimí.</P>
      <P>Seo a leanas an ráiteas:</P>
      <P>Is trua gur tharla mearbhall agus tuairimíocht faoin Údarás Gaeltachta atá beartaithe: is amhlaidh a thug mé agallamh le déanaí do Radio na Gaeltachta agus craoladh sleachta as ar chlár &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; an Domhnach seo caite.</P>
      <P>Is mian liom a dhearbhú nach bhfuil athrú ar bith ar chinneadh bunúsach an Rialtais go mbunófar Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Le linn agallaimh fhorleathain le tuairisceoir ó Radio na Gaeltachta Dé Sathairn seo caite, thug mé go hoscailte agus go macánta léargas ar na fadhbanna praiticiúla a bhí le sárú agam, mar Aire na Gaeltachta, chun Údarás éifeachtacht Gaeltachta a bhunú a mbeadh fonn ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin glacadh leis, agus go háirithe an fhadhb a bhain le hÚdarás a leagan amach a dhéanfadh deimhin de go mbeadh cabhair ar fáil ag na heagrais phobail&mdash;na comharchumainn agus na cumainn fhorbartha éagsúla a bhfuil sárobair á déanamh acu cheana féin ar mhaithe leis na comhluadair áitiúla&mdash;i dtreo go mbeadh na heagrais sin in ann obair níos fearr fós a chur i gcrích.  Ag druidim le deireadh an agallaimh dúirt mé go soiléir go mbunófaí Údarás na Gaeltachta roimh dheireadh na bliana seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is é an rud is tábhachtaí domsa mar Aire na Gaeltachta ná Údarás a leagan amach a chuirfidh ar chumas na ngnáthdhaoine sna comhluadair áitiúla i ngach paróiste ar fud na Gaeltachta páirt iomlán a ghlacadh i bhforbairt eacnamaíoch, sóisialta agus cultúrtha a ndúiche féin.  Bhí an méid sin mar phríomhaidhm an bheartais atá agamsa don Ghaeltacht ó ceapadh <Col N="847" /> mar Aire mé agus beidh sé mar phríomhaidhm agam agus an reachtaíocht d'Údarás na Gaeltachta á hullmhú agam.  Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh ar chumas na n-eagras áitiúil a d'fhás go nádúrtha ar fud na Gaeltachta le tamall de bhlianta anuas leanúint ar aghaidh leis an obair atá ar siúl acu; le lántacaíocht an Rialtais tá feabhas iontach á chur ar shaol na Gaeltachta ag na heagrais sin i gcónaí agus ní cóir cur isteach ar a deashaothar sin trí structúr nua polaitiúil nach bhfuil gá ar bith leis a thabhairt isteach&mdash; structúr nach bhféadfadh ach easaontas a chothú agus nach mbeadh ag teacht ar chor ar bith le sprid na comharaíochta i measc an phobail. Tar éis dom bheith ag obair i dteannta le muintir na Gaeltachta agus ar a son le trí bliana anuas táim sásta gurb é an saghas údaráis is fearr a bheidh in ann freastal ar a gcuid riachtanas ná Údarás a mbeidh feidhmeanna chomh leathan agus is féidir aige i gcúrsaí forbartha agus a bheidh ag obair faoi agus i gcomhar leis na hinstitiúidí daonlathacha Stáit atá againn.</P>

      <P>There has been no material change in the position since the Deputy previously raised the matter.  The cost of providing telephone service in the valley would be extremely high and a public telephone could be provided only at very substantial loss.  My Department provides subsidised public telephones only in rural areas where there is a sub-post office and then only if the subsidy involved is not likely to be heavy.  There is, I regret, no prospect of a public telephone being provided in the area in question except under guarantee from a local authority or other suitable body against loss.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the plans for the second television service involve changing the frequency used by the transposer at Glenisland, Castlebar, County Mayo which transmits the existing television service.  Viewers served by this transposer will need to have their aerials or aerials and sets modified to receive these programmes on a new frequency which has yet to be decided.  RTE and my Department are very conscious of the need to minimise inconvenience to viewers. The modifications needed will depend on the final plans for the transposer and may not be very significant.</P>
      <P>In addition, viewers who are within the service area of Truskmore transmitter will be affected.  The polarisation of this transmitter is being changed from vertical to horizontal and the polarisation of viewers' rooftop aerials will have to be changed also from vertical to horizontal.  This is quite a minor job.  405 line transmissions from Truskmore are also being ceased.  Any viewers still depending on sets capable of receiving 405 line transmissions only will have to change their sets if they wish to receive RTE programmes.</P>
      <P>I regret that I cannot agree to compensate those affected by adjustments in the existing TV service which, unfortunately, are unavoidable if the new service is to be provided at minimum cost for the maximum number of viewers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us in his reply that people will have to discard their present sets and aerials will have to be changed.  Does he consider this fair to people who have gone to considerable expense to provide television sets and would he not agree that the people of Mayo who will <Col N="853" /> suffer because this is being done for the benefit of the people of Galway are entitled to some compensation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Mayo is not, of course, the only area where inconvenience will arise as a result of changes in frequency usage arising from the provision of the second service. The only people who will really have to replace their sets are those who have old sets depending on 405 line transmission.  These have had fair notice of this change.  It was announced in March, 1974, that 405 line transmission would be ceased within two years or so.  This meant that the second service would be provided by VHF on four of the five main transmitters as compared with only two if the 405 line service was not ceased.  I think adequate notice has been given and I do not think any great suffering is involved.  Most of the changes over can be done at quite a low cost.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Would the Minister agree that this will cause considerable hardship to old age pensioners and the poorer section in the community in that part of the country?  My information is that there are about 5,000 receiving sets involved here.  I am not sure whether those are all 405, but I would be concerned about such people having to purchase a new set and at the same time having to replace an aerial.  I doubt very much&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have already indicated that considerable notice was given of the cessation of 405-line transmission, which is the main hardship, if the Deputy looks at it in that way.  Many of these sets are quite old and would need to be replaced.  Broadcasting is an area of necessary technological change.  I am sorry if there is any hardship at all but I think it is minimal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said today:</P>
      <P>A total of £112,500 has been provided for inland waterways.  This figure includes a sum of £2,000 for the continuation of the survey of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity the amount provided is so small because this canal has great potential for development.  At one time it was hoped that inland waterways would link the whole country. First, there was the Shannon linking up with Lough Erne; there was the <Col N="862" /> Ballinamore linking with the Grand Canal to Dublin.  It was hoped to link the Ulster Canal with Lough Neagh. The Ulster Canal has gone out of use but there is still the Ballinamore Canal which would link with the Shannon to Limerick, the Grand Canal to Dublin and the Ballinamore Canal also linking up with the Lough Erne system.  If money was provided for the survey of that canal it could be developed, and if it was developed to its full potential there would not be its equal in Europe.  The Parliamentary Secretary should keep in mind the development of these inland waterways.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also referred to Army barracks.  The erection of the Army barracks at Monaghan is well advanced, and I want to know if provision for living quarters for Army personnel has been made.  This is an area where great provision has been made for housing the people, but there is still a waiting list in Monaghan town.  Therefore the Office of Public Works should be in contact with either the NBA or Monaghan Urban Council to ensure that when that barracks is erected, accommodation will be available for Army personnel.</P>
    <P>Reference is also made here to embassy buildings and the money provided. When I read through this it brought to mind a parliamentary delegation to Copenhagen I took part in in 1974.  It was shortly after the setting up of our embassy there following our entry into the EEC.  At that time the building reflected very little credit on our country having regard to the accommodation on the second floor.  Buildings for our representatives abroad should reflect favourably on the country.  My experience on that occasion in Copenhagen was that that was not the case. It may have been remedied since.</P>
    <P>I note that £61,500 is provided for national monuments.  I would hope that the Parliamentary Secretary would, as far as possible, involve the local committees and community effort in the preservation of these monuments.  The Parliamentary Secretary also mentioned the erection of <Col N="863" /> plaques outlining the history of these monuments and places of note.  It is very important that we should preserve those before they go any further into decay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many failings and shortcoming in this Estimate presented by the Parliamentary Secretary but one that is of particular significance for the area I represent, North County Dublin, is the appalling disregard by the Government of the major problem of coast erosion.  This year there was only £65,000 provided in the Estimate for coastal protection. Even last year there was £80,000.  This compares with an estimate of £1,760,000 produced in 1975 by the Dublin County Council under the Coast Protection Acts to the Department for necessary work to be done on the County Dublin beaches for the protection of the coast.  That is, for the coastline of one county alone at the 1975 price.  The Government this year have provided the paltry sum of £65,000 for the whole country for this very necessary work of coast protection. The £1,750,000 for County Dublin was made up as follows: Velvet Strand, Portmarnock, £300,000; Lough Shinny, £25,000; the north shore at Skerries, £10,000; Barnageera, an area between Balbriggan and Skerries, £50,000; the area south of Balbriggan Harbour, £26,000; the borough of Portrane £160,000; the south County Dublin coastline £1,100,000 and Rodgerstown, Rush, £106,000.  The county council submitted this report under section 2 of the Coast Protection Act, 1963, which said that</P>
      <P>If the council is satisfied that land within the county is being progressively damaged by the continuing encroachment of the sea, as distinct from occasional or abnormal storms, and that the encroachment is liable to endanger the safety of a harbour, the buildings or amenities of a residential area, or other valuable property, it may declare that the promotion of a coast protection scheme is expedient and the Commissioners of Public Works should be asked to carry out a preliminary examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> They are told to carry out a preliminary examination of this very necessary work because every scheme proposed by Dublin County Council falls under the headings mentioned in section 2 of the Act I have just quoted&mdash;encroachment is liable to endanger the safety of a harbour and falls under that heading; buildings or amenities of a residential area or other valuable property, also fall under that.  The Government contributed £65,000.  It would not be enough to carry out the very necessary preliminary examination of even one of these schemes.  If the Government are serious about governing properly one of their main aims should be the protection of the amenities of the people in and around the capital city.</P>
    <P>One of our greatest amenities in the summer is our beaches, Portmarnock beach and the south county and north county coastline.  The Government have allowed a miserable £65,000 to cover all this necessary work throughout the country.  This is an indictment of the Government and everything they stand for.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to re-examine the Estimate and the allocation of funds for coastal protection.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the schemes suggested by the county council.  It was estimated that the Velvet Strand Portmarnock, would cost approximately £300,000.  What was included in that? The Velvet Strand covers an area from Farney Gutter, north of the County Club where it joins the Portmarnock-Malahide Road, along the banks towards Sutton Point and Portmarnock golf club.  The lands abutting the Velvet Strand consist of a ridge of dunes. Severe damage is taking place at the Farney Gutter and for a distance of approximately 500 yards piles of eroding sands are speedily engulfing this wooded area and making their way onto the main road.  The accumulation of sand in this area is blown on to the public road into gardens and drains and, from time to time, bulldozers and lorries have to be used to remove it.</P>
    <P>The Portmarnock complex is so important to the people of the county and city of Dublin that the Dublin County Council are preparing a compulsory <Col N="865" /> purchase order to acquire approximately 250 acres of this land for use for amenity purposes by the people.  Portmarnock is one of the great traditional playgrounds of the people of Dublin city during the summer weekends.  On any sunny Sunday during the summer you will see thousands of people along the Portmarnock beach and dunes enjoying their family picnics.  Surely this amenity is worth protecting for these people?</P>
    <P>Portmarnock is a rapidly developing area.  There are approximately 25,000 people living in Portmarnock, Malahide and the surrounding areas.  They are entitled to some amenities and their great natural amenity is the Velvet Strand.  Despite the pleas of the county council and the people living in the area, the Government have closed their eyes to this very necessary coast protection work which would preserve this amenity.  My comments on Portmarnock could apply with equal relevance to other schemes proposed by the county council.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the amounts of money provided for coast protection and see if in some way the preliminary examinations for this scheme could be got under way this year.</P>
    <P>The debate on the extension of Skerries Harbour has gone on since this Government came into power&mdash; with no credit to the Government&mdash;and it still continues.  I put down a number of questions to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance about the extension to Skerries Harbour. I also asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries on 3rd February, the progress made with regard to the extension of Skerries Harbour; and if he would make a statement on the matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary informed me that:</P>
    <P>A boring survey of Skerries Harbour will be necessary before any scheme for the improvement of the landing facilities there could be formulated.  I have asked the Office of Public Works to have this survey undertaken as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In the course of the supplementaries I said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> I accept that the Parliamentary Secretary gave that answer with tongue in cheek.  The boring equipment arrived at Skerries where one trial hole was made, but then the whole operation was packed up.</P>
    <P>The history of this situation is this: before an extension could be arrived at, it was necessary to bore the foundations to see what soil they were going into.  This is understandable.  About 18 months ago I raised this matter with the then Parliamentary Secretary.  I would like to say how very much I personally regretted the passing of the Parliamentary Secretary.  When he was in office he was a courteous, kindly and charitable man and is a great loss to this House.  He assured me that but for the fact that the one piece of boring equipment in the country was tied up on the west coast and there were storms at the time, they could have started the job in Skerries.  I asked if there was any other boring equipment here and was told no, unfortunately, there was only one piece of equipment.  The storms abated and the equipment was transferred to Skerries where it was assembled and anchored in the bay for a considerable time.  They then proceeded, with great blowing of trumpets to bore one trial hole and then they disappeared never to be seen again.</P>
    <P>When I queried this in the House the Parliamentary Secretary told me that another piece of boring equipment was being secured and eventually they would get around to digging the trial holes.  So far not a sign has been seen of boring equipment or of any sign of progress with the necessary extension of Skerries Harbour.  Skerries Harbour is one of the major harbours on the east coast.  Because of the size of the fleet&mdash;boats of 75 and 85 feet are being purchased&mdash;many of the boats, instead of coming into the harbour, have to anchor in the bay where there is not adequate protection, and where because of the size of the harbour there are not adequate docking facilities for the unloading of catches and so on. The problem is becoming critical and that is why I urge that some action be taken by the Parliamentary Secretary in the near future to recommence <Col N="867" /> the boring survey and, thereby, allow the necessary extension of the harbour.</P>
    <P>While waiting for the major job to be carried out at Skerries Harbour, some dredging work should be put into operation in the area immediately adjacent to the harbour wall.  This area is silting up badly and the bigger boats cannot come in, while those that can dock find that very quickly they have no protection because within a short time there is no water underneath.</P>
    <P>The question of dredging brings to mind Balbriggan Harbour.  Because of the inadequate space at Skerries many of the smaller boats are using Balbriggan Harbour again so that the fleet there is building up although the harbour is in a deplorable condition. It is necessary that dredging work be commenced immediately on this harbour. I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether anything was being done in this regard and he told me that the position will be re-examined in the light of a report of a special survey team.  This is the general survey being conducted in respect of the east coast harbours but I urge that in the meantime dredging work be commenced at Balbriggan.</P>
    <P>Together with Rodgerstown, Balbriggan and Skerries are the main harbours in north County Dublin. Sailing and boating generally are becoming very popular in this area. There is no control in many of the estuaries and little inlets on the coastline which are not directly under the control of the Port and Docks Board or of any harbour authority with the result that a certain conflict is building up between the commercial operators, such as fisherman or, in the case of Malahide, a shipyard, and private interests, the weekend sailors.  Therefore, I would like to see some authority being given to the Office of Public Works which would enable them to prepare a plan of the moorings and, consequently, ensure some control.  In Malahide where there is a large estuary, the channel is very narrow so that when some of the leisure craft tie up to moorings there <Col N="868" /> they are preventing the shipyard from using the channel to gain access to the sea.  The operation concerned for the Board of Works would be only minor but would entail in the first instance bringing together all the local interests concerned&mdash;public, private and commercial&mdash;to discuss where the moorings should be placed and so on.  This would make for a much better situation than the haphazard one which prevails at present in these small inlets around our coastline.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would arrange for some officers of his Department to act as liaison officers in this matter.  It is hardly a matter for legislation but merely for the application of common sense.</P>
    <P>In relation to leisure craft and the increasing popularity of boating as a hobby there is a problem in Skerries. It was proposed to build a slipway there which would be used by the local sailing club.  Originally there was provisional agreement between the Department and the county council on the question of the sharing of the expenditure that would be involved in this work but there have been no developments recently.  An examination was to have been undertaken by the Office of Public Works and I wonder whether any progress has been made in this regard.  The provision of a slipway at Skerries is of particular importance to the area and to the tourist industry generally because it would give Skerries the opportunity of hosting one of the world's sailing competitions.  The bringing of any such competition to the area is dependent on the slipway being provided.  Therefore, I urge that the investigation in this regard be speeded up so that work can be commenced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Because the Office of Public Works have responsibilities for so many different areas of activity the Parliamentary Secretary's speech of necessity, was wide ranging.  One of the matters referred to was the construction of Garda stations and in particular the one at Swords.  Some time ago I was assured that this work was going to tender and I note that it is hoped to place a contract shortly.  I <Col N="869" /> ask that no shortage of finance be allowed impede in any way the construction of this station.  After the setting up of the force the Swords station was the first to be occupied outside the Dublin metropolitan area so the least they are entitled to after all this time is a new station.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the whole problem of facilities for the Garda in north County Dublin.  Most of the stations were built at a time when County Dublin was a rural area and when the vast increases in population that have taken place since then along the city fringe area were not envisaged. I refer to Swords, Portmarnock, Rush, Skerries and all those other stations.  I would like to see some progress made in improving the facilities for the people in north County Dublin generally.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary gave a list of certain works which were to be carried out in the various embassies. When I spoke on this Estimate last year I mentioned the consulate at Hamburg.  The previous speaker, my colleague, Deputy Leonard, was in Copenhagen.  I was on a parliamentary trip to Germany and visited the consulate in Hamburg.  It also needs renovation. I do not see it on the list of jobs to be done.  I would like it to be looked at again.  Last year I suggested that rather than renting a number of those premises we should examine, from an economic point of view, the advisability of buying rather than renting property abroad.  We have had some of our embassies for a long time. They have been on long leases and I am sure we could have an opportunity of purchasing them now.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to look at this matter.</P>
    <P>All Deputies are concerned with the facilities in the House generally.  I mentioned one morning, on the Order of Business, the industrial dispute which prevented proper heating being provided in the House for Members, staff and visitors.  While today is a mild day we had problems earlier on when the weather was cold.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary is doing something <Col N="870" /> to see that this dispute is not allowed continue any longer.  I am very pleased with the increased accommodation on the fourth floor where I work. Since some of the staff moved across the road to Setanta House it is much more comfortable and conducive to work.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told us today, in relation to the provision of a concert hall:</P>
    <P>Planning is well advanced on a scheme for the adaptation for concert hall purposes of portion of the UCD premises at Earlsfort Terrace. It is hoped that it will be possible to complete the planning stage by the end of this year which would allow of a start being made on the adaptations in 1977, but this will depend on how soon the UCD authorities can release the space required.</P>
    <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary let us know exactly what progress has been made with the UCD authorities about releasing the hall in Earlsfort Terrace for use as a concert hall? The need for a proper concert hall in the city and for the country generally must be as obvious to the Parliamentary Secretary as it is to the country at large.  I hope he has been able to examine this matter and that he will be able to let us know what are the hopes of starting work next year.</P>
    <P>As usual, the Parliamentary Secretary had something to say about the facilities in the Phoenix Park.  This is one of the great loves of the ex-Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lemass, who was very conscious of the amenity value of the Phoenix Park to the people of Dublin.  The Zoological Gardens are one of the greatest attractions in the Phoenix Park.  I would like to see some extra land provided by the Board of Works for the extension of the zoological grounds.  A large number of riding schools use the Phoenix Park and the stables adjacent to it.  It would be a great idea if there was something in the Phoenix Park similar to that provided in Hyde Park, London, where there is a special riding track reserved for horses.  It is only on that track that horses are allowed.  There is a sand track right around the perimeter <Col N="871" /> of this area.  Something similar should be provided in the Phoenix Park.  We should not have areas all over the park torn up by horses.  This would be avoided if a special track was provided.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to national monuments.  In Swords, where I live, we have a magnificent old castle.  A very hard-working organisation there, the Swords Progressive Preservation Society, collected a sum of money and lodged it with the Department with a view to having some preservation work carried out on this castle.  It will take quite a lot of work but I have no doubt, with the goodwill that exists in the area, that a lot of voluntary work will be put into it.  I would like to see some examination made of this castle so that it can be restored.</P>
    <P>We have Martello Towers right along the coast line of County Dublin. They have been there since the Napoleonic wars.  I would like to see them preserved.  I am always afraid that somebody will buy one, knock it down and that some development work will take place on the site.  I should like to see some importance and significance being given to them by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>In various sections of this Estimate there are references to different Government buildings with different staff accommodation, and so on.  This brings me back to the question of the purchase as distinct from leasing of these buildings.  After the general election when the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor took office, in his first speech he referred to the goal of purchasing office blocks as distinct from leasing them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very wise goal at which we should aim. Buildings used by the civil service should be Government-owned rather than privately-owned and rented.  We should aim at the construction of our own office blocks for the public service. I am sorry that not enough emphasis is put on this by the Government. <Col N="872" /> I hope in the future this programme will be undertaken.</P>
      <P>I am also glad to see extra effort is being put into the development of the Shannon waterway this year.  This is a great national amenity.  There is no such amenity in the whole of Europe. We must emphasise our role as a pollution free haven within the European Community and try to attract tourists to this potential haven of a pollution free environment.  We are not fully free from pollution and that should be our aim.  One of our great amenities is the River Shannon.  I should like to see more work being done by the Office of Public Works to improve the facilities for boating and for leisure craft generally on the Shannon.</P>
      <P>Having spoken about individual items I should like to refer to the role of the Office of Public Works generally at this time of national crisis, with unemployment running at roughly 120,000 and with the class of 1976 leaving secondary school in June with no jobs to go to.  More so than any other Government Department, the Office of Public Works have a great potential for providing jobs.  I should like to see this role expanded. Last year when I spoke on the Estimate on 30th May, I referred to this potential for job creation within the Office of Public Works.  I suggested that we could set up a board called &ldquo;Amenity Ireland&rdquo;, or something like that, which would undertake local amenity improvements.  It need not necessarily clash with the county council local improvements schemes but could carry out high quality work on parks or play areas and provide permanent employment.  The training facilities of AnCO could be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could provide permanent employment for people who are at present receiving unemployment benefit and who are trying to get jobs.  These people would have a feeling of achievement and of responsibility by having a job, and, at the same time, they would be doing something of benefit to the country generally, and to their own community.  This idea has been working quite successfully in Northern Ireland. There is no reason why it could not <Col N="873" /> be carried out in the Republic in a revised and improved form.  In the Six Counties it is called &ldquo;Enterprise Ulster&rdquo;.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to examine what is being done there, and consider whether something similar could be set up here.  I referred to coast erosion, the scandal of the paltry £65,000 in the Estimate and the figure of £175,000 for County Dublin at 1976 prices.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to speed up the extension of Skerries Harbour, the provision of a slipway, the dredging and improvement of the harbour wall in Balbriggan Harbour and also to proceed with all haste with the construction of the proposed Garda station in Swords.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>A short time ago there was a great deal of public reference to the fact that the Government were allowing the free importation of foreign articles which we could buy at home. A number of questions were raised about the manner in which various organisations and firms were permitted to go outside the country to make purchases which could have been made at home.  Arising from that my attention was drawn to the fact that the Parliamentary Secretaries' diningroom had been re-papered.  That would be the description given it but I gather it is a far more expensive and elaborate form of decoration than could be described as &ldquo;re-papering&rdquo;.  Perhaps the way the Parliamentary Secretary described the matter is more appropriate &mdash;refurbished.  The refurbishing of the Parliamentary Secretaries' diningroom in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I expected that from the Parliamentary Secretary because that was exactly the answer he gave me on another occasion in this House.  I would draw the attention of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to a document circulated by the Ceann Comhairle's <Col N="874" /> Office.  As Whip of the Opposition Party I would be the last man in this House to question anything that issues <i>ex cathedra</i> from the Ceann Comhairle's office.  I have before me a document dated 21st October, 1975, which is the most recent document for use within the Oireachtas buildings of the official telephone numbers of various extensions within the House.  I did not want to take up the Parliamentary Secretary on the Adjournment debate on this issue for so misleading the House on a previous occasion.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary did not tell us in his previous reply from where he had got his information.  Now we learn it was from the Restaurant Committee. As far as a committee of the House dealing with its functions is concerned, I would feel that it would be the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that would be the one to which to refer such a question, rather than the Restaurant Committee that has to do with the extraction of additional moneys from us weekly because the cost of living continues to rise; fair dues to the Restaurant Committee of which my colleague, Deputy Moore, is an honoured member.  I feel they are actually keeping ahead of the cost of living with their increased charges.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with me to some extent.  I would draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to page 8 of the official document issued by the Ceann Comhairle giving the numbers of various telephone extensions within this House.  In that document it is mentioned that the telephone extension for the Parliamentary Secretaries' diningroom is 312.  There is no reference in that document to a distinguished strangers' diningroom.</P>

      <P>I took the opportunity, having been invited by the Ceann Comhairle, to go into the Parliamentary Secretaries' diningroom. From the time it was opened it has been recognised as the Parliamentary Secretaries' diningroom.  There is special provision for Parliamentary Secretaries within this House.  I know that if a Minister wants to bring in his wife or members of his family he has the entitlement of bringing them into what is known here as the Parliamentary Secretaries' diningroom. We do know that a Minister cannot take his guests into his room, as such; that is confined to members of the Cabinet.  It is agreed that a distinguished visitor can be taken into the Parliamentary Secretaries' diningroom but it was news to me that it had been rechristened the Distinguished Strangers' diningroom and that it was distinctly the privilege of the Ceann Comhairle to invite people into it.</P>

      <P>I presume this is not the proper place to go into this but I <Col N="876" /> could well imagine that if every Deputy of this House insisted upon dining in the Parliamentary Secretaries' diningroom it would create some confusion.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, in his effort to defend himself at this stage, against the misstatement he made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should be careful.  He is not a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and he is at present encroaching on that domain. I went through that document to see if I could find a heading &ldquo;Distinguished Guests' diningroom&rdquo;. But that is not what I really want to talk about.  At a time when we have a committee created by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to encourage everybody within the country to buy Irish&mdash;spending sizeable amounts on advertising, linked up with industrialists under the guaranteed Irish campaign&mdash;for the Parliamentary Secretary to have allowed himself to turn his back on such firms as Kildare Wallpapers and others to go for some type of ornate wall decoration is not good enough. As the Parliamentary Secretary said, I have been in that room once at the invitation of the Ceann Comhairle, approximately a week ago, to meet a distinguished Scottish Nationalist Member of Parliament for Britain.  I took time during my visit to look at the wallpaper.  I am not saying that the wallpaper there previously was any great shakes.  But I am saying I would be very surprised if Kildare Wallpapers could not have presented a more pleasant sight.  The whole effect is dreary and drab.  In its own way it is necessary that that room and the ministerial diningroom be brighter.  Perhaps it is the psychology of the thing&mdash;if one has Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, men responsible for the administration of the country at present, living 50 per cent of their time in such drab surroundings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to make an honest-to-God contribution on the Board of Works Estimate and the Parliamentary Secretary comes up with red herrings.  I am sorry if I am getting under the Parliamentary Secretary's skin.  When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce I was never ashamed to draw attention to the fact that every man and woman in this country should do his or her bit in protecting and advancing Irish industry.  On one occasion I tried in vain to buy an Irish-made shirt in 14 drapery shops in Grafton Street. However, I had the satisfaction of finding out one month later that seven of those 14 shops stocked Irish-made shirts.  I am not a new convert to the belief that everyone, particularly the public representatives, and even more particularly Departments of State, should set an example in this area.  This is why I found fault with the Office of Public Works and the Parliamentary Secretary for having the foreign-made wallpaper in the Parliamentary Secretaries' dining-room&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy tell the House what it replaced?  It was a British manufactured vinyl and it was put up by his Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  The Parliamentary Secretary has put it on the record already.  The reply given by the Parliamentary Secretary was quite audacious.  He said he had been in touch with Kildare Wallpapers. When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce I was in contact with that firm; I know the battle they had for survival and the tremendous effort they put into building up the industry. The Parliamentary Secretary stated in this House that Kildare Wallpapers confirmed they could not supply paper similar to what is in the diningroom. The impression he created was that this firm had been asked to supply paper for the diningroom but had <Col N="878" /> said they could not supply a suitable type.  On that one visit I made to the Parliamentary Secretaries' diningroom &mdash;I am still sticking with the only official document that says that; if the Parliamentary Secretary wants to get it changed let him do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>His explanation was that it was necessary to get wallpaper of this particular kind in order to display properly the paintings from the National Gallery.  I am not the &ldquo;arty&rdquo; type and presumably what I say now will prove that.  When they were getting rid of the paper I wish they had got rid of the paintings also. Apparently the imported paper was to show off the paintings to greater advantage and I admit that the paintings needed that help.  Personally, I do not think the wallpaper is beautiful. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary, in consultation with Mr. White, might consider brightening up the wallpaper with some other paintings. Having spent so much money on the foreign wallpaper I am not suggesting that it be torn down but I suggest that it be covered up to the greatest extent possible.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see the Parliamentary Secretary here.  We have been trying all day to get someone to speak from the Government side.  I thought they had all gone home.  There was a great fuss some time ago about the importation of foreign-made furniture and it developed into a nine days' wonder.  It is all over now and people can import what they like.  We are in the EEC but there are still certain preventive measures that can be taken.  I hope that we still have some sense of nationalism.  I would not try to suggest that it is confined to one side of the House; both Houses should have the same view on this.  We should all be mindful of the need to buy Irish.  Nowadays we have gone one step further because we talk <Col N="879" /> about buying goods that state they are guaranteed Irish.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would have qualified for a prize of £200 per week if he had bought the paper from Kildare Wallpapers.  I do not think there are any restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the Parliamentary Secretary has me in the situation where he is accusing me of having a go at someone for whom all of us had a great deal of respect.  I think it would have been as well if the Parliamentary Secretary had not said that.  He should have accepted the responsibility because he made a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>My record will stand up to any investigation and I challenge the Parliamentary Secretary to investigate it.  A constituent of mine asked me to check on the matter of imported radiators in that Government building.  It is possible that the building is rented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope whoever was responsible for renting the building reminded the owners that the radiators should have been bought here. The Minister for Industry and Commerce should take an interest here.  It now appears that, on the instructions of the Parliamentary Secretary, in association with the chairman of the Joint Restaurant Committee, a new house telephone guide for the House <Col N="880" /> will be issued because the one in existance is misleading.</P>
      <P>On this Estimate it would be improper for any rural Deputy not to refer to arterial drainage.  It has been a great bone of contention in all constituencies and any rural Deputy who does not talk about drainage is not worth his salt.  The farmers in my constituency are seriously affected by the lack of such work on the Nore and the Barrow but the schemes for these rivers are well down on the priority list.  I should like to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that over the last few years Laois County Council have provided a limited amount of money from rates to clean out fallen trees and other obstructions in the Nore.  Deputies have spoken to the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessors, in Fine Gael and in Fianna Fáil, about this problem and one thing we hoped for as a result of our entry into the EEC was an injection of money for this work.</P>
      <P>Laois County Council spent £2,000 last year on this work and the landowners in the vicinity were full of praise for the council.  It was the first time that a county council were able to add money to the rates and be praised by farmers.  We all know that traditionally the left wing of a county council are expected to stack up rates so that men can be kept in employment while the conservative wing take the view that they should not add anything to the rates because they depend on the farming community for votes.  However, when this additional cost was put on the rates&mdash; no grant was sought from the Office of Public Works because this work was not part of their function&mdash;there was no objection from the farming community.  In my view we have reached a stop situation in regard to arterial drainage.  Is it not time that the situation was reviewed?  I am aware that if I have sold that idea nothing will be done for another five years while the review is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always been met with courtesy when I approached officials of the Office of Public Works and it is with my tongue in my cheek that I find fault with them on arterial drainage. There is a lot of talk of getting <Col N="881" /> away from the use of machinery and having the work done by men.  Laois County Council last year employed men to do the work.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he point out to his Minister that if he could get £1 million or £2 million which is being paid out in the form of unemployment benefit transferred to the Office of Public Works he would be able to prepare drainage schemes on which those who are being paid unemployment benefit could be employed. He could point out to his Minister that if this money was available the unemployed could be engaged in removing trees and other dirt from the rivers of the arterial drainage scheme list.  I do not recommend that the problem should be handed over to the think-tank of which the Minister for Education is chairman but it is worth considering. It should be possible to find a way to channel money from the Department of Social Welfare for use in cleaning up rivers.  I made my remark about buying Irish seriously and I was surprised at the Parliamentary Secretary's reaction.  I put forward my last suggestion seriously and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will consider it.</P>

      <P>When contributting to a debate on this Estimate it is difficult not to stray because the Office of Public Works act as agents. Last year on this Estimate I spoke of the need for improvements at the entry point to this House and I am glad some improvements were carried out.  However, some literature should be available for people who have to wait for a Deputy.  A few magazines would help a great deal.  There is plenty of literature available.  I am sure it would be possible to set up a stall where we could return some of the literature we receive.  As often as not one takes a cursory look at these unless there happens to be something of particular personal interest in them. As I say, there is difficulty in disposing of them.  It is a pity they should go to waste.  Perhaps some space could be provided where one could leave these magazines and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first impression of Leinster House is the most lasting one.  It cannot <Col N="882" /> be a really good impression if a visitor has to wait ten minutes or a quarter of an hour until a Minister or a Deputy is free.  I believe people should be encouraged to call on their public representatives.</P>
    <P>The brochure on Leinster House is to be commended.  How are sales going?  We received our complimentary copies.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would give us some indication as to sales.  I think, too, there could be more display cabinets around the building.  Many people are still unaware that this brochure is available.  This is quite an informative brochure and it makes an excellent souvenir.  For a long time all we had was the J.F. Kennedy address to the combined Houses of the Oireachtas.  People like to have something as a memento of their visit to Leinster House.  A bigger effort could be made to publicise this brochure.  From the point of view of price it is a bit dear where children are concerned and at this time of the year school children visit Leinster House in great numbers.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Industrial Development Authority that a new project which it announced for Tallaght at the end of last year will provide employment for 178 people at full production. A small number are already employed in this project.</P>
      <P>The new project by General Motors which commenced production in Tallaght in February, 1975, has an employment potential for about 230 more people.</P>
      <P>I also understand from the authority that two firms located elsewhere in Dublin are transferring operations to new plants in Tallaght. On full transfer of operations the new Tallaght plant of one of these firms will provide net additional employment opportunities for 43 people.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if any records are available or if any analysis has been made to show, under the following headings, why factories or industries have closed down: (a) loss of market due to reduced consumption and/or demand for products (b) loss of market as a result of reduced competitiveness due to cost or lack of quality of the product (c) inability to get raw material or increased cost of raw material and (d) factors affecting home consumption and exports; and the number of manufacturing units under each of these headings.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Industrial Development Authority that, in relation to closures which come to their notice, the authority's records contain general information as to the reasons for such <Col N="856" /> closures.  The Deputy will appreciate that many closures result from a variety of, rather than single, specific reasons and that it is difficult to say which is the overriding reason in many cases.  Accordingly, it is not possible to classify closures under the headings in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>According to the records of the Industrial Development Authority 78 firms came to their notice in 1975 as having closed.  In so far as it was possible for the authority to ascertain, 25 of these were due to a reduction in the market for the products; ten were as a result of import competition; 12 more arose from production difficulties and the remainder resulted from poor management or other reasons.  I should mention that eight of the 78 firms were subsequently reopened. Similar data in respect of earlier years would take some time to compile.</P>

      <P>I am not quite clear as to which investigations the Deputy is referring.  The Insurance Industry <Col N="857" /> Committee have already submitted an interim report on motor insurance and I have just received the committee's final report which deals with insurance in general and which I intend to publish before the end of April.  In the meantime it is under examination in my Department.</P>
      <P>One of the results of the interim report to which I have referred was the establishment of the Motor Premiums Advisory Committee whose recommendations led to a more realistic premium and loading structure and general availability of motor insurance. That committee are now involved in the task of collecting statistics which will lead ultimately to the determination of premium rates on a scientific basis and therefore to a premium structure which is fair to all policyholders and groups of policyholders. This task is likely to take a considerable time.</P>
