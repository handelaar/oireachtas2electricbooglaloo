      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Government initiated this Bill after receiving notification on the 12th of this month of a resolution which the Committee on Procedure and Privileges had adopted unanimously. The request from the committee was that legislation should be introduced so that Members of either House of the Oireachtas would have privilege in respect of any utterance made before the committee.  The Government believe that any doubt as to whether privilege extends to utterances by a Member of either House of the Oireachtas before a committee of either House or a joint committee should be removed and this will be done by section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 is a section which gives powers to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges as well as other Committees established by either House to summon and examine witnesses and make provision for circumstances in which <i>inter alia</i> a witness may obstruct the work of the committee by refusing to attend or by refusing to answer questions to which the committee may legally require an <Col N="311" /> answer.  Deputies will recall that this power was given by the unanimous agreement of both Houses to the Committee of Public Accounts by the Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann (Privilege and Procedure) Act, 1970.  Portion of that Act was later found, by the Supreme Court, to be unconstitutional.  The portions of the section which were found to be valid have been reproduced in this Bill; the invalid portion has not been reproduced and instead of a section on lines which the Supreme Court indicated would be constitutionally valid have been inserted.</P>
    <P>The Government assumed that the Opposition would not object to the proposals in section 3 as they had, whilst in Government, introduced similar proposals in 1970 in respect of the Committee of Public Accounts.  However, as opposition to the inclusion of this section has been raised the Government is prepared to amend the Bill by deleting section 3 so that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges can proceed with its work without delay.</P>
    <P>I should, however, make clear that in the Government's view the powers contained in section 3 are necessary and desirable ones and it is hoped that the opposition to the section arises merely from its inclusion in the present Bill and not as a matter of principle. As it is highly desirable that questions concerning the privilege of Members of the House are matters on which, if at all possible, agreement from all Deputies should be forthcoming, I feel that it would be appropriate if the Leader of the Opposition and myself were, initially, to discuss such matters.  I hope it will be possible to reach agreement on such matters as the powers the committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas should have in relation to witnesses they might wish to call before them, what powers tribunals of inquiry established by the Houses of the Oireachtas might have and the rights and obligations of Members of the Oireachtas in relation to such tribunals as well as how best to deal with the problem of breaches of the Houses' privileges.  It <Col N="312" /> would be my hope and the hope of my colleagues in the Government that agreement on such important matters could be reached in the interest of the proper working of our parliamentary institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Government have decided to delete section 3.  I do not at all accept that the reason put forward by the Government for its inclusion in the first instance was valid and I suggest that its inclusion in the 1970 Bill is not a valid comparison in the circumstances. On the contrary, I suggest it is rather naïve of the Taoiseach to suggest that, because there was such a section in that Act, we in the Opposition might agree to the inclusion of a similar section in this Bill.  I will explain briefly my reasons for this statement.  The 1970 Act was passed in the background of a series of incidents and the Committee of Public Accounts were requested to investigate the expenditure of moneys allocated for certain purposes in respect of which it was alleged the purposes were not fulfilled and the moneys were expended otherwise than for the purposes for which they were voted.  I do not have to go into the merits of that particular case because they have been thrashed out <i>ad nauseam</i> but, for the purpose of that investigation, if the Committee of Public Accounts were to investigate the particular matter adequately, then the powers given in section 3 of that Act were necessary. Otherwise, it was felt, the Committee of Public Accounts would not have been effective for that purpose.  I might also mention that that Act was passed for a specific purpose and it was an absolutely limited function.  I quote:</P>
      <P>In this Act &ldquo;the committee&rdquo; means the Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann while engaged in the performance of the functions assigned to it by order of Dáil Éireann made on the 1st day of December, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the section was included in the Bill not only for a specific purpose but with the specific limitation that as soon as it had investigated that <Col N="313" /> event or series of events, then its powers of sending for people and for persons and papers were at an end. Incidentally, I note there is a provision in section 4 of the Bill before the House repealing this Act, but I suggest that is not necessary because the purpose of the Act having been served, it has no other relevant function. That being so, I repeat that it is rather naive for the Taoiseach to suggest that, because a section similar to section 3 was included in that Act, we would have agreed to its inclusion in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to give another reason why I stress this naïvety on the part of the Taoiseach and the Government.  This Bill purports to extend the privilege that obtains in this House for Members of this House and of the Seanad to all committees of Oireachtas Éireann.  I think it is proper that, in so far as there was any doubt that such privilege did extend to these committees, it should have been removed. But to give all committees for all time the power to send for witnesses and to compel them to produce documents under penalty of prosecution and, if convicted on prosecution, under penalty of £300 fine and/or six months imprisonment would be giving to committees of this House judicial status that is completely unwarranted, remembering, too, as I have indicated, that there is no limitation as to time or as to the type of committee on which these powers would be bestowed.</P>
    <P>I shall give reasons why I think it is only proper that this power should not be given to such a committee. First, even though Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas may have legal training, it must be assumed that they are not expected to have such legal training and, therefore, could not be expected to exercise functions properly exercised by members of a court with the necessary legal background they are required to have before they can be appointed as members of any court in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Secondly&mdash;and this I put forward without any suggestion that what I say is judicially or juridically correct&mdash; a witness appearing before a court is given privilege for the evidence he <Col N="314" /> gives before that court, but if he makes wild allegations to the point that these allegations are absolutely untrue and untrue to his knowledge, and to the extent that they could be construed as perjury, then he may be prosecuted by that court.  But consider a situation in which an allegation is made here in the House, investigated by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, by his own individual act, summons a witness to attend a hearing of a particular matter and that witness makes outrageous charges in respect of that matter or in respect of any other matter within or outside the jurisdiction of the House. I do not know what power the committee has or would have of dealing with such a person who, having made these outrageous charges would, perhaps, be completely immune.</P>
    <P>As I said, a court would have power to have the person in question prosecuted for perjury, but as far as I can see, section 3 (2)&mdash;and I am only dwelling upon it because the Taoiseach referred to it at such length&mdash; gives a witness before the committee and a person sending a document to the committee the same immunities and privileges as if he were a witness before the High Court, but it does not purport to subject that witness to the same penalies as a witness before the High Court.  I submit that on that score alone we have a perfectly valid objection to the inclusion of section 3.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said he might discuss with me the inclusion in a subsequent Bill or Act of the provisions now being omitted from section 3.  If he wants to consult with me on that, he will have to bring forward very cogent reasons to counter those I have put forward in the House this morning before I would even consider presenting any such proposal to my party.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the provisions in sections 1 and 2 of the Bill with whatever new section might be necessary as a consequence of the deletion of sections 3 and 4.  I am rather surprised at the urgency with which the Minister has introduced the Bill itself. I know the immediate purpose is to empower the Committee on Procedure <Col N="315" /> and Privileges to investigate the allegations made by Deputy Crowley here in this House some weeks ago and in the course of this investigation to give Deputies or any other Members of the Oireachtas the immunities they would enjoy if they made statements here in the House. Statements and allegations of a political nature in the House are usually not the subject matter of such investigations and charges of being a communist are usually and have for many years been regarded as charges of a political nature.  I remember a time when the former colleagues or predecessors of Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring in a general way to charges of a political nature, and I presume I may proceed on that basis without referring to the particular one which will now be the subject matter of the investigation of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It has been the precedent down through the years in this House that charges of a political nature were not regarded as in breach of privilege that a Deputy enjoys in this House. I suggest that on this occasion we are discussing a Bill obviously to deal as a matter of urgency with a charge that was made last week.  I will conclude by saying that I regard that charge as no more than a political charge.  Whatever the person against <Col N="316" /> whom the charge was made thought of it, I think it is a matter that ought not to have been submitted to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it a little difficult to follow Deputy Lynch because he appears to want to have it both ways, although I suppose that is understandable.  The problem of the committees of the House not being given the same privilege as the House arose, I think, first in the investigation to which the Leader of the Opposition referred and which was undertaken by the Committee of Public Accounts in 1970.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Constitution guarantees to Members of either House of the Oireachtas absolute privilege.  It was found in 1970 during the investigation of the matters referred to the Committee of Public Accounts that there was a doubt whether privilege given by the Constitution to utterances in either House was extended to the committees of either House.  As a result, the Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann (Privilege and Procedure) Act, 1970, was introduced and passed. Subsequently, the Committee of Public Accounts investigated the matter in the light of the terms of that Act in respect of the portion of it which was found valid by the Supreme Court. This particular measure has been introduced arising out of allegations made in this House recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition makes the point that political charges are not normally the subject of investigation or are taken as points made from time to time in the course of debates.  That may be true but what was true up to recently was that if a Deputy made a personal explanation it was accepted.  That explanation was not accepted in the case which warranted the introduction of this Bill. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges met and made a recommendation. It is not correct to say, as the Leader of the Opposition said, that this proposed inclusion of section 3 to which he objects, but which was a replica of similar provisions in the 1970 Act, would either convict or <Col N="317" /> penalise a Member of the House or a person summoned before it.</P>
    <P>If a person was so summoned, the committee would not be exercising judicial functions.  The failure of a person to answer would then be a matter for the court.  It would then be a matter for the court to apply the penalty.  If there is opposition to this section, we do not want to proceed with it because it is essential that the recommendation of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should be implemented without delay. As was experienced recently, if a witness before a Dáil committee, who is not a Member of either House, is not given the protection which it is designed to give here, it is obvious that no committee could secure his attendance, or, if it was secured, it could not be secured with the immunity which is essential if a committee of this kind is to examine and decide an issue before it.  The House is familiar with a case where recently persons outside the House were named.  While a Member of either House is protected in respect of utterances within the House, unless protection is given to outsiders, it is obvious that they cannot be expected to attend before committees of this kind.</P>
    <P>On section 4, again I cannot follow the reasoning of the Leader of the Opposition.  The only reason we suggested it be repealed was that that Act was passed to deal with a specific matter, the matter having been examined by the Committee of Public Accounts.  If there is any objection to repealing this Act, there is no reason why it would not be left on the statute book, but as far as the particular inquiry which was undertaken is concerned, it is completed and the Act is spent.  It is important to realise that the doubts which exist about the extent to which committees, which have been seen now to exist in at least two cases, as well as the possible defects and limitations in the Tribunal of Inquiries Evidence Act, might well be the subject of investigation.  It is desirable for Deputies on all sides that the privileges of Parliament should be not merely adequate to ensure that they <Col N="318" /> are protected, but when matters have to be investigated that they can be investigated without delay or without being held up due to technical procedural problems of a character such as that which has come to light both in the 1970 investigations by the Committee of Public Accounts and under the recent cases which have been before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>As I said, so far as the Government are concerned we are prepared to agree to the deletion of the section which is objected to although I should repeat it is similar to that which is included in the earlier legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>That section 3 be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this section there is one point I should like to raise.  The Taoiseach seems to dismiss much of the argument I made in favour of its deletion.  He failed, for instance, to refer to the point I made in respect of a witness summoned before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or any other committee and who might make wild, false and defamatory allegations in respect of a Member of the House or of a member of the public, that he could make these allegations with immunity so far as privilege is concerned. The committee would be exercising a judicial function but I suggested that their judicial functions do not extend so far as would the functions of a court in dealing with a witness who knew he was making false allegations, who knew he was telling untruths in the witness box under oath.  That would be a serious aspect of section 3 if this section were to be passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I wish to make in relation to this section is that a summons to a person who was <Col N="320" /> regarded as necessary for the purpose of giving evidence before this committee could be signed by one member of the committee.  With due respect, a member of that committee could act from various motivations, political or otherwise.  In effect he would be having the same powers of <i>subpoena</i> that a court of the land would have. Therefore, any member of the public could be required under <i>subpoena</i> to attend that committee and to give evidence or produce documents within his possession or procurement.  That is far too great a power to extend and entrust to a non-judicial person as any member of that committee must be since members of the Judiciary are not Members of the Houses.</P>
    <P>Another point which may not be very important or relevant but to which it is necessary to refer is the question of powers of conviction since the Taoiseach seemed to imply that I suggested that the committee had such powers.  I made no such suggestion but, by the signature of one of their members, the committee have powers to set in train such a process.  A person who, for perhaps, good and valid reasons was unwilling to produce either himself or documents within his possession or procurement could find himself before a criminal court on the signature of a political member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  That is too great a hazard to which to subject a member of the public.  If he examines what I have said, I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that section 3 has no place in the function or powers that we entrust to committees of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is much point in discussing the section since we are deleting it but I would point out that what was here was precisely the same as was contained in the 1970 Bill introduced by Deputy Lynch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said already that on that occasion the committee were investigating a particular matter with a limit on the powers entrusted to them in respect of their investigations. <Col N="321" /> As soon as the matter entrusted to them under a specific order of this House was investigated completely that provision had no further effect whereas the provision which was proposed here would continue to empower a member of the committee to summon a person to produce himself or documents within his possession to a committee.  This provision would be there for all time and for all committees.  Therefore, there is a very marked distinction between the provision in this Bill and the similar provision introduced for a specific purpose in the 1970 Act.</P>

      <P>Without broadening this debate too much, I trust Deputy Lynch and his party in discussing this section which, as the Taoiseach says, does not deserve much debate since we are not enacting it, will not stake out positions for themselves which they may find it embarrassing to have to proceed on later, whether in Government or in Opposition. It seems to me that there is a very strong case for the provisions of section 3, perhaps not line by line but something like them, for committees of either House or of both Houses jointly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the validity of the distinction drawn by Deputy Lynch between what section 3 intended and what his Act of 1970 set out to do, the distinction <Col N="322" /> being that the latter was addressed not only to one committee but to one particular matter before that committee. However, I do not think it is something which the Deputy can rely too heavily on because it is as much as to say that the next time the Public Accounts Committee had something important to investigate, the Government of the day would have to come back to the Dáil and have passed another Bill of the same content.</P>
    <P>The status and functions of these committees are very unclear and every time a crisis or difficulty arises we all look a little foolish and a lot of time is wasted before we can discover exactly what are our entitlements.  And the matter would not necessarily be the type of crisis that arose in the stirring days of 1970 not might it necessarily be something similar to the sort of thing that Deputy Crowley mentioned. There is a great deal to be said for the committees having clearly defined powers, not necessarily word for word with section 3 but something on those lines.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Lynch's remark that the committees would be achieving something in the nature of judicial status by reason of section 3, although he made it clear later that this would not be so, he said he thought something approaching that status was being bestowed on them by reason of the <i>subpoena</i> power.  I put it to Deputy Lynch that very many offences under our law are constituted by failure to observe non-judicial instructions, instructions coming from various administrative people.  There are all kinds of offences which are triable resulting from failure to observe directions or instructions by, for instance, planning authorities, health inspectors, the Garda and so on, and many of which have been in existence for 70 years or more.  Therefore, I see nothing radical or revolutionary in failure to observe an injunction represented by a <i>subpoena</i> from a committee of this House as being something which should not be regarded as an offence and which, because the offence is made up of a procedure initiated by a non-judicial act, the whole process should <Col N="323" /> be suspect.  I say that with no heat whatever.</P>
    <P>I put it to Deputy Lynch that if, in the case of the Minister for Local Government which was under examination last year, one of the people involved&mdash; there were people who voluntarily made information available to the committee so anxious were they to assist in the rebuttal of the slurs cast on the Minister&mdash;for reasons of his own, be it for instance anxiety not to become involved in the affair, intimidation or pressure put on him by another party, had not come forward where would the committee have been?  What would have been the position of the committee or the Tribunal if one of the bank managers or the builders involved had not come forward voluntarily with statements which cleared the Minister completely?  The Minister for Local Government would still be politically in hock and the two gentlemen on the far side would still be in the situation of conditional heroes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I might suggest that <i>res judicata</i> ought not to be discussed here as well as matters <i>sub judice.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not pursue the matter beyond summarising that point, that the last occasion on which the Committee on Procedure and Privileges met to discuss an allegation against a Member of the House they were able to reach a conclusion very simply because the information necessary for its conclusion was volunteered.  Had it not been volunteered and had a power such as was proposed by the section, which is now to be withdrawn, not been available to the committee I cannot see how that committee could have vindicated the Minister.  I do not see how it could have been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the Taoiseach's suggestion and I hope that Deputy Lynch and his party will meet us half way on this, that we ought to look in a non-contentious atmosphere and not in the setting of a particular row, at the powers of these committees and see what they need.  We should not give them any more than they need but give them at least what they need so that the committees, the <Col N="324" /> Houses of the Oireachtas and the public can know their functions and their powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to be so long on this debate but as long as there are interventions, the content of which I feel obliged to answer, I am afraid the debate will be prolonged.  The Parliamentary Secretary failed completely to deal with the point I made about witness having rights of privilege for what they say but not perhaps having to undergo penalties for committing perjury or something akin to perjury.  It is a very valid point that if a member of the public comes before that committee under <i>subpoena</i> and commits perjury or at least, as I said, makes charges which he knows to be unfounded or makes statements which he knows to be untrue, then as far as I can see under the section as it stands he is completely immune just as a Member of the House would be.  It is wrong to extend that privilege to a member of the public.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the very act of issuing a <i>subpoena</i> is a judicial act.  A <i>sub-poena</i> is a witness summons.  Failure to comply with that summons is an offence for which a penalty is provided which can be enforced only by a court.  Therefore, the person, on whom the summons is served is already by virtue of that summons being served, signed by a member of the committee, liable to a court penalty.  I do not see what distinction there is between that function and a judicial function exercised by the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is amusing to come back to the Taoiseach's charge against us of trying to have it both ways but the Government certainly had it both ways in the case referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary.  He referred to the fact that if certain witnesses did not come forward before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, in respect of the charges made against the Minister for Local Government, the Minister's character could not have been cleared.  The fact is that the witnesses came and there is nothing in the Bill as it stands now to prevent any witnesses coming.  There is no reason why a witness who wants to <Col N="325" /> tell the truth should not come and be prepared to stand over the truth without the cloak of privilege.  As it happened certain witnesses came forward before that committee and the Minister's name was cleared but that did not satisfy the Government.  They went as far as a judicial tribunal as well.  May I suggest, if matters are that serious the proper place for their investigation is before a judicial tribunal and not before an unqualified committee of this House?  These are the points I have to make in reply to Deputy Kelly's intervention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan) Patrick S. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £72,960,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1976, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain services administered by that Office; for the pay and expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for Defence for the financial year 1976 is a net sum of £72,960,000.  It contains provision for an average strength of 1,341 officers, 171 cadets and 13,500 men. The 1975 Estimate amounted to £59,322,000 including a Supplementary Estimate of £10,376,000, and was based on an average strength of 1,211 officers, 146 cadets and 11,000 men.  The current strength of the permanent Defence Force stands at its highest level for over 25 years&mdash;over 13,800 people.</P>
      <P>The pay provisions in the Estimate account for £55,336,000.  The terms of the national pay agreements have been applied to all ranks and the current pay rates for men range from £35.37 a week plus food and accommodation for an unmarried recruit to £76.70 a week for a married Sergeant-Major.  Children's allowances are payable also.  There are allowances for Border duty and special security duties in locations other than Border areas.  These rates should make the Army an attractive prospect for young men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of non-commissioned officers and privates of the permanent Defence Force are attending courses <Col N="327" /> which will enable them to sit for the Department of Education day group certificate and the leaving certificate examinations.  Others who have registered as apprentices in the trades of fitter, motor mechanic, sheet metal worker, bricklayer, painter, decorator and plasterer, are following courses at a number of AnCo centres.  Some of these apprentices are attending either full-time off-the-job training courses or day release courses.  During the past year over 100 men were involved in these courses.</P>
    <P>Due to the abnormal demands of the present security situation I regret that it has not been found possible to release for these courses as many men as we would like.  Deputies may rest assured, however, that no effort is being spared to improve the general levels of education and technical training of the soldiers in order to provide them with the knowledge and skills which are so vital to a modern army and which will also be of help to them in obtaining suitable civilian employment when their term of service has ended.</P>
    <P>Members of the permanent Defence Force who attend third level courses of education in their own time are refunded the cost of tuition and fees; 87 cadets were appointed from competitions held during the year for the Army, Air Corps, and Naval Service. There are at present 137 cadets in training, 80 of whom will be commissioned during the year; 107 officers and cadets are pursuing degree courses at University College, Galway; 22 non-commissioned officers are completing a potential officers' course and will be commissioned later this year; 105 apprenticeships were awarded in the Army and Air Corps during 1975.</P>
    <P>Games and physical training have a special place in Army life.  Sports competitions are held at unit and command level and, where possible, matches are arranged with representative sides such as the Garda, universities and so on.  An Army cross-country team took part in an international competition in Algiers in 1975 and a team was also sent to Tunis this <Col N="328" /> year for a similar competition.  All-Army gymnastic competitions are held annually and adventure training clubs have been established in all commands. Adventure training includes activities such as sub-aqua swimming, mountaineering, boating, sailing and canoeing. Swimming baths are hired regularly and swimming instruction is included in the recruit training syllabus.</P>
    <P>Recent years have seen an increasing involvement of the Defence Forces in the sphere of internal security.  In discharge of these duties the permanent Defence Force have been greatly helped by members of the First Line Reserve on full-time service and also by An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, whose members performed week-end duties and other forms of part-time service.  I would like to express my admiration for the dedicated manner in which all branches of the Defence Forces and all ranks have carried out their demanding tasks during the past year.  They have earned the gratitude and warm appreciation of the Government.  I feel sure that Deputies will also wish to be associated with this tribute.</P>
    <P>The involvement of the Defence Forces in the role of assistance to the Garda Síochána is a grim reminder of the continuing gravity of the situation. Out of this involvement a close and harmonious liaison has been forged between the two forces at all levels.  It is an assurance to law-abiding citizens that the rule of law shall prevail.</P>
    <P>The extent of the Army's contribution towards security may be gauged from the following outline of activities during the 12 months ended on 31st December, 1975:</P>
    <P>(a)  About 5,500 military parties were supplied for checkpoint duties and helped gardaí to set up 10,000 joint checkpoints;</P>
    <P>(b)  over 5,400 patrols were sent out into the road network along the Border.  These patrols are equipped with radio and can be directed to the scene of a Border incident by radio.  The patrols have instructions to detain any persons found carrying arms illegally;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> (c)  escorts for explosives and blasting operations were provided on 1,000 occasions;</P>
    <P>(d)  almost 300 requests for bomb disposal teams were dealt with.</P>
    <P>In addition, several vital non-military installations are under permanent military guard and others are protected by military patrols.  There are also activities arising out of the guarding and escorting of civilian prisoners and the conduct of searches for arms, ammunition and explosives. While the list of duties set out above is formidable, it is by no means exhaustive. These duties tax very considerably the manpower of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Every citizen has a basic obligation to uphold law and order.  It is not enough to leave the discharge of this fundamental responsibility to the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.  These are the democratically constituted forces of law and order but if they are to be successful in their task they need and are entitled to get the full support and co-operation of every right-minded citizen. Until violence is ended the Defence Forces will continue to provide full support for the Garda in the maintenance of law and order and in the preservation of the democratic fabric of the State.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service continue to perform their special role of fishery protection. In 1975 one of the minesweepers went on a training cruise to France.  There was a net strength increase of 75 during 1975 and the present strength of the Naval Service is at its highest for many years.  The numbers will be further increased when the new vessel, to which I will refers presently, is brought into commission in 1977.</P>
    <P>As I announced last year, the Government had to withdraw the Irish contingent serving with the United Nations in the Middle East.  At the time of their withdrawal, it was made clear to the Secretary-General of the United Nations that the Government would be happy, when the present needs had passed, again to send an Irish contingent to the Middle East <Col N="330" /> and that we regarded our commitment to the United Nations as a continuing one.</P>
    <P>There are still 21 officers attached as observers to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in Palestine.  Deputies may be interested to know that two of these officers occupy senior posts in the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission.  In addition, one officer and four non-commissioned personnel are serving in staff appointments with the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus.</P>
    <P>As regards recoupment of expenses arising out of our commitments to the United Nations, the overall position in regard to the Cyprus operation is that out of claims totalling £4.8 million we have received payment of £3.62 million.  This leaves a sum of £.56 million outstanding.</P>
    <P>In the case of the contingents which served with the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East payments amounting to £427,000 on foot of pay and allowances have been received in accordance with the special financial arrangements covering this force.  These arrangements, which were worked out by the United Nations in consultation with the troop-contributing countries, are based on a flat payment per man per month and have proved more favourable to us than the reimbursement arrangements which applied to previous United Nations operations. In addition, claims are being submitted in respect of military stores and equipment.</P>
    <P>The considerable increase in the financial provisions for stores and equipment in recent years is proof of the Government's intention to provide a well-equipped mobile Army.  Further substantial purchases are provided for in the present Estimate.  The transport position has been improved considerably through a phased programme of new purchases.  This year provision is made for the supply of additional trucks, saloon cars, landrovers and various other vehicles.</P>
    <P>In the past year four Fouga Magister aircraft were delivered and a further two are expected later this year.  These are jet trainer aircraft in replacement of the Vampire jets <Col N="331" /> which have now reached the end of the road.  Provision is also included for an initial payment towards the purchase of basic training aircraft to replace the old Chipmunks and Provosts.</P>
    <P>A contract has been placed with Cork Dockyard for the construction of a second fishery protection vessel, delivery of which is expected towards the end of 1977.  The Estimate includes provision for payments on foot of this contract.</P>
    <P>A provision of £156,000 has been made for the Equitation School&mdash; subhead N&mdash;including £100,000 for the purchase of horses.  Last year four horses were purchased at a cost of £41,500.  During 1975, Army riders and horses competed in international shows at Dublin, Brussels, Paris, Geneva, Rome, Hickstead and Wembley.  Two of our riders won the pairs competition at the international show in Brussels.  In addition 39 horse shows and gymkhanas were attended.  The total prize money won in 1975 was about £5,600.</P>
    <P>The helicopter service, as well as playing an important role in security operations, has provided its customary rescue, ambulance and other services. In search and rescue 57 missions were flown last year and 66 ambulance missions were completed.</P>
    <P>The building programme provision is £1,887,000 and, as usual, priority is being given to requirements in Border areas.  The new accommodation at Monaghan is expected to be ready in the autumn.  A new billet block was opened in Dundalk last year and further improvements are being planned at that post.  Priority is being given to the improvement of accommodation and facilities at Finner Camp.  Provision has been included for the commencement of a scheme of 50 houses for married soldiers at the Curragh Training Camp.  It is planned to improve living conditions at a number of other posts.  Among the works completed or substantially completed during 1975 were a new dining-hall and cookhouse and a new canteen at the Curragh; a new dining-hall and cookhouse at <Col N="332" /> Columb Barracks, Mullingar; improvements to the dining-hall and cookhouse at McKee Barracks; a new officers' mess at Connolly Barracks, Longford; the modernisation of four billet blocks at the Curragh and a new FCA headquarters building in Navan.</P>
    <P>Miscellaneous works already begun or planned to commence during the year include an extension to the dining-hall and cookhouse at Cathal Brugha Barracks, improvements to the cavalry workshops at the Curragh and a new apprentice school building at Casement Aerodrome.  A new FCA headquarters building at Westport is nearing completion.</P>
    <P>Last year I referred to the proposal to evacuate Cathal Brugha Barracks and to replace it by new barracks outside Dublin.  In reply to a question in the House on 10th February last, I indicated that the matter was being studied by an inter-departmental committee, that the financial and service implications were considerable and that early developments were not expected.</P>
    <P>Since the subject was first mooted there has been a large increase in the intake of recruits and all available accommodation in the Dublin area is urgently needed to assist in housing the additional numbers.  Consequently, because of military exigencies, Cathal Brugha Barracks will continue to be used for some time to come.</P>
    <P>The electricity supply to the barracks has been unsatisfactory for some years past.  Arrangements were made with the Electricity Supply Board to have the married quarters connected directly to the board's network, thus reducing the load on the supply to the barracks proper, and to instal a new transformer for the supply to the barracks. The other ranks' married quarters have now been connected directly to the board's network and the officers' married quarters will be linked up within the next two weeks.  Work on the provision of the supply to the barracks proper is expected to be completed at an early date.</P>
    <P>The Yacht <i>Creidne</i>, which was purchased last year to enable sail training <Col N="333" /> to be continued pending the construction of the proposed new vessel <i>Brendan</i>, carried out a full programme of training cruises during the 1975 sailing season.  <i>Creidne</i> spent a total of 137 days on cruises covering a distance of nearly 5,000 miles.  In all over 400 persons availed of the training cruises.</P>
    <P>This year is a special one in the realm of sail training with international transatlantic races which will involve a fleet of tall ships crossing the Atlantic to the United States by way of the Canaries and Bermuda. These races are being organised to coincide with the American Bicentennial Commemoration and the <i>piece de resistance</i> will be the parade of sailing ships which will take place in New York Harbour on American Independence Day on 4th July.  Under the guidance of some very experienced members of the Sail Training Committee <i>Creidne</i> has been carefully and thoroughly prepared over the winter months for her participation in the races.  We have every confidence that she will acquit herself well in her class.</P>
    <P>The <i>Creidne</i> will leave Dún Laoghaire on 15th April next for Plymouth from which port the race is scheduled to start on 2nd May.</P>
    <P>Over 50 persons in all will be involved as crew members on <i>Creidne</i> from the time she leaves Dún Laoghaire until her return to Galway in late August.  More than half of this number will be young people under 25 years of age.</P>
    <P>A sum of £405,000 has been provided for Civil Defence&mdash;subhead G. For the expenditure of this modest sum, we have available a voluntary organisation which provides an invaluable service to the community.  £285,000 of the provision represents the cost of paying grants to local authorities at the level of 70 per cent of their outlay on Civil Defence functional administration, on the recruitment and training of volunteers and on the storage, servicing and maintenance of equipment and so on.  Deputies will be aware of the key role which local authorities play in the operation of the Civil Defence service and I am glad to pay <Col N="334" /> tribute here to the officers of local councils and regional health boards for their work in Civil Defence in their areas.  The subhead also provides for the purchase of new Civil Defence uniforms and equipment and for the replacement of existing equipment.</P>
    <P>There are some 27,000 volunteers on the local authority rolls and while all who have been trained may not continue as active members, it is virtually certain that the services of the great majority would be available in an emergency.  Meanwhile, the active members provide a most valuable pool of trained personnel, capable of dealing with peace-time calamities such as fires, floods and so on, or assisting at the scene of bomb disasters such as those in Dundalk last December and, more recently, Castleblayney.  I am indebted to the Irish Red Cross Society, the Order of Malta and the St. John Ambulance Brigade for their valued co-operation with the Civil Defence organisation.</P>
    <P>Subhead BB provides for a grant-in-aid to the Irish Red Cross Society which includes an allocation for emergency relief.  I might mention here that during 1975 sums amounting to £12,775 were made available to the society to enable them to contribute to the relief of distress in Cyprus, Angola and the Lebanon.</P>
    <P>Not many years ago it was a commonplace for people to ask such questions as: Why have an Army at all?  What is the Army for?  These questions are not asked any more because in the turbulence of our times there has been a growing sense of gratitude on the part of our people that the security of the State is in good keeping.</P>
    <P>If today the emphasis in relation to the Army's function is on internal security and aid of the civil power, that is not to say that the Army are simply an auxiliary police force.  It must never be forgotten that the Army are, in the nature of things, an armed force maintained by the Government for the essential purpose of defending the State.  Because of that essential purpose it follows that the Army's numbers must be kept at an adequate level, <Col N="335" /> that they must be properly equipped and that there are proper service conditions for their personnel.  All this means expenditure but it is part of the investment we must make for the sake of the country's orderly progress and development.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Army Pensions Estimate which is also before the House.  This is for a net sum of £12,305,000 for the year ending 31st December, 1976.  The net figure for the year ended 31st December, 1975, was £10,542,000, including a Supplementary Estimate of £205,000.</P>
    <P>Included in the £12,305,000 for the present year is a sum of £608,000 to cover the increases in the pensions and allowances which will become payable from the 1st July, 1976, in accordance with the principle of maintaining parity in public service pensions.</P>
    <P>There are increases in the numbers of pensions, allowances and gratuities payable under subhead B, wound and disability pensions and gratuities; subhead C, widows' allowances, and subhead E, pensions and gratuities for retired members of the permanent Defence Force and in the number of funeral grants payable under subhead N in respect of deceased recipients of special allowances and military service pensions and a small number of deceased disablement pensioners.</P>
    <P>Under subhead C there are about 4,500 widows of military service pensioners in receipt of allowances equal to one-half of their deceased husbands' pensions at current rates and subject to a minimum rate of £113.40 per annum.  The average rate of allowance is £171 per annum.</P>
    <P>The number of special allowances payable under subhead H continues to show a downward trend, reflecting the excess of deaths over new awards.  At present there are about 9,500 allowances being paid and the average allowance works out at £250 per annum.</P>
    <P>I commend both Estimates to the favourable consideration of the House. If the Deputies require more information on any points, I shall be glad to give it when replying to the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the Estimate introduced by the Minister. The people we are dealing with here lay their lives on the line and their service cannot be measured in terms of pounds and shillings.  The Minister has given various figures with regard to payments but that does not seem a lot.  I think at times that they are inadequately paid.  The people concerned cannot be compared with any others in the country. They are in the position where they must put their lives on the line and death is regarded as an occupational hazard.  During the years the personnel in the Defence Forces have shown unquestionable loyalty, whether to protect the liberty so dearly won or to ensure the right of people to live without fear or intimidation. As the Minister indicated, it is the duty of every citizen to assist members of the Defence Forces and the security forces in every way possible.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, there are many aspects that must be questioned and many problems that must be debated to ensure that the Defence Forces adjust to meet the ever-changing times and problems.  We are a small country with limited finances and we must ensure that such finances are used to the best value.</P>
      <P>In the last 12 months I have had the opportunity of visiting military posts in Galway, Cork, Athlone, the Curragh, Collins Barracks, Dublin, Dundalk and Cavan and I have observed the presence of the military forces in the Border area.  I have also visited the Naval Service at Haulbowline, the Air Corps and the Equitation School.  I have a fair insight into the problems that exist throughout the Defence Forces.  I should like to pay a special tribute to all the people who assisted in the organisation of my tour.  I was received with courtesy and got every assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me from my tour that there has been no basic change in military thinking since the forties when I was serving.  It is necessary to ensure that evaluation studies be of a continuing nature, not just from one emergency to another.  This is very obvious to anybody who discusses <Col N="337" /> the situation with those on the ground.  There has been no basic change, but we must adopt ourselves to new tactics and techniques.  It was the tendency of armies in the past to take the concluding tactics of one war as the primary tactics of the next, as seen with other armies in Dunkirk and elsewhere, but there is a need for radical change in thinking.</P>
    <P>In 1922 we took over a colonial system and that has been maintained, with the exception of the changes in the 1940s, ever since.  I am aware that many officers went abroad on courses but we have not seen any radical change in organisation or restructuring as a result.  As one travels through the country one can see the unsatisfactory situation in relation to some of the military posts. There is unsatisfactory accommodation and I have no doubt that TDs or civil servants would not live in some of the accommodation military personnel who put their lives on the line are obliged to live in.  Civil service standards can be seen in Castlebar or Teach Furbo which will be taken over or the new Setanta building.  That is the type of accommodation civil servants have but not so for military personnel.</P>
    <P>Recently I visited Cavan military barracks and, as the military personnel know, and the Minister knows, if one put a wheelbarrow across the entry gate it would be impossible for the military inside to get out. This one inlet and no outlet situation that exists there, and in Dundalk, should have been considered some years ago.  It is of great importance in a Border area where the swift military movement of troops is necessary.  With the use of the existing military establishment in Cavan and Dundalk it is necessary to have troop-carrying helicopters to ensure that military personnel can at least get out of the barracks.  Any type of obstruction at present could prevent troop movement from certain military posts in the Border areas.</P>
    <P>The necessity to acquire troop-carrying helicopters should have become obvious to the military thinkers over the years to ensure the <Col N="338" /> free movement of personnel.  What would happen in Dublin city if military personnel were required in O'Connell Street during the rush hour?  How long would it take to move the troops from, for instance, Cathal Brugha barracks?  They would certainly walk much faster.  In a riot situation it is necessary to move troops speedily and this can only be done by the use of troop-carrying helicopters.  We are well equipped with armoured vehicles but because of the terrain and the movement of road transport such vehicles can be impeded.  It is not tank country or armoured vehicle country to any great degree.</P>
    <P>A policy document was issued recently on the Army.  I should like to state that as a result of my tour there are a number of matters I feel should be attended to.  The Minister stated that equipment is being purchased and I have no doubt that it is but is the best equipment always purchased? In some cases I do not think it is.  In my view many blunders were made in the not too distant past.  The question of the purchasing of equipment should be examined on a much broader basis.  In the document which was issued recently we set out a proposal for an alternation in age limits. We considered the present structure where the age limits have been graded upwards as a result of a variety of pressures, many of which ceased to exist.  Many of those who have medals or bars who wish to get extensions have rightly obtained them.  Nevertheless, in this new situation we must ensure that the personnel must be comparatively young, physically fit and able to carry out any of the duties required of them.  There seems to have been some confusion in the minds of some of the personnel in relation to that matter.  We were anxious to have the matter examined.  We wanted those under an existing contract of service to serve out the contract and there was no question of interfering with the rights of personnel.  This reduction to a more realistic set of age limits is necessary and desirable.  Such limits would ensure that promotional opportunities would be available at an earlier age than at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> If we look at other armies we will see that they have senior officers of 35 and 40 years of age.  Our Army personnel should have those opportunities. There should be a proper career system which will attract personnel into the service.  A comprehensive review of the career structure should take place.  Periodic assessments would ensure that personnel would be able to avail of promotion opportunities or terminate their service if they felt the opportunities were not available.  It is important that we have forward planning.  It is necessary, in the first instance, that we have officers of the highest calibre.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the educational opportunities offered are the best available.  Personnel should be assessed on lines similar to those in other armies so that they know their prospects of promotion within the service. If they are misfits they can adapt themselves through education and other means within the service for early retirement.  This is imperative. We all know that a bad lieutenant becomes a bad captain, a bad lieutenant colonel and a bad colonel.  However, an early assessment situation of officers, NCOs and men would ensure that we have men of the best calibre who are equipped to deal with modern problems making use of modern techniques. The outlining of a career structure to officers, NCOs and men would be a tremendous advantage. The position is haphazard.  One takes his chance.  If the person above the corporal cuts corners the corporal cuts corners.  There must be a code.  There must be standards.  They are not there at the moment.  There should be a positive career structure and positive career guidance and assessment at intervals so that personnel will know their long term opportunities or alternatively will be able to resettle at an early stage.</P>
    <P>The pay structure should be altered. It is not enough that, say, an infantry unit should move into an area and ask &ldquo;Where are the engineers?  We want to detonate explosives.&rdquo;  There should be in every unit personnel equipped to do this work.  A variety <Col N="340" /> of courses should be made available in relation to signalling, engineering, transportation and so on and men who pursue courses and get the necessary qualification should be paid accordingly. A fixed payment regardless of qualification means that the lazy man gets as much as the man who does his job effectively.  People should be paid for knowledge.  We would have a more effective defence force if people were paid for their knowledge.  The person who does not want to commit himself, who does not want to increase his knowledge and skill, who is of minimal advantage to a unit should not receive the same consideration as the man who studied and equipped himself so as to give better service. The pay structure should reward personnel for time spent in the development of talent.</P>
    <P>Accommodation is an important factor.  I would hope to see a big change in the approach to the provision of accommodation.  As I have said before, the accommodation in which some military personnel exist is not what I would consider suitable and I am quite confident that the Minister and other Members of Dáil Éireann, and, indeed, civil servants would reject out of hand the type of accommodation that is provided in some cases.  There should be an immediate survey and apprraisal of all military posts and barracks and they should be brought up to modern standards.  There is now an ideal opportunity to do this.  The Government are paying people 85 per cent of their wages while they are unemployed.  The Government should introduce public works schemes to which unemployed persons could be diverted.  Such schemes could include the improvement of military barracks.  Workers could be used to carry out work which does not require more than manpower if money is not available to purchase materials.  Certain improvements could be carried out in military barracks and people would be taken off the dole queue.</P>
    <P>I have been in Collins Barracks and I know how derelict some sections of the barracks are.  The same applies to other barracks.  The same applies to married quarters.  The Minister intends <Col N="341" /> to proceed with the provision of 50 houses for married personnel.  I do not blame the Minister for the present state of married quarters.  This is a long standing problem.  Successive Ministers have neglected this matter. It is not one that can be rectified over night.  Some of the married quarters are not fit for human habitation.  If local authorities were to examine some of the accommodation, they would deem it unfit for human habitation.</P>
    <P>During the war years I was stationed in the Curragh.  Married quarters were evacuated and this is where I was stationed.  In some cases the accommodation consisted of boxes and these are still occupied by families. One could get claustrophobia. Even military personnel who were prepared to rough it considered the accommodation outmoded at that time.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the provision of accommodation should be a charge on the Defence budget.  In areas where military personnel are stationed there is a special responsibility on local authorities and the Department of Defence should not have to be burdened with this problem.  It is the responsibility of the Department of Defence to maintain an Army capable of going into action at a given moment.  Military personnel should not have to live in inferior accommodation. Personnel will be lax if the Army is lax in relation to their problems.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the whole question of married quarters would be dealt with as speedily as possible in conjunction with the Department of Local Government.  The question should be examined of the provision of housing for military personnel in towns where married quarters are not available. There are in Dublin city reserved houses.  There is a responsibility on the local authority of any area where military personnel are based because of the substantial inflow of income to the area by virtue of that military personnel being based there.  The provision of married quarters within barracks was desirable in the past but may not be so desirable now.  The Department of Defence should not <Col N="342" /> have to bear the burden of providing married quarters within barracks for the number of personnel required to meet the existing security situation.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to modernise the training system and to ensure that individual skills and talents are fully developed.  Every opportunity should be provided for personnel and they should be rewarded in accordance with their skills.</P>
    <P>The Minister has touched on the question of physical education, athletics and leisure-time activities.  What is important is that the soldier would develop all his military skills but it is equally important that he should have an opportunity of developing other skills and every encouragement should be given to him to develop such skills. In some cases those opportunities are given.  In others they are not.  Where you have sports conscious officers there will be adequate provision for sports but where such officers do not exist there will be no provision.  Every member of the Army should have an opportunity of developing sporting skills. A high degree of physical fitness is necessary and desirable and the way to achieve this is through the provision of sporting facilities.  Encouragement should be given to people with artistic or cultural inclinations to develop those to the best advantage and a general look should be taken at the situation to ensure no injustice is done.</P>
    <P>I would hope that we would reach a situation where every member would be able to put on a flak jacket and go into action, if necessary. Unfortunately, that is not the position.  Many men are engaged on duties of a non-military nature.  Men are engaged as waiters and orderlies. To me it is humiliating for a soldier to have to polish floors or to make tea for officers.  There should be a restructuring to ensure better service and the release of the largest possible number of fully trained personnel should the necessity arise.  That is not the situation at the moment. There are as many men tied up on non-essential jobs as there are on actual military service duties.  It is important that this should be examined.  The number of people dug <Col N="343" /> in, to use Army parlance, is quite considerable.  The position is unrealistic. All men should be available for military service.  That is the service for which they are trained.</P>
    <P>There should be qualified career guidance officers in the Army.  It is not satisfactory to appoint inexperienced personnel for this purpose, personnel who do not meet the basic requirements.  Properly qualified career guidance officers should be appointed to assess capabilities and to ensure a systematic development in education, officers competent to advise on the many problems confronting the average soldier.  It is sad to see so many overholders in married quarters with no hope of obtaining accommodation from local authorities having given a considerable period of their lives to the Army and the service of the nation.  They should be advised at an early stage so that they would be equipped ultimately to meet the problems of resettlement in civilian life.  From time to time personnel have been appointed to advise young soldiers and sometimes the advice given has not been to the advantage to the soldier seeking it, but rather to his disadvantage because of the inability of the person appointed to cope with the situation. That is why I say proper career guidance personnel should be appointed.</P>
    <P>Education to enable a soldier to equip himself for civilian life on discharge is most important.  Discharged personnel are very often forgotten men who find it difficult to obtain any kind of employment.  Indeed, we see some of them hanging on to petrol pumps.  That is no way for a man who has given 20 or 30 years' service to the nation to finish up.  The Minister has outlined some of the educational opportunities being provided. He does not go far enough.  We dealt with this in our policy document. Our aim was to ensure that these men would have an opportunity of employment when they leave the Army. There should be refresher courses and every educational assistance possible <Col N="344" /> should be given to these men to ensure they will not be forgotten men. There should be special assistance given to discharged personnel.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the services available for a man in service, but the real difficulties are met when the man is discharged from the service.  Then he is forgotten.  After nine or 12 months in civilian life, if a man sees a job for which he thinks he could qualify with tutorial assistance, the Army should provide facilities, including loans, to enable him to pursue a degree course or courses leading to professional or vocational qualifications.</P>
    <P>Disabled personnel are also forgotten. I have met a number of them in recent times and discussed their problems with them.  They feel completely deserted by the State and rely for assistance of one kind or another from the local health authority.  Some of these men could do correspondence courses which would fit them for civilian life.  When a man is discharged because of a disability it is only after perhaps, three, four or five years that he is fit enough to pursue activities of this nature.  The Army should still have that responsibility.</P>
    <P>There are also the wives of disabled people and the widows of ex-servicemen. When they are the breadwinners educational and other facilities should be available to them.  There is a whole area here that must be examined to ensure that these people are not forgotten.</P>
    <P>We also proposed a system of vocational rehabilitation to give training to disabled ex-servicemen on a full-time or part-time basis, and that, in addition to the disability allowance, they should be given a subsistence allowance and also allowances for books and fees, and that suitable vocational counselling should be available to them in deciding on the most suitable occupation for them.</P>
    <P>We would also hope that fuller use would be made of Army hospitals. There are many vacant beds in these hospitals.  These facilities should be available to ex-servicemen on retirement pension, that is, long service men.  These men are lost when they leave the Army.  They have nothing in <Col N="345" /> common with people outside.  In many cases their families are gone and the only comradeship they have is that of old soldiers.  If hospitalisation were available to them when required, it would be an advantage not only to them but also to the Army doctors who would have a fuller practice and would be able to keep abreast of modern medical techniques.  The Army could be paid the social welfare or other benefits that are payable to hospitals, and in that way the cost would be minimal.  The Army also has responsibility for the continuity of treatment for ex-service men who become drug dependent during service, particularly overseas service.  Treatment should be continued through the Army because the case records would be available to military personnel. Greater use should be made of Army hospitals during the valley periods.  I would hope there would also be a reappraisal of the Army Nursing Service.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the Army Equitation School on a number of occasions in the past and I want to refer to it again.  I believe this is an officers' club.  If we are to have an Army Equitation School which is of no military value it should not be an officers' club.  NCOs and men who have natural ability for horse riding should have the same opportunity as officers. Among the 13,000 or 14,000 other ranks I believe there are talented people who have been passed over.  If the Army is picking a boxing team or a football team they do not pick officers only.  If they are picking any other team, officers are not picked <i>in toto</i>.  There seems to be special treatment in relation to jumping teams.  This is a situation that has annoyed many people.  We are living in a different period to the days of past glory.  On occasions when NCOs did jump they did themselves and the nation proud.  I am thinking of Sergeant Finlay and others who brought back trophies when they had to step into the breach.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a power struggle between the Army Equitation School and Bord na gCapall.  Between these two bodies they get £1 million, £316,000 for the Army Equitation <Col N="346" /> School and over £600,000 for Bord na gCapall.  This matter should be solved once and for all.  Let either the Army Equitation School or Bord na gCapall have responsibility for equitation.  The Minister said that the purpose of the Army Equitation School was to advertise and sell Irish horses abroad, which, of course, is completely incorrect. As I say, last year the Army Equitation School spent over £300,000 and Bord na gCapall spent £612,000.</P>
    <P>This area should be investigated and expanded.  It must be decided who will train the horses, Bord na gCapall or the Army Equitation School.  If Bord na gCapall take over, there is no reason why competent Army riders would not be able to compete.  If the Army Equitation School is to continue, I see no reason why it should not be open to privates, NCOs and members of the FCA who could compete with distinction for their country. I believe there are many men with natural ability who have been deprived of this opportunity because of the club-like mentality in the Army Equitation School.  It amazes me that this attitude has existed for so long.</P>
    <P>Recently I was speaking to a young man who joined the service believing he would have an opportunity to ride but found he was in a dead end.  NCOs and privates work in this school but only the officers are given the opportunities to ride.  That is wrong.  I read recently in the newspapers that very high charges are being charged by the Army Equitation School to keep Bord na gCapall horses.  We are told that these charges are way above those charged elsewhere.  There is clearly a power struggle here and the situation must be clarified for everybody's sake. I would ask the Minister to broaden the base of the Army Equitation School to ensure that no man with ability will be denied an opportunity to advance, whether it is in education or otherwise.  I see no reason why a private or an NCO could not attend courses in Galway university.  At the moment this opportunity is available to cadets and others.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned military justice on numerous occasions.  We have reached the stage where we must take <Col N="347" /> another look at it.  The Minister should institute an immediate review of the present unsatisfactory situation.  Because he has taken on certain powers in relation to promotion, an officer is denied the opportunity to redress a wrong.  This right was clearly outlined in the Defence Act, 1954.  If the Minister promotes a man against the advice of the Chief of Staff, it is to the Minister that the complaint is made if the man feels aggrieved because he has not been promoted.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with pension provisions. He should take another look at the pension situation to ensure that some type of normality is restored to the present situation.  It is difficult to interpret the pensions structure at the moment.</P>
    <P>I believe the FCA are a forgotten force, notwithstanding the fact that the Minister has given them some praise. In theory, there may be a reserve but in practice there is not.  We suggested that consideration be given to the feasibility of integrating the present reserve with the FCA to comprise one national reserve.  This would give a suitable role to the FCA and the reserves and provide them with adequate methods of training.  The reserves have no role to play at the moment and the FCA are neglected.  The paper strength of the FCA bears no relation to the actual strength of the force.  This is an important force of dedicated men who wish to serve but who, because of difficulties which have been placed in their paths, feel they are overlooked and disregarded.</P>
    <P>We were told some years ago that a study was being made of the FCA, an assessment was being made, the matter would be reported on, the role of the FCA would be examined.  Their integration with the Defence Forces was never on&mdash;we all know that&mdash; and for that reason it is necessary that at this stage a new look be taken at the FCA.  I and many other people feel that a reserve on the old volunteer lines would be much more satisfactory than the present system.</P>
    <P>There have been many varied complaints from the FCA and I will mention but a few.  An FCA man who <Col N="348" /> goes training, whether in camp or on nightly or annual training, is not insured by the insurance company. Neither is he insured by the Army.  If anything should happen to him&mdash; death or injury&mdash;no compensation will be paid by insurance companies. The Minister should clarify this position because the personnel are very worried.</P>
    <P>They are also worried about tax assessment, the collection of tax from those doing their 14 days' annual training.  They are concerned about the one uniform they are issued under present regulations.  If they are out on a march at annual camp and the weather is wet or damp, the drying facilities in the barracks are very limited&mdash;if there are any at all&mdash;and the men do not have a second uniform. In many respects they consider that they have been neglected.</P>
    <P>The question of insurance, too, is very important and in this regard we would like to hear from the Minister when he is replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>In recent times I have been to the Border area in order to find out at first hand what is the position there regarding operations.  During those visits I recalled an occasion on which, with other Members of this House, I visited Berlin and all I can say is that there was not as much activity at Checkpoint Charlie as there was on the part of the British on their side of the Border.  To say the least, the situation there is uncomfortable and the personnel did not appear to operate with nearly the same degree of assistance as was found among our own personnel on this side of the Border.  The provocative manner in which some British military personnel carried out their tasks did not make for free movement of persons in the execution of their daily tasks across this artificial divide.  This is a matter of concern to all of us.  The position was much more satisfactory in so far as our personnel were concerned and I compliment them on the manner in which they undertake their tasks.</P>
    <P>With the development of Border duty and in view of the general desirability of free and fast movement, it is necessary that the Air Corps be in <Col N="349" /> a position to move men in the quickest possible time from one area to another.  I compliment them on the wonderful work they are doing in the fields of air-sea rescue, the training of pilots and aerial photography.  The unit is efficient but it does not meet with the requirement regarding the desirability to move personnel quickly from one point to another.  At a time of crisis the speed at which these operations is carried out is of the utmost importance.  It might be much better to be able to move ten men in ten minutes rather than to move 100 men in 20 minutes.  This brings us back to the question of the provision of larger type helicopters.  In this area, too, we should be thinking of the re-introduction of sergeant pilots, a rank which existed during the war years and many of whom have since made their mark flying the north-Atlantic route or for various airlines throughout the world.  It is my contention that helicopter pilots should come from ranks other than officer ranks. In other words, we should be more flexible in our approach to the recruitment of these pilots and not to have the situation merely of officer clubs.  The re-introduction of sergeant pilots would be an incentive to many people to join the Air Corps.  This force, too, should have their own ground defence units.  There is no reason why they could not combine with FCA units in such operations as the defence of airfields, installations and so on.  There is a point of view within the FCA that the Air Corps could offer special opportunities to people residing in areas adjacent to airfields, for instance.</P>
    <P>It is good to note that additional vessels are being made available to enable the Naval Service increase their facilities since their duties have expanded with the protection of oil rigs, territorial limits and so on.  However, what is needed is an additional base on the west coast and in this regard I would consider Donegal to be an ideal location.  While the base at Haulbowline serves the east and south coasts reasonable well, the extensive strip from Donegal to Kerry is neglected.  A second base might not necessarily be of the same dimensions <Col N="350" /> as Haulbowline but it would be very valuable and would be an incentive to people to join the Naval Service. However, until such time as territorial limits are defined clearly it will be difficult to assess what is required in that sphere but we are aware that additional vessels are required for fisheries protection work.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister indicate that the question of our forces serving abroad with the UN remains open.  It was regrettable that there was so much panic in regard to the withdrawing of our troops from some of those places.  That was an undesirable step because as I have said, the number of people in dug-in jobs is as great if not greater than the number in actual service and many of them could be released for service.</P>
    <P>Recently I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs for some information about the situation in the Congo.  He made a number of books available in the Library.  I have examined those books but they do not contain any of the information I require.  It has been pointed out to me that some of the information in the United Nations report is erroneous and contradictory to that in the book <i>To Katanga and Back</i>.  The report of one particular situation, a flashpoint in Katanga, is either erroneously given in the United Nations document or it is erroneously stated in the book, written by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Will the Minister try to obtain information in relation to the matter about which I sought information from the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  I refer to reports on Elizabethville, Jadettville and Kamina air base.  It appears to me that the United Nations were misled in the production of this document.  Their report is at variance with the statement in the book written by the United Nations representative at that time, the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>I hope before very long we will have the opportunity of sending some of our Army personnel to serve with the other Defence Forces.  This would give them the opportunity of maintaining <Col N="351" /> contact with armies from other countries and also of viewing up-to-date equipment and methods employed by other armed forces. Many members of our Parliamentary Party expressed the desire to see the development of the Timoney armoured car, which I understand is reaching final stages and has been on display from time to time.  Would the Minister make this armoured car available for viewing to Members of the Oireachtas at an early stage?  This seems to be a very high class development which was initiated by Fianna Fáil many years ago.  I understand this may have commercial possibilities.  If it is in Dublin in the near future I hope that Members of the Oireachtas can view it so that they can see for themselves the type of equipment which can be produced here successfully.</P>
    <P>I asked a question some time ago in relation to the bomb disposal equipment which is under construction by the Army in their workshops. Has this been produced?  What development has taken place so far and is the progress satisfactory? The Press reports at the time indicated that this matter had reached a satisfactory stage and had great possibilities.  That is just like the development of armoured cars.  If we can produce an armoured car which has market potential and is superior to any we have at the moment or superior to that used by other armies then we may have the technical know-how in this field.</P>
    <P>One area of the FCA where there seems to be some neglect is that of the marine and coast watching service. They could co-operate with the Air Corps and the Naval Service in coast defence and sea rescue service.  They could perform a most useful service because they would have knowledge of the coast.</P>
    <P>In relation to the defence of Leinster House this matter seems to me to be at a ridiculous level.  When I came in this morning I was stopped for a security check at the gate.  A van went in in front of me but was not stopped.  A Minister's car came in <Col N="352" /> behind me and was not stopped but I was stopped.  I had to get out of the car and open the boot.  My brief case was not searched and nobody looked under the bonnet.  It seems to me that the whole situation is out of line.  There are two security checks. When a Minister's car comes in there is no security check and there is no security check into Government Buildings.  I understand that an investigation has taken place into the security of this House from the Army point of view.  Do they feel Leinster House is adequately protected?  Why should the security check only apply to TDs?  Why does it not apply to everybody?  The opening of the boot of a car is a silly system because people who want to plant bombs can use magnetic attachments which can be put any place, certainly not in the boot of a car.  If cars are to be searched every car should be searched.</P>

      <P>I hope we will have some positive thinking in the future regarding the re-structuring of the Defence Forces.  I hope that officers who go abroad on courses from time to time will bring back information which will help the Army.  Military thinking here has not changed very much since the forties.  The last thing I want to mention is the use of Press cards by the British army recently.  I understand some of those people may have attended a Press conference in a military barracks. What check is kept on those people? What check is kept on people who cross the Border?  It appears to me that there is a very substantial number of incursions in relation to crossing the Border and the map reading ability of the British army seems to be very imperfect.  They do not seem to know where they are going.  On every occasion they attribute the crossings of the Border, whether in cars, concealed or otherwise, to mapreading problems.  This seems to be a great defect within the British army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" /> It amazes me how accurate they are when they want to blow up a bridge or crater a road.  They can pinpoint that.  In the normal course of events they can penetrate into the Republic. They can come in vans or cars.  They can come in as civilians and they can come in armed, and they are allowed to go back.  People who come in here armed should be picked up and charged the same as anybody else, whether they are members of the British army, the SAS or any other body.  They have no right to be here.  The fact that we liberate them is a matter which needs further attention.  People were taken away from a farmhouse recently.  Vans were stopped and Press cards were used.  What has been the penetration of British intelligence?  How much do we know about it?  The excuses given are not at all satisfactory.  This matter must be kept in check to ensure that we are aware of their activities as well as the activities of others.</P>
    <P>I am completely happy with the services rendered by our own people. I hope the Minister will indicate the necessary and desirable structural changes which might take place.  Will we have air cavalry units at an early stage which can move from place to place as quickly as possible?  Will he indicate at what stage the report is on the reorganisation of the FCA, whether it is an ongoing situation or whether it has been shelved, or if it is proposed to dispense with that service? If the promised report is not available soon, many dedicated people who are interested in this service will lose interest and we will have no back-up for the Army.</P>
    <P>Is there any further information available from the United Nations in relation to the problem I outlined earlier?  It is very important that we should get factual and actual information so that Members of the House will be able to investigate fully for themselves matters which they deem it necessary to probe into.  On any occasion I sought information from the Department of Defence they were always most co-operative and I have no grievance whatsoever there.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that the information supplied by the Department of Foreign Affairs is erroneous in content. <Col N="354" /> I should like more up-to-date information.  Many aspects have to be clarified.  The reputations of many men have been tarnished.  We must get the information as soon as possible so that we can examine for ourselves the problems of the past which have caused some unpleasantness in some circumstances.  I want to make this clear.  It is not a question of a which hunt.  It is a question of clarification and of arriving at a true understanding of a situation which developed at a particular time when men were injured and others lost their lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be general agreement by Members of the House to support this Estimate introduced by the Minister for Defence. While there is an increase in the amount sought, people will readily understand the necessity.  The amount is to be increased from £59 million in 1975 to practically £73 million in 1976.  It will be appreciated that it is vital that we maintain the strength of our defence services.  The Army definitely must be maintained by the State to defend the State.  If the Army have to be more actively involved in internal security, it is vital that adequate sums be provided to see that they are properly equipped.</P>
      <P>The leadership provided by the Minister for Defence and by the Army GHQ officers has been very successful in maintaining a high morale amongst all ranks of the Army.  It is important that we should maintain this standard while the internal security of the State is at risk.  It is at risk.  We had evidence of that on many occasions during the year.  We are satisfied that the joint efforts of the Army and the Garda can cope adequately with any situation that has arisen or which might arise in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most vital aspect of an army's strength is to ensure the continuity of an intake of suitable recruits at all stages.  It is gratifying for the Members of the House and for the people to know that, for the past 25 years, we have not had a greater strength in the Army than we have at the moment.  It is now at its highest level. It is good to know that the terms of the national pay agreement have been <Col N="355" /> applied to all ranks.  About 25 or 30 years ago, it was not the custom to apply such agreements to the Army.</P>
    <P>It is vital to have suitable recruits attested in our Army if we are to keep up the quality and the youth of our soldiers.  Parents and others who are responsible for encouraging young men to join our defence services, the Army and the Air Corps, and our voluntary services such as the FCA, Civil Defence and, indeed, the Red Cross, the Knights of Malta, the St. John Ambulance Brigade, should be aware of the educational facilities which are now available, and which are provided by the Department of Education.  Young men have an opportunity to attend day courses and to sit for day group certificates and the leaving certificate.  This is an opportunity which should be availed of and everyone concerned should know the facilities their children would have if they joined the Army. There are opportunities for young men who have registered as fitters, motor mechanics, sheet and metal workers, bricklayers, painters, decorators and plasterers.  They have the opportunity to qualify in those trades.  There should be a realisation that a young man coming out of the Army is much better off than when he entered the Army; his education is improved and his ability to get a job in civilian employment is much enhanced.  The officer corps have an opportunity to get third-level education and a refund may be made towards the cost of tuition and fees.</P>
    <P>There are generous opportunities at every level in the Army and this is quite right.  We should give priority to the men who serve in the Defence Forces because we are aware of their dedication and loyalty to the State. We should all be aware of our dependence on them to preserve stability in the country and to allow people to do their jobs without being molested or prevented from leading normal lives.</P>
    <P>The physical aspect of Army training has been improving steadily through the years.  We now have adventure training, sub-aqua swimming, mountaineering training, boating, <Col N="356" /> sailing and canoeing.  In fact, swimming is included in the training of recruits.  Those who encourage young people to come into the Army should know that their mental and physical training is receiving attention. I do not think there is any area in which young people could get greater scope to compete.  There are sports competitions held within the different Commands and there are the all-Army competitions.  The PT teams have a very high standard and they are a pleasure to watch.</P>
    <P>The harmonious relations between the Army and the Garda Síochána have been obvious in the last few years.  Those two forces have contributed greatly to the confidence of the people.  They know that in the event of an emergency the Defence Forces and the security forces will be able to cope.  At the moment some people possibly wish to disrupt security but the public have confidence in the ability of our combined forces to deal with all situations.</P>
    <P>Some people may not be aware that non-military installations are protected regularly by the Defence Forces and in this connection the FCA play an important part.  I doubt if there is full appreciation of the contribution made by the people who have volunteered to serve in the FCA in the last 35 years.  It is not properly understood that they are available at all times, they are unpaid and their standard of training is high.  This is obvious when they compete in the competitions held at the Army ranges throughout the country; their standards in weapon training are very high.</P>
    <P>Many years ago it was not popular to be a soldier.  I do not know if this was due to the feelings held by our people with regard to the presence of the British army.  Too few people encouraged youth to consider making a contribution in the area of defence. The easiest way any young man could contribute would be to enlist in his own area.  In the last few years because of the security situation and because it is not possible to have proper strongrooms in each company area, weapons had to be stored in <Col N="357" /> barracks where the standard of security was adequate.</P>
    <P>The fact that weapons were not available in some way impeded the availability of weapons for the FCA. Nevertheless, the standard has not gone down.  We have within the State a crops of volunteers, some are ex-members and the majority are serving members, who, unknown to the civil population, are willing and available, and have sworn an oath to this effect, to assist the Army.  This is reassuring for our people.  It is good to know that there is no lack of support for the Army.</P>
    <P>The helicopter service rendered invaluable help during the past year in taking people to hospitals and rehabilitation centres.  The general public are grateful for that but I believe an extension of that service should be considered by the Minister. Prompt action is vital when an emergency occurs.  We should compliment the volunteers in the Civil Defence Force.  It should be remembered that local authorities get 70 per cent of the outlay involved in training members of this force. Those volunteers are doing a good service and they have been trained to deal with any calamity.  They have reached a particularly high standard in fire fighting.  They are available should the necessity arise and they should receive recognition for their contribution.  County managers have an interest in seeing Civil Defence promoted within their areas.</P>
    <P>We should not forget that a grant-in-aid is paid to the Red Cross and that in return it is distributed to areas of distress.  The Red Cross have given excellent service over the years.  People who make voluntary contributions to the Red Cross from time to time are discouraged when they see that money contributed to that organisation in some cases outside the State is fraudulently converted. Our people, however, can rely on the headquarters of that organisation in this State.  At no time has anything gone wrong in the administration of the funds our people contributed to that organisation here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> I should like to thank the Minister for his association with the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen.  He has maintained liaison with that organisation and many points raised by the executive with him have been attended to.  I should like to express the gratitude of ONE to the Minister for his interest and attention to their problems which in many cases he was able to solve.  From time to time criticism is levelled at the Army Equitation School because of the lack of success of their horses and riders. It is said that they do not reflect the glory of the past but in my view this could be related in many cases to the quality of the horses our Army officers are expected to ride in various events.  Undoubtedly our successes are not as spectacular as they were in the past but now that we have started purchasing animals of quality we might achieve better results in a few years.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the need to provide proper accommodation for personnel in barracks.  There has been slow progress in that regard over the past 20 or 30 years.  Our NCOs and men are entitled to good accommodation.  The old houses used by the British are still in use in most barracks and too few of the Army billets have been modernised.  I am well aware of the standard of such billets and the slow rate of investment by the State in bringing about more comfortable accommodation for our soldiers.  Our soldiers are the first citizens of the country and they should get the proper recognition irrespective of how restricted we may be in regard to finance.  Progress has been slow in this regard and the buildings occupied by single men as well as the married quarters must be modernised. Many people would make the Army a career if there was proper accommodation.  I know many who have spent more than 21 years in the Army and many more would continue for that length of service if accommodation was improved.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to know that the standard of recruitment has been maintained and that the equipment of the Army is modern.  It is good to <Col N="359" /> know that there is a recognition, with regard to transport, that the quick movement of troops in proper vehicles is vital.  I hope that there will be an improvement in the Air Corps for reconnaissance purposes.  This is vital because the combined forces must work together in any situation if it is to be brought under control rapidly.</P>
    <P>The extra provision for the Estimate is necessary.  The taxpayer who grumbles about extra taxation to provide for his own security should realise that that taxation has to be imposed while the internal security of the country might be questioned by some people.  It is the intention of the Government and of the Minister for Defence in particular to provide him with that security.  I conclude by complimenting the Minister on the maintenance of a high standard of morale within all ranks of the Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to compliment the Minister.  Nobody on any side of the House will disagree about the efficiency of the Army.  The Minister is doing a good job.  I want to praise also the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Defence for the interest he has taken in the Army. As Opposition spokesman on Defence he has dealt with the Estimate in depth.  It is obvious that both the Minister and Deputy Dowling take an interest in their respective tasks.  The Minister has to answer to the House for Defence and the Opposition spokesman must take a keen interest in the matter.</P>
      <P>I hope that what I have to say will be helpful.  I do not want to be critical. It is my view that in peace-time or in time of emergency we need an army.  Those who advocated that we should not have an army adopted a defeatist attitude.  It is not the size of the Army that matters.  The morale of the Army and the way it was trained and equipped stood us in good stead during the emergency.  If we had not had the Army it would have been quite easy for anybody to invade us. As long as we have a well-equipped and well-trained Army it will not be possible for anyone to invade us and to hope to remain here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> I am delighted that arrangements are being made so that members of the Army can equip themselves educationally and technically to give better service while in the Army and to improve their prospects on their return to civilian life.</P>
    <P>We are getting a good type of person into the Army.  I did not know a great deal about the regular Army but I knew quite a lot about the FCA.  I am glad that the Minister has praised the FCA.  The FCA is a voluntary organisation that was formed during the war years.  It was composed of persons who while continuing their civilian occupations submitted themselves to rigorous training in the FCA for the defence of the nation.  I should like to pay special tribute to the FCA.  They have done a great job and they are becoming increasingly efficient, even since my time in the FCA.  Training is better now.  It is a force of which we can be very proud. I hope the FCA will be continued and that it will remain as efficient as it is at present.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in the Army Equitation School and the Army Jumping Team which I believe to be the showpiece of the Army.  I would emphasise that horses which are not capable of jumping well should not be shown in public.  The horses used by the Army Jumping Team are supposed to be the best in the country and it is important that the highest standards should be maintained.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse what Deputy Dowling said about promotional opportunities in the Army. There may be some element of snobbery in the Army.  I would not like that.  There should be nothing to prevent an ordinary private who has the necessary ability from becoming Chief of Staff.  In any walk in life the man who starts at the bottom and works his way up becomes the best manager.  The man who starts as a private in the Army and who has the ability to work his way up will become the best Chief of Staff.  People should not be pitch-forked into jobs.  I realise that a certain standard of education is required but promotional opportunities should be provided for all ranks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> I am delighted that arrangements have been made for the purchase of another vessel for fishery protection. At the moment there is not adequate protection.  If we get the fishery limits which we are hoping to get we will not be able to protect them.  Every effort should be made to protect our shores against illegal fishing.  Fishing is becoming increasingly important.  I do not intend to discuss this industry on this Estimate.  I merely mention in passing the importance of fisheries protection.  We require more boats and bigger boats for the protection of our fisheries.</P>
    <P>Since I became a Deputy I have made repeated reference to the members of the Old IRA who are in receipt of the special allowance.  When a recipient of this allowance dies the allowance dies with him.  The special allowance is given on the basis of the circumstances of the person.  The military service pension is granted on the basis of service irrespective of circumstances. When the man dies the allowance ceases.  I would ask the Minister to continue the allowance to the widow.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Old IRA, these men are dying out gradually.  They gave great service to the country and they deserve to be honoured for that service.  I was at the funeral recently of an Old IRA man and there was no flag on the coffin and no firing party.  A survey should be carried out by the Department of these people&mdash; it should be a simple matter because it merely means checking on recipients of pensions and allowances&mdash;and when these people die the Department should take the initiative and supply the flag and the firing party.  Where there is an alert organisation or a public representative who is interested, the flag and the firing party will be there but, if there is no one to bother, no honours will be paid.  To me, that is very wrong. These people are entitled to full military honours.</P>
    <P>I am a long way from the Border but I have heard complaints about British troops crossing the Border.  They seem to be bad map readers or, perhaps, they want to be bad map readers. All that happens is that they are told to go back across the Border.  I believe <Col N="362" /> they should be prosecuted.  We cannot go in and they should not be allowed to come in here either.  A very dangerous situation could develop.  No British personnel should be put on Border duty unless they are competent map readers.  I would like the Minister to take note of this.</P>
    <P>We have a good Army doing a good job.  Our spokesman on Defence has gone into the Estimate in detail.  The Army is in good shape.  We ought to be very proud of it.  A good type is joining the Army.  The sporting facilities are excellent.  Unfortunately, there are complaints about quarters.  The Minister mentioned the erection of 50 houses.  I know one cannot do everything overnight and an effort is being made to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Where the jumping team is concerned there should be no suspicion even of class distinction.  Any man, from private upwards, should be on that team if he is a competent horseman. There are people who query the existence of the Army and the need for it. While we have an army nobody will invade this country because it is easy to take us but it is very hard to hold us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the way in which he has tackled his job and the energy he has put into it.  We were reaching the stage where people were reluctant to join the Army.  There seemed to be no opportunities in an Army career.  The Minister has taken the Army out of the doldrums and the Army is now taking its rightful place.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not hesitate to station the Army at various centres throughout the country. He was quite right in this approach.  It has helped the Army and it has helped the areas in which the Army is stationed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right we should pay tribute to the generous contribution made by the FCA.  Those fine young men volunteered for service without any thought of reward.  The country owes them a great deal.  Some did not appreciate the effort these young men made.  Week after week they went to <Col N="363" /> the various centres to train and be disciplined so that they would be prepared to play their part if called upon. If an emergency arose they were there to render service.  We owe a lot to those people.</P>
    <P>One thing that has given the Army a boost is the increase in remuneration. The Army was regarded as an inferior type of job at one time because remuneration was very low and this did not encourage people to join up.  Down in Manorhamilton I have been talking to some of these men who are back in the Army, having left because the pay was not sufficient. They are very happy to be back because they are well looked after and well paid.  They also spoke highly of the new, improved uniform they are wearing today.  It gives the young soldier an air of confidence in himself when he steps out in the comfortable uniform which is provided for him now.  It is good that we are keeping up with the times where our young soldiers and officers are concerned. Over the past 35 years nothing much was done for the Army.  The Army horse-jumping team and the Army band were the only units that figured prominently and we did not hear or see much of the rank and file.  I suppose we should not be critical because there was very little money available in those days, but now we are moving in the right direction.</P>
    <P>It is a great help to any town to have an army centre in it because the money that is paid to the personnel is spent locally.  The next thing that is required is adequate housing for the young Army men who are getting married and who are going to live in this centre and rear a family.  I am sure the Minister will not lose sight of this need for housing.</P>
    <P>I have known many fine boys who joined the Army and came out well trained and capable of taking over good positions in civilian life.  They could go into the building business or take up jobs as mechanics or as drivers.  I know the Minister will pursue this policy of training Army personnel in this way for the future.</P>
    <P>When an emergency arises and <Col N="364" /> when very dangerous operations have to be carried out our Army are always there.  They can carry out sea rescue operations by helicopter and can save the lives of many people when they are threatened with danger.  It is very common to see a helicopter taking a patient, say, from Manorhamilton to Dublin or conveying a patient from Sligo hospital to another hospital in Dublin or elsewhere, and these helicopters have the advantage of being able to come right down to the hospital door.  That is a very valuable contribution the Army are making to the community.</P>
    <P>The world was watching our Army in the days when they went to the Congo and to many other countries overseas and gave a very fine account of themselves.  I am sorry to say that one of those brave young men who was stationed at Sligo&mdash;I forget what his rank was but his name was O'Sullivan&mdash;died only last week.  Some of those boys paid with their lives to serve this country.  I know this will continue and that there will always be good young lads to take their place. Every encouragement should be given to young boys to join the Army.  It makes men of them and prepares them for life after they leave the Army.  The scales of pay should be advertised and brought to the notice of young people.</P>
    <P>On two or three occasions I was asked to make representations to the Minister for Defence that the Army be allowed to take part in a St. Patrick's parade in Sligo or at festivals of agricultural shows in Manorhamilton. If peace was restored in this country, it would be a good thing for these centres to have such participation by the Army on these occasions. It would bring the Army more to the notice of the public and would add flavour to the event concerned.  I would ask the Minister to consider this point.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a plea for the dependants of Army personnel who may retire or who may pass on through illness and leave a wife and family after them.  A woman might find herself without any allowance if her husband dies.  I expect that the <Col N="365" /> Minister has improved the situation but in the past a woman whose husband died after 23 or 24 years' service found herself without any allowance. If that has not already been rectified, I hope the Minister will do something about it.  There is a small group of people who continually make contact with elected representatives, that is, some Old IRA men.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows more about those representations than the Minister.  I strongly recommend that the Minister consider any borderline cases and give them a special disability allowance. Some of those men made fine contributions to the freedom of this country.  When they came back to civilian life many of them got good financial situations.  Some of them had good businesses, others were farmers and so on, and did not need assistance nor did they ask for any.  As the years passed, they found they were not able to manage as well as they expected. A small number of these men now hopefully expect that the Minister will give them a special disability allowance to supplement their old age pension or other income.  I brought many of these cases to the notice of the Minister and I recommend that any borderline cases receive this allowance.</P>
    <P>Once again, I compliment the Minister for doing a very good job.  He has not hesitated to travel the length and breadth of the 26 Counties to do his job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long time since I felt I should intervene in a debate of this nature for the simple reason that if one has been involved in a specific area in the past, one can get rather set ideas and seek to impose them on people who are moving with the times.  It is, therefore, with a certain amount of diffidence that I want to make a general comment on defence and our Army.  If I should be open to the old charge of thinking in terms of the last war, all I can say is that I am trying to overcome that natural handicap of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to talk about defence in a general context, in a way which, I hope, will be helpful.  Before so doing, <Col N="366" /> I should like to join with others who admire the way our Army has progressed and who are re-assured to find that a certain spirit of service and dedication still exists in our defence organisation, both on the civil and military sides.  This has happened in an age when, unfortunately, in many other areas of human activity, that same sense of responsibility, loyalty and spirit of service, are all too often conspicuous by their absence.  It is not an exaggeration or a formal tribute to our Department of Defence embracing both the military and civilian sides, to say that by keeping with the times they have remained responsibly true to their traditions.</P>
    <P>That, perhaps, is the most sincere compliment that can be paid in general terms.  Anybody who thinks for a moment must realise that with the outside world as it is, that all the disorders&mdash;I am thinking not so much now of violence or even social disorder, I am thinking of individual disorder, the disorder in our thinking, the disorder that is in humanity, this tendency, especially among the young, where everybody does their own &ldquo;thing&rdquo;,&mdash;have made it very difficult to harness the young people who were brought up in that contaminated atmosphere to meet the requirements of the Defence Forces. The greatest tribute that can be paid to the Department&mdash;I am using the word &ldquo;Department&rdquo;, as I have emphasised, to embrace both the military and civil elements, that is, all the areas over which the Minister presides&mdash;is that they have been able over the years to absorb, train, impress the spirit and maintain the morale of the people in the service. When one reflects on this, one can be justly proud of our Army.  It measures up to the yardstick of today and to the yardstick of yesterday.</P>
    <P>I could go into details which naturally concern Deputies about the welfare of troops and soldiers, their conditions, accommodation and so forth, but this has already been discussed by other Deputies.  If I do not labour it, it is because it has already been said.  I join in the exhortations to the Minister in whatever <Col N="367" /> regard is necessary.  In my view, in a debate like this, we should pause and go a little further, to be neither content by applauding what is good nor criticising details which, in our opinion could be bettered, adjusted or corrected, or making various suggestions in certain cases. Instead of doing all that, we should occasionally look at the broader aspect.  That is what I would like to do today.  I take it that it is in order in an Estimate of this nature to deal with the general policy of defence.</P>
    <P>What are our Defence Forces there for?  They are primarily an organisation to give physical protection as far as possible to our people and our community.  That fundamental concept remains even though during a period after the war, particularly in the 1950s, there was a lot of talk about peace; armies, in the old sense, were obsolete, and so forth. Sad experience is proving, however, that neither humanity nor the demand for defence forces have changed but that it remains in the last words of the introduction to the classic work of Foch on the principles of war, &ldquo;It always remains necessary to establish the principles of war.&rdquo; That is tragic but it remains a fact and it is the basic reason for the existence of defence forces.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it might be well to pause here for a moment and speak on one point.  In today's world and, particularly, in our local situation, the role of defence forces very often is what used to be called &ldquo;in aid of the civil power&rdquo;.  This is a very important role and it justifies currently the strength and activities of our Defence Forces, making it easier for a government to maintain the numbers and find the finance necessary.  But in the long term it would be a mistake merely to regard our Defence Forces as armed auxiliaries, so to speak, to the Garda Síochána.  Although that is the practical task of the moment, it is a narrow view which should be broadened. Before I conclude I hope to give a reason for this assertion.  However, in this role of supporting the <Col N="368" /> Garda and providing for the security problems of the moment the Army are performing a proper and necessary function and, so far as one can judge, are providing the service excellently. In making that remark I am hopeful that what I have to say in no way contradicts the use of the Defence Forces in this concept. Rather, it would be my wish that what I have to say will be regarded as a broadening of the concept, a widening of our focus regarding the defence problem.</P>
    <P>As I have said, defence forces are a tragic necessity in the modern world.  After the first world war which was to end all wars there was the optimistic approach to life whereby there was talk of disarmament and matters of that nature but it transpired that all such laudable activities as disarmament and diplomatic negotiations, while they may have held off the evil day, in so far as they inhibited the facing up to realities and the preparation for such realities, they brought on the world a second world war.  My fear today is that the all pervasive corrosive liberalism of the western world which to a large extent has destroyed the moral of that western world, coupled with the lack of order and discipline that is so apparent everywhere else&mdash;but which I am glad to say still exist in the Department about which we are talking&mdash;would seem in the light of history and of the way things are going, to be conspiring in somewhat the same direction.</P>
    <P>I regret that despite the events of very good, dedicated and devoted people everywhere we are not moving towards a peaceful Utopia.  In the area in which we are there is an element of demoralisation which is somewhat frightening and in which there is the suggestion of the decay of a civilisation.  Therefore, the old Latin maxim, <i>si vis pacem parabellum</i>, appears to be forced again on everyone in the world.  These are disturbing thoughts.  Anyone with any semblance of sanity would not wish these thoughts to arise but simply because they are so horrible, so detestable, can we afford to deny all reality of them?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> During the 30-year period since the last war there have been wars and rumours of wars from Korea onwards. Then there is all over the world what we are experiencing here, not organised war, but the break-up of war and disruptive and murderous violence.  There were wars in the Middle East.  When one conflict quietens down another erupts somewhere else like a volcano and all the time there are great powers who are maintaining large bodies of military forces, backed by a diabolical technology, mobilising in camps on the surface of this globe which, in human terms, is contracting.  Whether one takes the great land mass that lies between the Far East and the West or whether one takes the western continent, the situation is the same.  Then, it is perturbing for us to dwell on the apparent demoralisation of our western democratic society.  Where will it all lead?</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House with an analysis.  I will just make this remark. Before the last war it was thought that gas and chemical warfare would be the dominating factor in the war that was to come but it was not.  A very horrible war came, but gas or chemical warfare was not used to any great extent.  We have been hearing of nuclear war and nuclear weapons.  They are as much a reality as gas was before the last war.  One must admit that the potentialities of chemical warfare undoubtedly put brakes on the rushing of powers into war before 1939.  In the period since the last war the potentialities of nuclear warfare have fortunately acted as a deterrent.  It is disturbing to find now that those who have studied the problem find the build-up of conventional forces in certain areas posing a new situation.  One does not want to be too detailed about specifics when one realises where we fit into the scheme of things. I am merely interested in the problem we have to face.  It is out of place to talk about the great powers of the world and their operations.</P>
    <P>Things are changing.  In the continent of Africa there are people who are young in civilisation with the vigour and ruthlessness of youth as <Col N="370" /> against the decadence of a lot of the west.  From an area in the west there is now an injection into that continent which completely alters the situation and the likelihood of how a conflagration can break out.</P>

      <P>I will concede one point to the Deputy.  I could delay too long if I gave all the reasons for what I want to say specifically on the Estimate.  It is because those things are not being adverted to that I want to indicate the necessary background to the remarks I want to make on the Estimates.  There are a few factors in relation to this matter which could be considered.  There is an intervention in a most unforeseen way in the African continent.  There have been unforeseen developments of violence and situations changing towards war all over the world.  On top of that the experts see the greatest threat not in the nuclear weapons and all those things, as was seen before the last war in relation to gas, but in the build-up of the conventional forces. I will leave my background at that.</P>
      <P>This is an occasion where one should consider, although I am not suggesting that the matter is proximate, what would be the position of a country like this?  We are small but we are not isolated.  The chances of being isolated grow less and less.  What would the position of this country be if we were encompassed, in the words of the psalmist in straits, by a worsening situation?  We have to realise our size and our role.  I know it is very easy to say that we are so small that we will do nothing.  Before the last war that, unfortunately was very often said.  On the other hand, before the last war a lot of preparation was done, partly without being directly conscious of the defence need.  In our case God helped those who helped themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that we alert to certain problems which can develop in certain circumstances and in the broadest context of defence, the protection of the <Col N="371" /> community, I want to focus attention on a couple of points.  Before the last war our economic policy influenced a few things, our approach to fuel and food production and also the Defence Forces were given an opportunity from 1937 onwards to improve their organisation and equipment.  There was also a good deal of attention given to the development of reserves.  Therefore, when the crisis came in 1939 and 1940 we were in a position to survive.  However, problems developed then.  The problems were specific to the time but we must consider the nature of the type of thing which is likely to occur and we must try to be ready for it.</P>
    <P>That is the type of philosophy in which I am trying to approach this matter.  I am not attempting in any way to suggest what might in the more narrow sense be called a defence policy. I am talking about simple precautionary organisation and preparation.  It is too easy merely to think of defence, especially if you are concerned mainly with a security role, as something like a tactical operation such as one reads about.  One must have behind this the defence of the community.  The first thing to consider is food.  I will be specific now.  I do not want to be an alarmist or to put my views forward as if there was a doomsday situation around the corner.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to take this as taking the opportunity to say something which should be said at any time.  I believe it is part of the defence of any community to think about the first requirement of survival, the feeding of that community.  In a defence situation, that becomes the job not only of the Army quartermaster but also of the Government for the community. Consideration of that problem is vital for defence staffs.  Therefore, I mention food.</P>
    <P>If ever it should appear that the situation is deteriorating and it is necessary to consider the defence problem as a live problem, the Department of Defence should be in a position to help the Minister of the day to play his role so that the Government of the day can co-ordinate the whole question of food supplies.</P>

      <P>I was talking about food.  I am suggesting that the Department should consider the mechanism by which the Minister of the day can achieve co-ordination with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Departments concerned with transport and supply to look after that fundamental requirement and the other specific provisions which would have to be made. This is something which can easily be forgotten at the early stages, and could be an emergency problem, as we know from past experience.</P>
      <P>In exactly the same way there is the question of fuel.  During the last war we were fortunate, accidentally to a large extent, in that under both these heads actual preparations had been made.  I am suggesting that accidental circumstances may not always help, and the situation may be more complex.  Our energy resources should be reviewed by the Minister's Department with a view to co-ordination in an emergency situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of supplies is more complex and more likely to be unpredictable.  It is certain to be difficult.  Flexible consideration of this problem is desirable.  I urge the Minister to see that the strength of the staffs is adequate for these purposes. There is no need for a great commitment.  One could overdo the commitment in regard to numbers or activities.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned food, fuel and supplies.  Transport and communications are two other headings.  Transport comes much nearer to the actual operations of the Department and the Defence Forces.  Whether it is on land, sea or in the air, the liaison between all the transport resources of the State and the Minister's Department, and their possible role, should be kept under constant survey, even for security purposes.  I am sure this is being done.  It is very desirable that there should be a constant and ongoing review, and that the necessary routine contacts should be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same thing goes for communications of every nature, international as well as internal.  Lastly, the industrial resources of the country should be surveyed and kept within purview. This is all basic staff work.  It is remote to the extent that it should not be a preoccupation.  It would be undesirable to get one's priorities all wrong but the past experience of this and other democracies is that it could be postponed too long.  The obvious solution is to have some staff, both civil and military, establishing the necessary liaison in the broader field, taking a broad view and constantly anticipating problems as far as possible, without going into too much detail, and without evaporating&mdash;and there is this danger&mdash;into a theoretical sphere of imagination which, perhaps, in some ways, could be more dangerous <Col N="374" /> than not looking at the problem at all.  A balance is called for.</P>
    <P>These are the first phases.  I will come to the technology of it afterwards. Food, fuel, supplies, transport, communications and general industrial liaison are the considerations. This is the right approach in the broader context I tried to indicate earlier.  It will also be of very material help in the security problem.  In saying these things I am not faulting the Defence Forces or the Department. I am merely using the occasion to call attention to the matter.</P>

      <P>I understand that while no redundancies have yet arisen at the factory in question, the proprietors are considering possible rationalisation measures in the light of the current cattle supply situation.</P>
      <P>This is, however, the normal seasonal valley period for cattle supplies and it is estimated that total cattle slaughterings for the year may be about the same level as 1974 which, apart from the exceptional level of 1975, was the highest ever and far surpassed those of any previous year.</P>
      <P>As regards the general cattle supply situation, I would refer the Deputy to my replies to earlier questions in this regard on 4th November, 1975, and 3rd March, 1976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that 50 to 60 redundancies are threatened in this factory and that the same situation obtains in other factories, particularly in the Kildare area?  While I agree with him that <Col N="375" /> this is due to shortage of cattle for slaughter, I would also say that it is due to bad agricultural policy.  Can the Minister give us any promise that he will devise some scheme to ensure continuity of supplies so that this will not happen in the future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This year we have for slaughter cattle up to the level of supplies in 1974, which was second highest on record.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had approximately the same number of in-calf heifers every year in the last five years.  The increase in cow numbers was because cows were not culled in anticipation of high EEC prices.  In 1972 and 1973 they were kept over but they were disposed of in exceptional numbers last year. We have approximately the same level of breeding stock as we had heretofore and we have approximately the same number of in-calf heifers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Press reports alleging incursions by British Army helicopters near Carrigans in County Donegal on 6th March.  I can assure the Deputy that, as is customary, the matter was raised with the British authorities who have said that while they had two helicopters in the general area at the time neither crossed the Border at any stage.  It is possible that either the ground eye witnesses or the pilots made a minor error as to the precise location of the helicopters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary indicate if at any stage any Minister gave permission to the British Army to overfly our territory?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy that information.  The Deputy's question refers to a particular incident. I know a bit more about that but I do not know if, in general, permissions were sought or granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>We hear a lot about incursions along the Border area. Apparently the British Army are bad at map-reading because on occasions in the past when there was an incursion we were told it was due to an error in map-reading.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary find out if there were such incursions recently because of such errors and if any permission was granted to the British authorities to overfly our territory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relying on memory now and I do not want to be held on this, but I think I remember the <Col N="379" /> Minister, in reply to similar questions, saying that permissions were occasionally sought beforehand.  That would not be counted as an incursion and it would not be reported as such if a British or any other aircraft flew over our territory.  There are occasionally reports of incursions and they are always taken up with the British authorities.  There have been a small number this year so far&mdash; roughly the same as last year.  Some of them have been admitted and an apology has been made and some are in dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>My memory is to the effect that the Minister said something on those lines in answer to similar questions but I do not want to bind him with that recollection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary say what is the difference between giving permission for flights over our territory and permission for incursions on the ground?  Have the ground forces received permission to cross at any stage?</P>

      <P>The costs of providing and maintaining a kiosk at the place in question would, it is considered, far exceed likely receipts.  Moreover, kiosks are not provided in rural areas where there is no post office. The erection of a kiosk at Highwood, Kilmactranny, cannot therefore be favourably considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the amount provided in the Estimate for his Department for 1976 under subhead G.2 for recoupment of expenses of the General Medical Services (Payments) Board; how this compares with the actual expenditure by the board for this purpose in 1975; and if the amount provided for 1976 will necessarily involve a cut-back in the general medical service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount provided for the General Medical Services (Payments) Board under subhead G.2 of the Vote for the Department of Health in the current year is £24.120 million compared with an expenditure of £21.5 million in 1975.  The 1976 allocation is estimated to be sufficient to maintain services at the 1975 level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that an increase from £21 million to £24 million is anywhere near adequate <Col N="381" /> in the light of the general economic and financial situation with inflation calculated to be at least 15 or 16 per cent during the coming year and with increasing costs generally? Is the Minister satisfied that the figure provided is a realistic one or is it simply a book-keeping exercise to try to present some feasible appearance to the budgetary provisions?  Surely it is obvious to the Minister that if the general medical services costs £21.5 million in 1975 they will cost a great deal more than £24 million in 1976, even allowing that there will be no increase of any sort in the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the services can be maintained.  I should like to point out to the Deputy that of the £21.5 million paid to the General Medical Services (Payment) Board in 1975 a sum of £1.3 million was included for arrears of payments to the medical profession, to doctors specifically.  Therefore, the actual figure for 1975 was £20.2 million and in 1976 it is £24.12 million, an increase for 1976 of £3.2 million which represents an increase of 19 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

Can the Minister give an assurance that the figure he has mentioned is adequate for all the purposes during the year?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, also with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report a statement showing the allocation for non-capital expenditure in 1976 for each of the health boards <Col N="385" /> and the boards' estimates of expenditure for 1976.  The table will show that, for all the health boards, the difference between the allocations and their estimates was £10.788 million, or about 6 per cent.  It is not correct to describe this difference as a &ldquo;deficit&rdquo;.  As I pointed out in speaking on the Deputy's motion on 3rd March&mdash;Official Report, Volume 228, column 1260&mdash;it is customary for estimates of bodies such as health boards to be reduced after examination.  The examination of the boards' estimates, with a view to reconciliation, has been carried out by my Department with the officers of the health boards.</P>
      <P>In the case of four of the boards&mdash; the southern, the mid-western, the north-western and the north-eastern, it has been possible to achieve full reconciliation on the basis of repricing of certain items to relate them clearly to 1975 levels and by economies in expenditure on &ldquo;housekeeping&rdquo;&mdash; including maintenance&mdash;on transport services, on replacement of equipment, reducing locum cover and overtime to essential levels and similar items.  Increased income to the boards was also provided for, including the increase in charges for private patients which will come into effect on 1st April.</P>
      <P>For three other health boards&mdash;the western, the south-eastern and the midland&mdash;similar revisions of estimates were achieved and these have reduced the differences between the estimates and the allocations to a figure totalling about £1,300,000.  Further discussions are proceeding on the elimination of these balances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of reconciliation of the difference in the case of the Eastern Health Board was similar to that for the other health boards.  The board's estimate was examined in detail, in consultations between officers of my Department and its officers.  The estimate made by the board had not been based strictly on maintenance of 1975 levels and the examination between <Col N="386" /> the Department and its officers resulted in reductions on this account in the estimated figures under several headings.  Furthermore, it was agreed that the provision made in the estimates for some items could be repriced. In particular, the provision for overdraft interest was reduced by £200,000 and the provision for receipts was increased by £120,000.</P>
    <P>The estimate as prepared by the Eastern Health Board had included provision of £1,900,000 for maintenance works on buildings and so on. It was put to the Board's officers that, in the present difficult financial situation, this figure could be reduced very considerably.  A reduction of £700,000 was agreed to in it.</P>
    <P>The total reduction in the estimate as originally prepared by the board arising from these discussions was £2,946,000.  The &ldquo;gap&rdquo; between the board's original estimate and the allocation which I had made to it was thus reduced to £773,000.  It was also intimated to the board that I would consider a proposal, which I will be referring to in a reply to another of the Deputy's questions, on the scheme for subsidising drugs for the middle income group and a proposal in relation to charges in hospitals which could reduce this deficit further.  In the estimation of the board's chief executive officer this will reduce the difference to the figure of £323,000 referred to by the Deputy.  The chief executive officer reported this new position to the board at their meeting on 4th March and the board have accepted the situation as thus reported.  Discussions will continue with the Eastern Health Board on the elimination of the remaining part of the &ldquo;deficit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As regards Question No. 22, the matter of revising the allocations for non-capital expenditure to health boards in 1976 for the purpose mentioned by the Deputy does not arise.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister suggest to the House that this is a serious proposal?  Is he endeavouring to suggest to the House that the executive officers of the different health boards submitted estimates which were irresponsibly inflated to the extent of £10 million?  Is there any other explanation of the fact that officers of his Department are able to go along to the different health boards and reduce the budgets submitted by £10 million simply by examining these estimates on paper? Would the Minister indicate which is the situation?  Were the estimates fraudulent in the first place or is the alleged reduction which the Minister now proposes to make fraudulent? Which is the situation?</P>

      <P>The estimates are framed and the amounts agreed by the health boards are sufficient to maintain the services at the 1975 level.  In this House in the last few debates there was from practically every Deputy who spoke a reference to what they considered to be a certain amount of wastage in the health services and they suggested that economies could be achieved. That appeared to me to be the consensus of opinion among a certain number of Deputies excluding the Deputy who asked the question but as a former Minister for Finance I am sure he will agree that while the estimates may not be described as being inflated there is an inclination towards an element of over-estimation as far as expenditure is concerned. The various health boards were approached through their CEOs. The CEOs in turn consulted the members of the health boards and, as I have indicated in my reply, five of them agreed that these economies could be made without damaging the service.  In respect of the others where there still is an outstanding deficit it is proposed to have further consultations with the health boards to see if other economies can be effected.</P>
      <P>I have in the course of a recent speech on the Deputy's motion indicated the improvement in real terms in the health services up to 1975.  I have no hesitation in saying that we must look for economies in this year where there is undoubtedly constraint. The Deputy can lay the blame on this person, that Minister, or the other Minister but the fact is that the situation does not allow me, does not allow the Government, to make the improvements that all of us would desire but I think in 1976 and without any damage or danger to patient care or to the health services generally what has been agreed with the majority of the health boards and accepted by the actual members of the health boards is desirable.</P>

This is something that I intend to give consideration to and I will be referring to it in my reply to the Second Stage debate on the Health Contributions Bill.  In reply to the first part of Deputy Coughlan's supplementary question, yes, I am satisfied that as far as patient care is concerned 1975 standards can be achieved.</P>

I want to assure you, a Cheann Comhairle, that that is all I am endeavouring to ascertain by this process of questioning.  It is a very important question and is one of considerable public interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not done it so far.  The Minister has indicated that various devices have been resorted to in an attempt to eliminate the deficit of £3.72 million in the Eastern Health Board financial situation. I want to suggest to him that these alleged measures which the Department of Health have worked out <Col N="391" /> in collusion with the executive officers of the Eastern Health Board are illusory and that, in fact, this deficit of £3.72 million still exists.  Can he seriously suggest that a figure of maintenance of £1.9 million in the Eastern Health Board can be reduced by £700,000 in a realistic way and is this not simply a device, a bookkeeping affair and that, in fact, the deficit is still there? Do the measures which the Department of Health officials have worked out with the Eastern Health Board officials include, as in the case of St. Loman's, removing cornflakes from the breakfast menu, providing simpler desserts, cutting down on minerals and soft drinks with meals, cutting out patients' cigarette allowances, cutting out newspaper allowances for patients? Are these the sort of economies which his officials have worked out with the Eastern Health board officials or is he still prepared to deny that these restrictions and cutbacks are in force in St. Loman's Hospital, which is typical of this whole exercise carried out by the Department of Health?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>These allegations were refuted by me some weeks ago and I still refute them.  There will be no diminution as far as the services to these people are concerned.  As I said, all this was suggested in some newspaper article by some unnamed spokesman.  I resent Deputy Haughey saying that these cuts were done in collusion with the CEOs.  The various health boards met and considered this and, in respect of about five of them, the various health boards agreed these economies should be made.  Deputy Haughey continues to repeat things he said here about a month ago and I can only come to the conclusion that what he is trying to do is to cause mischief within the health boards.  The various allegations that have gone around about cutting out this, that and the other as far as patients are concerned are wrong and will the Deputy not now accept my assurance that, as far as I am concerned, the 1975 level will be maintained?</P>

      <P>If the Minister had answered my questions in the case of each health board separately and specifically, as the Chair would like us to ask supplementary questions, there would have been no difficulty, but the Minister did not do that.  He lumped everything together so that he would not have to deal directly with a particular instance.  The Minister has again denied that these cutbacks, these economies, have been put into force in St. Loman's.  Is he aware of the fact that the journalist who published the original disclosure in regard to this hospital has since interviewed the executive concerned personally and has been able to ascertain beyond yea or nay that these economies and cutbacks are now in force and, as to 99 per cent, the original articlie he published on the situation there has been verified by him personally in consultation with the authorities of that hospital? Further, is this typical of the manner in which all these alleged economies have been carried out and given effect to and is the whole process of apparently reducing this Eastern Health Board by £3.72 million not simply a fraudulent exercise by the Minister's Department on the health board concerned?</P>

Am I to take it they have agreed on that? Secondly, am I further to take it that in answer to a question earlier asked by Deputy Haughey the Minister said no direction was issued by the Department for any cutback? I take the Minister's word for it, but he also said they must live within their budget and the budget is not sufficient to carry on the service as it was carried on last year.  This is the position: first, the Minister says there will be no cutback and then he says there is a certain amount of money within which they must work.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is satisfied that attempts by health board programme managers to dictate to medical practitioners in the general medical service the patterns of visiting and prescribing for patients to be followed is in the best interests of public health; and, if not, if he will direct that all such attempts be discontinued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information that any officers of the health boards attempt to dictate practice patterns. Health boards monitor the visiting and prescribing patterns of doctors engaged in the general medical service and provide them regularly with information which enables them to compare their performance with that of their colleagues.  Where the visiting or prescribing patterns of individual practitioners are greatly in excess of those of their colleagues they may be referred for examination by an investigating group appointed for that purpose. This group is representative of the medical organisations and the General Medical Services (Payments) Board, with an independent chairman.</P>
      <P>Monitoring of performance is necessary, is acceptable to the profession and I am satisfied that it should be continued.  It has been in operation since the scheme was inaugurated in 1972.</P>

I am concerned with the different health boards this year being forced as an economy measure, not as a normal matter of good administration but as an economy measure, to lay down particular patterns for visiting and prescribing by practitioners under the general medical services.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that the intention of health board managements to eliminate all overtime and not to permit annual or illness leave substitutions in hospitals and institutions under their control must inevitably interfere with the general level of efficiency in these institutions and result in excessively long working hours for the staffs concerned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that it is the intention of health board managements to eliminate all overtime and not to permit annual or illness leave substitutions in hospitals and institutions under their control. I do not, therefore, accept the inferences drawn in the latter part of the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>I am aware that health board managements intend to monitor and control overtime and annual and illness leave substitutions more closely than may have been the practice in the past and to authorise expenditure in these areas only when it is proved to be unavoidable.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this exercise of management responsibility can and will be done in a way which will not interfere with the general level of efficiency in the hospitals and institutions concerned.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that management teams in practically every health board have put forward as a positive proposal to their boards precisely this suggestion which I have outlined in my question, namely, that annual or illness leave substitutions in hospitals and institutions under their control will not be permitted?  Is he not aware that in every regional health board throughout the country health boards are pursuing a policy of restricting all forms of leave substitutions and that everybody concerned recognises that this is <Col N="399" /> going to mean excessively long working hours for staff?  If he is not aware of the situation, will he have it investigated and see to it that neither the quality of the service these staffs give nor their work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While, as will be clear from my replies to the Deputy's earlier questions, the financial circumstances of the present year do not allow for additional <Col N="400" /> expenditure in real terms on the meals-on-wheels and home help services, I am satisfied that the general allocations to the health boards will allow for a continuance of these services at 1975 levels.</P>

Is that the extent of the guarantee he can give? Does he not realise that, in present circumstances, simply not to reduce expenditure could still result in a very severe cutback in these services? Is he not aware that in a number of health boards a very definite proposal to restrict meals-on-wheels and the other ancillary community services has been put forward for serious consideration and that the levels of money which are allocated for these services almost certainly indicate that these very desirable, essential humanitarian services will be severely reduced and limited this year?</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that health boards will ensure that the manner in which savings in heating costs will be achieved will not lead to hardship or suffering, particularly in the case of elderly patients in homes and institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that cutbacks to the extent which is agreed apparently between his officials and the Eastern Health Board in this area must inevitably result in a very serious lowering of the levels of heat, to mention just one aspect, in these homes and institutions? This can, and undoubtedly will, give rise to very serious hardship to the inmates of the various institutions. Is he not aware that the level of the cuts proposed in the Eastern Health Board and in other health board areas is such that suffering, hardship and discomfort are inevitable unless he positively intervenes to ensure that adequate allocations are made for fuel and energy supplies?</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Defence).</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The general remarks which I made before Question Time were necessarily vague because one does not wish to sound alarmist unless there are very good grounds for adopting such an attitude and, secondly, one should have regard to our proportion in a world community and in our own environment. I should hope that it was a sense of responsibility which prevented me from being more specific.  However, it may be that an attempt at specification would have no further value than that of a mere academic discourse. But there is a broader aspect of responsibility in the field of defence and I shall be more specific now in relation to a few headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the need from a staff point of view for foresight and co-ordination with energy development and requirements in transport and communications in the broad sense but I shall move on now to the question of the similar necessity in regard to the co-ordination of medical resources <Col N="413" /> and supplies, hospitals and so on.  These are areas in which certain alternative contingencies can be foreseen in a broad and general way and where at least information can be obtained and collated and contacts made with other elements in the community and other Departments of State that are likely to be involved in a deteriorating situation.  Much of that had been more or less achieved accidentally before the last calamity but it is a matter which should not be left again to accident should the need arise.</P>
    <P>To turn now to the question of what is required specifically in the area of defence, it goes without saying that there must be an adequate Department administratively to deal with this field of activity, and that there must be a defence force of sufficient strength and equipment.  It is said that it is an ill wind that blows no good and the ill winds of the requirements of peace-keeping activities abroad in the fifties and sixties and of the disorders of the present day, have at least contributed to and determined to a large extent the strength at which our forces can be maintained.  I recall in my early days in the House in the forties trying to convince Ministers of more than one government of the need to keep up the strength of the Army although it may have appeared then that there was very little to be done in the area of defence.  However, the requirements of peace-keeping abroad in the first instance as well as the troubles nearer home have secured that we have a regular establishment. That is a vast improvement on what was the relevant position before the last calamity.</P>
    <P>Those strengths should be regarded as a permanent feature of our Defence Forces and not merely as a temporary increase in numbers and equipment, that is, if we are to have a Defence force at all.  I say that, too, from the point of view of those who make the Army a career, both on the military and civil side because within the Defence Forces they can have as much job satisfaction as is to be obtained in any other sphere.  However, the greater problem of the moment is <Col N="414" /> to supply all the necessary facilities to enable the defence units to function. I shall not attempt to go into the day-to-day matters or into detail regarding weaponry or organisation because I do not know anything about that but my experience as chairman of a committee of this House is very reassuring in regard to the existence of the same hard-headedness that prevailed, for instance, before the last war when our people, to take a minor example, took the independent decision, regardless of the decision of the British, to begin to equip the force with Bren guns.  There was the enlightenment of the force when, for example, they got the 3.7 mm batteries or when they got the 81 mm mortar.  I am glad to say that spirit of responsibility and initiative is still there.  It would not be right for me to comment on any equipment the Army have or have not.  I believe it is right to express confidence and to feel that our general staff, technical staff and the civil adjuncts are alive and responsible in getting equipment and the necessities in order that the Army may do their job.  They are doing this in a responsible and businesslike way and can be utterly trusted to make the best use of the public funds put at their disposal.  I am glad to be able to say that from a certain amount of experience of what I have seen as a Deputy in the House and in committees. That combination of enterprise and hard-headedness is to be encouraged. It would be unseeming to presume to offer the Minister advice in this matter because he has good advisers on both sides and the matter can be competently left to them.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the Reserves.  Tributes have been paid to the standard of the FCA and the Reserves, with which I join wholeheartedly. However, I feel that this is an area where one can put off things too long.  When one has a regular Defence Force of a certain strength adequate and doing their job well we should have a proportionate number of Reserves to cope with the broader aspect.  By this I mean Reserves having a certain basic training that enables them to come in as needed.  I do not believe it is necessary <Col N="415" /> to expand on this.  On more than one occasion in the House I outlined that in 1939-40 we were fortunate in having two Reserves built up, one from the 1920s and the other in the 1930s. The first was sufficiently trained to take their place immediately and carry a load that would have been impossible even for local security in 1939. The second was so trained that they were able to take their places in the short time available before it came to the general recruitment of the emergency Army.</P>
    <P>I would like to see as much attention as possible given to increasing the number of personnel, particularly the officer and leader Reserves and also the rank and file Reserves.  This ensures that if the time arrives when they are wanted they are there to be quickly absorbed.  They expand quickly the skeleton on which a wider mobilisation can be made.  I believe that point is worthy of attention. This matter has given rise to certain anxiety because one feels that Reserve strength may not be adequate and also that some intermediate provision for something between the completely voluntary part-time Reserve like the FCA and the whole-time regiment is needed, particularly where commissioned ranks are concerned. That was there previously but I do not think it is there now.</P>
    <P>One wants to condition the mentality of people to take part in a military organisation.  I am talking about professional people, doctors, scientists, engineers, chemists, physicists and various other people whose services are needed both in peace and war.  The advantage of having a Reserve Force with some of those people already there is that they are conditioned to military organisation and can fit in.  During the last war many eminent surgeons were commissioned to be ready for a contingency. That type of Reserve needs consideration.</P>
    <P>That is tied up with Civil Defence and the Garda.  The Civil Defence end in turn goes back to the general staff concept, such as the Red Cross in <Col N="416" /> relation to the medical reserves and fire fighting in relation to other matters.  The question of Reserves should be considered under three headings.  The first is increasing the strength of the FCA.  The second is the provision of something more sophisticated and experienced, particularly where officers and leaders are concerned.  This will require a certain modicum of full-time training, which is very difficult to achieve nowadays. The ideal is a short service and then retiring to civilian life with a commitment to being on the Reserve.  The third heading is the professional tie-in, if I might call it that.</P>
    <P>The last matter I want to refer to is the question of technology.  It is very easy to be defeatist here especially in the modern, highly organised world but we must remember that our industry and technology are improving. When we were up against it the last time we were able to fill some gaps in a relatively amateurish way. We used contraptions of various sorts. However, we were able to harness our technical, scientific and industrial resources to fill some gaps.  We should not forget that lesson.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister, as I urged his predecessors, to provide something on those lines.  We could have specially trained people on reserve and we could have them interested in the Army apart from having people with sufficient technical knowhow in the Defence Forces.  Experience justifies this even though it is very easy to take the defeatist attitude: &ldquo;When one looks at computers and what modern rockets can do it seems a little silly to consider those things&rdquo;.  There are a few good reasons for this.  It is no harm to study a problem near one. It is surprising what results one can get when one is up against it.  Another reason is one which I hesitate to mention. We can see in other places, with all the discouragement of an organised State, police forces, security forces and all the rest, what perverted ingenuity can do.  I have a little interest in that because I was involved in that type of exercise the last time.  I do not want to expand on that.</P>
    <P>These are points I would commend <Col N="417" /> to the Minister.  I have asked for close co-ordination between the different Departments of State in the matter of food, fuel, transport, communications, energy, and specifically in regard to medical reserves, professional reserves and Civil Defence, and what I might call emergency improvisation. Let us not forget these things, while naturally being preoccupied with the task of the moment, that is, security. Because I have not commented on it I must not be taken as ignoring it.  I do not want to minimise the importance and the value of the services given there.  I have not spoken on this Estimate for quite some time.  Now and then somebody should stand back and look at the overall picture and assess it.  The Department of Defence always have to look ahead and be ready for contingencies.</P>
    <P>My necessary vagueness in this initial attempt to analyse the problems will be understood, I hope.  I do not want to be thought of as being fuzzy in my thinking.  I hope my vagueness will be attributed charitably to an attempt to be prudent rather than being woolly and vague. That woolliness and vagueness were imposed on me by prudence.  I would ask the Minister to spare a moment to consider the general points I have tried to make in all the hurly-burly of the present problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with others who have congratulated the Minister and who have shown their support for our forces and the admiration they have for the men who comprise our forces.  I should like to praise, if I may, the wonderful job they are doing for us. As the previous speaker said, they are in a peculiar situation in that they are lined up behind, and more or less helping, the forces of the Department of Justice, the Garda, in large areas.  I want to pay my own small tribute to the men who are doing this work.  Everybody realises this is a very important part of the work of our Army.  We are sorry and saddened that it has to be done and that our Army have to be involved in this type of operation to ensure <Col N="418" /> that people can feel secure and safe in their own homes.</P>
      <P>The Minister said these forces will co-operate for as long as is necessary in this field, and ensure that the rule of law prevails.  That is what the vast majority of our people want to see the Army doing.  No matter what their politics may be, the vast majority of our people feel our Army are doing an excellent job in preserving peace and the rule of law in this State.</P>
      <P>The co-operation, the comradeship, that has grown up between the Garda and the Army is a good thing and we are very proud of it.  These men are doing this work unstintingly.  They are helping in various ways, by setting up road blocks and by bomb disposals, to ensure that democracy prevails within our community.  They deserve our unreserved thanks and appreciation for the job they are doing in this field.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be congratulated on the fact that the numbers in the Army stand at the highest in over 25 years.  That is as it should be.  Over the years, no matter which Government or which Minister was in office when, for some reason or another, we wanted a strong Army, we always seemed to be caught with the Army at a very low level.  During the past few years the Minister has been fairly successful in building up our Army and in getting recruits.  I hope that, when this emergency is over, as I hope it will be very soon, we will keep a strong and large Army.  It was a mistake to allow our Army to drop to the level to which it dropped.  Then we tried to rush in to mend that position if we needed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should maintain the Army at a very high level at all times.  If we have to let its strength drop a bit, we should ensure that we have trained personnel on reserve, officers and men who could be called upon in an emergency. We should keep the strength of the force relatively high and it could be increased without any great difficulty or without a long recruiting campaign.  I am glad to see that more money is being spent on the Army now than ever before.  Even <Col N="419" /> allowing for inflation, the Army are well paid.  A good relationship has been built up with the authorities and the Army are looked upon as providing a very good way of life for any young man.  Many young people would be better off if they spent a few years in the Army in the early part of their lives.  This would fit them for other spheres of activity within the community.  I am glad to note training courses are available within the Army for suitable people and I would like to see this extended in a big way so that people who joined the Army might qualify as tradesmen in various fields.</P>
    <P>It would help the nation to have a trained force of workers ready and willing to take their place in the work of the nation outside the Army if they did not feel they should make the Army their career.  It would be better for themselves and better for the nation.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the image of the Army was not as good as it is now. There seemed to be an impression that it was not the most desirable kind of life.  I can assure the Minister that this is changing and people nowadays have a high regard for our Defence Forces.  At one time some of the district justices recommended to people who were in trouble with the law that they should join the Army.  There may have been something in that but now only the best type of young man is good enough for our Defence Forces and that is as it should be.  sometimes we may go a little too far in this direction but, at the same time, it improves the image of the Army with people who have no connections with it.</P>
    <P>I am glad that money is being provided for the purchase of horses for the Army.  We have had some success by Army officers in the past year. Taking part in shows and in world horse jumping competitions is an important contribution by the Army in peace time.  It helps to advertise Irish horses and we have proved that our horses and riders are second to none. While we may not have the glories of <Col N="420" /> previous years in this area, we have the nucleus to build up teams equal to those wonderful teams of the past.</P>
    <P>There were certain provisions in the Estimates that I was very happy to see although I thought there might have been a little more.  The Minister hopes to arrange for the building of an additional 50 houses in the Curragh area for members of the Defence Forces and, as a Kildare man, I am delighted about this.  It should be the policy of the Minister and his Department to ensure that those serving in the Army are properly housed.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a matter that has been a sore point in Kildare during the years, namely, the overholders.  I know that it has been the attitude of the Department for many years that when a man finishes his work in the Army that more or less means the end of the Army's responsibility towards him in the matter of housing. I do not agree with this totally.  If a man completes 20 or 30 years service in the Army and retires he cannot get his pension if he is still residing in Army quarters.  Something must be done about this matter.</P>
    <P>Kildare County Council are allocating a number of houses in each scheme that is adjacent to the Curragh and the Army authorities will appoint the most deserving overholders as tenants.  This scheme may solve the problem of the number of men who retire each year and who need rehousing.  However, there is a substantial backlog and there are many people who have no hope of getting out of the Army houses.  In order to get work of a civilian nature in the military camp they have to leave the married quarters.  Thus, they are put at a great disadvantage.  I know that the Minister's answer will be that any money he has for housing must be spent on accommodation for serving soldiers and I appreciate that point.  However, some arrangement should be made, perhaps with the county council, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Defence in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Department of Defence have a <Col N="421" /> certain responsibility towards those people.  On behalf of the overholders, I want to put on record that they feel aggrieved and let down.  After serving the country for more than 30 years they cannot get employment in the military camp and they are deprived of their pension because they are still living in Army housing.  As far as they are concerned they are being penalised for something that is not their fault.  There must be some way during their career in the Army where they could make some arrangements: perhaps they could build houses for themselves with the help of loans so that when they retire they have their own houses and are able to act like ordinary citizens, not having to exist under the strain of being overholders, denied their pension and the right of employment in their own area.</P>
    <P>There were complaints about those houses.  I accept that it was a pilot scheme but in providing houses for soldiers, and others, we should ensure that there is more privacy for householders.  Orchard Park was an open plan scheme but I believe it could have been better planned.  It could have been planned in such a way that each person would know the boundary of his front and back garden. It is not easy on an open plan estate for people to have much privacy or to be in a position to cultivate their gardens.  People cross the gardens for short cuts.  The gardens in houses provided for military personnel should be protected in the same way as gardens of houses provided by local authorities.  I do not accept that the open plan housing schemes provided by local authorities proved successful either.</P>
    <P>There is a need to improve the billets at the Curragh.  This is long overdue. The young men who join the Army are entitled to the best facilities available.  They are prepared to give their services to the country and tie themselves down.  I am aware that the Minister is doing his best in this regard and I look forward to the day when every billet and other accommodation for Army personnel is up to a proper standard.  Officers, NCOs and men should be provided with proper <Col N="422" /> accommodation and the facilities made available to them should be first class.</P>
    <P>Good employment is given to civilians in the Curragh Camp.  This could be extended and it should be possible to have civilians carry out some of the duties of the serving soldiers. If this was possible it would be a great help in these times of high unemployment. I was glad to learn that NCOs can follow a course which could lead to their promotion to the officer ranks.  I feel that a big proportion of our officers should come through the rank and file of the Army.  In my view officers who have served through the ranks make better officers.  The man who joins the Army as a private should be able to feel that there is a prospect of him being promoted to the officer ranks.</P>
    <P>In my view the kind of investigation that goes on with regard to the means test for Old IRA pensions is mean.  I am aware that the means are not investigated by officers of the Department of Defence but it is a pity that a person who may get a small increase in an old age pension should have his Army or Old IRA pension cut by a similar amount.  Such people helped to gain for us the measure of freedom we now enjoy.  We should not be penny-pinching with these people.  I do not know what the regulations with regard to the means test are but they should be eased and a more sensible and flexible approach adopted.  It is frustrating for those in receipt of such pensions to know that as soon as they receive an increase in a social welfare benefit their pension is cut accordingly.</P>
    <P>On the question of housing of military personnel there is the view that there is a kind of obstruction to them getting local authority houses.  This is wrong.  Anybody who applies for a house from the local authority in my constituency will not have his chances improved, or otherwise, by the fact that he is a serving soldier.</P>
    <P>There are people who think that because Army houses are available local authority houses will not be available to Army personnel.  On a number of occasions I have met <Col N="423" /> people who thought that because they were serving soldiers their chance of getting a local authority house would be reduced.  I am not referring to persons living in married quarters.  I am speaking about serving soldiers living outside barracks.  The local authority of which I am a member treat these applicants in the same way as they treat civilian applicants. I say that for the specific purpose of letting it be known that that is the case because I have met persons who believed that local authorities were of the opinion that serving soldiers should be housed by the Army and not by the local authority.  No such objection is raised in the local authority of which I am a member and I do not believe that such objection is raised in any other local authority.</P>
    <P>I would pay tribute to the Minister for allowing neighbouring sporting organisations certain facilities to play games on the plains of the Curragh which are vested in him as Minister. That is the correct policy.  Where facilities are available in a military installation, as far as possible and to the extent that security allows, facilities should be made available to civilian clubs.  This would foster greater understanding between the civilian population and the military.</P>
    <P>The helicopter service has endeared the Defence Forces to the public.  The public realise that the Defence Forces are there to help them in emergencies.  The helicopter service helps in the transportation of patients and in rescue operations.</P>
    <P>Civil Defence is something that we should develop in such a way that persons who are too young to join the Defence Forces could acquire the rudiments of military training to prepare them for careers in the Defence Forces.  This would provide skilled recruits for the Army.  The people who have done so much for Civil Defence deserve our thanks and deep appreciation.  They educate people in medical as well as other matters.  The Civil Defence movement should be encouraged and recruitment to the Army from the Civil Defence force <Col N="424" /> would be desirable.  Civil Defence training should be carried out in military installations where Army and Civil Defence personnel would mix and would carry out exercises and manoeuvres together.  This would help to cement friendship between the Army and Civil Defence personnel.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing a good job in creating a new image for the Defence Forces.  People are proud to say that they belong to the Army and they have every reason to be proud.  The people have reason to be proud of our Army and should appreciate the work done by the Army throughout the land in preventing subversives from doing more damage.</P>
    <P>The manning of installations by the Army is a good thing.  The Army at present man installations that are not military installations.  That policy should be extended.  For instance, post offices where large robberies have been carried out should be under military supervision when large amounts of money are being transferred.  The subversive activities that are carried out would be reduced if these robberies had been prevented.  This is not an easy matter.  If there had been a military presence when there were large amounts of money in various post offices this money would not be available to subversive organisations and their activities would be reduced.  It might be worth considering having Army or joint Army/Garda supervision of places where there are large deposits of public money.  This would mean that there would be less of this kind of money available to subversives for their evil work.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing a good job. In his term in office he has brought to the Army a better image that that which prevailed previously.  I hope that will continue and that we will all have for our Defence Forces the respect we should have for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have this opportunity of speaking on this Estimate and I compliment the Defence Forces for their loyalty, attention to duty and total dependability. Ours is an Army that has never wavered.  It took an emergency <Col N="425" /> to bring home to us the worth of our Army and, as a previous speaker on this side said, it is an ill wind that blows nobody good.  It is unfortunate that the circumstances which have channelled such a lot of money into the Army were brought about by the actions of pseudo-patriots, madmen, whose actions have necessitated this expenditure.  At the same time, I am glad this money is being devoted to the Defence Forces and I am pleased that we are now in a position, a position we did not have for a long time, in which we can spend money on the Army.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister, too, on reading the discussion document our party brought out containing our proposals for the future of the Army.  I compliment him on the fact that he was not loath to use some of the things we suggested where he felt they were good and could be effective.  We saw one of the roles of the Army in that document as assisting in times of national disaster.  The Minister, in his brief, said that it must never be forgotten that the Army is in the nature of things an armed force maintained by the Government for the essential purpose of defending the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like now to deal with a matter which is very important from the point of view of the Army and Army morale.  Morale is uppermost in everyone's mind and anything that those in authority do to lessen morale is a retrograde step.  Today we have a country very close to us honouring a great soldier, Montgomery, a great general and military commander who did good work for that neighbouring country in the last war.  We, too, should honour this man because, if one were to say which is black and which is white, I would definitely assert that Montgomery was on the side of right and by his actions he helped to preserve us.  I notice from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 23rd March that the late Winston Churchill, in paying tribute to him, referred to him as a Cromwellian figure, austere, severe, accomplished, peerless, his life given to the study of war, which attracted to him in an extraordinary measure the confidence and devotion of the army.  It is important <Col N="426" /> that our Minister and everyone connected with the Army should endeavour to preserve these qualities and ensure that the confidence and the morale of the Army are not impaired.</P>
    <P>I grant the present Minister has an interest in the Army.  I am sure he has the common touch, too, that helps in his dealings with army personnel but he must accept some blame for the great blow he struct at the morale of our Army when he made his famous doomsday situation speech.  In that he indicated that it was the duty of our Army in a doomsday situation to show no interest in what went on in the North.  This has never been refuted by the Taoiseach or by any member of the Government so we must assume this is Government policy.  We were criticised when we made a statement on the North and laid our aims clearly on the line.  We were making a declaration of war in advance.  As I see it, the statement by the Minister was a declaration of surrender in advance.  It is the only occasion I know of that anyone in any country attached to the Army was foolish enough to do what the Minister did and the Minister may not be happy in the knowledge now that he has assured for himself a niche in military and political history because of that statement of his.  We have clearly stated that our aim is to reunite the country by peaceful means. We are committed to that.  The Minister admits by his silly remark that he sees the possibility of a doomsday situation.</P>

      <P>The Chair does not want to interrupt the Deputy but in connection with this particular debate the Minister is responsible for the activities of troops in the Border area but a debate on Northern Ireland or the situation there would not be appropriate on this Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has admitted that the situation he envisaged <Col N="427" /> could exist.  Just as in Montgomery's day, when this side of the Border showed an interest in Belfast when Belfast was bombed, and sent ambulances, fire brigades and fire-fighting services to help the Irish people, so, too, have we a commitment to the Irish people in a disaster like that.  I will make no further reference to that irresponsible statement.</P>
      <P>I would like now to refer to the ability of the Army.  This surely concerns us seeing we are spending £79 million on the Army.  I believe the reference made some time ago by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in the present Administration to his feelings about the ability of our Army needs to be mentioned.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, speaking well outside his own role, made an insulting reference to our Army.  He said the Army would not be able to hold the town of Newry in an emergency.  That was an insulting and unforgiveable remark.  It was a slur on the years of work and effort that have gone into the making of our Army and I want to know why the Minister for Defence remained silent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I know many people in the Army.  I know it is a good Army and capable of doing what we want it to do.  I do not agree with the Cabinet's opinion of the ineffectiveness of the Army.  If that particular statement by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is true, I would point out that anyone who makes known the secrets of an army is usually dealt with by being tried as a spy.</P>
      <P>I have every confidence in the ability of our Army.  They have never shirked their duty and in many situations, emergency or otherwise, both at home and abroad, in which they were called upon to give service they have proved how effective they were.  Therefore, if that statement is untrue, as I think it is, it is the duty of the Minister to deny it and to remove this slur that has been cast on our Army.</P>
      <P>I would refer to a sad occasion during the past year when the Minister lost cast with our Army on the question of promotions.  This was a great blow to Army morale, and the Minister should now resort to every plan he can to help to redeem himself and restore morale in the Defence Forces. We pointed out how wrong he was on that occasion.  We pointed out during the debate that his haste was such that he even quoted the wrong Army regulations and that the order under which the promotions were made would not be valid and would not stand up in law.  The Minister told us then that he did not confer with barrackroom lawyers, that he had discussed it with the best legal brains and was assured he was right.  Seeing that the Minister had afterwards to do what we told him he would have to do if he wanted to make the promotions legal, it is obvious that he should have said that he discussed the matter with the best paid legal brains in the country.  We discussed the matter with the best legal brains and were properly advised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on continuing the education opportunities that are afforded to the <Col N="429" /> Army at all levels and the second chance that is afforded to some people. I am involved with the vocational education committee in Kildare, which has close liaison with the Army Apprentice School and Army personnel in the Curragh.  Therefore, I would hope this is something that would continue and would be fostered.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes reference in his speech to games, physical training and other such matters relating to the Army.  I have a feeling&mdash;and I have the facts to prove it&mdash;that there has been a great deterioration in the performance of Army teams in football, hurling and athletics.  Maybe this is just a general pattern which applies also to civilian life.  Maybe the fact that Army life is a little softer today than it was in the emergency days has helped that deterioration.  It is a voluntary activity, but more enouragement should be given to improvements in the performance of our Army personnel.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentions the provision made for the Army Equitation School, the purchase of horses and also the amount won in prize money during the year.  It is a sad state of affairs and there is something very wrong in a country like ours when we have not sufficient good horses left in the country to compete in the Olympic Games.  We pride ourselves on being a leading bloodstock country, a country that can produce the best horses, the best steeplechasers in the world, and this country had a proud place in the equestrian world some years ago.  I do not know where one would start in making improvements in this direction, but I was hopeful that the Minister and especially the Taoiseach who has such an interest in horses might set a headline here. Maybe we have the civilian and Army personnel to ride the horses but the horses are not left here today to represent us as we would like to be represented in the Olympics.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary might think it presumptious of me, being from an inland county, to refer to fishery protection, but I would draw attention to the acknowledged poaching by foreign trawlers that is going <Col N="430" /> on everywhere.  It can be safely said that the coasts of Ireland are now a poachers' paradise for these people, where they have a free run.  I read an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently which stated that early in February 23 French trawlers were reported within four miles of the coast.  I know also that a Dutch fleet who operated off the west coast of Ireland admitted themselves that they took 10,000 tons of fish last year off the Irish coast, and when they admit to that I think we could assume they took more.  They told a friend of mine who was speaking to them that the best catch they had was on the day of the funeral of Éamon de Valera when they felt that the protection personnel might be otherwise engaged.</P>
    <P>We have very little in the corvette line to give fishery protection.  Naval patrols of this nature are slow and limited, and I am told that one fishing boat which the illegal fishers are prepared to leave on point duty at Cobh to give them the warning that the corvette is on its way allows the others to operate freely and illegally off our coasts.  It is obvious we have not enough naval vessels to deal with this and in the present recession I am sure there is no hope of getting more.  I should mention that in the case of the 23 French boats that were fishing inside the limit, by the time the corvette arrived they had removed themselves from the scene with their catches got.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Minister to a court case in Yorkshire in 1975 when, for the first time, legal recognition was given to helicopter evidence which was given and was accepted as being conclusive to warrant a case being brought against the people concerned. If that is the case in England, it is time we should utilise it here. Until such time as this becomes legal and there are no loopholes in it, we should provide further helicopter patrols as a temporary measure which would allow very quick inspection. People in a helicopter could get to any part of the country quickly enough to catch those who are engaging in illegal activity.  It should be tried out and used even as a <Col N="431" /> deterrent for the moment.  I would ask the Minister to look into that straight away.  This will become of greater importance now that we are hoping for an extension of the limits. This extension of the limits will be all right on paper but it will be useless if we are not in a position to enforce fishery protection.  Maybe we will have the EEC fleet to help us if we all fall in line and adopt the EEC proposals. If a corvette apprehends fishermen who are breaking the law and brings them to justice it might be no harm if the Minister consulted with his colleague in Justice to ensure that the fine that is imposed will fit the bill. At the moment the fine is of a nominal nature when one considers the value of the catch they can make and that the confiscation of their gear is usually followed by an auction where they are allowed to buy it back again, so it is no deterrent to those who want to engage in this illegal practice.  This was highlighted when some fishing ship from another nation was fined and the gear confiscated and bought back and when a photograph of her fishing illegally again the following day appeared in the paper.</P>
    <P>There is need for a change here. Our coasts are very attractive and the opportunities for illegal fishing are very lucrative.  We should ensure that the harvest that is there off our coasts will be protected and preserved for our own people.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to the national ex-servicemen.  These people did their bit for the country in the emergency from 1939-1945 and have carried the Irish flag with distinction in the Congo and Cyprus.  At that time they soldiered for very small money. They have shown great loyalty and attention to duty.  I appeal to the Minister to provide a home for old soldiers without dependants.  There would not be a large number of men involved.  He could also provide free medical and hospital treatment at the nearest military barracks for these pensioners.</P>
    <P>About 20 per cent of the wards in the military hospital in the Curragh are used for medical purposes and the rest <Col N="432" /> are used for storage.  It would not be a great task to make provision for military service pensioners here. Some pensioners would be glad to avail of this type of institutional care and we should be prepared to give it to them as well as some modicum of comfort in their retirement.  It would be well at this stage to compare the treatment meted out to our pensioners with that given to British pensioners.  The Minister or his staff should visit Leopardstown Park to view the luxurious set up there for British pensioners.  That might be very revealing indeed.  The British pensioner going in for treatment to one of these institutions gets back his old rank and the current rate of pay for that rank.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to an amendment to a regulation regarding incremental pay brought in in 1974.  An old regulation allows an extra ten years' pension or incremental pay for any ten years' service after 21 years. Many people in our Defence Forces serve from 21 to 31 years.  I know of some people who have 41 years service in the Army.  The new amendment means that these pensioners, when they qualify for a social welfare pension, forfeit the ten years' incremental pay, and in one case I mentioned 20 years. A man I know who has 41 years will lose £25 a month as a result of this amendment.  He was a member of the military police.  In 1957 he was asked to sign on again because his services were required.  The Army wanted him badly.  They impressed on him how much they needed him and the benefits that would accrue to him for his extra service.  I am not too happy about the way he is now being treated.</P>
    <P>This type of treatment would not be tolerated by the Garda.  It is more than a coincidence that the Garda are entitled to have a representative body but military personnel are not.  I appeal to the Minister to look into this matter and correct the situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a specific request to the Minister.  It might not cost too much but it has been a bone of contention for many years.  Part of the pension of a deceased soldier should be available to his widow.  At <Col N="433" /> the moment an officer's widow gets a percentage of her husband's pension &mdash;maybe he paid into a superannuation fund&mdash;but an NCO's pension dies with him, unless it is a disability pension.  It should be remembered that during her husband's lifetime a wife puts up with a great deal of inconvenience. Her husband is called on, and is prepared, to carry out his duties at all times.  These men volunteered for service in Cyprus and in the Congo.</P>
    <P>The widow of a garda is allowed a portion of her husband's pension on his death.  A garda is paid overtime. He might have been working side by side with a member of the Defence Forces for a long time, each experiencing the same hardships, but not enjoying the same overtime.  I hope the Minister will accede to this small request about pensions for soldiers' widows.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased our spokesman on Defence suggested the decentralisation of the Department of Defence. I am more than pleased that the suggested siting for this new headquarters is the Curragh Camp.  I have spoken before on this matter but I am pleased to see that it has now become official Fianna Fáil policy.  After the next election, we are committed to the implementation of this decentralisation.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to convey to the Minister my hope that he will not take any action that will be difficult to undo in the short time that <Col N="434" /> is left to him before we deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>In my view the Curragh is an ideal site for a military headquarters.  It has everything needed from the military, administrative, educational and social points of view.  We appear to stick to tradition.  It should be remembered that we inherited a British system and a British pattern of military barracks.  There is no reason why we should continue to use and feel obliged to maintain this system.  With our population of three million people we should gear our Army to suit our needs.  One good modern headquarters, situated in the Curragh, would be ideal.  Before anybody rushes to suggest that because of the present recession we would be unable to afford this, or suggests that we do not have the money, let me tell the House that money should be no difficulty in this case because we have very valuable property in Dublin. Any of our Dublin barracks would easily make enough on the market, if disposed of, to allow our plan to go ahead.</P>

      <P>In March, 1973, Wicklow County Council acquired 80 acres of sand dunes at Brittas Bay to ensure conservation of the area and to provide for its use as an amenity area. Because of the extensive use of the area by residents of Dublin city and county, including Dún Laoghaire, the authorities in these areas agreed to contribute to the cost of the acquisition and development and my Department provided a grant of £15,000 towards the scheme.  I am satisfied that the preservation of the dunes can be achieved by co-operation between the local authorities concerned and I see no reason for the suggestion that this should be a national charge.</P>
