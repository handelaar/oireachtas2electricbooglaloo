      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable additional assistance to be given from <Col N="1320" /> public funds towards the cost of connecting some isolated houses in rural Ireland to the electricity supply.</P>
    <P>Rural electrification was first commenced in 1946 under the provisions of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1945, which authorised capital expenditure by the ESB on the scheme. In the past 30 years some 420,000 houses have been connected to the rural network at a total cost of about £80 million, some £27 million of which represent State subsidy, the balance being met by the ESB.</P>
    <P>The total of 420,000 houses represents some 98-99 per cent of all rural houses and compares favourably with the connection rate elsewhere.  In Britain and the United States of America the connection rate is believed to be about 98 per cent and 98.4 per cent respectively, whilst on the Continent generally the connection rate is somewhat less.  It is only in countries such as Germany and, possibly Switzerland and Sweden, that the connection rate in rural areas exceeds the 98.99 per cent level.</P>
    <P>What is known as the final phase of the rural electrification scheme was undertaken over the four years 1971-75 to give every unconnected house in rural Ireland a final opportunity of obtaining electricity supply on subsidised terms.  The programme was well publicised and at some stage during the four-year period every rural householder then unconnected to the electricity supply had an opportunity of obtaining electricity supply on subsidised terms.  The final phase was officially closed on 31st March, 1975, that is, no further applications for subsidised supply were accepted after that date, but subsidised terms have yet to be quoted by the board to applicants in a few areas whilst construction work remains to be done in these and some other areas.  However, all householders in each of these areas where work remains to be done, whether already quoted terms or not, who applied and qualified for subsidised supply before 31st March, 1975, will still get supply on subsidised terms.</P>
    <P>Under the final phase of the rural electrification scheme the board <Col N="1321" /> looked for the very modest rate of return of 5.2 per cent on their capital outlay or investment in providing supply to each house.  The board were prepared to meet, subject to a limit of £750, the capital cost of providing supply to any house or premises.  If the applicant's ordinary annual fixed charge which every consumer pays, usually about £12 per annum or so in rural Ireland, was not sufficient to cover 5.2 per cent of the cost of connection, the applicant was required to pay what was known as a special service charge.  The amount of the special service charge in any one case was the difference between the ordinary fixed charge and the sum representing 5.2 per cent of the cost of connecting the house in question.  For example, if a house cost £500 to connect, the ESB would look for a return of £26 per annum that is 5.2 per cent on their investment of £500. With a fixed charge of, say, £12 per annum this would mean that the special service charge payable by the applicant would be £14 per annum in six two-monthly instalments of £2.33 each.</P>
    <P>In those cases where the cost of connecting a house exceeded £750 the board required the prospective consumer to meet by way of lump sum payment part of the cost of connection, as determined by the board. This lump sum payment was known as a capital contribution and, in effect, represented the non-recoverable part of the connection costs above £700 which would arise in the event of the consumer refusing or ceasing to take supply shortly after having the house connected.  The ESB adopted this arrangement in the light of working experience.</P>
    <P>During the final phase of the scheme some householders, mainly in the Black Valley area of County Kerry and the Ballycroy area of County Mayo, found themselves unable to accept the board's offer of subsidised terms, involving payment by them of substantial sums by way of capital contribution.  Precise figures of the number of such householders are not readily available but the ESB have estimated that, in all, <Col N="1322" /> there are some 800-900 such householders in these and other isolated areas.  This is not a definitive figure as there are also individual houses in this category here and there throughout the country and the final total may well be more than the ESB estimate.</P>
    <P>While any scheme of rural electrification will throw up anomalies the plight of the Black Valley and Ballycroy householders is probably the worst of the unresolved anomalies revealed at the closure of the final phase of the scheme.  These householders can reasonably be regarded as unfortunate in that, through no fault of their own, they live in areas where the cost of connecting them to the electricity supply, even under subsidised terms, is substantial.  The cost of connection under normal economic or unsubsidised terms would of course be very much higher.  All, or nearly all, of the houses in question were built when proximity to the electricity supply was not an obvious factor to be taken into consideration when selecting a site for a dwelling. The practical effect of the Black Valley and Ballycroy householders' inability to accept the subsidised terms of supply offered to them in 1971-75 is that they do not now have available to them a service which is widely regarded as a basic amenity of life. They represent, by and large, the &ldquo;hard core&rdquo; or outstanding balance still remaining of the unconnected rural houses which the subsidised rural electrification scheme was intended to benefit.  To leave them unconnected to the rural network now would, to some extent at least, vitiate the whole purpose of the rural electrification scheme which was to bring the benefits of electricity to all parts of rural Ireland.  The scheme was not limited, and was not intended to be limited, only to the parts of the country where connection was relatively inexpensive.</P>
    <P>The Government are, in all the circumstances, prepared to recommend approval to the provision of additional moneys to enable the Black Valley and Ballycroy householders, as well as others in the same category throughout <Col N="1323" /> the country, to obtain electricity supply on terms comparable, by and large, to those generally available to applicants under the final phase-1971-75&mdash;of the scheme, but with a special concession in relation to payment of capital contributions.  Briefly, what is in effect proposed in this Bill is that these housholders, that is the householders who refused supply under the final phase of the scheme because of the requirement to pay capital contributions, will be given a further and final opportunity to obtain supply on subsidised terms but, this time, without having to pay a capital contribution.  In so far as provision of supply to them is concerned they will only have to pay an annual or standing charge of £36.40 in six two-monthly instalments.  This standing charge, which may from time to time be subject to review by the ESB in accordance with the board's normal criteria for review of fixed charges, is inclusive of both the usual fixed charge and the special service charge; if there is no review by the board the standing charge remains unaltered.</P>
    <P>Apart from charges for electricity consumed or for instalment payments, if any, in relation to electrical appliances and so on that may arise, no other charges will be payable by them. The appropriate capital contributions which these householders would otherwise have had to pay to the ESB under subsidised terms will be paid on their behalf to the board out of the Vote for my Department.  At this stage it is not possible to indicate with certainty the aggregate of all such capital contributions, because costs of connection are rising all the time, but the sum of £300,000 being provided in the Bill should meet the requirements of the scheme.</P>
    <P>This is a once-for-all scheme of limited application intended to deal with a special case of localised hardship which, because of the nature and extent of the anomaly revealed under the final phase&mdash;1971-75&mdash;of the rural electrification scheme, merits special consideration.  To eliminate all anomalies in a scheme of rural electrification which covered the whole of the <Col N="1324" /> country would be a virtually impossible task and involve an unacceptable drain on the Exchequer.  In taking steps to eliminate this anomaly the Government feel that they are going as far as they can reasonably go in all the circumstances.  Government expenditure on rural electrification down the years has been, in the aggregate, very substantial and further expenditure other than that now proposed could not be justified.</P>
    <P>The details of the proposed scheme are now being worked out but, broadly speaking, what is envisaged is that a reasonable period will be set during which applications from the householders in question for benefit under the scheme will be accepted by the ESB who will then proceed as quickly as possible to provide supply, after issue and acceptance of quotations, which will not include capital contributions. When the work has been finished subsidisation of electricity supply in rural areas will then finally come to an end and normal economic or unsubsidised terms of supply will apply from then on.</P>
    <P>Whilst I must, because of Exchequer constraints, set my face against any further extension of the rural electrification scheme, I am very conscious of the heavy financial burden which can be involved on householders, both persons building new houses as well as existing householders not already connected, in meeting the cost of connecting their houses to the electricity supply.  I am pleased, therefore, to announce that, in order to ameliorate such burden, the ESB have at my request agreed to introduce a scheme of deferred payments for costs of connection to the electricity supply in cases where subsidised terms are not available.  Full details of the scheme will be made available shortly but at this stage I can say the scheme will, broadly speaking, provide deferred payment facilities up to a reasonable limit for all new applicants.  Meanwhile, I must commend the board for agreeing to an arrangement of this kind which will go a long way towards easing the financial burden sometimes involved in obtaining electricity supplies.</P>
    <P>I might also add my voice to the <Col N="1325" /> board's appeal to persons proposing to build new houses for prior consultation with their local ESB office before deciding on sites for their new houses. In very many cases consultation beforehand with the board can result in considerable financial savings.  As Deputies no doubt readily appreciate, the cost of connection of any new house to the electricity supply is largely determined by its location in relation to the nearest electricity distribution centre.  In recent months the board have been at pains to emphasise this and to encourage prospective new householders to inquire beforehand as to the cost of providing electricity before irrevocable commitments as to erection of homes are entered into.  I can only endorse the board's appeal and reiterate the importance of prior consultation with the board's local office in all cases where erection of new houses is contemplated.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill and the principle involved in it.  As the Minister said, and this is something of which we are all well aware, this is a long awaited measure because of the cost by way of quotation and otherwise experienced by people looking for connection in recent years. Some quotations from the ESB have been truly frightening.  Public representatives, who made representations with a view to some alleviation of the problem, found there was nothing that could be done with regard to these quotations.  In some cases the quotations were equivalent to the cost of a housing site and would naturally form part of a very big addition to the cost of building houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is designed to cover those who are unable to get connection under the old scheme before a certain date.  We welcome this relief in areas such as the Minister mentioned, areas like Ballycroy and the Black Valley. These people have been waiting patiently for the benefit of electricity supply.  While we welcome the Bill we believe the amount involved should be greater in order to cover others who have a problem.  If a farmer already connected to the ESB supply builds a <Col N="1326" /> new house even reasonably near his old residence he is treated as a new customer and he will not get any benefit under this Bill.  That is what I have been told by the ESB.</P>
    <P>There was a period when such people were treated as transfer cases somewhat in the same way as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs treat the transfer of telephones.  Now such people are, as I say, treated as new customers and are quoted on that basis.  This is a hardship they should not have to suffer and now might be the time to solve this problem.  Very often such people are compelled of necessity to move into better accommodation and they should get some relief from the point of view of connection. I find it hard to understand how the ESB can justify this approach.  Even if it means increasing the amount mentioned in this Bill I believe we should increase it in order to relieve this type of person.  Many people are affected by the high cost of connection to houses in rural areas.  Some of those quotations can run into thousands of pounds.  Did the ESB ever try to assess what would be required to cover people needing electricity in rural areas?  Was consideration ever given to introducing a Bill which would give partial relief to such people?</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the big sums involved here will be taken by way of instalment but, just the same, the money must be paid.  Before the Bill was published we were hopeful that it would bring some relief for the people who are scattered in rural areas and those anxious to build houses in remote areas.  Those who decide to erect houses in rural areas are to be admired because for a long time we have been worried about the fact that people were leaving such areas.  There seems to be a tendency now for people to return to rural Ireland to live.  That is a good trend but there is not much encouragement because of the cost of getting electricity.  As well as having to face the financial burden of providing a house such people must pay the huge cost involved in this connection for what is a necessary facility.  In most cases those intending <Col N="1327" /> to erect a house in a rural area forget about the cost of connecting to the electricity; they do not budget for an expenditure in the region of £2,000 for such a connection.  In a lot of cases young couples are involved or people about to get married.  I hope it will be possible to give relief to such people and to those living in Ballycroy and Black Valley who expected to get relief in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a Bill such as this gives us an opportunity of reviewing the substantial investment which the ESB made in the past, and intend to make in the future, to increase their generating capacity.  It also gives us an opportunity of reviewing the ESB's intention of increasing this generating capacity by the utilisation of natural gas in the Minister's own county.  We have expressed the view that the utilisation of natural gas to generate current was wasteful and should not have been considered, but the Government have decided to permit the ESB to have access to this gas.  We still believe that money spent on such a generating station will be badly spent.  It appears that it will cost in the region of £100 million before a generating station to use this gas is completed.  If this investment is to be financed by borrowing from non-sterling sources, we are bound to draw attention to the implications involved. This is the first opportunity we have had of discussing the company's borrowing outside non-sterling areas, a matter which was dealt with in the annual report of the ESB circulated recently.  The accounts dealt with in that report show that the balance of foreign loans outstanding on 31st March, 1975, was £100 million.  The ESB borrowed a further £26 million during the next year from outside the sterling area and there is also provision in the report for almost £24 million to provide for the currency adjustment involved in foreign borrowing because of the drop in the value of sterling.  A further £10 million was paid in interest on foreign borrowing.  On 31st March, 1976, the ESB owed £149 million, according to the report.  This seems to mean that 25 per cent of the money paid by <Col N="1328" /> consumers is going to pay for the currency adjustment involved because of the foreign borrowings of the company. It appears that the company now intends getting involved in a further loan of £100 million so that they can establish a generating station for the purpose of using natural gas.  If that is the position consumers will be faced with a heavy and unnecessary burden to pay for such a loan.  We believe the ESB have ample generating capacity.  A lot of their investment in the past was based on planning for the future.  It was based on the view that demand for current would continue to grow as it had been doing before the energy crisis.  They now believe that this growth rate will not be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The investment of a further £100 million to create more generating capacity is unnecessary in our opinion. The money will be borrowed outside the sterling area and we know what it will mean for consumers in future years&mdash;bigger ESB bills.  Householders find even present bills unbearable. As we said during the debate on the Gas Bill which set up An Bord Gáis, that money could have been better spent in the creation of a national gas grid fed by our natural gas.  This would in turn mean that industrialists and other commercial users would have a cheaper supply of energy.  Progressively, it would mean more employment, especially for our younger people.  The use of gas by the ESB will involve a 70 per cent wastage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It seems to me that much of what the Deputy is saying is more appropriate to the Estimate for the Department rather than this measure, which is a rather limited Bill.  I have given the Deputy much latitude.  I have permitted him to refer to An Bord Gáis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt these were matters that should be mentioned in a Bill relating to the ESB.  However, I accept your ruling and look forward to a future opportunity.  In our opinion, the Bill should be expanded to provide current for more applicants than this £300,000 will provide for.  There are many households, especially young <Col N="1329" /> married people, who are seeking current. This is true of most constituencies. I feel sure the ESB could come up quickly with some figures so that we could discuss them during the debate on this measure.  We should be given some idea of the sums involved in providing current for rural people who need it.</P>
      <P>For instance, in my county there are approximately 150 houses seeking connection. They are in great hardship because of this.  If we take an average cost of £300 per house we arrive at a figure of £45,000 for one county.  The figures will vary from county to county but if we multiply £45,000 by 26 we arrive at £1.2 million and this is not a very large or unbearable sum for us to give to the ESB by way of subsidy so that they could relieve extreme hardship in many counties.</P>
      <P>I particularly ask the Minister to endeavour to have people building ing new houses connected.  I ask him to have them treated not as completely new consumers but in the fashion of telephone applicants who can have their telephones transferred from one house to another.  We welcome the Bill but we suggest that the figure be increased from £300,000.  The Minister mentioned a capital sum of £750 per unit.  That money will not be absorbed by the ESB at any stage: it will be collected as a public service charge indefinitely.  We would hope that we could find the means and agreement to expend the amount involved in the Bill on Committee Stage, which would be the time to discuss this.  By that time the Minister might be in a position to be more specific with regard to figures.  I have no doubt there are people on the board who could come up with figures for the Minister very quickly, and we might be able to do a better job while we have the opportunity of doing so under this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanToal" hpid="Mr. Toal Mr. Toal">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. To my mind the rural electrification scheme was the best thing that ever happened in this country.  Part of the credit for this goes to the legislators for the legislation passed in 1945. Now almost 30 years later the rural electricification programme is almost complete.  Credit must also go to the ESB for implementing the scheme.  It is fashionable these days to complain about semi-State companies but if the ESB were to fold up overnight the rural electrification will stand as a monument to them in the history of the State.  Most of the credit must go to the people of Ireland who had the good sense to avail of this programme. Organisations such as Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Tuatha and community leaders from parishes and so on, had to put all their powers of persuasion behind this scheme to entice the people to avail of it, and this was no mean task.  In rural Ireland especially there are very deepseated traditions, the attitude of &ldquo;if it was good enough for my father it is good enough for me&rdquo;.  This programme did more to change the life and carry rural Ireland into the 20th century than any other Government programme in the history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is designed to cover a few areas in Mayo and in Kerry where the programme has not been completed.  Deputies from all parts of the country will welcome that.  The cost to be voted by moneys from the Oireachtas is in the region of £700,000 and this is a small sum when one considers the benefit that will accrue to these people and the service that it will bring to these remote areas.  In any man's terms electricity today is good value for money and it is good to see that a farmhouse in the country can be as comfortable and modern as anything in the city.  Years ago when emigrants returned to visit their families, they were embarrassed <Col N="1331" /> and appalled at the conditions under which their folks were living.  That has all been set aside now thanks to the rural electrification programme.</P>
    <P>This legislation does very little for newly married couples who have the courage to start building their houses. The capital costs of having an electricity supply laid on to a new bungalow or other new dwelling in a remote area is prohibitive.  It is unfair to ask any young people in a rural community to shoulder such a cost and I would ask the Minister to devote his energies to allaying the plight of these young people.  The policy of this Government and of past Governments has been to restore as much community life in remote rural parts as possible and the best way this can be done is to assist these people in setting up homesteads in the country by making it as inexpensive as possible.</P>
    <P>No amount of publicity should be spared in order to bring the attention of would-be householders to the importance of laying on a supply of electricity, and the importance of their consultation with the ESB before they decide on the site of their new house.  Unfortunately young people and newly married people have not much choice when it comes to selecting a site.  They plunge in, get planning permission and a loan from a county council or some other authority and in the middle of it they are saddled with the huge cost of getting electricity.  The Minister should address his attention to this problem in the rural parts of the country.  I welcome the Bill and, as I said, the rural electrification programme was the best thing that could have happened to this country and I commend the Minister for his work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in principle.  It serves a very useful purpose.  It will enable householders and families to get electricity now and in the immediate future, which they would not otherwise have been able to get by reason of their economic position. I would have thought that there were more than 800 to 900 people or householders who would qualify under this Bill.  I would think that the figure <Col N="1332" /> throughout the country as a whole, would be nearer to 2,000, and I am also under the impression that the amount of money required would be nearer to £1 million or £1.2 million than £300,000.  I am very doubtful whether £300,000 provided under this Bill will cover all the applications which will be received by the ESB. The special service charges at the moment are much too high for the ordinary person in rural areas, particularly for the ordinary smallholder and the tenant or occupant of single rural council houses.</P>
      <P>Capital contributions are now so high that I know of numerous cases where persons who had intended to build houses themselves did not do so because they could not afford to pay the capital contributions required by the ESB.  This meant that these people went on to the local authority housing list instead.  Up to now, there had been no subsidy whatsoever toward the erection of new houses.  I am glad the Minister has recognised the seriousness of this and intends to make some concession.</P>
      <P>In his opening statement he said it is intended to arrange with the ESB to introduce a scheme of deferred payments for costs of connection to the electricity supply in cases where subsidised terms are not available.  I would ask the Minister to tell us when details of this scheme will be announced and whether this scheme will have retrospective effect.  I would ask the Minister to be specific and to give as much information as possible.  I hope the scheme will be operated immediately. Undoubtedly, there are numerous areas like the Black Valley and Ballycroy where it is impossible for people to meet the capital contributions and to pay the fixed charges.  For this reason, this Bill is welcome.  We on this side of the House have been pressing for a measure like this for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that electricity is vital today in every home.  It is now a basic amenity of ordinary life and, if we want our young people to settle down and live in rural Ireland, and if we want to maintain and increase the population in remote rural areas, it is vitally necessary that they have electricity. <Col N="1333" /> After all, it is virtually impossible to have a television service in a home where there is no electricity.</P>
    <P>I am very dubious about the £300,000 provided in this Bill.  As I said at the outset, I believe this money will not go anywhere towards meeting the need.  It will cost approximately between three and four times this sum. I am sure that when all the applications are received by the ESB and the scheme is costed the sum required will be in the region of £1 million.  Could the Minister not set a higher maximum figure in this Bill and let the ESB work within that figure?  It would not be necessary for them to take up the whole sum.</P>
    <P>Another cause of grave concern in many rural areas is low voltage.  This matter requires urgent attention by the ESB and by the Department of Transport and Power.  Nowadays each farm is practically a little industry and the modern farmer, the transitional farmer, the development farmer, or any farmer who intends to improve his holding, has many items of equipment which require electricity.  In many of these areas it is virtually impossible for these farmers to operate because the voltage is so low.  I know some districts where at evening milking time during the summer the voltage is so low that it is impossible to get good TV reception or for housewives to use electrical appliances in the kitchen.  The same situation arises where small rural industries have been set up during the past ten years.</P>
    <P>The ESB will require a large sum of money during the next few years and they should get this money soon in order to improve the working conditions of the agricultural community. The high capital contribution required by the ESB for single rural houses has had an adverse effect on the building trade.  In many cases it has made it impossible for tenants of local authority houses to have electricity because they could not afford to pay the capital contribution.  Neither could they afford to pay the fixed charges, in addition to furnishing the council house.  For that reason the Minister should give us the details and get his scheme moving quickly for the <Col N="1334" /> deferred payment system in respect of new houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement said that householders who refused supply under the final phase of the 1971-1975 scheme, because of the requirement to pay capital contributions, will be given a further and final opportunity to obtain supply on subsidised terms, but this time without having to pay a capital contribution.  I should like the Minister to tell us if this applies throughout the whole country and if it applies to people who refused, even a few months ago, to pay a capital contribution.</P>
    <P>I do not like the idea that the ESB will be given the power to increase the annual or standing charge of £36.40.  There is no guarantee that this standing charge of £36.40 payable in six two-monthly instalments by these householders will not be increased to up to £100 per annum. Some system should be devised whereby these charges could not be increased without reference to the Minister for Industry and Commerce or some other authority.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>The appropriate capital contributions which these householders would otherwise have had to pay to the ESB under subsidised terms will be paid on their behalf to the board out of the Vote for my Department.</P>
    <P>Does this cover the whole country, and does it cover each householder who applied before and who was refused under a subsidised scheme?</P>
    <P>A time limit should be imposed on the ESB for the operation of this Bill. There is no fixed period for it, as far as I can see; in other words, it could drag on for anything from one year to five years or even longer.  Financial provision should be made so that the ESB could complete the scheme within a period of 12 months or so from the date of the commencement of the Act.  There is no reason why the whole country could not be covered by 31st December, 1977, and this should be built into the Bill.  We may have an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage.  I do not like a Bill of this sort without a time limit for <Col N="1335" /> its operation.  This is vital in the interests of the householders and of the districts concerned.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the Minister that there should be prior notice to the ESB by persons, including farmers, who intend to build homes or, indeed, any structures which will require the use of electricity.  This is only fair to the ESB and also to the people themselves so that they will know well in advance what the cost will be.  It would also give the ESB an opportunity to make adequate provisions for power in that area.</P>
    <P>I hope the terms of this Bill will be implemented as soon as possible and that the Minister's announcement about the scheme of deferred payments in respect of new houses will also be introduced without delay.  A start should be made by 1st December and the whole scheme completed by 31st December, 1977.  There is a great sense of urgency about the implementation of this Bill in an improved form.  As I said before, it took many Dáil questions and promptings from the Opposition to get this far.  I sincerely hope there will be no more need for pressure from this side of the House to get the scheme moving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to compliment the Minister on the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1976.  It amazes me to hear Deputy O'Leary talking about promptings from the Opposition when I remember that the Opposition had the power for 16 years to do this and it is only since the Minister for Transport and Power came into office that it has been decided something drastic should be done.  What the Minister says is probably quite true, that 98 per cent of all rural houses have so far been connected with the ESB, but what he has failed to state is that at least 10 per cent of western seaboard houses have not been connected.  It is not new for us to hear about connection charges of £1,500, £1,800 and even £2,000.  All the western seaboard Deputies will welcome this measure whereby at long last they will get an electricity connection at the right price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> Admittedly, this Bill still has not gone far enough.  People in western areas should get electricity at the same price as it is available in the towns and in the cities.  It is a form of discrimination that because you live in the country you have to pay a substantial connection charge.  Perhaps one of the things the Minister could do in co-operation with the Minister for Local Government is that, when people in country areas apply for planning permission, it should be stated on the planning applications returned to people that they should take into consideration the ESB charges.  Too many people are ignorant of the fact that they may have to pay very high charges, especially in respect of new houses.  It should be a very simple matter for the planning officers in the area concerned to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>Sometimes people living in an old house decide to build a new house 100 yards away from the original house.  It is unfair that these people should be asked to pay for an ESB connection even though they are changing to a new house in close proximity to where they were living. Such work should be done free.  The Minister also stated that people who refused connection under the rural electrification scheme will now be given electricity at the subsidised rate.  Does that include people in those areas who did not apply at the time; perhaps a neighbour of theirs applied and was refused?</P>
    <P>It should be the policy of the ESB, as far as possible, to ask the farming community to bring underground cables to their new houses.  If the farmers dug the trenches and got the ESB to connect the wires, it would work out much cheaper for them.  At the moment the ESB seem to be insisting on too many poles, which are unsightly.</P>
    <P>The cost of installing transformers should not be a charge on new houses. Recently it has become common for transformer charges to be included in the costings for new connections.  I welcome the Minister's suggestion that there will be deferred payments for connections to new houses.  It is high time this was done.</P>
    <Col N="1337" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in that it goes some way towards helping householders who, through no fault of theirs, live in areas where up to now it has not been possible to extend electricity supplies.  In his speech the Minister mentioned two areas in particular &mdash;Ballycroy in County Mayo and Black Valley in County Kerry.  I understand that areas in County Galway, particularly an area near Woodford, were to be included in this Bill.  I hope these areas will not be excluded from the scheme.</P>
      <P>The sum of money that has been allocated for the scheme is not adequate.  The ESB will probably find they have insufficient funds to complete the service.  I am sure all Deputies would be willing to vote for a larger allocation for this most important scheme.  People in backward rural areas are very often deprived of essential services such as the rural electrification scheme, the group water schemes, the school transport service and the telephone service.  There are no backward rural areas now because people can communicate without difficulty. The lack of electricity hinders the development of farms and businesses. Nowadays electricity is an essential part of life.  It has been proved conclusively that farms will use more electricity in future.  In recent years we have seen the advent of large farming enterprises such as milk parlours, pig fattening units, poultry houses and glasshouses.  Because of the nature of the soil, farmers in rural areas have a greater need for such enterprises and for that reason it is essential that they have electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy is aware of the large number of representations made in regard to electricity supply by people building their own houses.  The charge in some cases has been prohibitive. Recently I received a letter from one of my constituents who was asked to pay £1,000 to have supply extended to his house.  That anybody should be asked to pay such a large sum of money for electricity in this day and age is ridiculous.  Nowadays young people do not want to be without electricity.  They cannot be blamed for this because there is a great dependence <Col N="1338" /> on electricity in a modern home.  Will this Bill cater for young people who are now building their homes and who may be faced in a year's time with a large bill for the installation of electricity?  Having built a house it is a shock to discover that the electricity will not be connected unless a large sum of money is paid to the ESB.</P>
    <P>The problem of low voltage in certain areas has been mentioned.  I know it is a problem in my constituency. A number of farmers have complained that they have not sufficient current for their milking machines.  The planners of the rural electrification scheme in 1946 could never have envisaged such a great demand for electricity.  At that time most people were satisfied to have electric lighting.  The normal contract for wiring a house at that time was for lighting and a few sockets.  The ESB should ensure that three-phase supply is made available in all small towns.  It would be an incentive to industrialists and to locals to establish businesses.  There is a great need for the establishment of industries in our smaller towns.  If this were done it would reduce the number of young people on our unemployment list. Concessions should be given to employers who use a large amount of electricity.  The electricity bills of such people are considerable.  We know they have risen steeply in the past few years.  Possibly the ESB or the Government could find some way of allowing them some concession on their bills if they are creating employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy White mentioned the possibility of placing wires underground. This is a very good idea and something the ESB should follow up, particularly in many towns they are wiring at present.  Those of us who travel through Tyrrellspass on our way here have seen the job done in that town.  It is a credit to the people involved that they have placed both telephone and ESB wires underground. I am sure there are many other areas that could do likewise.  All those wires hanging around can be unsightly as well as being dangerous in stormy weather.  One cannot exbilit <Col N="1339" /> pect the ESB to be continuously checking on these wires, particularly in winter.</P>
    <P>The deferred payments system is very welcome and the sooner it is introduced the better.  At least it will afford people who are unfortunate enough to have to pay this capital charge an opportunity of doing so by instalments.  It is indeed a welcome move and will be appreciated by the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is time that the people living in rural areas for whom this Bill is designed were given some chance of enjoying the services the rest of the community have enjoyed for a long number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity of making a few remarks on this Bill.  I am particularly interested because, as the Minister said in his speech, one of the two areas which he picks out as being the most disadvantaged in the country at present in so far as the provision of electricity is concerned is the village of Ballycroy which is in my immediate county council area and in the Dáil constituency of West Mayo, which I represent.  There has been a very serious problem in that village for many reasons.</P>
      <P>In general terms I agree with those speakers who have referred to the good work of the ESB over a number of years in developing rural electrification. As the Minister has stated, over the past 30 years nearly 500,000 houses have been connected at a total cost of £80 million, £27 million of which represented State subsidy.  In a small country of limited resources that is a very considerable achievement. Looking at other countries in Western Europe, at a much greater stage of development than ours, the comparison is very favourable in that apparently connected to the rural electrification grid are somewhere between 98 per cent and 99 per cent of householders here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister &mdash;and I am not saying this in any political sense&mdash;on the introduction of this legislation because of the singular personal interest he has taken <Col N="1340" /> in this issue.  We went to him some two or three years ago, especially in regard to the plight in Ballycroy where some people of very limited means were quoted as much as £900 capital charge on top of special service charges and fixed charges.  Of course, relative to their means, it was a hopeless position; it was an imposition many of them simply could not afford.  I am pleased to say that the Minister was very receptive.  He met these people in Ballycroy.  He saw conditions for himself.  Subsequently in Dublin, senior officials of his Department met representatives of the Ballycroy community.  Subsequent to that again the Minister, in his office, met these people in a formal delegation from the area and promised something would be done about it.  I am glad we are now seeing the result of these discussions and representations.</P>
    <P>The remarks of Deputy J. O'Leary suggesting that it required many Dáil questions and that he hoped there would not be need for any more pressure from the Opposition benches were quite wide of the mark.  From the very beginning Peter Barry was completely receptive to this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>He could indeed.</P>
      <P>Mr. Staunton: I have found certain misconceptions in relation to this Bill. I had copies sent to some people interested in it.  In particular they referred to the note regarding the £700 which is contained in section 2, subsection (1) (b) which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) in respect of which the capital cost of such connection at the date <Col N="1341" /> of such quotation exceeded £700, and</P>
    <P>Apparently there has been some confusion there.  Some people have misread the Bill and have been led to believe that the meaning of this subsection is that capital charges up to a level of £700 must be borne by householders; that, for example, in the instance of the quotation in the village of Ballycroy to which I referred if say, householders had received a capital charge demand from the ESB amounting to £600 they felt they were eligible for that concession and that it was only the sum above £700 which was being nullified by the introduction of this Bill.  I realise, from discussions with the Minister, that that is not the intention of the Bill.  We need to spell out, in the interests of the people involved, the fact which the Minister states in his speech: that no capital contribution whatever will be required from householders under this scheme.  I think I had better repeat that no capital contribution whatever is required. It merely makes provision for a situation which had existed up to now where capital charges up to the level of £700 will be built into the annual charge.  As the Minister states that amounts to an annual charge of £36.40 which, broken down, represents about 70p a week or 10p a day. To reiterate the position: it is inclusive of the usual fixed charge and the special service charge and there is no requirement of a capital contribution. This scheme will be of immense value to the parties involved.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech he continues to speak about the fact that it is a onceand-for-all scheme.  I want to re-echo that because some years ago we were involved in the rural electrification of a number of villages outside Westport in County Mayo.  Unfortunately, in some of those villages, when they received quotations from the ESB, due to what they thought were high charges at that time, they declined the offer and did not go ahead with the electrification of certain villages.  Naturally the social demands for electricity were great and, three or four years later, they reconsidered the matter, when charges had gone up by perhaps 50 <Col N="1342" /> per cent.  Of course the vicious circle was operating.  Again, at that second stage, they decided they could not afford it, so they did not take it.  In some of those villages they got quotations on a third occasion&mdash;eight or ten years after the first&mdash;when charges were about three times greater than they had been a decade before that.  We saw the real need of getting electricity into these villages and enlightened people saw the necessity for it.  We had a series of meetings and persuaded people, despite the cost, to have it connected. Of course, they have never looked back because it is a vital amenity and villages will die unless they have an amenity as basic as electricity.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies here.  I want to sound a warning note lest there be any danger of apathy in areas such as the Black Valley in Kerry, Ballycroy in Mayo or other parts of Galway and the western seaboard.  This could be a once-and-for-all scheme and it might not be that simple to come back in five years or a decade hence with further subsidisations by the Government of the day.  We should tell the people affected in those areas that it is vital in their interest to take up the offer in this Bill with total acceptance of it as far as possible.  I will play my part in my part of the country to persuade those involved that they should enthusiastically respond to this scheme and attempt to get total acceptance of it.  It is a very good deal and it may not happen again with rising costs and constraints on future budgets.</P>
    <P>I welcome the guidelines given to the ESB by the Minister as far as the capital cost for the provision of electricity to new bungalows is concerned. The building of new houses, with high costs, is a very great hardship on young married people in particular. In addition to building the houses they have to provide outhouses, pathways and decoration.  The receipt of a bill from the ESB amounting to anything from £300 to £700 can be very crippling to young married people at a very difficult stage in their lives.  It is economic good sense to introduce this system of <Col N="1343" /> deferred payment.  It is a question of working out a reasonable return for whatever the investment is and arranging that the householders will pay the same sum on a deferred basis.  It will not put them under pressure to go into the banks or lending institutions to borrow money.  It will not put them under pressure to sell their land or use their savings. This is a very good scheme which is overdue and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his final remarks, referred to the building of new houses.  In my experience after people have built new houses they get crippling bills from the ESB for installation. The ESB are in a monopoly situation and possibly, because of lack of competition, some people think their charges are too high.  Presumably they have to look for a return on their own investment and they are beholden to the Minister.  Their job is probably not as simple as we would like to think.  At the same time it is common sense that people building houses should inquire from the ESB, especially if they are living in an area where it might seem there are difficulties, the cost of providing electricity before the bricks and mortar go up.  This might affect the siting of a house on a few acres of land that somebody owns and it might affect the general attitude of people.  Such people should get at least a rough quotation of the cost involved before the building starts.</P>
    <P>I am very enthusiastic about the introduction of this Bill.  All of us should persuade all the householders in the areas which have been referred to and other areas in the country to respond to it so that the level of electrification in the country goes up to 99.9 per cent.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers, I should like to welcome this Bill, belated and incomplete as it is.  It will bring great relief to some people who have given up all hope of getting an ESB supply.  There are, however, some questions I should like to ask. Will a person building a new house who has not been given a quotation <Col N="1344" /> under the terms of this Bill be covered by it or does the Bill only refer to those who got quotations in the period 1971 to 1975?  I see the Minister nods.  Do I take it that anyone who got a quotation before 1971 will not be eligible under this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Another question I have specifically applies to rural areas where the local authorities are rehousing people.  Will those people be entitled to the new concessions?  Will they get the benefit of the terms? How can we justify any person who is considered eligible for a local authority house being asked to pay contributions like some of those being asked now by the ESB, contributions of up to £500 and £600?  Will the Minister ask his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, if they do not qualify under this Bill, whether the Department of Local Government would consider taking the full charges into account in the actual cost of the house?  Unless we are prepared to continue to hold out hope that there will be a continuation of subsidisation, contrary to what the Minister said in his speech, then it will mean the end of many rural areas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett referred to the cost of the transfer of electricity supply from an old house to a new one.  All of us have come across this.  We also find in some areas that connections are not being made to new houses for many months.  We find that where new houses are erected adjacent to old houses, built within 20 or 30 yards of them, the owners are being asked for contributions of between £300 and £400.  How can this cost be justified? Are the ESB improving the service locally at the cost of some of those people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech laid particular emphasis on the necessity for contacting the ESB in regard to building sites.  I agree with him and would like to say that I have always advised people to do this.  However, when there are exorbitant charges, even where <Col N="1345" /> houses are near power lines, what is a person to do?  Surely it is reasonable to presume that the ESB will give a reasonable quotation if a farmer gives a site to a son or daughter adjacent to his own house?  I wrote to the Minister during the past week about the case of a son who is erecting a house on a site he got from his father quite near to the power lines on two sides.  This man has been given a quotation of £652 for a connection.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) (b) states:</P>
    <P>In respect of which the capital cost of such connection at the date of such quotation exceeded £700.</P>
    <P>Deputy Staunton said that there is a certain amount of apprehension about this.  The applicants who have never been notified of the actual capital cost will only have been asked for a capital contribution.  Does the Minister envisage the ESB contacting everybody who applied for terms?  Such people may only have been asked for a capital contribution of £300 to £400 and from what the Minister explained in his speech the actual capital cost of such a connection could be greatly in excess of £700.  Those people may not be aware that they will qualify under the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There appears to be contradictions in the Minister's speech.  He stated:</P>
    <P>To leave them unconnected to the rural network now would, to some extent at least, vitiate the whole purpose of the rural electrification scheme which was to bring the benefits of electricity to all parts of rural Ireland.  This scheme was not limited, and was not intended to be limited, only to the parts of the country where connection was relatively inexpensive.</P>
    <P>Further he went on to say:</P>
    <P>This is a once-for-all scheme of limited application intended to deal with a special case of localised hardship....</P>
    <P>Then further on:</P>
    <P>... further expenditure other than that now proposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I take it he is specifically talking of <Col N="1346" /> the sum of £300,000 mentioned in section 2 (4).  Later he said:</P>
    <P>When the work has been finished subsidisation of electricity supply in rural areas will then finally come to an end and normal economic unsubsidised terms of supply will apply from then on.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and the Government continue to hold to this view we here will have done a great disservice to rural areas.  We, as legislators, have no right to tell people where they are going to live.  We have no right to declare desert areas with just a few village oases around.  It is our duty to give equality of opportunity to all.  The sum of £300,000 mentioned is very little in present-day terms. In the Minister's speech and in the Bill itself there is a certain finality about this figure.  Will the Minister explain in his summing-up if the sum of £300,000 is all that is going to be spent? Like other Deputies, I am convinced that this will not be enough.  If the Minister could assure the House that money will be provided to cover everyone who had applied, then the Bill would be far more acceptable, to me at least.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Ballycroy area there are other areas in Mayo.  I have attended meetings in areas where people can look out of their doors and see Bellacorick power station a few miles away across the bog and where they have been asked for sums ranging from £450 to £1,850 two years ago for connection.  Does it mean now that these areas will not get the new terms under the Bill? At the moment in one of these areas the county council are building three houses which will be wired for electricity, but the tenants have had to look for quotations for gas and for generators.  Do I take it that these people would be offered the new terms? If not, when does the Minister expect to see the deferred payment scheme in operation?  Like Deputy J. O'Leary and others, I urge the Minister to insist that the ESB would in the very near future publish and publicise the terms of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly at the moment is the case of the outskirts of village <Col N="1347" /> areas.  It appears that the ESB have drawn an invisible line around these areas and that they have one scheme of charges for people just inside that line and another for people just outside. This may not be the time to raise this, but it causes considerable frustration among people when one neighbour is quoted one system of charges and another person 50 yards down the road is quoted another.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which could be better dealt with on Committee Stage, but we are all worried that the figure of £30,000 is a final figure.  We would ask the Minister to consider amending that in some way on Committee Stage.  If the terms quoted in this Bill were applied to all I do not think there would be any way in which the £300,000 could be stretched.  Mention has been made of young couples building houses.  The rural electrification scheme as we know it should remain when the provisions of this Bill are fulfilled.  If not it is essential that terms of the deferred payment scheme be published as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>My first statement in this historic Chamber will be somewhat brief and to the point.  I can speak with authority only on my own experience and knowledge of the local situation.  It is fair to say that the seeds of this legislation really came to fruition in the mind of the Minister for Transport and Power on his visit to the Bellacorick area as a consequence of the bye-election last year. This area is portion of a much larger area which has repeatedly been ravaged by the twin scourges of emigration and unemployment, one being synonymous with the other. When there is suitable employment emigration figures tend to drop drastically.  This is an area which still bears the scars of neglect by successive Governments down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people there and in similar areas have characteristics of Irish quality, some of the finest characteristics that go to make up our Irish culture and as such have long been entitled to this basic necessity which <Col N="1348" /> the rest of the country take for granted.  So it was on his personal visit to the area that the Minister saw for himself and experienced at first hand the everyday frustrations and complications that people there have to contend with.  Political disinterest for so many years so disturbed the Minister on the occasion of his visit there that he made a public commitment to introduce the necessary legislation to extend the supply of electricity there as soon as possible.  He deserves great credit for the manner in which he has done this because he has shown the Government's continuing commitment to the growth and development of these areas.  He has also shown that public commitments by Ministers such as himself are not idle or false promises.</P>
    <P>The basic point of the Bill is that it will provide service where no service existed before.  It is a service at a price.  It would be perfect in theory if supply could be extended to every area for nothing, but in practice the factual and financial positions are often quite different.  The main complaint of local people in areas such as this was that they would have to pay a large capital contribution before the installation of power.  This Bill proposes that any amount of money incurred in the installation cost over £700 will be borne by the State and that the £700 can be paid in instalments over a period of years.  This will alleviate the fear of having to make a large capital contribution while, at the same time, providing a service together with its related outlets. This is an important point because agriculture and education have become increasingly important.</P>
    <P>Our most valuable asset is probably the top ten inches of our topsoil.  The areas that will benefit under this Bill are frequently very isolated and have poor agricultural quality soil.  However, they can still be brought to a level of much greater potential than they have at present.  It is true that education is becoming an essential for survival.  In this jet age it is essential that everybody should receive every educational opportunity possible. Although I do not agree with everything that appears on television, it is <Col N="1349" /> important that young people have the opportunity to benefit from decent educational programmes.  This is impossible without a suitable supply of electricity.</P>
    <P>The introduction of payment on a deferred basis for new houses will be a tremendous help to young couples throughout the country and to many of our emigrants who are returning.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that details of this scheme are published as soon as possible so that it will have the wholehearted support of thousands of people throughout the country.  With the crippling cost of electrical installations people have found themselves in dire straits and unable to meet the charges.</P>
    <P>There was mention of the lack of power in certain areas and the necessity for supplying three-phase electricity. I would draw the attention of the Minister to an area in County Mayo that has recently received Government support.  I am referring to the Ballyglass area outside Belmullet where a major harbour is presently under construction.  An essential prerequisite for future industrial development in the area is three-phase electricity and I would ask the Minister to look into the matter at his leisure.</P>
    <P>It is sad that lines of electricity supply should determine where people build their houses.  Of course we must take into account the financial cost of installation in a house that is not built in a suitable location.  Although I agree entirely with the suggestion that prior consultations be carried out with the ESB&mdash;as Deputy White has said, that could be done at the planning stage&mdash;I think it is sad that a person should have to build a house not perhaps in an area he might wish but somewhere that is close to the electricity supply.</P>
    <P>The question of underground cables is important.  Electric poles, pylons and a mass of wires do not add to the beauty of the countryside.  Although the cost would be astronomical if policy were to be changed to put all cables underground, a start could be made with the connections to new houses.  The people concerned could <Col N="1350" /> dig the trenches themselves and put in the outside covering for the cables. Our country is small.  The percentage of connections is very high and compares favourably with Britain and the United States.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The Minister deserves credit for the principle and the terms of the Bill.  The greatest benefit is that not alone will it ensure that areas not previously serviced will now get electricity but in addition many thousands of people will be able to move into their houses without the fear of having to pay an exorbitant and astronomical capital contribution.</P>

      <P>I understood there were only three places: Kerry, Woodford and Mayo but there may be more, Deputy Kenny referred to County Mayo.  I think Deputy Hogan O'Higgins, myself and a deputation from Woodford made some impression on the Minister also regarding the real need of the Woodford area.</P>
      <P>I am worried about how far the provisions of the Bill extend.  We are told that the capital charge is being abolished but that is not so.  It is only funded and there is a charge of £36 per year.  However, there was no mention of when this £36 will finish. In addition, many of the people in the Woodford area are over the £1,000 figure.  I presume they will have to pay the capital charge over £700?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like very much to get that information.  I have a statement here that was given to a person in Loughatorick.  Under the old scheme it would cost him £850 but the charge mentioned by the Minister is less than what the ESB quoted.  This person was told it would be £1.50 per £100 every two months which worked out at £10.50 as a service charge on the £700.  However, according to the Minister the cost would be about £6 service charge on the £700 every two months.  The man would also be liable to a fixed charge of £3 as well as a domestic charge of £3.  According to the ESB he would have to pay £16 every two months but according to the Minister the charge of £10.50 could be reduced to £6 leaving a charge of £12.50.  This is based on the assumption that his capital charge is only 700.  I Should like the Minister to tell us in his reply if he will be charged more if he is in excess of the £700.</P>
      <P>I want to make clear that I welcome the Bill, especially the provision dealing with deferred payments. Every Deputy should do his best to get the people to avail of it.  It will be a very heavy burden on some people living in the mountains if they have to repay, according to the ESB £16.50 but according to the Minister £12.50 every two months, provided his capital charge is only £700.  This man's capital charge was £850.  I assume he will have to pay the extra £150.  I am puzzled about the man who has a capital charge of £1,000 and is allowed £700.  Does he have to repay the remaining £300?  These questions are not explained in the Bill and I would like the Minister to clarify them.  No matter how we try, I do not believe we will be able to sell this to the people living in the mountains when the charges are so high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the deferred payments.  Any money that can be given to subsidise the installation of electricity in new houses in rural Ireland is money well spent.  Some people appear to be encouraging those living in rural areas to leave.  A young man <Col N="1352" /> getting married will budget for the price of building his house, but he will not budget for £1,000 to instal electricity.  As has already been mentioned by some Deputies the man who had electricity in his house but changed his residence is charged £200 a pole.  These are the facts.</P>
    <P>As I said, I welcome the deferred payments, but I think we should go further.  I have been pressing for this for a very long time.  Present day thinking seems to be to get people out of rural Ireland and into villages and towns.  They are not being given an incentive to build houses where they want to live.  I realise there are isolated houses the ESB cannot serve. It will cost excessive amounts to bring electricity to certain villages and the ESB should assist these people.</P>
    <P>I understood that a special once-for-all grant would be given to these areas under this Bill, but that is not what we are giving.  We are giving a funded loan.  How long will it take to repay the loan?  How far will this loan of £300,000 go?  When electricity is installed in rural areas it should be possible to use it on a farm, for business purposes and so on.  Electricity is of vital importance to rural Ireland.  We must not quibble over a few million pounds if we are to keep our rural environment as it should be and as we want it.</P>
    <P>A famous American statesman said: &ldquo;Oh liberty, what crimes are committed in thy name.&rdquo;  I say: &ldquo;Oh efficiency, what crimes are committed in thy name.&rdquo;  We should do all we can to keep our people in the rural areas.  Instead, we are bringing them into the towns where there are no jobs for them.  Every incentive should be given for people to build houses in rural areas.  They should build where they want to, and not where the planners say they must.</P>
    <P>As I said, a person building a house does not budget for an installation fee of £1,000.  This Bill is providing for deferred payments.  When will it come into operation?  What will be the interest rates?  How much interest will be charged on £1,000?  How long will it take to repay?  These are very. important points.  We must tell the <Col N="1353" /> people what the system entails and how long it will take to repay.  The same applies to the £36 on the funded grants being given to these areas.  I would like the Minister to clarify these points.</P>
    <P>This is a Committee Stage Bill and there are many points which will need to be debated.  Local authorities build houses and instal electricity.  Sometimes they do not pay the full rate if it is too high.  Will local authorities be included in the deferred payments system? Sometimes one could build an extra house for what it costs to instal electricity in four or five local authority houses.</P>
    <P>This is a very clever Bill.  It looks lovely on paper but to my mind it is deceptive in the sense that we are getting nothing for nothing.  Let nobody cod themselves about that.  Now you have the deferred payments but the period over which these payments will be made is not stated.  It may be for years or it may be forever.  I welcome the principle of the Bill but I do not believe it goes far enough.  I am not concerned with why the Minister's predecessors did not do this.  I am concerned with keeping the people in rural Ireland where they themselves want to stay.  They should be given every encouragement. I know there are isolated houses that could not possibly be connected.</P>
    <P>Underground cables were mentioned. I believe these would be an excellent idea because the poles are unsightly. Indeed, underground cables might be cheaper because at the moment the fee per pole is around £200.  The Bill is slightly deceptive in that it does not spell out how long people will be paying and it does not say if the State will make a great deal of money ultimately out of this.  This may be an investment and not a grant.  It should be by way of grant in isolated areas and I trust it is not the intention to use these areas for the purpose of making a profit.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  There is one area in my constituency that is included.  It is the Lough area in Woodford.  I have been aware for a long time, for the last 19 <Col N="1354" /> years, before ever Deputy Callanan came into this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Good man. People living in this area, who applied for connection, were told by the board to wait until they recanvassed the area when they would be quoted more favourable terms.  They waited patiently for some 15, 16 or 17 years and then discovered the terms quoted were astronomical, anything from £800 to £2,700.  That was the top quotation in the area.  Now the Woodford area, the Loughatorick area, is high in the mountains. The farms are small and the farmers are very industrious, hard-working people.  They are a very proud people and they are quite prepared to pay a fair figure.  They do not want anything for nothing.  But they will not allow themselves to be crucified.  That is how they looked on the situation up to this and so this Bill will be a great help to them.</P>
      <P>The figures Deputy Callanan quoted as given to the people in Loughatorick were given to them by an official of the ESB and their fear now is that they will have to pay approximately £16 every two months plus the ordinary payment for the current they consume.  That sort of bill is just not on.  There is no way these farmers could pay that kind of money.</P>
      <P>There is a number of school-going children in this area.  Deputy Hussey talked about the necessity for having electricity on the farm.  As a farmer myself I am all in favour of electricity on the farm but every Member who has spoken so far has spoken from the man's point of view.  No one has referred to the need for electricity in the house.  Do Members realise how hard it is to iron their shirts without electricity, to wash their clothes without electricity, to cook without elecricity? I suspect they do not.  I suspect they think we all buy drip dry, but even drip dry have to be ironed.  Take it from me-I have spent hours at it. Looking around this House I notice all the shirts are beautifully ironed so I presume Members' wives are using electricity.</P>

      <P>Unlike Deputy Callanan, I do not believe the Minister is trying to deceive us and I am sure he will clarify the position when he comes to reply.  I welcome the deferred payment system.  I appreciate that people should consult with the ESB before they locate their houses but very often location is a matter of Hobson's Choice; one either builds on the site one has or one does not build at all.  I suppose every Member has had the experience of constituents telling them they have beeen quoted £X for connection and they cannot understand this because the electricity is just across the field.  They are told that this is a transformer charge.  It seems to me everyone is being charged for a transformer. Being ignorant of the way electricity works one just accepts that this is so, but the cost of connection from the old house to the new house is much too high.  It should be a nominal charge.</P>
      <P>The area to which I referred earlier, Loughatorick, is possibly the prettiest area in the whole of County Galway once you reach the top of the hill and look across to the Shannon, which produces so much of our electricity. The strange thing is that these people living beside the Shannon have no electricity at all.  All that area is incredibly beautiful and so I believe connection should be made by way of underground cables.  That should be encouraged.</P>
      <P>I fear like others that this £300,000 will not be enough.  If the Minister finds it is not enough, will he be prepared to seek further finance to carry out this absolutely essential work? We are now approaching the end of the century and it seems ridiculous that people, just because they live in remote areas, should be deprived of electricity.  We simply cannot continue without electricity on the farm and in the house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">

      <P>I should like to compliment Deputy Kenny on his maiden <Col N="1356" /> speech.  When I was in college with him I never imagined the day would come when I would be complimenting him here in this House.  He certainly made the case for the people in the West.</P>
      <P>I welcome the general principle of the Bill but, like other speakers, I cannot see how £300,000 will be sufficient.  I cannot understand why the Minister was so vague about the number of householders who would benefit.  He said precise figures are not available but the ESB have estimated that, in all, there are some 800 to 900 householders in these and other isolated areas.</P>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I wonder why only two areas were mentioned.  I understood that the Woodford area would be included in the terms of this Bill.  I hope the Minister will give us a list of the areas which will benefit. It must be obvious to him, from the number of parliamentary questions tabled last week, that Members are anxious to know the areas that will benefit from the scheme.  I would also be obliged if the Minister would give us a breakdown of the elements contained in a typical quotation from the ESB for installation.  Is it the case that the cost of poles is the big factor?  If that is so I wonder how it is that a final quotation for the installation of a telephone is not as high as a quotation from the ESB.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs also make use of poles in the installation of telephones&mdash;I accept that it takes a long time to have a telephone installed&mdash;but if poles are the expensive factor I would support the suggestion that the ESB use underground cables. Poles are unsightly and must be replaced quite often and this is another factor in favour of using underground cables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that more people are anxious to live in rural areas. From a practical point of view those who wish to erect a house in a rural area can obtain a site cheaper than if they wanted to buy one adjacent to a town or city.  In many cases in rural areas parents or relations give sites to their children with the result that the heavy expense of purchasing a site is <Col N="1357" /> avoided.  However, even with this advantage young couples anxious to live in rural areas must be prepared to spend a lot of money to gat electricity into their house.  I welcome the proposal to permit people to pay for this installation on an instalment basis.  I understand that because quotations for the installation of electricity are so high local authorities have not proceeded with housing schemes in rural areas.  It is sad to think that people cannot get a house in an area in which they are anxious to live.  It appears that the ESB and the Department of Local Government will in future be telling the people where to build their houses. ESB quotations may become the criterion for housing schemes, local authority and private housing schemes.  I hope this trend will cease soon.</P>
    <P>Deputies complained of low voltage in some areas.  A farmer in my area told me that at times there is not sufficient power to enable him to boil an egg on his electric cooker.  If we are to provide a service it should be a good one.  I have received many letters from the local ESB office, in relation to the Woodford area in particular, to the effect that they were awaiting the introduction of this Bill to see if it would give relief to certain categories of consumers.  I hope that its introduction will mean that many people in rural areas will be able to avail of the facility for which they have been waiting so long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is about time such a measure was introduced and it is a move in the right direction.  We all agree that the amount of money being made available will not be sufficient but the Minister has made a start.  Many young married couples who have been asked to pay up to £500 for connection to the electricity supply have approached me to see if it would be possible to have that special charge reduced.  In fact, some couples have been asked to pay as much as £1,100 for connection.  Young couples find it difficult enough to raise the money, from local authorities and building societies, to build a house without having to face the enormous <Col N="1358" /> charge for connection to electricity. The fact that this must be paid in cash is also a great burden on people.  I welcome the provision whereby people will now be able to pay the connection charge on an instalment basis.</P>
      <P>An effort should be made to provide electricity for old age pensioners and disabled people.  Many old age pensioners in my constituency cannot afford to pay the special charge with the result that they do not have light or heat.  That is a sad situation.  In many isolated areas in Mayo the county council only allocated £100 towards the cost of installing electricity with the result that those involved have to pay up to £400.  Those people are entitled to be housed by the county council and in many cases large families are involved.  I know of a family who have not moved into their new house because the county council cannot afford to pay the full amount for the installation of electricity.</P>
      <P>I am sure this Bill is being introduced as a result of representations made by rural Deputies to the Department of Transport and Power.  Another matter brought to my attention is that in some rural areas the voltage is not high enough for farmers to use their milking machines.  I accept that when this is reported to local ESB offices every effort is made to rectify the position but I have seen in my own townland the lack of power which results in television sets going off.  We are going through a serious financial situation throughout the world and the Minister must be complimented from that point of view for providing this money to help the people who need it.  If one goes into a pub in any town in Ireland one will find it packed, and nobody should begrudge a penny or two to help to provide electricity for those who have not got it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Although welcome, the Bill is but a feeble effort by the Government to help in this vital area. The provision of electricity in rural areas is a social service.  It is also necessary to provide the infrastructure for industry in rural Ireland.  It seems to me that there is an implication in the Bill that development in rural <Col N="1359" /> areas finished in 1975 and that by then we had completed our obligations in regard to the provision of electricity. That is not true.</P>
      <P>In the past year people have been quoted figures of between £1,000 and £2,500 for connection with electricity supply.  These are enormous sums for such people.  I agree enormous work in this field has been done in recent years but there are still many rural households unconnected.  There is nothing in this Bill to help people to pay the enormous sums demanded for connection.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan O'Higgins referred to mountainous areas in Galway and North Clare.  I know places within a few miles of Ardnacrusha where people have got quotations of £500, £600 and £700 in the past year and this Bill will not help them.  We cannot write them off and forget them. The Minister must provide subsidies for them and continue subsidisation in the next few years.  Instead of the £300,000 this Bill will provide, we should be talking in terms of £3 million if we are to do this work properly.  I have had representations from people in Lissycasey who have been quoted subsidised terms but they still find the cost too high.  They have been given until 31st December to agree to take the supply.  Can that period be extended and will those people benefit by the provisions of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his opening speech the Minister said that all householders in areas where work remains to be done, whether already quoted terms or not, who applied and qualified for subsidised supply before 31st March last, will get supply on subsidised terms. Will that apply in the case of the people I have mentioned?  Later in his speech the Minister said that when the present work has been finished subsidisation of supply in rural areas will come to an end and normal economic or unsubsidised terms will apply from then on.  People who have already applied for subsidised electricity should be told whether they will qualify under this Bill.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that <Col N="1360" /> advertisements in local newspapers will make people aware of the position.</P>
    <P>It seems strange the Minister did not give figures of the number of households involved.  I would have thought he would have had up-to-date figures.  As I have said, the Bill is welcome but it does not do anything to meet the needs of young people who have been getting quotations of between £1,000 and £2,000 in the past year.  There does not appear to be anything in the Bill to help them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I welcome any additional assistance to provide electricity for rural areas, I do not think there is much encouragement in this Bill because the amount of money is too small.  I fail to see how £300,000 will help to provide the service required. We have been told that the number of houses in rural Ireland which have electricity compares favourably with Britain and America. We should not be satisfied until every house in Ireland has been connected.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed that the Minister did not make reference to new houses.  Many new house builders who paid for the service through direct or indirect taxation were missed out during the operation of the subsidised scheme which has now been discontinued. Admittedly, the ESB made every effort to draw attention to the fact that the scheme would discontinue. Notwithstanding all the advertisements a number of people in all areas failed to avail of it and many of them cannot afford to pay the extra charges.  I believe that a survey should be carried out and some assistance should be given to ensure that those people get a supply of electricity. There is an inadequate supply of electricity particularly in milk producing areas where milk parlours and so on require additional power.  When called upon, the ESB make great efforts to supply the required electricity but their lines and transformers are not strong enough and stop-gap measures are introduced to keep a plant going.  The ESB must replace those lines and transformers in order to ensure a sufficient supply of electricity to those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> Great work was done in rural Ireland following the war when people began to realise the benefits of an electricity supply.  Organisations such as Muintir na Tíre and other groups went around the country canvassing so that people would accept the ESB. Those people had arguments to contend with and in many cases they could not convince the people of the benefits that would result and in many areas it was well into the 1960s before they had rural electrification.  Electricity is essential at present and a survey should be done in relation to the conditions of the lines of the rural areas and also in relation to the lighting of villages because in many cases they are inadequately lighted.  The ESB are doing a survey in my county at the moment in relation to the requirements of villages.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that at his request the board has agreed to introduce a scheme for deferred payments for the cost of electricity.  This is to be welcomed but is it fair that people who have contributed to the ESB as a semi-State body by way of direct or indirect taxation now find that they will not be eligible for assistance towards the cost of electricity once the subsidised scheme is finished?  The deferred payment scheme is a help but interest must be paid.  Even at a deferred rate there would be a sizeable interest to pay on, say, a sum of £900. New house builders should be subsidised in relation to electricity.  The ESB report for the year ended 31st March, referring to the rural electrification scheme 1975-76 said that during the year 3,964 new rural customers were connected under the final phase of the subsidised rural electrification programme bringing the total number of customers under the scheme to 405,000.  The applicant in 1976-77 will get no assistance; they can only avail of the deferred payment system.</P>

      <P>A person building a new house and applying to the ESB for electricity is not subsidised.  These people have contributed towards provision <Col N="1362" /> of electricity for other people and they now find when they go to erect a house they will not be subsidised. That is a very big expense when you take into account the increased cost of sites and building generally.  In fairness, when a person is about to erect a house and applies for planning permission he is also advised to apply to the ESB for an estimate for the connection of the electricity in case he might have to meet a very large bill for electricity if the house was not convenient to ESB power or a transformer.  One is still faced in rural areas with the problem of securing building sites and, in many cases, people are unable to acquire a site which is fairly convenient to ESB power lines.  They are faced with going to another area where there is a very heavy charge for the connection of electricity.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the cost of underground cabling.  The ESB report instanced the case of Tyrrellspass in County Westmeath where the electricity network was placed underground as part of the European Architectural Heritage Year project.  I should like to ask the Minister the cost of this work and if he has an estimate of the probable cost per consumer of such work.</P>
      <P>It is very important that electricity networks in regions of scenic beauty should be underground, but one would first need to ascertain the cost of this work.  I should like to know if the Minister has considered asking the ESB to implement a programme for the replacing of existing networks underground in tourist areas.  Would it be cheaper for all further developments to be placed underground?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When canvassers were trying to interest people in rural electrification, one of the arguments used when giving estimates of probable ESB charges was that, when the initial cost of full rural electrification had been met, people would enjoy fairly cheap electricity.  There was no talk at that time about the cost of replacing either the telegraph poles or the electricity poles and wires.  The Minister and the ESB should have this matter examined.  A survey should be <Col N="1363" /> carried out on the need for replacement of those lines.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the Ballycroy area in County Mayo.  Another speaker mentioned the Mayo by-election. I was glad to hear by-elections could bring such results in their wake.  We had a by-election in Monaghan and many promises were made&mdash;not by this Minister&mdash;which did not materialise or come to fruition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We welcome this Bill even though it is belated.  It is most encouraging for us to hear in the Minister's speech of the great work done by the ESB over the past number of years in the provision of rural electrification.  We are all aware of the many benefits which come from the provision of electricity. Tourism in my own area would not have developed to any great extent without the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though I discussed the Bill on radio with the Minister, I am not quite clear on exactly what is involved. I have a letter from a person who was quoted the sum of £2,880 as a capital charge.  Will this man now be in a position to have his capital charge suspended and to pay a standing charge of £36.40 in six two-monthly instalments?  ESB bills are couched in legal terms and, for a person who has no legal training, it is not easy to understand what exactly is meant.  My first reading of this Bill gave me the impression that it referred only to people whose capital charges were in excess of £700.  I should like the Minister to explain these matters to the House when he is replying.  The Minister referred to rural areas and the position faced by people who are <Col N="1364" /> now building new houses in rural areas.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the average cost of surface dressing of (i) a mile of county road (ii) a mile of national primary, secondary or main road and (iii) a mile of local improvement scheme grant road in respect of each of the years ended 31st March, 1973, 31st December, 1974 and 31st December, 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Information in the form sought by the Deputy is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>In the case of county roads particulars furnished by road authorities do not enable national averages to be calculated.  Since there can be wide variations in unit costs for national routes, depending on width of road, length of haul and other factors, the calculation of average costs would not be a productive exercise.  Such information as is furnished to the Department in respect of the local improvement scheme would not enable such calculations to be made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there has been a general reduction in the acreage of vegetables grown for all the Erin Foods factories of the Irish Sugar Company in recent years. This reduction has been necessary because the competitiveness of the company's dehydrated vegetables in the export market has been eroded due to the recent entrance of a number of producers from other countries into this market.  In addition, there has been a general downturn in the world market in the demand for dehydrated vegetables.</P>
      <P>The company's level of production must, of course, be based on the market demand for their products and the consequential cut-back in production has unfortunately led to a shortening of the annual vegetable campaign. The reduction has been spread as equitably as possible over all the company's food factories.  The provision of more work and a longer processing season at the factories is dependent on an increase in the demand for their products.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance when he proposes to initiate legislation governing betting offices and illegal betting in view of the enormous amount of illegal betting being carried on both inside and outside the State at present and the penalties he intends to impose especially in cases of illegal betting carried on in public houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that he is getting an adequate return from the betting tax at the <Col N="1386" /> moment?  According to the figures he gave here last week it seems that the betting turnover in those offices in the country is £30 million approximately while in the Six Counties with one-third the number of betting offices the turnover is now £36 million.  Would the Minister agree that something should be done urgently in order to ensure that this illegal betting is prevented as a result of the comparison of those two figures where we have a population of three million here and one-and-a-half million in the Six Counties?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, I do not doubt his honesty in this matter but he may have been misinformed. <Col N="1388" /> The Office of Public Works have some part of the rescue work in the harbour.  There is some local ill-feeling there against the Office of Public Works which a little goodwill on the part of that office would help to remove and thus help to ensure a better service.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware of the size of losses sustained by certain herd owners as a result of brucellosis and of the impossibility of their re-establishing themselves without adequate compensation; and the measures he proposes to take in order to ensure the proper working of the eradication scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the problem encountered by herdowners who sustain a serious outbreak of brucellosis.  This was one of the reasons why I have indicated that I proposed to ask the Government to establish a fund to help herdowners who suffer significant hardship as a result of heavy outbreaks of disease. Such a fund would, of course, be established only if the industry itself <Col N="1389" /> undertakes to provide the money to keep it financed after the first year.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the measures now in operation are adequate to ensure the proper working of the eradication scheme.  As the Deputy is aware, however, I have recently established the Advisory Council on Animal Health and Disease Eradication and shall give full consideration to whatever recommendations the council may make on all matters in relation to disease eradication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not acknowledge that the arrangements he has made for the compensation of herd owners are condemned by all the farming organisations as being totally inadequate?  Is he not further aware that they are unlikely to be accepted by the farming community and herd owners generally and that therefore there will be no effective disease eradication scheme in operation until the question of the acute cases, such as brucellosis in herds, can be specially dealt with first and thereafter the fixing of realistic compensation for herd owners in the cases of both TB eradication and brucellosis eradication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In further reply to the Deputy, I have acknowledged in my reply that there can be and there are hardship cases and we have made proposals in relation to these cases. What the Deputy says about the lack of progress or the unlikelihood of progress being made unless reactor prices are increased, I do not accept.  Even in the short time that we are testing we have more than ample evidence that testing is going ahead normally and that farmers are having their animals tested and are selling them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that during the two-year period when there was no animal disease control whatever the incidence of both brucellosis and TB spread through areas that were already declared tested and free from these diseases and that the instance of reactors throughout the country is almost as bad as it ever was?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the President of the IFA is reported as saying that they are in fact, and that it is arranged that they are getting normal prices for brucellosis reactors.  Of course they are not getting normal prices for TB reactors because the market for TB reactors is a restricted market.  This is not to say that in certain instances a fair price is not being paid for TB reactors. But we are tied on TB reactors; we cannot do very much about them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply, surely the Minister is aware that they are not getting the price which he said?  What he said is wrong. I know a case where a man did not get even the price of the hide.  There is no use in saying they are getting it. They are getting a raw deal.  The Minister knows as well as I do that the smaller type of farmer whose cattle get a bad dose of brucellosis is going to be finished after the cost of replacements.  The fund for hardship cases is totally inadequate.  I would like to know how badly off one would have to be before this fund would be of any use to a man who has a bad case of brucellosis infection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy would like to avoid fraud in the expenditure of taxpayers' money.  If the people the Deputy has referred to are putting the same punch mark in the ears of the sheep as we are putting for grant purposes then the same sheep could be presented twice for payment of grants.  We have known such frauds to take place.  It is only <Col N="1394" /> for that reason we are being cautious about this.  I have said I will take up the cases referred to and have them investigated.  What more can I do in the circumstances?

      <P>It was not in 1976 that this Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1399" /> got into his mind that an exclusive fishing band was essential for the development of our fisheries.  He had that in mind since he became a Member of this Dáil in 1951, throughout the fifties, sixties and seventies.  It was only in 1976 that the Fianna Fáil Party got into their mind that an exclusive fishery band was essential because the emphasis was on free access with a possibility of getting a three-mile exclusive band in the negotiations carried out by them in 1970 and 1971.</P>

    <P>In moving this motion, I am taking a significant step in public service <Col N="1405" /> reform.  I am proposing to open to review by the Oireachtas an area of the public service where the public and Deputies have frequently expressed misgivings about the degree of information available particularly for parliamentary consideration.  The magnitude of the area of the public service covered by the 25 bodies in the Schedule to the motion, and their importance in the national economy, can be gauged from the fact that their total net assets now exceed a figure of £1,000 million and their annual turnover is well over £500 million and they employ some 57,000 people.</P>
    <P>In response to specific needs in some cases and because of a doctrinal approach in others, public enterprises, nationalised industries and similar State bodies are a feature of most developed countries.  The Irish State-sponsored body has from early days been a major force in the development of the economy.  Our State-sponsored bodies grew out of <i>ad hoc</i> responses to different requirements.  Once established each body has tended to operate independent of its parliamentary creator while Members of the Oireachtas and the public were alternatively infuriated by or apathetic about its activities.  This unhealthy situation has brought about a realisation that the effectiveness and acceptance of these bodies as efficient national agencies required a more formal relationship to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Beginning with the establishment of the Electricity Supply Board and the Agricultural Credit Corporation in 1927, they have grown in number and size until today there are now about 100 State-sponsored bodies employing some 65,000 people. Originally designed to enable the Government to operate with flexibility in commercial ventures, the form has over the years been adapted to provide similar flexibility in the discharge of functions which might, perhaps, be discharged by civil service structures. While there may be some borderline cases, it is normally possible to distinguish between &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; or trading bodies and those which are purely service type agencies.  While <Col N="1406" /> the latter or, as they may be termed, the &ldquo;non-commercial bodies&rdquo; are the most numerous, they are also generally much smaller.  The commercial bodies, which are included in the Schedule, employ over 57,000 out of the total figure of 65,000 and these are dominated, in size at least, by the four largest: CIE, ESB, Aer Lingus and Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Public opinion has long been concerned with the lack of accountability of the State-sponsored bodies.  I believe that the passing of this motion will help to allay public anxiety.  It should also satisfy the long-felt desire of many Members that the Houses of the Oireachtas should take a greater interest in the affairs of State-sponsored bodies.  As far back as 1950, I recall that a motion was introduced and debated in the Seanad to provide.</P>
    <P>That a Joint Committee, consisting of members of both Dáil and Seanad, should be set up to consider and report on what steps, if any, should be taken to provide for a periodic review of the operations of companies in which the State holds a majority of the issued shares.</P>
    <P>After a lengthy debate the Seanad agreed not to pass the motion.  In the late 1960s, the Committee of Public Accounts suggested that the activities of State-sponsored bodies should be subject to parliamentary review. In November, 1972, the Informal Committee on Reform of Dáil Procedures recommended an early examination of the relationship between the Houses of the Oireachtas and State-sponsored bodies.  Finally, during the course of the debates on the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 1973, many Deputies and Senators expressed misgivings about the accountability of State-sponsored bodies to Parliament and called for increased participation in the review of these bodies.  As I indicated at the time I was sympathetic to this view.</P>
    <P>In their considerations leading to the introduction of this motion, the Government have had to consider whether the Oireachtas should be asked to review the whole State-sponsored body area or should have <Col N="1407" /> a more limited mandate.  As I have said, there is a significant difference between the commercial and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies. The latter are in many ways similar to the executive branches of Government Departments, except that they have a larger degree of operating freedom.  There is a problem in relation to their responsibility to the Oireachtas but, at this stage, it seems that a solution may well lie in a redefinition of their relationships to Ministers.  For the commercial State-sponsored bodies, however, we feel that the existing relationships to Ministers, which provide for considerable operating freedoms, are broadly correct but that there is, in the overall structural pattern, a gap in the area of responsibility to the Oireachtas which will be filled by the proposals now before the House.  We are, therefore, proposing that review should cover those bodies engaged in trading or commercial operations.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give a precise definition of the term &ldquo;State-sponsored body&rdquo;.  Generally, the term may be taken to include bodies established by or under statute and financed wholly or partly by means of grants or loans made by a Minister of State or the issue of shares taken up by a Minister of State.  In addition there may in some cases be doubts as to whether a body is commercial or non-commercial. For this reason, the general principle is being adopted that commercial bodies are those which derive the greater part of their current revenues from the sale of goods or services.  To put the matter beyond doubt, the bodies to be covered by the Joint Committee are listed in the Schedule to the motion.</P>
    <P>The motion provides for the establishment of the Joint Committee consisting of seven Members of the Dáil and four Members of the Seanad to examine and make recommendations where appropriate in relation to the 25 bodies set out in the Schedule. There is provision for the addition of new bodies or the deletion of existing bodies if required and the powers of the Joint Committee and certain procedural <Col N="1408" /> matters are specified.  There are a few points on which I might make particular observations.</P>
    <P>The motion provides that the committee will have power to send for such persons, papers and records as it considers necessary for the task of examining the reports and accounts and overall operational results of the State-sponsored bodies listed in the Schedule.  The emphasis is on examining the general efficiency and effectiveness of the bodies rather than on attention to operational <i>minutiae</i>.  The examination required may also involve oral presentations and senior officers of a State-sponsored body being reviewed and, possibly, senior civil servants from Departments should attend before the Joint Committee. These people should be in a position to supplement the examination of reports and accounts which very often may require elaboration or clarification.</P>
    <P>Another factor which I would regard as being vital to the success of the Joint Committee's job is that it should have adequate specialist and technical support.  I shall endeavour to provide the committee, on request, with any technical or specialist expertise available within the public service. In addition, the committee may wish to employ outside specialists for particular inquiries from time to time and provision is made accordingly in the motion.</P>
    <P>The third point is that it is provided that, if a commercial State-sponsored body so requests, the Joint Committee will not publish confidential information about that body's activities and plans.  The reasons for the provision are obvious and I will not labour them.  Certain confidential information might, if published, give an unfair advantage to competitors who were under no similar obligation to make disclosures.  While the interests of the bodies in the matter of publication will be safeguarded, the committee will not be inhibited in seeking information relevant to their task.</P>
    <P>While the Joint Committee will determine their own operating programme, there are certain general <Col N="1409" /> questions which they may wish to resolve at an early stage in their proceedings. Because of constraints of time and resources, they will hardly be able to examine all the scheduled bodies together and they will probably have to be selective in the order in which bodies are chosen for examination. It might be wise if, before getting down to the task of selection, they considered the general principles which should govern the operations of the bodies and the form in which accounts and reports are presented. Should the committee so decide, I can assure them of all the assistance that can be given by both my Departments.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Joint Committee should be seen as a significant development of our parliamentary institutions; it should not be construed as a criticism of the way in which State-sponsored bodies have been handling their affairs up to now. Indeed, I would like to take this opportunity to express a word of appreciation to the boards and the staff of all the State-sponsored bodies for the way in which they have tackled the often difficult tasks assigned to them and for the enormous contribution they have made to national progress.  I am confident that the work of the Joint Committee will not only result in making the bodies more accountable to the Oireachtas and, through it, to the people, but will help the bodies themselves to make an increased contribution to the economic and social development of the country in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a constructive and positive debate on this motion because it responds to a need very frequently expressed by the public in general and by Members of the Oireachtas.  I would hope therefore that the acceptability of the principles behind the motion, as well as the motion itself, will not be unnecessarily blunted by any issues of detail which may arise in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>I should like to anticipate some comments which may come from the Opposition because of the amendments they have tabled.  With regard <Col N="1410" /> to the size and composition of the committee, under Standing Orders the appointment of Members to Select Committees is a matter for the Selection Committee.  It is provided by Standing Order 69:</P>
    <P>Every Select or Special Committee, previous to the commencement of business, shall elect one of its members to be Chairman....</P>
    <P>I believe this is the appropriate way in which to handle matters like this rather than to spell something positively into the motion in the way suggested by the Opposition amendment. It is relevant to observe that there are at the moment two not dissimilar committees, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation. There are other committees.  One relates to matters over which you, Sir, preside, namely, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and then there is the Committee of Selection which is presided over by the Government Chief Whip.  In our sister Parliament in Britain the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries is chaired by a member of the Government party.  I understand the thinking behind this is that, where you have a number of committees, the chairmanship should be shared.  Our Parliament is very much behind the practice in other countries.</P>
    <P>In other countries, where there are several committees, the practice is to distribute the chairmanship between both sides and I would hope there would be general agreement on that principle here.  Which particular committees should be occupied by members of the Government or by members of the Opposition as far as the chairmanship is concerned is a matter for debate and for, I hope, gentlemanly agreement.  I would hope the principle of sharing the chairmanship would be accepted because the likelihood is that the number of parliamentary committees will tend to increase and it is desirable that the principle of distributing the chairmanship around the House should be accepted at this stage when we are embarking on this new committee.</P>
    <P>As far as State bodies are concerned, <Col N="1411" /> I do not think it matters a hoot who occupies the chair in any committee because Members serving on such committees in the past have tended to leave aside any partisan loyalties they might have and have dedicated themselves totally to the national good in an unprejudiced way. I believe that will continue in the future.</P>
    <P>There is an amendment also suggesting the work of the committee may extend into the area of policy. The purpose of the motion, as the House is aware, is to examine the reports and accounts and overall operational results of the scheduled bodies.  The amendment goes further. I notice that in the equivalent committee in Westminster the power of the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries extends only to examining the reports and accounts.  We propose to go further and examine the overall operational results.</P>
    <P>The Minister responsible for any particular company is responsible for the overall policy of the company and answerable therefore to the Dáil and the Seanad for that policy.  I believe that is as it should be and it would be wholly undesirable that that area of responsibility should be transferred away from the responsible Minister to a committee.  There would be the danger that, if the Minister were not to be held responsible for overall policy, fundamental decisions might get delayed or real policy issues might become concealed in the volume of work the committee would have to undertake.  It would be a wrong interpretation of the functions of the committee, I believe, to insert the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo;.  We cannot, of course, be certain as to what is the correct mandate for this committee at this stage but I would urge that we should allow the committee to operate for some time so that in the light of experience we could form a view as a result of the study of the reports the committee might provide for us.  With that experience it should be possible to take a fresh look at the committee's mandate in a few year's time to see if any further extension of its powers would be desirable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> I notice the Opposition have some misgivings about the proposal to delete bodies from the Schedule or from scrutiny by the committee.  I want to assure the Opposition that the need for such an amendment was identified since we tabled the original motion.  When we tabled it we had the Potato Marketing Board as one of the bodies because this board had been a State-sponsored body.  It has now lost that status and is a private enterprise body.  As such, it does not come within the ambit of the committee. Another example of a change of character occurred in 1972 when Bord Bainne was reconstituted in order to comply with EEC law.  Its status was changed to that of a co-operative society under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1936.  As Deputies are aware I have provided that deletions could occur after consultations between the Minister for the Public Service, the committee and the Minister for Finance.  I suggest that that is an adequate safeguard: it is the right way to do it, rather than requiring that each amendment should require the full sanction of the Dáil and Seanad. Sometimes it might be necessary to effect a quick change and I could not anticipate that a Minister, after consultation with the committee, would come to a decision which was in conflict with the wishes of the committee.  It is desirable that we should provide for the deletion and that is why I made the amendment to the motion as originally tabled.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with another suggestion made by the Opposition.  They suggested that the committee should be left with a discretion as to whether or not they might publish confidential reports received from a State body.  In my view it would be dangerous to leave the discretion with the committee. Many of these bodies are operating in competition with enterprises in the private sector and it would not be fair that information relating to their affairs which could be used against them by their competitors should be revealed by the committee in their formal reports or by members of the committee arising out of information <Col N="1413" /> which came to them in the course of their work on the committee. There is a real danger that if we leave the discretion to the committee in matters of this kind that information which could be helpful to the committee in their workings would be withheld from the committee.  I feel certain that State-sponsored bodies, aware of their responsibilities to the nation and to the committee, would not, unnecessarily, withhold information even of a confidential nature.</P>
    <P>If the committee find, in the light of experience, that their work is frustrated by the withholding of information it would be open to the committee to comment on that fact and ask the Oireachtas to take remedial action.  I urge Deputy Colley, and his colleagues, not to in any way soften the obligation which would lie on the committee not to disclose confidential information because it might not always be possible for the committee, even objectively, correctly to assess the need to withhold information which if released could be damaging to the best interest of a State-sponsored body and the State.</P>
    <P>There were suggestions for the addition of a number of bodies.  It was suggested that Bord na gCon, Gaeltarra Éireann, Bord na gCapall and An Bord Gáis be included.  I should like to state frankly that I have no strong view as to whether they should be included or not but I would like the House to know my thinking on the matter because that might help Members to assess whether on balance the boards in question should be included. I would remind the House of the distinction I drew earlier between a commercial State-sponsored body and a non-commercial State body.  In the selection of bodies for inclusion in the Schedule only those bodies which derive the greater part of their revenues from trading or commercial activities were included.  That was the test I applied.  Some other bodies which are primarily executive agencies of government derive some revenue from trading or commercial activities but they have not been included in order to keep the activities of the <Col N="1414" /> committee in the purely commercial State-sponsored bodies area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the bodies mentioned in the amendment, taken in the order of the degree of their commerciality, I should like to state that Bord na gCapall are a promotional body financed entirely by grant-in-aid from the Vote for Agriculture and Fisheries. In 1976, £647,000 was provided.  There is no element of commerciality as such in the workings of the board and, therefore, I respectfully suggest, no case for their inclusion in the Schedule.  Gaeltarra Éireann were originally a commercial type body but in recent years they have moved very dramatically from commercial to promotional activities.  In the year ended 31st December, 1974, the last year for which accounts were published, Gaeltarra Éireann received £4,500,000 by way of grants-in-aid and repayable advances while their total sales for the same period amounted only to £1,500,000.  While Gaeltarra Éireann are now primarily engaged in industrial promotion the commercial activities are now a relatively minor part of their activities their inclusion would divert the attention of the Joint Committee to examining non-commercial operations which now make up the principal part of their operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true in regard to Gaeltarra Éireann that they have fairly substantial equity holdings in a number of operations apart from the trading operations the Minister mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true but I am not satisfied that even taking those into account Gaeltarra Éireann could be treated as being primarily a commercial organisation.  Most of their work nowadays is analogous to that of the IDA in that they are acting as a promotional institution.  The IDA also have shareholdings in some enterprises but we have not on that account considered that they were primarily a commercial organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na gCon derive their revenue from the operation of the totalisator which was £751,000 gross in 1975 and from the levy on bookmakers which <Col N="1415" /> was £591,000 gross in the same year. Out of this they contribute to prize money in greyhound racing and coursing and make various promotional grants.  They also have a number of subsidiaries to run certain greyhound tracks.  Since their revenue comes from what might be called quasi taxation, the deduction from totalisator receipts and bookmakers' levies, they are not, I suggest, a commercial body.  They could be regarded as administering a tax on greyhound racing for the benefit of the industry. I should like to state that I would find it hard to distinguish between Bord na gCon, on the one hand, and the Racing Board on the other.  I notice no suggestion was made for the inclusion of the Racing Board and I imagine it was for the reason that they are similar to the character of Bord na gCon; they are primarily promotional and administering revenue collected in the nature of a tax.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis only recently came into being and are not yet engaged in commercial activities.  At the moment their funds come mainly from the European Investment Bank.  They will be a trading company whenever they sell gas when it comes ashore but this is unlikely to happen until 1978 onwards.  I suggest that this is a company which in due time would be added to the mandate of the committee. However, between now and 1978 the committee have more than enough to do to look at the workings of the 25 bodies which are in the Schedule, particularly as they include the four major organisations, the ESB, CIE, Aer Lingus and Bord na Móna.  There is ample work to keep everybody busy between now and 1978 without at this stage endeavouring to look at the workings of An Bord Gáis.  Because that board have just come into being they will not have any reports or accounts until late 1977 or 1978.</P>
    <P>I hope the House finds my observations on the suggested amendments helpful.  They are offered with a desire to help the House produce the best mandate for this new committee which I hope will be well received on both sides of the House, in the other <Col N="1416" /> House and by the public.  It means that we will have available to us an instrument which will explain to the public the workings of State bodies. In turn it may help State bodies better to understand some of the public anxieties and criticisms which from time to time may be expressed in tendentious and sometimes unhelpful language but which through the working of the committee may lead to a more mature understanding on everybody's part of the true functions and possibilities of the semi-State bodies who have served this country so well and who, I believe, will be able to serve the country better as a result of the greater understanding which will arise by the operations of this body.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the fact that the Minister has outlined some of his thinking in relation to the amendments.  It is helpful, but perhaps not as helpful as I should like it to be, to know some of the Minister's thinking.  Before dealing with the amendments in detail there are a few matters I should like to refer to.</P>
      <P>The first is that the Minister stated towards the end of his script that the establishment of this committee should not be construed as a criticism of the way State-sponsored bodies have been handling their affairs.  I should like to endorse that and to say that in so far as we agree with the principle involved in this motion&mdash;we have certain reservations in regard to its terms&mdash;I want to make it clear that that agreement is not in any way intended as a criticism of the way in which State-sponsored bodies have been handling their affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> On the contrary, I have personal experience of a number of CEOs of these bodies expressing the view that they would prefer, in regard to the bodies for which they were responsible, that there would be a review of their activities by the Oireachtas, and they felt that as a result they would succeed in bringing to Members of the Oireachtas a much clearer understanding of the role of the activities of the bodies concerned and they would hope thereby to avoid uninformed criticism of their activities. That is a view I have heard expressed by a number of CEOs.  I do not claim it is a unanimous view because I do not think it is, and I mention it in order to underline that the setting up of a committee of this kind is not a criticism of the way State-sponsored bodies have conducted their affairs.</P>
    <P>There may not be a Member of the House who has not got certain activities of some of these bodies in mind which he believes are matters that should be subjected to criticism&mdash;that is inevitable&mdash;but I believe the general principle in this motion is one that should not only make for a greater understanding of the work of semi-State bodies with a possible spin-off of better informed criticism, but also that it should be of assistance in the long term in the more effective working of State-sponsored bodies in the carrying out of the purposes for which they were set up or additional purposes.</P>
    <P>I believe a committee of the kind proposed will be extremely important. The possible effects and ramifications of an effective committee of this kind working are almost impossible to visualise at this time, but one can say they could have very important consequences, and they could have very damaging consequences, too, if the matter is not handled correctly.  Therefore it is important to pay attention to the small print of the motion as well as to its general principle.</P>
    <P>As we all know, various semi-State bodies have been set up during the years until we have reached a stage when I think it is true that bodies of this kind in our economy form a <Col N="1418" /> considerably higher proportion than in the economies of most if not all other western democracies.  This has happened for historical reasons but largely due to the fact that the capital, enterprise and expertise that could have been expected to emanate from the private sector were not available. I am glad to see that situation has been considerably improved but, for whichever reason, we have an unbelievably wide spectrum of public bodies.  The range of their activities is incredible to anybody who gets down to examining them, and the problem of their accountability to Parliament and the people is one that has exercised the minds of many for a long time.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a mystifying feature.  When consideration was given to this problem in the past, frequently one of the major difficulties adduced was the danger of the disclosure of confidential information in relation to the activities of commercial or trading State-sponsored bodies to their detriment and to the benefit of their competitors. The reason I find this situation somewhat mystifying is that looking at the motion one finds it proposes the setting up of a Joint Committee to keep an eye on the activities of the State-sponsored bodies which are engaged in trading and commercial activities, the very bodies which were supposed to present the major problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister has glancingly adverted to this in his speech.  He said the reason for excluding the non-trading bodies is that such bodies are extensions of the Departments concerned, and the policy for which they are responsible is one in respect of which the Minister is answerable in the House.</P>
    <P>That may be so in theory but it is not the practice, and I should like to give the Minister an example.  I will take RTE.  They have not only a policy imposed on them by the Minister but a statutory obligation to achieve balance in their programmes for, let us say, politics, the one with which all of us or most of us are familiar.  If a Deputy came in here with a question to the Minister for <Col N="1419" /> Posts and Telegraphs which was aimed at eliciting information as to the balance achieved by RTE in relation to political matters, it is almost certain such a question would be ruled out of order and the Deputy told &ldquo;This is not a matter for which the Minister is responsible&mdash;it is the responsibility of the RTE Authority&rdquo;.  It is therefore a fallacy to suggest that in the case of non-commercial, non-trading bodies, the matter can be dealt with by virtue of the Minister's responsibility for policy in this House and the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to have another look at this problem.  When one thinks about it, one is entitled to ask the question: &ldquo;Why should a body like Córas Tráchtála or the IDA or other similar bodies not be answerable to the Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of certain major aspects of policy?&rdquo; If we take the IDA, it is true that the general policy followed is the subject of discussion and debate in this House but, on the other hand, the methods used by the IDA to achieve its aims are not open to question in this House.  There are good reasons in some cases why it should not be open to full scale public discussion at least until the facts are established.  I am referring to the IDA just because it is of major importance.  What I am saying is true of many other bodies also. I would question the wisdom of excluding from the terms of reference of this committee all State-sponsored bodies which are not engaged in commercial or trading activities.  It may well be that the range of work involved is such that it would require another committee or even two other committees to do it.  I am not dealing with the practicalities of that at the moment but rather with the principle involved.</P>
    <P>When you come to the trading and commercial State-sponsored bodies you immediately come up against a problem which does not arise in the case of non-trading and non-commercial companies, that is, the danger of damage being done to the activities of such bodies by the disclosure of information concerning their activities or <Col N="1420" /> plans to other private commercial firms who are in competition with them.  I will refer later to the paragraph in the motion which is designed to deal with this problem but the fact is that that is not an easy problem and it arises directly out of the scrutinising of the activities of commercial and trading companies but it does not arise at all in the case of non-commercial and non-trading companies.  Therefore, there is a stronger case in my view for subjecting the activities of such bodies to the scrutiny of the House.  I strongly urge the Minister to think again about the activities of the non-commercial or non-trading State-sponsored bodies and the subjection of those activities to a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, if the Minister for various reasons, feels that is not something which can be contemplated at this stage, I would urge that the whole question of the responsibility of the Ministers concerned in regard to accountability in this House for the policies of such bodies should be reviewed, perhaps, jointly between Government and Opposition representatives, with a view to establishing clearly and unambiguously that responsibility for policy and all aspects of policies of such bodies is here in this House and ensuring that we do not have a &ldquo;no man's land&rdquo; in which there is, on the one hand, no responsibility in this House and, on the other hand, no committee or scrutiny by elected representatives of the policies of such bodies.  There is an area here where attention is required and the requirement could be met by setting up a similar committee or, alternatively, and perhaps, less satisfactorily, by a review of the Standing Orders and the practice and procedure of this House with a view to establishing clearly beyond doubt the full accountability of Ministers to the House in respect of the policy of State-sponsored bodies which are engaged in non-commercial or non-trading activities.</P>
    <P>The Minister disclosed in his speech the criteria which had been used in distinguishing between State-sponsored bodies which are engaged in commercial and trading activities and those <Col N="1421" /> which are on the borderline.  The Minister used this criteria to show why some of the bodies we have suggested as being suitable for adding to the Schedule should not be added.  The Minister will appreciate that the first we heard of this criteria was in the House today.  There is nothing on the face of the motion to give any indication that one should have regard to whether the major portion of the income of a State-sponsored body should be derived from commercial or trading activity in order to include it in the terms of this motion.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that since we did not have the criteria to apply we could not apply them to the companies we proposed to add. Furthermore, it may be that the criteria put forward may not be universally accepted.  I would question, except on the grounds of practicality, whether such criteria should be applied at all.  If the Minister had said that the range of bodies was so large that a committee of the House could not deal with this work and, therefore, he wanted to confine it to the major bodies concerned in terms of commercial and other activities, that would be a practical approach whether one would accept it or not.  That was not the argument made.  The Minister has been putting forward somewhat arbitrary criteria and applying them to the various bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>There are some matters in relation to the operation of the committee on which a little more light could be shed.  Is it envisaged that the Press would normally be admitted to meetings of this committee?  Presumably if it is so envisaged the possible exclusion of the Press would also be envisaged where matters of a confidential nature such as are referred to in paragraph 3 of the motion would be concerned.  On the other hand, if it is envisaged that the Press would not be present at all, we would like to know that.  Speaking for myself, my first reaction would be that this would be unacceptable.  We ought to have spelled out what exactly is envisaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry&mdash;it would be <Col N="1422" /> unacceptable if the Press were excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in all circumstances. I noted also that the motion before the House is not the motion originally put down by the Government. There are certain changes.  The Minister referred to one change which is the exclusion of one particular body because it has ceased to be a commercial or trading body.  I do not think he referred to an addition which was put into the changed version of the motion, that is, the addition of Irish Life.  That is an addition of some significance.  The Irish Life Assurance Company Limited is a very large and important body.  As we all know, it figured in certain controversial matters not so long ago.</P>
      <P>An argument is put forward by some people that it should not be subject to scrutiny by this committee because of the interest of the State in it, while the great bulk of its shareholding is extremely small in relation to the interests of the various policy-holders. I may say that is not an argument with which I agree, but I know the argument is made very strongly.  I would have expected that the Minister would throw a little light on why it was originally decided to exclude the Irish Life Assurance Company from this and subsequently decided to include it.  Perhaps before the debate concludes, we might get from the Government side a little more light on the reason for this decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing that is crystal clear, as far as I am concerned.  If this committee is set up, and if it does its work even moderately well, the demands on the time of the members concerned will be enormous and, for that reason, paragraph (4), which includes a provision to enable the committee to engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge, is of vital importance.  I should appreciate it if the Minister would spell out in more detail, in so far as he can, what he has in mind as regards the range of assistance which would be made available, and the numbers of persons involved, and <Col N="1423" /> whether there is any thought about limitations on this kind of assistance. Clearly, we do not want a situation in which outside experts of various kinds, be they auditors, engineers or whatever, are engaged to such an extent that the matter becomes one of dialogue between the representatives of the State-sponsored bodies on the one hand, and these outside experts on the other.  Clearly that is not what is desired or envisaged.</P>
    <P>On the other hand I cannot lay too much stress on the fact that the demands on the time of Deputies are very great.  They are increasing, and particularly Deputies of the calibre we would like to see serving on this committee, if it is to be effective, are Deputies whose time is already very heavily committed both inside and outside the House.  Consequently, I regard it as being of very great importance that every possible step should be taken to try to ensure that the Deputies and Senators who will be members of this committee will have affairs so arranged for them that they will be able to concentrate on the important matters on which they should concentrate, particularly aspects of policy and I will come to that in more detail later.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see a situation in which members of this committee have to dig and delve through a great deal of largely irrelevant information in order to get at the real information with which they should be concerned. We should try to ensure that the assistance which will be made available to them will be such as to enable them to avoid having to spend unnecessary time on that kind of activity.  If we get the right people on this committee, their time will be much too valuable to be spent on that. Indeed, it is not unknown for people in the public service, and outside it, to develop a technique whereby they can drown people in paper, paperwork and details in order to keep them from getting at the major issues with which they should be concerned.  Now is the time we should try to ensure that the machinery being set up will, <Col N="1424" /> so far as is humanly possible, avoid that pitfall.</P>
    <P>I come now to the amendments and I should like formally to move amendment No. 1 standing in my name:</P>
    <P>In paragraph (1) after &ldquo;Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo; to insert: &ldquo;and of whom 5, including the Chairman, shall be members nominated by the Leader of the Opposition&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We envisage the role of this committee as being analogous to that of the Public Accounts Committee.  It will be, we hope, a watchdog committee. If we were to follow the procedures in regard to the Public Accounts Committee, we would end up with even representation between Government and Opposition, and with the chairman being provided by the Opposition.  Since the Public Accounts Committee is a committee of this House only, and the committee proposed in this motion is a Joint Committee of both Houses, difficulties arise in that regard which we recognise.  So far as we are concerned, departing from the principle of even representation, which has always been observed so far as I know in regard to the Public Accounts Committee, is a concession.  We recognise the practical difficulties and in recognition of those difficulties, we are prepared to depart from the practice in the past in such committees.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, we believe it is important that, so far as possible, this committee should be set up on the same lines as the Public Accounts Committee.  That brings us to the question of the chairmanship.  I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach is here because he will recall writing a letter about this committee to the Opposition Chief Whip in which he set out certain ideas in regard to the composition of the committee. I am not purporting to quote him because I have not got the letter with me, but I think he will accept that what I am about to say substantially represents the point of view he put forward.  He said that, by tradition and practice, the chairmanship <Col N="1425" /> of a committee of this kind was provided by the Government side.  I want to make it clear that our view of the role of this committee as a watchdog committee, as analogous to the Public Accounts Committee, is such that we could not accept the proposition that it is traditional or in accordance with practice that the chairmanship should be provided by the Government side rather than the Opposition side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not remember this myself.  I accept the Deputy is relying on his recollection.  So am I, but I do not think I made a reference to the chairmanship of the committee.  What I did say was that the Government would need an overall majority and that has certain purely arithmetical consequences for the representation of individual parties, given that there must be presumably an independent member of the committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Independents are concerned, the Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate a problem that arises in regard to Independents, because they are Independents, is that one Independent does not represent another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, they have on a couple of other occasions that are not present to my mind agreed between themselves on one Independent standing for the arithmetical total of them in other committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should say then that if the Government feel it necessary or advisable to provide for an Independent member of this committee as representing the other Independents in both Houses, that is a matter for them.  However, the Parliamentary Secretary will note the wording of amendment No. 1.  It is unusual&mdash;I freely concede that&mdash; when we say &ldquo;members nominated by the Leader of the Opposition&rdquo;, but it is precisely to ensure that we are not saddled with some Independent as purporting to represent us that we have worded it in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be occasionally <Col N="1426" /> tough for the Opposition to find that an Independent cannot be relied on by them, but the consequences for the Opposition are nothing like as serious as they are for a Government that finds that its majority consists partly of an Independent who is not reliable. One thing I wanted to observe briefly is that there are six university Senators, two of them have since joined the Labour Party, but there are four other university Senators, three of whom certainly are not members of a political party, and we simply cannot exclude them.  This is a committee of both Houses, and there are three Independent Deputies here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can give no undertaking in respect of the Independents, nor will I be represented nor purported to be represented by Independents. That is why, as I say, amendment No. 1 is worded as it is.

      <P>The Opposition did want five members.  I offered the Fianna Fáil Whip&mdash;and that offer is still open &mdash;to change the total number of members of the committee.

      <P>In this context I want to reiterate the point I was making, that we visualise this committee as being analogous to the Committee of Public Accounts, having equal representation for Government and Opposition. However, because it is a committee of both Houses, we recognise the <Col N="1427" /> practical difficulties that arise and are, therefore, prepared not to press for equal representation for Government and Opposition.  But we do not want, as a result of that concession, to be pushed even further and be asked to accommodate the Independents as well.  That is a luxury we should gladly leave to the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know, the Government have an absolutely open mind&mdash;except for the non-negotiability of a Government majority&mdash;about membership of this committee, about the size of the committee and in regard to juggling with figures.  If the Deputy's side would make some suggestions, we could do business.  I have written three times to the Opposition Chief Whip.  I have had two replies, but I have not had one single constructive suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>He might say amendment No. 1 is not a constructive suggestion. I think it is, and it represents the view we would take in the Opposition having regard to the fact that we are making a concession in regard to numbers.  As regards the chairmanship, I am not sure what the position is.  From what the Minister said earlier and from what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, it may be that the Government have an open mind on that question.  But I want to make it clear that if this is to be a watchdog committee it is important that it should be seen to be, and one way in which that can be done is by having a member of the Opposition as chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how far the tradition goes back, but it certainly goes back a very long time.  In the case of the Public Accounts Committee, the Opposition always provided the chairman, and, indeed, you, Sir, have served as a distinguished chairman of the Public Accounts Committee in the <Col N="1428" /> past when this party was in Government. I think it is a good precedent. The present chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, Deputy de Valera, who is sitting here beside me, is discharging his duties extremely well and assiduously, and I have never heard a complaint in the past arising out of the fact that the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee came from the Opposition.  The same kind of thinking should be applied to this committee, and I would, therefore, strongly urge the Government to concede the proposition that the chairman should come from the Opposition.  I am speaking, of course, of the Opposition of the day, because, if and when this committee is set up it is going to last for quite some time and it will not have to last very long before there is a change of Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is welcome to whistle as loudly as he likes past the graveyard.  However, the only point I want to make in this regard&mdash;and just to keep the Parliamentary Secretary happy I will say there is going to be a change of Government some time; I will not ask him to agree to any more than that&mdash; is that the suggestions we are making will apply in reverse.  We are very conscious of this, so the Parliamentary Secretary can take it that it is not merely short-term opposition advantage we are concerned with but rather with the long-term structure of this committee.</P>

I do not think it is relevant to the point I am putting forward in relation to amendment No. 1. I think I have made as clear as I can the reason for putting down this amendment.  It may be that some further discussions or some further contributions from the Government side on this will clarify matters in regard to amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>I am trying to make out thinking as clear as possible in relation to the composition and chairmanship of this committee and why we think it is important. In case there is any doubt on this matter.  I want to draw attention to the fact that the motion provides for the exclusion of a member of the Government or a Parliamentary Secretary. That, Sir, is also in accordance with the Standing Order relating to the Public Accounts Committee and reinforces the case I am making that this committee is analogous to the Public Accounts Committee and should be structured in the same way.</P>

      <P>The Dáil may, on motion made after notice, appoint a Select Committee to consider and, if so permitted, to take evidence upon any Bill or matter, and to report its opinion for the information and assistance of the Dáil.

      <P>The point I am making, and with which I trust the Parliamentary Secretary does not disagree, is that the proposed committee should be regarded as being analogous to the Public Accounts Committee and structured on the same lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 proposes to insert the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; so that paragraph (1) would read: &ldquo;... be appointed to examine the Reports and Accounts, policy and overall operational results of State-sponsored bodies ...&rdquo;  I regard this as a matter of considerable importance.  I have already dealt with the policy aspect in relation to non-commercial companies but we are now dealing with the activities of commercial and trading State-sponsored bodies.  I suggest that, if one were to exclude the examination of policy, one could well be ensuring the non-effectiveness of this committee.  This committee is not necessary to perform the kind of function the Public Accounts Committee performs, that is, in relation to <Col N="1431" /> accounts, except to a limited extent.  I think&mdash;and it is generally acknowledged&mdash;that, in so far as there is a need for this committee, the need is in relation to the policies pursued by the State-sponsored bodies, in trying to relate that policy to the aims laid down for the particular body and in trying to measure the degree to which the policy pursued is helping to achieve the aims involved.</P>
    <P>One matter to which attention should be drawn is that the terms of reference laid down in paragraph (1) include the examination of reports and accounts and the reporting thereon to both Houses of the Oireachtas and the making of recommendations where appropriate.  If this were confined to accounts and the making of recommendations on them, one could understand the position, but the paragraph refers to the overall operational results and recommendations in regard to the overall operational results.  It is difficult to distinguish between making recommendations on the overall operational results and making recommendations on policies.</P>
    <P>For that reason the Minister should accept amendment No. 2, which will make it clear that there will be no room for argument that policy is excluded. If, for instance, amendment No. 2 is not accepted, it may be taken that there will be arguments that these terms of reference, which include making recommendations in regard to overall operational results, include the examination of policy.  If it is not intended that those words will include the examination of policy, it should be spelled out.  If that is what it means then we will have to examine the position again.  If this committee is to be effective and is to do the kind of job the public will expect it to do, the policy must be a matter of concern to the committee.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the difficulties that can arise in this regard, some of which are adverted to further on. What is involved is that we should not purport to set up a Committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas to examine the activities of commercial and trading State-sponsored bodies and <Col N="1432" /> then refuse that committee the powers to do the job the public expects it to do.  To examine the reports and accounts alone would not be doing the job.  To examine the overall operational results is going further and is welcome.  But how can a committee examine the overall operational results of such a body and make recommendations, if necessary, without examining the policy of the body?</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 2.  Failure to accept it will lead to argument and disagreement in the committee, which will be arguing about matters of this kind instead of getting on with the job it was set up to do.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 proposes to delete certain words from paragraph No. 2.  Paragraph 2 provides:</P>
    <P>That, after consultation with the Joint Committee, the Minister for the Public Service with the agreement of the Minister for Finance may include from time to time the names of further State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities in the Schedule,...</P>
    <P>We are not objecting to that at all. We accept that in the long-term additions to this are probably largely a matter that must be decided in some similar way.  Our objection is to the rest of the paragraph which says that the Minister may delete from the Schedule the names of any bodies which he considers no longer to be State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities.  I accept&mdash;and I think the Minister put forward these arguments when commenting on the amendments&mdash;that it may be possible to read that paragraph as meaning that the Minister can only delete bodies from the Schedule after consultation with the Joint Committee.  Certainly that is a possible interpretation.  We feel that the question of deletion is a matter which, in the normal way, may raise no problems.  But we must envisage a situation in which, let us say, there is a very intense inquiry going on in the committee into a spectacular State-sponsored body.  The situation is becoming <Col N="1433" /> difficult and the Minister concerned is under a lot of pressure perhaps from representatives of the State-sponsored body.  Indeed I can envisage a situation, arising out of that kind of inquiry, where one might have a chief executive or others in the State-sponsored body telling the Minister: &ldquo;If this goes on we are going to resign&rdquo;.  The Minister, under pressure, might say: &ldquo;Right, I will consult with the committee to delete them&rdquo;.  He is not obliged to go by what the committee say.  He merely consults them and then he deletes them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Deputy the section says that he might consider this in relation to semi-State bodies engaged in trading and commercial activities.  He could not arbitrarily do it.  He would have to justify such a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a little example of this today.  When the Minister introduced it he told us for the first time of the criteria he was applying to put in or delete companies. The criteria he applied related to the proportion of their income derived from trading or commercial activities. It is not inconceivable that the same criteria could be applied to say: &ldquo;This body should come out&rdquo;.  The point I want to make to the House is this.  If a State-sponsored body has ceased to be a commercial or trading body is it conceivable that there could be any difficulty about the committee agreeing wholeheartedly to take it out out of the Schedule?  I do not think there could be any difficulty there.  On the other hand, if a situation arose in which, as a result of a very detailed inquiry which was resented, an effort were made to take a particular State-sponsored body out of the ken of the committee, it is quite clear that such a situation would lead to grave suspicion which might be unjustified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we should put ourselves in that position.  I suggest that where a body has ceased to be a commercial or trading body there can be no difficulty.  In such a case all that is needed is a motion in the House to take it out of the Schedule and there <Col N="1434" /> would be no opposition from any part of the House to such a motion in such circumstances.  I do not think we should leave it open to have a situation of the kind I have described arise. It might be a temptation to some people to pressurise whatever Minister was concerned and the Minister might just give way to such pressure.  In my view that would be the worst possible thing that could happen.  When the going gets too tough it should be possible to take a State-sponsored body from under the scrutiny of this committee. I urge that amendment No. 3 be accepted.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 4, this proposes to change the emphasis somewhat in regard to what the procedure would be in the event of confidential information relating to a State-sponsored body's activities being furnished and whether or not it should be published.  The motion as it stands, in paragraph (3), envisages that, if the State-sponsored body requests it, then the committee must&mdash; there is no choice&mdash;agree not to publish confidential information regarding the body's activities and plans.  My amendment proposes to change that to: if the body requests it, and the committee so decide, then the information will not be published.  If this committee when set up is to be trusted to examine the confidential information that should be made available by the various bodies, then it should be possible to exercise proper discretion as to whether or not such matters should be published.  I do not accept that any State-sponsored body should have the right to dictate to a committee of this House as to whether it should or should not publish particular information.  Of course, I understand the concern&mdash;I share that concern&mdash;that there should be no damage done to the activities of any commercial State-sponsored body by reason of the publication of confidential information.  I would think that every Member of this House would share that concern.</P>
    <P>I think also that there is a principle involved here, that however important the information may be, however important the State-sponsored body may <Col N="1435" /> be, we cannot accept the proposition that a State-sponsored body whose affairs are being examined should be in a position to say&mdash;because that is the effective result of that paragraph &mdash;to a committee of this House: &ldquo;You may not publish any of the following information&rdquo;.  I do not think that is a position that we should or could tolerate.</P>
    <P>Therefore I urge this amendment to ensure that the decision as to whether or not something should be published would be made by the committee&mdash; at the request of the State-sponsored body, of course, because they are the people who are in the best position to indicate to the committee what is confidential, what is not, what could be used to their disadvantage and what could not.  But I submit that the decision should be made by the committee who are entrusted by both Houses of the Oireachtas with this task of examining the affairs of these bodies, of having submitted to them confidential information, who are being trusted with that information. They must be trusted to exercise a discretion which any responsible Member of the House would exercise in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I come now to the last amendment, No. 5, which proposes to add certain bodies to the Schedule.  These bodies are Bord na gCon, Gaeltarra Éireann, Bord na gCapall and An Bord Gáis. They are inserted merely as examples. There are quite a number of other bodies which might be added even under the criterion of being solely commercial or trading State-sponsored bodies.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara is one that springs to mind.  I know it is largely a promotional body but it does engage certainly in some commercial activities.  I think it operates boat-yards. Perhaps they engage in other commercial activities.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about some of these bodies and seemed to suggest that they were not engaged in commercial activities.  If I may take the last one first, he spoke of An Bord Gáis as not being really operational yet, that it would be operating only when natural gas came ashore and <Col N="1436" /> was being sold.  My information is that they are already engaged in the purchase of wayleaves, in negotiations with farmers, providing a pipeline for a supply to Nitrigin Éireann Teo, and the ESB in Cork.  I am not terribly concerned about An Bord Gáis and its inclusion.  These bodies were put in merely as examples.  There are others that can be added.  But I am concerned about Gaeltarra Éireann and its exclusion.  The Minister suggested that the reason for its exclusion was that it is now very largely a promotional body.</P>
    <P>I accept that a great deal of their work is promotional.  He mentioned a figure for the amount of their activities that are related to trading and said they have got rid of most of their trading activities.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht was not here at the time and that is the reason I am repeating this.  I pointed out to him, and he accepted, that Gaeltarra Éireann hold substantial equity holdings in quite a number of companies which are trading.  In many cases Gaeltarra Éireann are the majority shareholder but in some cases they are the minority shareholder but is it widespread.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>All of those are private companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that they may be private companies does not mean that the activities of Gaeltarra Éireann, who derive their income in the main from the taxpayer, are to be completely free of all scrutiny.  It is clear, in relation to the activities I am describing of shareholding in different companies, that they are not subject to scrutiny in this House.  If they are all to be excluded from scrutiny in this committee we could not accept that position, certainly not on the grounds that these are private companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking not alone about the taxpayers' money but about much more than that.  We are talking about the general policy that Gaeltarra Éireann are following in relation to their investment in these various <Col N="1437" /> companies, their activities, where they are located, and what they are achieving in the areas concerned.  This is something which goes to the basic roots of Gaeltarra Éireann's existence and why they are there.  I do not think it could be accepted that activities of that kind on the part of Gaeltarra Éireann should be excluded.  I do not know the proportion of Gaeltarra Éireann's income or expenditure which is involved.  It is unreal to suggest, from my knowledge of Gaeltarra Éireann's activities, that they should be excluded from the scrutiny of this committee because they are not really, or to any degree, substantially engaged in commercial or trading activities.  Whatever may be the structure in the future, to anybody who has any real knowledge of the Gaeltacht situation Gaeltarra Éireann are perhaps the major body concerned with commercial activities, with development in the Gaeltacht in one way or another.</P>
    <P>I am not denying that they are not concerned with various other activities, which are not commercial, but the degree of their involvement in commercial and trading activities is such that it would be quite wrong, unreal and might begin to raise questions and suspicions in people's minds if they were excluded, when bodies of the kind listed in the Schedule are included.  I strongly urge the Government, particularly the Minister for the Gaeltacht, who I imagine will have a large say in this matter, to include Gaeltarra Éireann in the Schedule to this motion.</P>
    <P>It might seem that I have spoken at undue length on this motion but, as I said at the beginning, I regard the small print of this motion to be extremely important as well as the principle.  I have tried to deal with a number of aspects arising from the small print and the amendments which I have put down.  There is a very interesting paragraph in the Minister's script regarding the adding in of other State-sponsored bodies in which he seems to be saying that the general approach is that all State bodies, which are commercial or <Col N="1438" /> trading, are really included.  Then he states:</P>
    <P>To put the matter beyond doubt, the bodies to be covered by the Joint Committee are listed in the Schedule to the motion.</P>
    <P>If that is the real approach, that it is just to put the matter beyond doubt, I hope there will be no objection from the Government side, unless there is a very good reason for their exclusion, to having all State-sponsored commercial and trading companies in and if some of them are overlooked that they can be added in immediately. That seems to be the sense of that statement in the Minister's speech.  I am not sure if, on reflection, that is exactly what he would want to convey. I do not think I am being unfair to what he says in that paragraph in interpreting it the way I did.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that this committee, if they operate even reasonably effectively; could be extremely important.  It is very important that we try to get it right at this stage and not have to come back mending our hands time and again when perhaps certain vested interests will have grown up.  We should, as far as we can, try to envisage them now and get the matter right at this stage when there should not be any great vested interest on one side of the House or other in regard to the activities of this committee.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will reconsider the position in the light of the amendments we are putting forward and the case I have made and my colleagues will be making.  It is important.  It could be vitally important but I do not want to see that we end up appearing to have a committee which will review the activities of State-sponsored bodies but which in reality are so hamstrung one way or the other that they cannot effectively do the job.  I reiterate something which I suspect most people outside the House do not realise and few people in the House realise, that is, that the amount of work that is involved or can be involved in this committee for Members of either House if they are to do the job envisaged here is enormous.  One of the big problems we will come up against is to get Deputies and Senators <Col N="1439" /> of high calibre to give the time that is required for the working of this committee.  Anything that can be done to smooth the work, in particular anything that can be done by the Minister for the Public Service to assist the Members in not having to spend too much time on donkey work but concentrate on the real work, will be very valuable.  I hope the Government will have an open mind on the case we put forward.  If they have we can ensure that we get this committee off to a good start.  I believe if we do the committee can do a job which could be very important for all of us and indeed for democracy in the country.  It largely depends on the attitude the Government adopt arising out of the debate we are having today, whether or not we get it off on the right foot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is gratifying in the House occasionally to see a measure of consensus between Government and Opposition regarding the necessity for this motion, the introduction of parliamentary review of semi-State bodies.  This issue has in recent years become much more important than it was earlier after the foundation of the State.  In the 1920s the development of semi-State bodies such as the ESB represented an infinitesmal proportion of our national budget. They have grown out of all proportion to the original intention of the Government of that day and today they hold an enormous proportion of the national cake.  For example, as the Minister stated in his speech, the semi-State bodies he intends including in this parliamentary review have a turnover of £500 million a year, their assets are valued at about £1,000 million, and they employ about 65,000 people.  Originally, I presume, they were established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, which was sensible at that time.  But as time has passed and taking into account the huge proportion of the national budget, national turnover, national assets of this sector, a certain amount of disquiet has developed <i>vis-á-vis</i> the issue of control.  The Government may ultimately have control, but at present they are so busy with <Col N="1440" /> other briefs in other areas that in practical terms their control of such bodies is minimal.  Through the present parliamentary process, there are inadequate means of discussing the activities of such bodies.  For that reason I welcome the introduction of the Bill by the Minister for the Public Service. It is most necessary to establish the formal relationship with the Dáil which he described.</P>
      <P>I accept his point of differentiation between semi-State bodies in the commercial sector and those in the service sector or the promotional area.  I accept it in the sense that I accept this as being the Bill which is being introduced by the Government.  However, in terms of concept, of philosophy and of control, I believe that all such semi-State bodies, whether commercial, promotional or service, should ultimately be incorporated in this system.  In the service sector there is the same need for this formal relationship with the Dáil, for parliamentary control, for dialogue and for questioning of attitudes. There were practical limitations, the main one being the incapacity of Members of this House to take on a vast new area of additional work at a time when we are finding it extremely difficult to get quorums sometimes for existing committee of the House such as the EEC Committee or the Committee of Public Accounts.  I accept that we are going to cover those companies which are in the commercial sector, but I hope that in terms of philosophy the Government accept the view that ultimately other semi-State bodies should be incorporated in this system in possibly two, three or four years hence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley mentioned Gaeltarra Éireann.  A progressively smaller portion of Gaeltarra activities is in the commercial sector.  There has been a severe cut-back of their own activities in the commercial field and the vast proportion of their activity at present is in the promotional and developmental fields.  Hence they are in the same boat as the Industrial Development Authority, which is not included.  It seems to me that if one of these bodies is included, then both <Col N="1441" /> should be.  If for the time being the attitude of the Government is that the commercial bodies are to go in, on that yardstick Gaeltarra should not be included.  In so far as they hold equity&mdash;and of course they do&mdash;the equity they hold is in private companies, and one might question the broad policy of Gaeltarra Éireann of involvement in taking equity.  However, one could not possibly entertain a situation where such committees should examine in any detail the workings of such private companies. This would obviously be a breach of confidentiality and of the whole business of free enterprise in our society.  For that reason it would not be acceptable.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of disclosure of information, it seems that if there is goodwill and if common sense prevails in the semi-State body in question and the committee, this question of disclosure will be minimised.  It is very unlikely that we will have a stalemate situation in which the semi-State company refuses to yield information on the basis that it is confidential whereas the committee would demand that such information be granted.  I disagree with Deputy Colley's point that the ultimate arbitrator in this situation should be the committee itself.  If the committee in question had a political complexion&mdash;we are not talking in terms of the present Government or Opposition but for posterity&mdash;there is a danger of political motivation of such decision by the committee.  Such a committee should not be the arbitrary decider of whether information be divulged as confidential or whether it should be released.  If there are reservations on this score it might be useful for the Minister to consider the naming of the Minister himself as the final arbiter in such circumstances.  If there is the deadlock to which the Deputy referred, it might be a useful practice for the committee to appeal to the Minister for his decision in such cases, and thus the Minister of the day would be the ultimate decider in cases of such contention. I do not accept that the committee themselves should have his type of arbitrary power in this area of confidential information.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1442" /> One aspect of the motion needs to be spelt out further.  I quote from section 1:</P>
    <P>... a Joint Committee ... be appointed to examine the Reports and Accounts and overall operational results of State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities (being the State-sponsored bodies referred to in the Schedule hereto), and to report thereon to both Houses of the Oireachtas and make recommendations where appropriate.</P>
    <P>There is a weakness in this wording which should be examined more closely.  On analysis, if this committee is going to examine reports and accounts and overall operational results, we are talking about an historical analysis.  In the world of accounting today it has been recognised in accounting, management and financial circles that there is a weakness in placing too much regard on historical accounting and that in terms of control budgets one needs to look at policies and to discuss the future in addition to examining the past and historical records.  I see the practical weakness in the wording in that if for a semi-State commercial body the financial year ends on 31st December and the accounts for that year are not published until the following June, July or August due to difficulties with the auditors of the semi-State body, with the publishing firm, or other such complications, we are getting the results of the year ending 31st December in June or July of the following year.  We are into the summer recess of this House at such time, so that the earliest time at which the committee could begin to consider the review of such semi-State body would be October.</P>
    <P>Therefore in practical terms, if the examination of reports and accounts and overall operational results of semi-State bodies are to be the work of this committee, we are going at best to examine results of a year which started a year and nine months previously.  At worst we may be examining the results of some companies in an historical two-, three- or four-year situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1443" /> I can understand the reluctance at times of the Government and the Minister to allow a review of policy because policy is in the area of Government and policy is reviewed in this House.  Having regard to that, there should be some arrangement for a look at the operations of such bodies. I hope there will be a loose interpretation of this examination or the inclusion by the Minister of some note in that regard.  If we can examine the reports, accounts and operation, for example, it will allow us to talk about their operations.  It will allow us to articulate the views of the people about the semi-State body in question and to pose questions about certain of their activities.  It will allow the chief executive and the personnel of the body to reply to the reservations of members of the committee and to articulate the policy of the company. Of course, there may be a clash on whether it should be the policy but presumably it will reflect Government policy ultimately and, at least, the articulation of such a policy in the committee will be a useful public exercise.  In addition to examining reports and accounts and overall operational results.  I hope the committee will have the authority to talk about the broad day-to-day policy and the immediate future policy of such companies.  That is important.</P>
    <P>The committee will have useful work to do in terms of the philosophy of the semi-State companies.  When such companies start operations there is a great deal of enthusiasm in Government circles and in the sector concerned and articles of association are drawn up confining the activities of the company to a certain area. These are the objectives set by the Government of the day.  However, there is a danger as time goes on&mdash; and there is a certain amount of evidence of it&mdash;that certain bodies begin to act and to take a loose interpretation of the articles of association under which they were set up, perhaps 20 years previously.  There is a danger that some companies may go beyond the original intentions of the Government and of the Oireachtas at <Col N="1444" /> the time of their establishment.  The committee could perform a useful function in discussing such broad matters with the semi-State bodies being reviewed.  I hope that cognisance will be taken by the chief executives of the importance of the committee. I hope it will become the practice of the committee in its review of a company to engage in dialogue with the chief executive concerned if he is available.  It should have this type of significance and it should become a major committee.</P>
    <P>For instance, Aer Lingus have been enormously successful in their operations in the air and subsequently that company broadened their base to include activities in overseas operations in hotels and in leisure activities.  Aer Lingus have done a very good job in their overseas activities and it appears from their investments that they have been one of the more successful semi-State companies.  The revenue accruing from their investments in overseas operations in hotels has helped the viability of that company but in terms of philosophy one could see the committee questioning the validity of the company in getting into such activity at a certain time.  That seems to me the type of work the committee could do with many other companies.</P>
    <P>The growth of power of the semi-State companies has built up anomalies and people with a concern for democracy have had some misgivings. The Oireachtas is the premier institution in the country but although we may have the trappings of power here in some cases the reality is different and much of the real power lies elsewhere. There has been an enormous growth in the sectors I mentioned and there has been an erosion of the position of the Oireachtas.  I hope that this vital Bill will tend to restore balance in this area.</P>
    <P>The primacy of this House must be fundamental to democracy in this country and if the primacy of this House is fundamental to the running of the country it raises certain other anomalies.  In practical terms the workload of Deputies who will be appointed to the committee will grow <Col N="1445" /> enormously.  An anomaly already exists so far as Members of the Oireachtas are concerned with regard to office accommodation, the capacity to delegate constituency work and such matters.  As this is the premier institution, nominally other institutions are responsible to this House but even at the fourth, fifth or sixth level in semi-State companies one could find individuals much better equipped than are the Members of this institution. We are not having proper regard to the primacy of the Oireachtas if we allow that situation to continue.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the Public Service for arranging the additional help we received last year with regard to secretarial assistance but, with respect, it is not meeting the needs of this age.  Individual Members are involved in constituency work, in party meetings, in correspondence, in attendance in this Chamber or in activities of committees such as the Public Accounts Committee, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and on the Joint Committee for EEC legislation.  There is the practical problem sometimes of getting a quorum for such committees because of the involvement of Deputies in other work.  If this committee is to be successful, the Deputies participating in it must be supported to a greater extent in terms of secretarial assistance for the delegation of the simpler work that can be delegated. Otherwise the country will suffer as long as that position remains as it is.</P>
    <P>I gather that the Minister for the Public Service has a certain amount of goodwill in this area.  I am told that one of the problems about accommodation is the availability of space in this area and I realise this presents a difficulty.  However, it does not take away from the fact that we must continue to consider ways of upgrading the type of support to which Deputies are entitled.  I hope there will be some improvement in that regard.  If there is not, this committee will not have the success it should have if it is to be of benefit to the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much this parliamentary review of State-sponsored bodies and wish it well.</P>

      <P>There is no question but that the Committee of Public Accounts have proved their worth in examining as they do each year the accounts of the various Departments. On a number of occasions that Committee expressed concern about the situation regarding semi-State bodies. Deputies have already mentioned the principle of accountability.  That is of concern to the Opposition at present. Perhaps it is because we are in Opposition that we have time to look at that side of the economic life of the State. It will come as a bit of a shock to many members of the public to find that the companies the Minister has scheduled to be included in a review by the proposed committee already have capital assets exceeding £1,000 million and a turnover in excess of £500 million.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is a reflection on Administrations of the past 30 or 40 years that it is only now this motion has come before the House, although it was mentioned from time to time over the past 25 years.  The Houses of the Oireachtas should fulfil their responsibility to semi-State companies as they do in relation to State Departments.  The type of exercise in which we are at present engaged and the workings of this committee will provide a necessary measure of encouragement, support and public confidence for these companies.  As one Deputy mentioned, we have had an increase in the growth and power of these companies over a relatively short period.  There are now almost 100 semi-State bodies involving a considerable amount of taxpayers' money and covering a very wide area of commercial life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the questions we are trying to deal with now relates to the publication of material.  The Opposition spokesman was correct when he said it should be a matter for the committee to decide having heard from the executives of the bodies examined. We know from experience that committees tend to act as one unit and in a very responsible manner.  Our spokesman was also correct when he said that the responsibility of Parliament should come before all other responsibilities and accountability <Col N="1447" /> should be laid on the shoulders of those appointed to responsible positions on committees of this kind. Consequently, if the question of the publication of material arose, it will be best dealt with by empowering the committee to decide.  Deputy Staunton dealt with that question in a different way and I will return to it in a few minutes.</P>
    <P>There are so many semi-State bodies that it does not seem possible that any one committee could deal sufficiently and effectively with their affairs.  In the motion the Minister listed 25 companies which the Government felt should be included in the responsibility of this committee. We feel that no semi-State company should be necessarily excluded, although the first priority of this committee should be to look at the companies engaging in commercial activities.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that it might be thought the many calls for a committee of this kind over the past 20 years might be taken as a criticism of the working of the executives in semi-States companies.  This does not enter into it at all.  Parliament should have final responsibility and be held accountable for all the companies. Executives of companies of the size of those named in the Schedule should feel the need to have to account to somebody.  This should make them all the more effective.  This would be a considerable aid to many of the companies mentioned here.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for Members of this House to be as flexible as possible when setting out the workload and terms of reference of this committee.  We are tackling this situation by way of motion and a number of amendments.  I wonder if this is too rapid a means at arriving at the methods of operating such an important committee?  Unlike a Bill this motion has to be dealt with here and now.  All the amendments must be taken together.  When this discussion ends there must be a vote in which the Government side would be deciding yes or no to the amendments put forward by the Opposition.  It disturbs <Col N="1448" /> me a little bit because this kind of committee is really rather like the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is not necessarily a committee which should have its terms of reference worked out other than by some sort of consensus.  As the Parliamentary Secretary will agree, it is not that easy to reach a consensus across the floor of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not despair of reaching a consensus and I agree it would be very desirable.  If we leave a few days before resuming discussion of this item&mdash;the debate will obviously not finish before seven o'clock&mdash;we might be able to get some kind of agreement as against, as the Deputy says, voting on three or four amendments.</P>

      <P>I think that is a good suggestion.  One of the reasons why I think it should not be all that difficult to arrive at some kind of working consensus, despite the difference of opinion that has shown itself as between the Minister and Deputy Colley, is that Deputy Colley himself mentioned that, whatever is put forward by the Opposition on this motion, democracy being what it is, the Opposition ultimately should be in Government and will have to wear the opposite side's point of view and whatever has been accepted by the Government. It is from this point of view we have been approaching this matter in arriving at the amendments tabled. It is a serious long-term point of view. It is not for the purpose of putting up the appearance that the Opposition is willing to co-operate and help to ensure semi-State bodies are accountable. It is rather as Deputy de Valera, as chairman of the Public Accounts <Col N="1449" /> Committee, and the Opposition members of that committee do; they endeavour to do as good a job as possible while in Opposition.</P>
      <P>I believe Deputy Colley's point is a valid one.  If the Opposition is to be genuinely involved in this on the basis of a committee of 11, then the number should be not less than five. I can see the Parliamentary Secretary's problem when he says the Government must have a majority. At the same time, he wants to have one independent on the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so much that the Government want any particular thing but this is a committee of both Houses and groups, and even denominations like Independents, might reasonably expect to get a share in it. If Independents sit on this, it will be a good deal more central.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>It might not be that easy to find an Independent who would give as much time as Government and Opposition Deputies would give.  As has been pointed out, the amount of time involved may be far greater than any Independent could afford to give. Demands on the time of Independents are greater than they are on those who are members of political parties.  If the Opposition is to carry a part of the responsibility for the accountability and operation of semi-State bodies, then it seems to me that, like the Committee of Public Accounts, the chairman should be a member of the Opposition.  The Minister suggested the chairmanship should rotate.  I believe the system that has worked so well in regard to the Committee of Public Accounts should be adopted and the chairman should be a member of the Opposition.  That principle in the Committee of Public Accounts has proved itself over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been argued by the Minister that non-commercial bodies should not be included.  I do not agree with that. All semi-State bodies using State funds or having a State guarantee in the provision of their capital should be responsible to the Oireachtas.  While they may, as the Minister suggested, be responsible in a more direct sense to the appropriate Minister, I am pretty <Col N="1450" /> sure no Minister can possibly get around, as this Committee will be able to get around, to looking at the accounts, the working and the general activities of these semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>We welcome this as a beginning, but I can see many problems arising.  The demands on time will be tremendous. Deputy Colley referred to the question of engaging the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist the committee.  If the members of the committee are to give the amount of time and energy that will be required to do the work entailed, then some form of secretarial assistance, specialist assistance and advice will be necessary.  The accounts side of bodies like the B &amp; I, Ceimicí Teoranta and so on would be quite mystifying to ordinary members and so, in order to do the work effectively, the committee will need assistance and advice.  Will the Minister tell us if this reference to the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge is applicable to the committee as a whole, to the members of the committee or to the chairman of the committee?  The Minister seems to have included most of the bodies engaged in commercial activity but we mentioned a number of additional ones in our amendment.  The reason for introducing Bord na gCon, Gaeltarra Éireann, Bord na gCapall and Bord Gáis is not specifically to bring out those companies; it is to refer to the principle that companies involved in a commercial way should be included in the Schedule for this committee.</P>
    <P>The other point on which there is not agreement at present relates to the matter of policy.  I do not think there should be any political difference of opinion on this matter.  It is important that all semi-State bodies should have more clearly defined terms of reference or policy authorisation. I do not think that in that area there should be any difference in viewpoint between the Government and Opposition.  For that reason we feel that any examination of the activities of semi-State companies should include policy so that there would be rapport between the executives of each company and the members <Col N="1451" /> of the committee.  This would be useful but I am prepared to listen to the Minister since he is the person who has included those companies.</P>
    <P>Although the Parliamentary Secretary has indicated that this is a matter which can be the subject of informal discussion, it would be a pity if we arrived at any rigid conclusion on either side in relation to the matters under discussion, particularly our amendments.  The experience Deputy de Valera has had on the Committee of Public Accounts would be useful and when contributing he will be able to give the Minister the benefit of his experience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very good aspect of the debate that the maximum amount of consensus is being sought from both sides of the House because it underlines the importance of the committee being established by the motion and the importance of the work it will be asked to undertake. To a great extent this is an innovation in our parliamentary procedures and it is correct, therefore, that all aspect of the composition and the role of the committee should be analysed in detail.  It is important that before the House reaches a decision the maximum amount of consensus and agreement is reached.  I take at face value the assurances of the Opposition that they are looking at the long term in putting forward their various amendments.  Perhaps it is only when one goes into opposition one realises that changes should be made in our institutions that will last a long term.  I can recall Deputy Lynch's conversion to an electoral commission for the constituency boundaries on the occasion when he realised he had lost a general election. That was a good thing in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a hint of that repeating itself when I looked at the first amendment, tabled by Deputy Colley, because it was accepted in an exchange across the floor that there would be a change of Government, this being a parliamentary democracy.  Yet a change which is sought on foot of Deputy Colley's amendment introduces the concept of the Leader of the Opposition. <Col N="1452" /> What happens if there is more than one party in Opposition and if they do not agree as to who the Leader of the Opposition is?  Clearly, the wording of that amendment does not cover the possible composition of future Oppositions in this House.</P>
    <P>The amendment is being dictated by the short term, that the Opposition at present consists of one party and it seeks to have five of its members included in the committee and one of those members to be its chairman.  For that reason I do not think the amendment can be categorised as being long term in the universal sense and capable of being applied to all situations. If there was a change of Government and the Opposition consisted of two or more parties&mdash;we must always permit of the possibility of new parties arising, as they have in the past&mdash;how would this amendment stand up?  How would the amendment stand up to a situation where we would have four or five parties of equal strength in opposition? Clearly, that amendment would not fit the situation.  It has been drafted from a very short-sighted viewpoint of what the opposition would be.</P>
    <P>Cognisance has to be taken of the position of Independents.  Speaking for the Opposition.  Deputy Colley said they were the Government's baby, but they are not.  In the other House the Independents, as in this House, sit on the opposite side to the Government. If they are anybody's baby they are the Opposition's baby.  If the committee is to be representative of both Houses then it should incorporate Independents.  It should also maintain a proportionality between the various parties represented in both Houses.  If it is essential to maintain the principle of proportionality and, at the same time, a majority for the Government then there should be agreement between both sides here to expand the membership of the committee so that those two principles would be maintained. I would think it inappropriate to accept the first amendment of the Opposition and at the same time to leave the total number of the committee unchanged.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the construction <Col N="1453" /> which is being placed on the function of the committee by the Opposition. The last two speakers stated that they regarded it as a watchdog committee analogous to the Committee of Public Accounts.  That is a false analogy which is being used to buttress the argument in favour of the first amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not see this committee as being in any way analogous with the Committee of Public Accounts.  This is a totally new innovation.  The Committee of Public Accounts fulfil an auditorial role.  They vet the discharge of moneys voted by this House to bodies directly responsible to this House.  On the other hand, semi-State companies have moneys which are not voted by this House, which in some cases they have raised on the commercial markets by borrowing or otherwise.  Therefore, the degree of accountability in a financial sense is not analogous.  They also usually have a legal character totally different from that of a Department of State.</P>
    <P>The role of this committee should be far wider than that being attributed to them by the Opposition.  They should be capable of evaluating all aspects of the performances of semi-State bodies, not just financial and not just operational but developmental as well&mdash;a mixture of both financial and political, using the small &ldquo;p&rdquo;.  In other words, this committee will have to look into the policy of these companies.  I agree with Deputy Colley in that respect and with the general thrust of the Fianna Fáil amendment in that regard, because although it could be argued that one could look at policy on foot of the wording of the motion&mdash;that it is there implicity&mdash;I should rather see it spelled out explicitly.  Therefore I agree with the insertion of the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; as has been suggested, but if one accepts the argument that policy is to be within the ambit of this committee, I do not think one can say they will be strictly analogous with the Committee of Public Accounts which, as I have said, perform an auditorial function.  Policy involves political choice and therefore <Col N="1454" /> I believe that for the proper functioning of the committee they should have a Government majority and the chairman should be drawn from the Government side.  I say that in the full knowledge that on some future occasion there will be another party in Government&mdash;I accept there will be a change of Government.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about policy we are talking about things like, in connection with the ESB, the sort of energy that should be utilised in future.  That is not the kind of area the Committee of Public Accounts investigate. Again in relation to the ESB, we are asking them to spell out their policy in relation to energy requirements during the next quarter or half century.  We are asking them for their evaluation of various technologies, energy production, costs, resources and so on, a totally different area altogether.  That is why I have said this committee will be a complete innovation.  We cannot therefore fall back as a precedent on something that has come out of the 19th century British parliamentary tradition. We should have such a regard for precedent here that we will now and then create precedent.  This is a precedent.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the question of policy should be at the heart of this committee. In the past, too much of the policy considerations of semi-State bodies have been carried on in secret, very often between the boards of those bodies and the Minister responsible or his departmental officials, and has never seen the light of day, has never been open to parliamentary scrutiny or public debate, and yet the decisions have vitally affected the economic and social life of the country.  I say this from practical experience of having been an official in a semi-State body engaged in such a process of consultation on issues of policy.</P>
    <P>I think it will be to the benefit of the companies, and Irish parliamentary life in general, if considerations of a policy nature are available for public scrutiny.  Policy lies in the area of future choice, of setting out what we see to be our objectives, the <Col N="1455" /> problems facing us, the alternatives open to us and the choice and the reasons for the choice.  That is the sort of thing that can be properly discussed between these bodies and this House, because very often some of these bodies, notwithstanding the fact that they are responsible to a Minister or a Department, lose sight of the social role that in many cases has been spelled out for them by this House and the other House in statutes.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to single out any particular body at the moment or to denigrate them, but 12 months ago, as most of us will recall, an example occurred in which we questioned whether a semi-State body were carrying out the social role assigned to them.  For that reason, this aspect of the functioning of these bodies should be at the very heart of this committee's operations.  It could be argued that the annual reports and statements of accounts are included in the first paragraph of the motion and that this will ensure policy will be discussed.  A strict interpretation of that paragraph is that there would be <i>post hoc</i> consideration, in other words, that which was included in the annual reports.</P>
    <P>I have &ldquo;ghosted&rdquo; annual reports of semi-State companies and I know the care very often taken to leave out information as much as to put it in. Therefore, if one goes on the strict interpretation of that paragraph, of course there would be many areas of policy which the committee could not examine even on a <i>post hoc</i> basis. Annual reports would not provide us with material for an examination of future policy, which would be very essential.</P>
    <P>Another area touched on by Deputy Colley refers to an amendment of his seeking to change paragraph (4) to the effect that discretion in respect of confidential information submitted to the committee by these bodies would be exercised by the committee, from the point of view of publication, rather than by the bodies themselves.  This is a very difficult area and I say this from experience of having been involved in <Col N="1456" /> a company engaged in the commercial field.  I can see the need for some mechanism for a company to ensure that confidential information which could be commercially valuable to competitors would not be disclosed unnecessarily or unwittingly.  I can see difficulties for any State company involved, for example, in a joint venture with a private company or another public company in having to say to their partner: &ldquo;There are certain aspects of our joint operation which we must make available to this committee and which could in turn be made public.  Because of the wording of the motion setting up the committee, we as a company have no discretion as to whether this information will be published.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For example, the company for which I worked, the Irish Sugar Company, are involved in a joint venture with a private company through Heinz-Erin.  Are we to say, therefore, that the activities of Erin Foods are to come within our scrutiny?  Are we to leave out of account, or apply different standards when we come to consider Heinz-Erin in which Erin Foods are involved and without which we could not possibly understand the operations of Erin Foods?</P>
    <P>This is a question of balance because I could also see that as the motion is worded it will ensure that the managements of the boards would be more likely to be forthcoming with information if they were assured that on their request information would be kept confidential.  If they believe that they simply have the right to make a request for confidentiality but that it would be at the discretion of the committee whether the information would be confidential, I think they would be more circumspect in offering information on the grounds that they are the best judges of their own case, particularly in the case of those companies which are engaged in commercial competition. One can think of a number of companies which are included in the Schedule and would fall into that category.  The Schedule should include a number of State companies which are not already included.  The suggestion that only commercial or trading <Col N="1457" /> companies should be incorporated in the motion is too narrow.  Bord Fáilte, Córas Tráchtála and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards are of as much value to the economic life of this country as some of the bodies included in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte is one of our biggest industries and I cannot see why it should be left out.  Coras Tráchtála fulfils a vital function in the economic life of this country as does the IIRS, and I cannot see why they should be left out either.  I cannot think of anything more fundamentally important to the industrial development policy of this country than a proper research and development programme, and the IIRS is at the very heart of that.  If, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach says, the Government have an open mind on the various aspects of the motion, they should give further consideration to the extent of the Schedule of companies.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the plea which has been made that this committee be properly serviced, that it will be given not just secretarial help which is very important, but that it will also be given specialised research facilities and assistance.  Specialised assistance will be required in relation to the accounts, and will be required from economists, technologists and engineers in dealing with companies such as Aer Lingus and many others.  I hope that this committee will not be hamstrung for lack of proper back-up services.  As other Deputies have said, the members of this committee will be taking on a most onerous task in terms of time and commitment.  Those who take it on deserve the best back-up services and this House should ensure that they get it.  I subscribe to the proposition that this is one of the most important committees ever established by this House and that it should be establised on the basis of maximum consensus between all sides.</P>
    <P>I welcome the assurance given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach that the Government have an open mind on this issue.  This debate so far has demonstrated that there is a desire on both sides to gain this consensus.  I hope the real nature and character of the committee will be <Col N="1458" /> thrashed out further because that is where the real difference between both sides is, and we should continue to exchange views on this aspect.  This Dáil has the potential to resolve these difficulties.  It will go down as the Dáil who set this committee working and chartered for Irish parliamentary politics a totally new direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In the approach to this important matter we have seen parliamentary procedure working at its best today.  Too often one sees it working at its worst.  There has been a determined consensus from all parties in the House in seeking an objective solution to the problem that this motion and the amendments today are designed to meet.  However, everything will depend on the result of the setting up of this committee and what it can achieve.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach is not here at the moment because I want to direct a few technical questions to him.  Where precisely will this committee stand in relation to legal and constitutional status, in relation to both Houses and to the bodies which will be the subject of its investigations? This is stated to be a Joint Committee and a Joint Committee by definition involves both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Rules of this House provide for the setting up of such committees.  Unfortunately, the three types of committee that this House has to consider do not seem to be specifically defined, namely, a select committee, a special committee, and a joint committee, although we all know pretty well what they mean. There are rules governing them and I presume the same type of rules are in the other House.  Our Standing Orders refer to standing joint committees and I presume it is intended to set this up as a standing joint committee, something that will continue. If there is any point in including the word &ldquo;standing&rdquo; from the technical point of view, I just mention it.  That is my first observation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter I should like to deal with, which has attracted some attention here today, is the comparison of this committee with other <Col N="1459" /> committees.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy Halligan when he says this is <i>sui generis</i>.  In agreeing with him&mdash;or, to put it another way, in his agreeing with us&mdash;that policy is a necessary ingredient here, its distinction from the Committee of Public Accounts is a valid one.  The Committee of Public Accounts actually does function, as Deputy Halligan has said, largely as an auditorial committee and, perhaps, a lot of its effectiveness results from the fact that policy is excluded and that, therefore, it is constrained to its auditorial function.  Thus far I will go with Deputy Halligan, and I am glad to do so.  But there is something more than this.</P>
    <P>Our argument in seeking the chairmanship for the Opposition goes rather on another basis.  While accepting fully the distinction Deputy Halligan makes, while fully accepting that this is <i>sui generis</i> that there is the distinction he made between the two committees, nevertheless, in the nature of this body, we will advocate here that the approach of principle should be the approach that led to the constitutional convention, if you like, that the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts should be a member of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>In that case the reason was, of course, that the Minister has responsibility for expenditure as well as the accounting officer, under the Ministers and Secretaries legislation, and that the Committee of Public Accounts was precisely what Deputy Halligan said, an auditorial committee. That argument can be applied in a general way to this committee because the Minister is the executive ultimately responsible for the State bodies.  The Minister and his Department have an intimate relation, or should have an intimate relation, with these bodies, whatever Minister is concerned. Furthermore, he has a responsibility for them, although at the present moment his answering for that responsibility to this House is extremely defective.</P>
    <P>If that is so, one cannot separate the Minister and his Department from the <Col N="1460" /> State bodies which are, so to speak, generated from and associated with them.  If this committee of the House is to be a body judicially to consider, advise and report on the operations of these public bodies from the point of view of parliamentary control, particularly of expenditure, then the same type of argument applies as applied in the case of the Committee of Public Accounts, notwithstanding the essential difference between the two committees.</P>
    <P>In my experience of the Committee of Public Accounts it has been an extremely integrated committee&mdash;policy can have two meanings here&mdash;where party political considerations are submerged in the common task.  Incidentally, in most committees of the House, such spirit prevails generally.  Having made that general argument in reply to Deputy Halligan, I should like to mention something which occurred earlier when the Parliamentary Secretary raised a question.  Paragraph 126 of Standing Orders, 1974, provides:</P>
    <P>The committee, which shall have power to send for persons, papers and records, shall consist of twelve members, none of whom shall be a member of the Government or a Parliamentary Secretary, and four of whom shall constitute a quorum. The committee shall be otherwise constituted according to the provisions of Standing Orders 66 and 69, and so as to be impartially representative of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>This is the essential thing which makes the Committee of Public Accounts different from the ordinary committee. Paragraph 66 which is mentioned in paragraph 126, part of which I have quoted, refers to the Dáil motion setting it up.  Paragraph 69 simply says it shall elect one of its members to be chairman.  The next paragraph dealing with special committees, the point raised by the Parliamentary Secretary, implies that a member of the Government or a Parliamentary Secretary can be a member of a select or a special committee.  In fact, they frequently are.  It may be a technical question at times as to whether or not they are members, but the Standing Order is <Col N="1461" /> open to the interpretation that they are.</P>
    <P>What makes the difference is the small addendum to paragraph 126 &ldquo;so as to be impartially representative of the Dáil&rdquo;.  While admitting Deputy Halligan's distinction, there is an argument for the convention that the chairman of this committee should be a member of the Opposition.  As in the case of the Committee of Public Accounts, members of the Government and Parliamentary Secretaries are excluded in the motion.  Any member of the Government side, because he is supporting the Government, is involved, so to speak, and in a sense he is in the position of judging his own case.  Therefore, the general argument developed on that line is in support of what we have urged from this side of the House that the chairman should be a member of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>It is most important that this committee should be set up with all the security and power of a full statutory committee of this House.  I would ask that this point should be looked at in the final draft of this motion.  There is always a complication when the two Houses are involved.  So much for what I might call the technicalities of the matter.</P>
    <P>This motion is overdue and is very necessary in its own right.  In order to appreciate it fully one must refer briefly to the overall problem in a modern democracy of Parliamentary control of administration as against the Parliamentary function of legislation. The Parliamentary control of administration, particularly of finance, presents more and more problems as the complexities of State organisations develop.  It is very noticeable that Parliament, because possibly of antiquated procedures and not keeping up with the times, has been losing and in many cases has lost its control, first to the Government and then to the administration.  I do not want to expand on that field, but I would like to refer to the situation as it was when we adjourned for the summer recess.  To avoid taking up the time of the House may I say that I am speaking in the context of my contribution to the Adjournment Debate at <Col N="1462" /> columns 2220 to 2231, Volume 291, of the Official Report of 30th June, 1976?</P>
    <P>A very unsatisfactory situation has developed in that this Parliament has for a considerable time now been impotent in regard to current control of the semi-State bodies.  I hope to justify that in a moment by specific reference. The situation has developed because, the legislation having been passed and powers given to the Minister, the Members of the Dáil have been unable to get information on behalf of those who supply the money, the taxpayers, by the ordinary method of Parliamentary question.  By a technicality a question will be ruled out of order because it will be alleged the Minister has no function.  One is told, on the one hand, that the Minister has no function and one is not allowed to discuss or question the matter, while, on the other hand, the Minister and his Department are actively concerned in handing out taxpayers' money and giving directions to these bodies for which he disclaims responsibility.  When I say &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; I am speaking in general terms.  It has no relationship to any particular Government.</P>
    <P>One might say the Committee of Public Accounts could deal with this, but precisely the same problem has arisen there.  The Committee of Public Accounts has been unable to inquire into the affairs of any of these bodies.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has been unable to get the full information and, as the committee itself has pointed out in at least one report, the committee is becoming stultified.  Indeed, it was through the reports of that committee that continued pressure has been applied for a motion like this, supported by the feeling of frustration which Deputies and the general public have felt at not being able to find out what was happening and seeing large sums of money which was collected from the taxpayer being applied here and there without having a very clear picture as to how it was being spent.  Again, as in the case of Ministers, I am not referring to any particular semi-State body.  I would like to make it clear that I agree with those people who <Col N="1463" /> have nothing but admiration for the standard maintained and the effort made by the responsible personnel in these bodies.  Here we are dealing with a matter of principle, a matter of Parliamentary control.  As things have worked out, it can be said that if anybody were looking for a device to prevent inquiry from Parliament, no better instrument could be found than has evolved from the concept of the administration of the State-sponsored bodies.  Presumably it was to deal with the problem that this motion was proposed.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of this matter to which I should like to refer and which is the cause of some concern. The Minister says in his speech and in the terms of the motion that it will be confined to dealing with State-sponsored bodies engaged in commercial or trading activity.  As the Minister said, that is difficult enough to define and it is not possible to give a precise definition of &ldquo;State-sponsored bodies&rdquo;.  He goes on to give an indefinite definition, depending on the idea that any particular State body will be put into one category or the other, into the non-trading or non-commercial category or into the trading or commercial category, depending on whether the greater part of their current revenue is from sales of goods or services.</P>
    <P>This is vague.  It is very hard to see from the list what category is in question. One fundamental point is that all categories require the voting of public funds, whether as grants-in-aid or otherwise.  If there is to be no taxation without representation&mdash;and this House is the representation of the taxpayer&mdash;then why should the so-called non-trading bodies be left in the present position?  Why are they not to be accountable?  I would be prepared to go a long way with the Minister&mdash;and I believe the Department of Finance have promised that the case of the non-trading bodies will be looked at if he is prepared to account for them in this House and I would be happy to go along with the rest of the motion. If we are to have a position where some State bodies, depending on what <Col N="1464" /> in the last analysis must be arbitrary classification, are to be subject to this investigation and to what I hope will be control, in the best sense of the word, of this committee and another set of bodies will be exempt and will carry on as heretofore&mdash;both sets have in common the receipt and expenditure of public money, even the disposal of public money: those who get grants-in-aid have the power to give grants which is something wider than the expenditure of public money&mdash;I would be prepared to settle for this if the Minister were to accept parliamentary responsibility.</P>
    <P>Failing this, I see dangers.  Unless there is an equal provision for parliamentary control and the informing of Parliament as the sovereign authority under the Constitution in regard to the activities, particularly the financial activities, of these other State-sponsored bodies then even this motion will be hamstrung from the beginning.  For example, take the incipient debate we had earlier on Gaeltarra Éireann.  Is it or is it not?  I think Deputy Halligan mentioned Bord Fáilte.  Again, a question arose about Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Whatever Government are in power or whatever Oireachtas is in being at the time, if there is this ill-defined borderline, with the present unsatisfactory situation on one side while on the other side there is control, then it will be too easy to transfer from one category to the other.  I see a grey area which leaves it open for a Minister or a Government to effect transfers of this nature by bringing into this House a motion on the very indefinite criterion that the greater part of their current revenues are from the sale of goods or services.  That seems to be a defect.</P>
    <P>If we pass this motion&mdash;and I am more than happy to see a co-operative and understanding way of working this&mdash;without clearing this area, we are leaving the seed of the weed of future trouble in the ground we are preparing.  One cannot get away from the necessity for controlling both types.  One way of doing it would be to expand the powers of the Joint Committee.  The obvious thing to do in the case of the administrative <Col N="1465" /> companies is to let the Minister take responsibility and be answerable for them in the ordinary way.  Some supplementation of the existing motion will be necessary to make this new committee effective.</P>
    <P>With regard to the working of the committee, it is important to approach it as we have approached it today. Everybody has spoken objectively about it today.  There is an anxiety on the part of the three main parties in the House to make this work and to seek a consensus, which is the basis of the successful working of these committees.  Something more is needed in the actual working of this committee.  This committee will only be effective if there is a high degree of co-operation between the Government and the administration on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the bodies concerned and the committee.</P>
    <P>The committee must in no sense set itself up as an inquisition.  Its task must be constructive.  We must recognise that, in the broader field of parliamentary control generally, time moves on and that the complexity of modern times requires adjustments.  It cannot be approached on either doctrinaire or preconceived ideas as to procedures.  There must be a willingness on the part of the committee to face realities and to find realistic solutions to problems that may arise. That presupposes that it must completely understand not only the executive point of view of the Government and the administrative problems of the civil service, the Government Departments, but it must also be sympathetic and understand the very real problems with which these State-sponsored bodies are faced.</P>
    <P>Since the Committee of Public Accounts has been mentioned so often perhaps it is no harm to say that the secret of its success lies in the fact that there is such tripartite co-operation&mdash;the Comptroller and Auditor General on the one hand, the Department of Finance and the accounting officers on the other hand &mdash;particularly the Department of Finance and now the Department of the Public Service.  The accounting officers of both of those Departments <Col N="1466" /> occupy a unique position among accounting officers in that they are supervisors as well as accounting officers in their own right.  Then there are the accounting officers themselves. There has to be co-operation between those three distinct elements.  Let me repeat: the committee itself, the Comptroller and Auditor General and then the accounting officers with specific reference to the secretaries of the Department of Finance and the Department of the Public Service.</P>
    <P>If that mutual trust, co-operation and willingness to be reasonable while holding one's views, were not there in the case of the Committee of Public Accounts, it could not have done its job at all.  Anyone who pursues its reports will see that essentially that co-operation is there.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is necessary to the committee for it to function at all; on the other hand the Comptroller and Auditor General, needs the support of the Committee, its members being the direct representatives of this House.  In the same way the Department of Finance have a supervisory responsibility as have the Department of the Public Service.  They have a common interest with the Comptroller and Auditor General and the committee. While the accounting officers themselves have their own problems and are only too glad to have the assistance that can be given by the Comptroller and Auditor General, nobody likes to find something that may be commented on.  In their hearts everybody is glad when the proper spirit exists.</P>
    <P>In the same way this committee will not be anything more than a grouse shop unless it can start and can maintain this association with the Government and the Administration&mdash;and when I say Administration, I mean the Government Departments, the civil service, if you like, on the one hand, and the State-sponsored bodies on the other where there is mutual trust, co-operation, understanding and willingness to see the other side's problem and to achieve workable solutions.</P>
    <P>Overall that is by far the best way of getting parliamentary control over both policy and expenditure.  I emphasise <Col N="1467" /> that because, unfortunately, this problem has been allowed to drift far too long, for various reasons, over very many years.  The concept of the State-sponsored body developed too fast and out of proportion to the original concept.  As a result of that there has been a good deal of frustration both inside and outside this House.  There might be temptations to witch-hunting.  Any such temptation must be firmly put aside.  Only on the basis of the type of mutual co-operation I mentioned in the case of another committee can this committee work.  It augurs well for the future that we are approaching it in this way.</P>
    <P>Obviously I shall not have time to finish before we go on to other business.  I do agree with Deputy Halligan about policy but the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; has two meanings.  What one might call administrative or commercial policy is one thing; what one might call social policy is another. Deputy Halligan mentioned the social role.  I would say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but there are also economic and financial roles to be balanced with that.  If one is to maintain balances&mdash;social, economic and financial&mdash;then policy has to enter in. Policy, in that sense, should exist and therefore I urge on the Government that they consider our amendment No.2.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I was speaking about the lack of job opportunities for young people.  I am glad the Minister is here this evening as we are most anxious to hear from him on a number of points raised in last evening's debate.  We were referring <Col N="1468" /> to areas such as AnCO and the public and private sectors.  We informed the House that 50 per cent of our population are between the ages of 18 and 25.  One can see the enormous problem of providing job opportunities for those young people.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce last night spoke about creating the conditions for growth but he did not inform the House what efforts the Government have made during the last three-and-a-half years to create this growth or what their future policies are to create job opportunities for our young people. Our young people have a right to know what has been done by the Government to safeguard their future as far as employment is concerned.  I hope the Minister for Labour, in contributing to this debate, will give some indication of the Government's policy to create a satisfactory growth of employment for our young people. It is important that the Minister would identify the areas where the immediate prospects of employment are and, having done that, that he would then recommend to the Government the introduction of emergency measures for the employment of the thousands of our jobless young people</P>
      <P>We spoke about emergency powers and things of that kind some time ago. I believe everybody will agree that the greatest emergency in the country at the moment is the lack of job opportunities for thousands of our young people.  New initiatives must be introduced for our industrialists to overcome the lack of confidence which is very evident in Irish industry today. This can only be done by the Government setting definite targets for the establishment of new industries and the expansion of existing ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's lack of proper planning in industrial areas is to be deplored.  Continuous warnings were given to them from the Fianna Fáil benches, together with many other economic experts.  The Government were warned time and time again that industry was running down and was in urgent need of capital.  However, they ignored all those warnings and <Col N="1469" /> advice.  Consequently, we now find ourselves in a job crisis.  All avenues must be explored to find a solution for this appaling wastage of the talents of our young people.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's responsibility to provide employment.  There is no running away from this and there are no excuses because the facts are there. It is pitiful to see thousands of young people year in and year out making sacrifices to provide themselves with a better education and then finding at the end it was all in vain.  Last night I mentioned the frustrations of our young people and their parents who made great sacrifices to ensure that their children would get proper education.</P>
    <P>I have close association with young people and I know that they do not want the dole or handouts.  They want work and they want to be part of a great effort to build up our economy. This is the spirit of our young people. Leaders of young people plead with the Government on every platform and in every newspaper to bring in some emergency powers to provide immediate employment rather than see our young people become involved in some anti-social activities.</P>
    <P>We must consider the blow dealt to our young people.  Only last year in areas where they were getting employment, especially holiday employment, a directive was sent to health boards and local authorities to stop recruiting further personnel.  This directive was also sent to the civil service.  Those are most important areas for our young people.  Last night I referred to the building industry.  As the Minister knows, being a member of the Labour Party, large numbers of apprentices are usually employed in the building trade.  Parents are now asking what is happening and what is the future of our young people.  They also ask what are the Government doing about it.</P>
    <P>Two years ago the leader of this party made a very special appeal to the Government and the Minister for Labour to introduce a community project. This was very effectively operated in the western parts of the country but I am afraid it has not gone beyond <Col N="1470" /> that stage.  There are other areas in which this could be introduced, which would give young people worth-while work in helping the needs of their own community.  This cannot be a permanent thing but it would help them over the present crisis or until the time that there is a Government who are prepared to devote their energies in providing employment for our young people.  I hope from this House tonight that some encouragement will be sent out by the Minister for Labour and that now, late though it may be, he has some plans to introduce a crash programme to put our young people into employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the severe unemployment crisis affecting this country one could make a justified case on the facts for looking at any one category in the numbers who are unemployed and asking for special attention to cater for the needs of that particular category because unemployment in most democracies is regarded as a menace to social cohesion, a problem admittedly encountered by all economies at present. I believe unemployment is regarded in most democracies as something that corrodes the basis of the self-repect the individual can have for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of the democracies in Europe at present are facing very high levels of unemployment.  In the categories of those unemployed one can say that a good deal of attention has been devoted in all of the democracies to the problem of young people out of work, and to the spectacle in Britain, Germany and France of young people who have had no jobs since they left their educational establishments.  It is a question we have discussed in the EEC Council of Social Affairs at our various meetings and it is a question that in the period that Ireland had the Presidency of the Council of Social Affairs an initiative of ours was succesful in bringing forward a proposal to deal with unemployment among the young people, a proposal embodied in our own country at present in the Community Youth Training Programme. But in talking of categories, and one could make a case in the general unacceptably high unemployment <Col N="1471" /> level of catering in particular for the circumstances of the man or woman who in his or her forties is out of work and say: &ldquo;Here is a particular case, here is something that should call for immediate action&rdquo;, and so on.  One could look at other categories amongst the unemployed and call for a special response to each category of persons out of work.</P>

      <P>I was making the point that the Government did make the proposal to unions and employers of £100 million comprising £50 million in tax reductions and £50 million in job creation for the next year.  That is the direction of Government policy.  The success of that direction and its acceptance for that kind of proposal is the realistic way out of the unemployment dilemma affecting the economy at present.  It does not consist in flash programmes such as we have seen from certain members of the Opposition in their September programme where they talk about £100 million to be invested in job creation, although on reading the programme one sees that £50 million of it is to be devoted to increased jobs in the public sector.  It is not to that kind of flash programme, leading to further increased deficits in budget formation, increased borrowing abroad and therefore increased liability for productive effort at home, that we can look for any future hope for young people and middle-aged people who are presently unemployed.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that Members of this House, seriously or otherwise, should suggest that it is possible to do something about job creation by calling for additional expenditure and heavier deficits on ridiculous cost estimates.  It is not helpful at all to serious discussion of this problem that one should hold out the hope that it is possible that jobs can be created and unemployment can be licked by programmes that have the insubstantial base of spending as proposed from the Opposition benches.  That is not helpful, and I suggest that youth leaders cannot be taken in by that kind of programme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must not, as I say, confuse type-written sheets written in the haste of Opposition based on the proposition of attracting, presumably, some support for the party putting out such a programme. I believe that a serious approach to the question of unemployment means that we must drive home the lesson to our people that unemployment can be licked and the problem brought down to manageable proportions only by getting people to accept that in their demands on expenditure, in their demands on Government, they must demand less and the Government must be in a position to earmark more resources for productive investment.  That is the only way out of this dilemma, that we must ensure that our manufacturing industry will be in a position to give a greater number of jobs to people seeking them.</P>
      <P>We have not been able up to now to satisfy the requirements of those looking for jobs.  We admit frankly that this Administration has not been able to do it and our inability to do it has been made even more difficult by the present recession.  However, Deputies opposite on looking at the record will appreciate that they were unable to do it through the sixties and early seventies; that the unemployment rate taken in conjunction with the emigration rate meant that they failed dismally in the matter of providing sufficient jobs for those seeking them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accepting these realities in the job situation in Ireland is the first step towards a realistic policy.  There is no point in pretending that the problem has not existed in the past.  There is no point in the Opposition saying&mdash;because it does not serve them in the long run&mdash;that the problem has arisen only since 1973.  The problem goes much further back into Irish economic history than the date of the arrival of this Government in 1973.  It <Col N="1474" /> was with us from 1958 to 1973, and in most cases the people opposite depended on emigration to settle the problem.  No longer can we have the easy option afforded by emigration which option was availed of to reduce unemployment figures. One could say that we are not excessively intolerant but no other European country would have tolerated the unemployment figures that the people opposite lived with year after comfortable year when in Government. They saw 300,000 emigrants leaving this country between the late fifties and early seventies.  This motion is concerned about young people out of work.  Presumably many thousands of those young people were numbered amongst the 300,000 who left our ports to search for work which the Fianna Fáil Government in all those years were unable to provide; and those were years unmarked by problems such as we faced as a result of this recession.</P>

      <P>Most people, apart from some people opposite, do recognise that we have been through a recession comparable in its severity to the 1931 great depression.  That is accepted in most countries.  It is not accepted by the Opposition and their policies all have the imprint of the non-acceptance of this fact of economic life.  I suggest to the Opposition that there is little advantage for them in pretending that the problems brought about by the recession have not existed.  It will not cut ice with the electorate if they say they do not accept that there has been a recession and that there are not problems caused as a result.  The electorate can see and hear about those problems every night on television.  They can see programmes that deal with the problems of other countries and they accept that there is an employment problem in most other countries. They know we have been through a recession.  Even in the strongest economies such as those of Germany, France and the United States, many <Col N="1475" /> people are worried about the unyielding nature of unemployment, that although output and exports may be improving the level of growth recorded is not, as yet, making any dent in the unemployment figures in these countries.  This is a worrying problem and one that Governments and Oppositions in other countries have noted in their economies.</P>
      <P>For a correct analysis of the situation it is necessary to point out that we have always had the worst unemployment in Europe throughout the period when the Opposition were in power.  We have always had the worst record in young people being out of work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We had the worst emigration rate.  All of these are facts and I am merely reading them into the record of the House.  Acceptance of these facts will permit Deputies to face the problem squarely, understanding that past remedies have not been successful in producing results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point of the recent Green Paper is that we would need a growth rate of 6 per cent repeated annually to make any impact on unemployment in the years ahead.  This is a figure that has never been achieved on an annual repeating basis. Throughout the sixties when we did not have problems associated with the recession we were happy to achieve in any year a 4½ per cent increase.  It shows the dimensions of the problem that we would require a figure nearer to 6 per cent repeated annually into the future if we are to bring unemployment down to manageable proportions and that would still be very far from anything approaching full employment. I suggest this indicates the difficulties and problems inherent in <Col N="1476" /> bringing about a realistic employment policy.</P>
    <P>Recently there has been some encouraging news regarding the economy. We have seen an improvement in exports and in output this year we will reach if not 4 per cent certainly 3½ per cent.  We can say that the economy is returning to a healthy condition but even in noting these facts one must admit that these figures give little consolation to anyone concerned about our present high rate of unemployment.  As I have pointed out, it would require 6 per cent repeated annually to make a dent in unemployment and we are nowhere near the possibility of achieving this.</P>
    <P>However, there is an encouraging sign over last year.  There is a reduction in the numbers out of work from September to October allowing for the seasonal position that normally at this time of the year, even in the best years, one would see a disimprovement in the employment situation. One can point to that encouraging feature this year.  What is necessary is that we will be in the correct position for progress towards the goal of providing sufficient employment.  We need action from the Government and we need complementary action from the unions and employers.  Those three agencies are important, working together in partnership, if we are to improve the employment situation which has proved incorrigible of correction in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If manufacturing industry is to be competitive the proposals the Government have put forward should assist them in this area. We must channel all available resources away from non-employment areas to the greatest extent possible and put them into productive job creation.  We must work towards these objectives.  The work of the IDA this year will assist to some extent the people under 25 years in getting jobs because we reckon that more than half of the jobs provided in the new grant-aided industries go to people under 25 years.  However, it will require agreement to the proposals we put forward to see the economy begin to answer up to the challenge of providing sufficient jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central objective we have is getting the agreement of the people and of the social partners so that the Government can devote all the necessary resources to the problem.  The Government believe that so serious is the situation with regard to employment that now is the time for them to invest this £100 million package to take the pressure off the pursuit of income increases that prove nominal when taken in conjunction with <Col N="1478" /> price rises.  Instead, there should be emphasis on tax reductions which means a greater take-home increase to the individual concerned.  We reckon that the tax reduction envisaged in the £50 million proposed by us would be something like a 3 per cent increase in the take-home pay each week without adverse effects on the cost of living.  Here we are talking about a Government influencing the course of events.</P>
    <P>Here we are talking about a Government who recognise the scale of the problem and seek, with the agreement of all concerned, to get them to come with the Government into a joint plan which would see our resources increasingly devoted to employment creation in the years ahead. The answer on the other side is an everlasting vista of increased deficit budgeting based on foreign borrowing. It is a cruel illusion for the Opposition to suggest to young people out of work that it is possible, on so specious a programme as they put forward, that sustained productive employment can result.  £50 million of their so-called job creation programme goes into the public service; £20 million into youth employment schemes.</P>
    <P>I am deeply disappointed that the Opposition, who have had many years of experience in Government, unsuccessful experience when it came to providing employment, should try for low political gain, because it cannot be described as anything else, to suggest to young people that it is possible the problem of employment creation can be materially altered by the kind of programme, financed as it is, which they have put forward.</P>
    <P>We have always had the problem that we have more of our young people in the 14-19 and 20-24 groups in our labour force than any other EEC country.  I have already referred to the fact that the true level of our unemployment throughout the sixties was masked by the disappearance of these people on the emigration boats to Britain.  Its full extent was masked near the end of the sixties with the extension of free education.</P>

      <P>The main need of the economy is that conditions should be brought about in which it can expand.  Those conditions have not been with us for the past few years because of the problems in most of our export markets which were the result of the recession, but there are signs of improvement in that respect. During that period, when so many of our people were out of work, we did not neglect their training.  A very important aspect of any economic industrial revival must be the assurance that the people who will be going into that industry are sufficiently well trained.  A good deal of this new industry calls for a higher level of skill than was the case in the past.  I hope Deputies will note the difference between the 1,350 people trained by the national training authority in 1973 when we took office and the number we hope to have trained this year, nearly 11,000.</P>

If we can get general acceptance for the proposition that the Government can devote resources to employment creation next year, can go ahead with our tax concession programme, avail of the £100 million package which the Government offered to the social partners, together with the improvements we have noted already in the economy&mdash;improvements which certain propagandists might not notice, but we must distinguish between propagandists and journalists &mdash;we can say that next year could mark the first year, which, since coming out of this recession our economy would begin to offer a chance to young and old to work in their own country.  It is to that I would ask Deputies to direct their attention at this point of time and not to badly costed programmes.  I would ask them to direct their attention to the facts of our situation recognising we had a problem in this area in the past and that there is a problem also at present.</P>

      <P>At one stage in the history of Europe there was a positive plague of optimism.  It was rife all over the Continent of Europe.  Luckily there was a satirist called Voltaire to satirise it.

      <P>By the Minister for Finance last week, by the Minister for Labour tonight and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday. There is a positive plague of optimism around.  Let me deal first of all with a few of the points one can extract from the speech of the Minister for Labour here tonight.  He started by saying he was concerned about categories of workers other than youths because the Fianna Fáil motion mentioned youth employment. Later he contradicted himself by pointing out that we had a very large number of the work force under 25. In fact the figure is 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He arrogated to himself the idea that tax incentives could be used in the present economic situation to improve our economic position.  He knows perfectly well that this particular proposition had already been mooted by Fianna Fáil.  He referred to flash programmes Fianna Fáil were putting forward to deal with the situation. I shall come back to that later, but better flash programmes than no programmes at all.  He talked about the people's agreement.  The people's agreement and the trade unions' <Col N="1484" /> agreement will not be achieved by the kind of holy Mary approach to them that this Government have been making for some time now.  He talked about the training schemes.  That was effectively answered by Deputy Fitzgerald in an interruption.  The schemes were initiated by the Government by courtesy of the Social Fund. The Minister knows that and the Minister cannot claim credit for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a temporary thing and would not solve anything on a permanent basis.  Just to give an example now of this optimism which is around, yesterday the Minister for Industry and Commerce said the percentage increases in unemployment did not show a situation that was frightful.  He went on to juggle with percentages.  He forgot to tell us that where you have a small number to start off with the percentage looks big.  If you have five people unemployed one year and six the following year you have a 100 per cent increase in unemployment.  He juggled around with figures and he started off with a higher percentage and so the figure would naturally look more.  He talked about a certain sense of pride that the Irish economy had come through such a desperate time so well.  This is more of the optimism.  He talked about the dangers of undue pessimism and of labour unrest.  Mark you, one of the points in the 14-point programme, if anybody remembers it, was that with Labour participation in Government industrial relations would be peaceful, calm and progressive.  He talked about increased public expenditure having the inevitable consequence of increased taxation.  In fact the Government are taking 55 per cent of GNP at the moment, 35 per cent financed from direct and indirect taxation and 20 per cent financed by borrowing.  There is no place else one can go.  He said also inflation would be due, if it were allowed to develop any worse than it is this year, and it is 18 per cent, to wage spirals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me quote a few items from <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of 2nd November and we will <Col N="1485" /> see the reason for inflation.  Against £130 million taken by the Government for excise duty in the corresponding period last year £388 million were taken this year.  Instead of income tax of £273 million last year the figure is almost £1,000 million this year.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce should have addressed himself to these figures.  What about VAT?  We were supposed to be careful about inflation.  Last year £143 million and this year £205½ million in the same period.  What price pressure on prices.  What price inflation. We must be realistic.  I find no realism in the case being made on the government benches.  There is a rush of simulated optimism.</P>
    <P>One of the real gems from the Minister for Industry and Commerce was the statement that the economy is coming out of the slump.  I have here a piece of information which tells me that on 29th October, 1976, there were 108,772 people unemployed and that does not take into account the unfortunate people we are talking about here tonight and that we were talking about here last night.  I cannot see how anybody can come in here and be optimistic about young people who are out of jobs at the moment.  Let these optimistic Ministers, the pupils of Dr. Pangloss, come down to Cavan with me and tell Pauline in Arva, who has a good leaving certificate and a high speed in shorthand and typing, a full commercial course, and a factory closed at her back door, that we are not doing too badly and we must not be unduly pessimistic.  Let the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour go down and talk to Seán in Belturbet who has the same kind of qualifications and has been looking for a job month after month.  If these three Ministers would visit our youth conferences, which are attended by increasing numbers in the hope that Fianna Fáil will pull us out of the miserable situation they are in, not all the Fianna Fáil adults at those conferences could keep them from being lynched.</P>
    <P>This city at present has thousands of young people who cannot get jobs. <Col N="1486" /> The situation is grave; it is dangerous but all we can get is a pseudo optimism from the Ministers of the Government most directly responsible for providing employment for young and old here.  Doctor Pangloss, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Industry and Commerce may be as optimistic as they like, <i>argumenti causa</i>, but they will not fool young people who are waiting around looking for jobs.</P>
    <P>One strange thing I found in the contribution of the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday, and echoes of it in the contribution of the Minister for Labour tonight, is that they seemed to have grasped the situation, they seemed to have the proper analysis of the situation.  The proper analysis of the situation seems to be that which was made comparatively recently in issue No. 26 of the report of the National Economic and Social Council.  It is that there is a grave onus on those who run the economy to increase output in manufacturing industry and in agriculture.  It must follow as night the day that apart from the increase in employment in those two sectors there will be&mdash;a study has proved that this has been the case throughout the expanse of the OECD countries&mdash;an increase in employment in commerce.  It will involve employment in wholesale and retail shops, in restaurants, hotels, in banking and in insurance.  It will also mean an increase in employment in the public utilities, in the development of electricity, gas and the provision of water for the community. As well as that, though not as directly correlated, it will mean an improvement in employment in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>At present we have a developing mining industry and we got a promise which has been shamefully evaded that a smelter would be established to give employment right along the line.  If this analysis is right&mdash;in the debate on the economy I said it was and the Minister for Industry and Commerce said it was correct last night&mdash;I should like to know what is being done about it; what kind of economic leadership is being given; <Col N="1487" /> what is being done to put the effects of this analysis into action.  Nothing is being done and, consequently, the list of unemployed grows larger and our young people sink deeper into despair.  The corollary of this assessment, and there seems no possibility of challenging this assessment, is that we must look at the market sector of our economy, mainly private industry. Believe it or not, we have the word of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, once the <i>eminence grise</i> of the non-private sector, that a satisfactory growth of employment depends on private enterprise.  That is the conclusion of the economists who put together the 26th report of the NESC but they went a little further to say that the unsheltered section, the exposed section of our market, is the important one to look at.</P>
    <P>That section is unsheltered and exposed at home due to the pulling down of all the barriers; it is also exposed and unsheltered on the export market.  Therefore, the wages and salaries paid in the exposed sector of the economy are the ones which should determine wages and salaries across the line, in the public and sheltered sector.  If that is not the case, competition will kill.  In the course of his speech the Minister for Labour said that it was from manufacturing industry we would have to get our increase in employment, and I agree with him but with all the expertise at the Government's disposal, and with the influence we are led to believe the Labour Party have in trade union circles, are we seeing any real leadership on the part of the Government to make a comprehensive list of the firms in that sector.  Is anything being done to get the unions together to consider the situation and to settle as a headline for the rest of the economy the wages in that sector, wages which will allow the manufacturers to compete in tough markets at home and abroad?  We have all learned, having listened to Question Time, that the toughness is as bad here as it is abroad.</P>
    <P>However, we are getting no leadership; we are getting a shying away <Col N="1488" /> from that position.  That is the crunch of the present situation involving employment for the young and for the economy in general.  The trade unions have always deserved well of this country in times of crisis and there can be no mistake about it but that this is a time of crisis.  This is a time when industries can die.  Industries have died and other industries are in a shaky position but yet we have waffling, no leadership and no sense of direction.  There is a grave responsibility on the Government if we have, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce last night euphemistically called, deindustrialisation.  Deindustrialisation means the closing down of factories, the loss of jobs and the impoverishment of the country.</P>
    <P>We have a young and educated labour force which is younger, percentage wise, than any in Europe.  It is better educated than ever before. Even without the extension of formal education our workers have always been considered as highly adaptable and very quick to pick up the technique and expertise for their jobs. We are assured there is capital at home and abroad that can be brought into play to produce jobs for the people now leaving our schools and colleges.  A strict correlation between an increase in manufacturing industry output, agricultural output and that in commerce, the public utilities and so on would solve our problems if we pick our objective and go for it and bring the trade unions with us, as I believe we can, if an honest effort is made in this regard.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear facile.  It is not easy.  A Government are not elected to do easy things, but if there is a serious problem, no unit in the country is better equipped than the Cabinet, no unit has the same facilities to discover the situation and to be able to deal with it.</P>
    <P>There will not be a great increase in the numbers leaving employment in the agricultural sector.  We can hope for a slow down in those numbers, but there is a vast field in agri-industry ready to be tilled.  Our spokesmen on this side, and several others, <Col N="1489" /> time and again have pointed out that this is a rich mine of jobs that we should try to exploit.  Therefore, it is not helpful for the Minister for Labour to come here and talk about Flash Harry schemes.  I think he spoke about flash programmes coming from this side of the House.  We have waited long enough for some kind of programme from the Government but they cannot get basic agreement between themselves.  They cannot talk about working comprehensively or making a deal with the unions or with anybody else.  Anybody who thinks they can should have his head examined.</P>
    <P>In March, the Taoiseach went to the US to represent our country, a good thing.  Before he went he fired a salvo indicating there would be a pay pause.  I think St. Patrick's Day was on a Wednesday.  On the Friday the Minister for Labour put in his little spake.  He said there would be no pay pause.  How can one expect a united approach towards the trade unions or anybody else who has an important say in industrial development from an outfit like that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a bit worried. Last night I was challenged by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I got on to the Central Statistics Office to see what they had to say about emigration in the latter years of Fianna Fáil administration.  The CSO have plenty of time on their hands now and they are anxious to get work to do.  Of course what they should be doing is processing the census which the Government refused to hold and which would have given a few jobs to young people.</P>
      <P>However, in the year up to April, 1972, emigration was nil.  In the year up to April, 1973, the net immigration, not emigration, was 2,000.  I was challenged when I made that statement last night and I want to put it on record now that I was speaking the truth, that I was giving facts.  We have talk about all sorts of programmes. I told the House earlier that the Government were taking roughly £338 million in excise this year as against £130 million last year; £370 million in income tax as against £270 million; £205 million in VAT as against £143 million.  All we are asking is that £20 million of that vast sum would be dedicated to providing jobs for young people.  A sum of £20 million would not drive the ship astray.  I do not think it would take £20 million to provide the smelter we have been talking about and have been promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other job possibilities around the country.  An article in the current issue of <i>Management</i> shows the way to provide new jobs.  We could double the employment premiums for young people and this would encourage employers to recruit them in the factories which still remain open.  The argument does not hold that this would increase Government expenditure. It could not do much if it were used in productive employment, and that is what we have been advocating all the time.  The French give bonuses to people who employ young people straight from school.  A programme of earlier retirement would help. There could be a transition year before <Col N="1491" /> young people go to universities.  Most of the European countries have schemes of public works&mdash;I am not talking about the public works that left such a bad memory from the Famine days.</P>
    <P>Surely there is some imagination left in someone connected with the Government.  Young people could be used on archaeological sites, on ecological work and environmental work. Every job provided is an improvement on the present situation.  Vocational education could be stepped up and we have the EEC Social Fund behind that.  We do not want our young people's certificates, diplomas and degrees to be devalued by lack of job opportunities when they come out of schools and colleges.  A wait and see policy is dangerous as far as they are concerned.  There were several European schemes that I wanted to ask the Minister about to know if he has anything to report from them.  I can write to him and find out.  A meeting of the Council of Ministers for Education was held on 9th February, 1976, and there was a resolution about school to work problems which I would like to know about.  Last week I mentioned that Marconi could take double the number of radio officers that we are training in this country at the moment. Why can we not have a special programme to train them?  We want training for jobs that are there to be filled and I have pointed out the way to have those jobs provided.  No matter where you look on the Continent of Europe something is being done, but nothing is being done here. There is nothing but disillusion, lack of confidence and hopelessness among our young people, and the Government have the responsibility.  Young people at the moment feel like a character in Pasternak's <i>Zhivago</i>&mdash;a name on a list that was lost.</P>

      <P>Listening to the previous speaker one could hardly imagine why all the things complained of and all the infrastructures that are now missing were not planned for during the lengthy periods of Fianna Fáil administration.  I do not accept <Col N="1492" /> that the picture is as bad as it has been painted during this debate more especially when Deputy Wilson speaks about the situation in Europe and compares it with the projections that are going on there.  I feel that the Government have introduced many initiatives and I would like to compliment them on them and encourage them to expand them.  AnCO has made great progress in the training and retraining of young people.  This has been a reasonably successful scheme and the money made available from the Social Fund has played an important role and will continue to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the brief time at my disposal I will refer to the lecture given last night by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It was very similar to the lecture given last year by the same Minister.  In the course of it the Minister said that he was sometimes accused of distorting statistics for his own benefit but that no one could ever prove that he distorted them.  I will go briefly through the two sets of statistics the Minister gave us last night.  The Minister told us that we were very well off indeed in this country so far as unemployment was concerned because in the two years, between the first quarter of 1974 and the first quarter of 1976, Belgian unemployment increased by 126 per cent, Danish unemployment increased by 286 per cent, French by 112 per cent, German by 115 per cent, United Kingdom by 104 per cent, Ireland by 63 per cent and Italy by 14 per cent.  The Minister left out the only other member in the European Economic Community, which is Luxembourg, where the rate of unemployment increased by 1,000 per cent.  That is not to say that Luxembourg is now devastated or poverty ridden.  The number of people unemployed in Luxembourg in 1974 was 100 and in 1976 it had increased to 1,000, that is 1,000 per cent, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that he does not distort statistics and that because Ireland is lower than increases such as that from an abnormally low base, we are well off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> How could anybody accept again in the future statistics that are so blandly quoted by the Minister?  The other statistic the Minister referred to was our position in the chart of rate of growth of output in the OECD. The Minister quoted three years&mdash;we were third in 1973, fourth in the table in 1974 and fifth in 1975, out of the 20 odd OECD nations.  The Minister neglected to tell us, when he alleged that our rate of growth was abnormally high, that we were starting from what was propably the lowest base of all and therefore any kind of an increase when expressed in percentage terms as compared with the percentage of other countries which had a much higher output <i>per capita</i> would appear abnormally high.  The Minister did not tell us how we stand in these tables by direct comparison with other countries and not by percentage growth on an abnormally low base. The Minister for Industry and Commerce in his speech last night reported in today's <i>Irish Times</i>, and which concurs with my recollection of it, says:</P>
    <P>What was needed was not for the Government to take a greater percentage of the GNP for the setting up of jobs, but the creation of an environment where less taxation was taken from private and corporate sectors so that it would be advantageous to invest with the consequent creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>That is a gem which perhaps social, economic and political historians in this country might take note of in years to come to show the development of the man.  I can remember Deputies Lynch, Colley, Wilson, Haughey, Faulkner, Wyse, Gibbons and myself, and almost everyone who spoke on economic matters from this side of the House, saying that since 1973, and we were told that socialist planning would solve all our problems. When reading that statement one realises how far that man has come from the days when he graduated from 37 Pembroke Lane.  We heard lectures on the economy from the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the economy debate <Col N="1494" /> last week.  We were told that the economy had turned the corner, that we were now on the up and up, things were looking really good and there were tremendous prospects ahead for us.  Then the Minister for Finance left this House, and went to a dinner in this city on last Saturday night and told the assembled accountants, who were trying to digest their dinner, that the country was now in such an incredibly bad state financially that serious consideration would have to be given to the abolition of children's allowances, free school transport, disability benefit and relief by agricultural grants&mdash;the grants that provide relief from rates for small farmers under £20 valuation.  Here in this House two days earlier he told us we had turned the corner, that everything ahead of us was rosy, and that this country was just coming into prosperity, the likes of which it had never seen before.</P>
    <P>What sort of men are these that we are supposed to listen to?  What sort of men are these that the country is supposed to listen to?  Is it any wonder that no longer does anybody pay any credence to their utterances? After that happening last week, why should we pay any credence to what was said tonight, for example, by the Minister for Labour?  Can he blame us if we do not, or if nobody in the country does?  If there were any young people listening to this debate over the past two nights, could they not have justification for feeling disillusionment at the kind of lectures and statistics we were being given, which told us we are 1¾ per cent better off than Portugal, or 1½ per cent better off than Iceland, or some other equally irrelevant country for the purposes of our problems here today? Could they be anything but grossly disillusioned with what they heard coming from those Government benches?</P>
    <P>I should like to explain in simple human terms what faces young people who are looking for employment here today.  It is not OECD reports they read in trying to gain consolation for themselves as they sit around from morning until night.  It is these sorts <Col N="1495" /> of facts.  These figures, for example, were given to me only last week by a senior official in the Bank of Ireland who is connected with the recruitment of young people to the service of that bank.  They had 127 vacancies in that bank this year, they got 19,000 applications from young people between the ages of 17 and 20 years for these 127 jobs.  In other words, one in 150 of those applicants will actually get a job with the bank.  The only useful by-product was that I think it was necessary for them to take on a few temporary staff in order to write letters to the 19,000 people who applied for those jobs.  I frequently have coming in to see me young people who have left school with excellent leaving certificates. They give me a list&mdash;and I am quite sure the same goes for every Deputy in every part of this House&mdash; with the names and addresses of 25 firms to which they have applied.  In most cases they did not even get a response because the unfortunate firms are so inundated with applications that they cannot keep up with replies. These are the kinds of prospects facing young people today.</P>
    <P>The regional hospital in Limerick took on in the past few weeks 48 young ladies with the leaving certificate. How many applications had they?  Just under 2,000, and I am told the figure for the regional hospital in Galway is considerably larger.  I have no doubt that the figures for hospitals like St. Finbarr's in Cork, St. Vincent's, the Mater, St. James's, and other hospitals, proportionately are much the same as those in Limerick.</P>
    <P>These are the realities facing young people today and the Government, in a flippant and lethargic way, through their two spokesmen say: &ldquo;The OECD say we are better off than some other countries and we should take consolation from these statistics.&rdquo; What care is there for those people? What care is there for the fact that, due to idleness which they do not wish for, unfortunately a larger and larger proportion of our young people are going into directions they should not go into, and crimes such as vandalism are increasing daily, and <Col N="1496" /> we have an inadequate Garda force in numbers to deal with them.</P>
    <P>A very pertinent example of the attitude of this Government to young people and to their efforts to get employment was demonstrated in this House yesterday afternoon in a reply by the Minister for Justice to a question put down by Deputy Collins. Deputy Collins inquired when it was proposed to recruit the 500 gardaí the Government had announced on 21st June last were about to be recruited in order to increase the strength of the Garda.  The Minister for Justice replied that recruitment would take place sometime in the future but examinations would have to be set and the whole entry procedure would have to be arranged so that the recruitment could be put in process.</P>
    <P>I wonder does the House realise&mdash; the Minister for Justice must realise &mdash;that, over the past two years, there have been 2,500 young men on the waiting list for entry to the Garda. These are young men who have passed the necessary examination, or have the leaving certificate and therefore were exempt from it, who have been measured, who have been found to qualify physically for entry, who have been interviewed locally by the sergeant or the superintendent and found to be of good character, and put on a list to await medical examination. There are 2,500 young men on that list and many of them have been on it for two years now. They were told in this House yesterday by the Minister for Justice: &ldquo;The whole thing is scrapped.  We will start again from scratch.  We will now start recruiting again and we may be able to take in some of them next year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the position of those unfortunate young men?  They have been coming to me in dozens, I suppose because I am a former Minister for Justice and they feel I could have some say in trying to get them called. They are frustrated and bored almost to extinction by this enforced wait. What will their feelings be now when they read that the waiting list they were on is scrapped and that, in order to save money, a new examination is <Col N="1497" /> to be established for people who want to join the Garda and the leaving certificate will no longer be regarded as being worth while and even those who have good leaving certificates with several honours will have to undertake an examination perhaps two or three years after they left school?</P>
    <P>It is indicative of the fact that, when this Government want to save money, they are prepared to save it in the most vital field of all, the protection of our own citizens.  They are prepared to do that at the expense of young people and force them into a situation where frustration will inevitably lead to crime and all sorts of other anti-social behaviour as a result of the situation in which they find themselves. <Col N="1498" /> It has been made clear to us in this debate that the degree of care which comes from those benches in regard to the situation of our young people today is very small.  How any Deputy on any side of this House who looks honestly at the situation into which our young people are forced by the Government could go into the division lobbies to support the Government and say that Dáil Éireann agrees with the Government's attitude to employment opportunities for our young people today and refuses to deplore it, I do not know.  Any such Deputy&mdash;and well each of them knows it&mdash;is, I am afraid, nothing but a hypocrite.</P>

      <P>The provision of a health centre in Darndale, Dublin, is a matter primarily for the Eastern Health Board.  I understand that the area is now served from the temporary health centre at Coolock.  The health board have obtained a site for a permanent health centre at Coolock, which <Col N="1400" /> will cater for the Coolock and Darndale areas.  The provision of the new centre will, however, depend on the availability of capital funds.</P>

      <P>Discussions have been taking place with Dublin Corporation on problems arising from town planning and services matters in respect of the proposed site and these have now been completed.  Formal negotiations with the Sisters of Mercy regarding the acquisition of the site are under way.</P>
