      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 2 and 3, No. 19, Vote 39 (Resumed), 17, 18 and No. 20 (Resumed). The Adoption Bill No. 3 will be taken at the conclusion of No. 18.

      <P>I received the Adoption Bill in my post this morning. Having read it, it seems to be an attempt to allay the concern caused by the recent Supreme Court decision, and only that.  In relation to the statement of the Minister for Justice last night about the amendment of the Constitution, I take it that it will require a constitutional Bill in itself. Is it the intention to introduce that Bill before the recess?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is ready, yes, but it is a question of drafting it.  The intention is to proceed with the constitutional amendment as soon as it is possible to get the Bill drafted. Because of the possibility that the 1952 Act is unconstitutional, it is felt that it should be put beyond any doubt.  For that reason, it is proposed to introduce a constitutional amendment. If it is ready, it will be introduced before the recess, if not, it will be introduced immediately after it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress in replying to the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, I had dealt with a number of the more serious points raised by Deputies.  There were a number of other points which I was anxious to deal with and I hope to deal briefly with them this morning.</P>
      <P>The most important item raised by almost every Deputy was the veterinary dispute.  Before I deal with that I should like to deal briefly with a few other points that were raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Callanan referred to what happened in 1974.  Indeed, the 1974 period was referred to by most Opposition Deputies.  I can understand their concern about the present and the future.  What happened to cattle prices in 1974 is unlikely to recur because of developments in the meantime. At that time our processing capacity was totally inadequate.  It was not possible to cope with the number of cattle being offered.  They were able to hold back on buying and because they were holding back on buying until they got the cattle at the cheapest possible prices, there was no buying of small cattle and the slump <Col N="1188" /> went back down along the line.  In a situation where you have continuous movement of cattle, where there are so many dealers and middle men coming in dealing with young cattle it is very hard to avoid the man at the end of the line getting the worst possible deal.  This is the only country that I know of in Europe where such a system exists.  We will have to try to get away from the present system where cattle are moved so often, where there is so much jobbing and dealing in cattle and where all these profits are gained by middle men along the line.  We must encourage people wherever cattle are produced to hold on to those cattle and finish them where they are.  Otherwise an awful lot of the profits are taken up by these movements.  Deputy Callanan suggested that to overcome periods of this kind there should be a fund of some sort set up to take care of such a situation.  I raised this sort of possibility in the EEC with Commissioner Lardinois and he had at that time gone into this in detail and he found that to give any sort of a deficiency payment such as the deficiency payments that they had in England on a smaller scale would cost £1,000 million.  The question of a fund to take care of that sort of situation in Europe is just not on and there is no way that we can deal with that kind of situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant that the fund should be collected on the commodities that are going well and put into a fund to cushion against the fall. I did not expect the Community to put up the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I misunderstood the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister certainly did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We were confronted with the same slump situation for a short time in the pig industry.  I approached producers here about the setting up of such a fund and it was considered by the farming organisations.  They came back to me and said that they needed the money themselves and that <Col N="1189" /> they would not agree to a levy going on to provide such a fund.  Therefore, I think it would not gain acceptance by the producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried it in the case of pigs.  It could be tried again in the case of cattle but I think it would be rejected by the representative of the farming organisations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons said that the people should be told that they will get a reasonable price for whatever they produce and that stability is what matters.  I agree that stability matters but I do not think that in any product, whether in agriculture or industry, you will get a guarantee that you will get a reasonable price at all times and in all circumstances.  This would be wonderful if it could be done but it cannot be done.  We have surpluses now in so many commodities in Europe that in the last few days I expressed the view that in Europe we seem to be putting out fires all the time.  We wait until we are confronted with an enormous mountain of one thing or another and then we have the problem of how to dispose of it and then we get about a dozen measures that would kill that sector of the agricultural industry completely. As Deputy Callanan knows, there is no such thing as stop-go in agriculture. You cannot get in today, out tomorrow and back in the following day.  I am afraid that there is a good deal of theory in this whole question of what is possible and what is not possible and only the people close to farming appreciate that you just cannot jump in and out of various operations in farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are being told to do.  It cannot be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true and it is quite right that the EEC is open to a lot of criticism for the failure to take worthwhile and reliable forecasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we hear the Minister out without interruption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The nucleus of a unit has been set up now within the EEC <Col N="1190" /> and I hope it will develop and that we can in future hope to get more reliable market prospects and forecasting from them.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to the delay in the payment of headage grants.  I think Deputy Gibbons said that there should be a certificate of posting.  I would welcome such an arrangement because it is distressing for me and for the people concerned when people come and say that they have posted it more than in time to get there and we have no record in the Department and people are deprived of grants because of this.  We cannot single out one person and say he is telling the truth and another person is not telling the truth.  It would be much more satisfactory if we had such an arrangement.  A certificate of posting would be accepted by the Department and people who are concerned about this should do it.  There has been no undue delay about the payment of grants where people did their part of the job.  There have been complications due to a change of ownership, deaths and all that sort of things and those cases are still outstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vets dispute has caused a lot of concern and I think it is fair to say that no Minister in any Department, or in any Government, has given as much personal time to a dispute as I have given to this dispute.  I am sorry to say that at the end of a very long period I certainly have not made the sort of progress that could find a solution to the present dispute.  We have reached a point where we have to make decisions.  It is imperative that we get on with the job because we simply will not be able to dispose of our cattle if disease is not eradicated fairly quickly.  I have tried to co-operate in every way with the veterinary practitioners and I just do not understand why their co-operation is not forthcoming.  If they were to do the work that is now being offered to them, there would certainly be no question of unemployment in the profession. I think they would be over employed as they were when I made the suggestion first about lay technicians being brought in.  I have refrained <Col N="1191" /> for some time from making public statements on the issues involved in the dispute because I was hoping that the union would see the error of their ways or that the pressure of public opinion would persuade them to take a more reasonable view of their position.  They have demonstrated that neither reason nor pressure influenced them to depart in the slightest from their original rigid stance.  They have also chosen to forget that I have responsibility and that I must exercise it.  This quarrel was certainly not of my making.  It had its origins in a situation that existed long before I took up office.  At this stage there is no point in apportioning blame but it is necessary to lay the facts on the line because the general public as well as the farmers and veterinary practitioners have a right to know the facts.  I have the distasteful obligation to publish these facts. While the immediate problem with the practitioners concerns brucellosis, there is an older problem concerning bovine TB.  This country was declared virtually free of bovine TB in 1965, and over the following nine years, up to December, 1974, a controlled programme was maintained in operation with all herds being tested annually and all animals which failed the test being purchased by my Department and resold under contract to meat processing firms.</P>
    <P>This activity cost the taxpayers nearly £33 million.  This sum included over £16 million paid in fees to veterinary practitioners for testing the cattle.  In spite of this vast expenditure I have to say with regret that over this period of nine years there was absolutely no reduction in the incidence of TB.  In fact, in some areas there was an increase.  Efforts made by my Department to improve the system have not met with any great success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister blaming the vets for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that as I go along.  So far as I can judge, <Col N="1192" /> a few practitioners had thrown their professional and ethical standards out of the window, and some farmers whose interest in disease eradication was less than their desire to make money quickly had devised ways and means of defeating the purpose of the testing.  I am concerned about these farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is more concerned about farmers than I am, but I am also concerned when, in some instances, farmers are responsible for the spread of disease, thoughtlessly often, but they are responsible.  We all know about the amount of tag switching and card switching which has taken place, and all these things to which we must try to put an end. The taxpayer has to foot the bill.  The farmer will be the biggest loser because he will not be able to find a place to sell his cattle in a short time.</P>

      <P>The Minister has come a long way since he was trotting back and forward to Earlsfort Terrace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I trotted back and forward to Earlsfort Terrace it was for a good purpose.  It was not for the purpose of stirring up trouble but trying to settle trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>He was stirring up trouble.  He has come a long way since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been easy for me to plaster over the cracks even though our experience was contrary <Col N="1193" /> to experience everywhere else. The normal pattern in TB eradication is, according as disease incidence reduces, annual testing gives way to testing every second year and then testing every third year.  With us, annual testing could go on forever with no improvement in the situation if the Government were content to have it so.  The taxpayers would be obliged to go on paying the bills if our customers abroad were as unconcerned as we seem to be.</P>
      <P>Worse than that, however, we embarked on a brucellosis eradication scheme which promised to be even more expensive than the TB scheme and which could last even longer. Contrary to what happens in the case of TB, the actual testing for brucellosis is done in a central laboratory operated by my Department.  This does not seem to be understood by many people who should know this is a fact.  The blood samples are collected and sent to one central laboratory. The field work consists of taking a sample of blood from each animal to be tested. This work has, unnecessarily in my view, been entrusted to practitioners. In many other countries it has and is being done by trained technicians. That is the position in the North of Ireland.  The vets in the North of Ireland, like the vets down here, are all members of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  The council of the same Royal College specifically approved some years ago of the employment of trained technicians to take blood samples for the purpose of bruceallosis testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1974 I decided to introduce technicians for this work but, under pressure from the Irish Veterinary Union, I since retreated step by step from my original intention until all that was left was a proposal to employ about 25 technicians for a trial period of three years.  During these three years the work of the technicians was to be monitored by an animal health committee which would be set up and would be independent and would assess their work or otherwise.  If at the end of that time they came to me and said: &ldquo;This is no good&rdquo; it would be dropped.  I have to insist that these <Col N="1194" /> people should be employed.  Let us try out the system.  The union refused this shadow of a change even after they had provided ample evidence that some, at least, of their members were not capable of, or were not interested in, taking the blood samples in the time allotted to them each year.  Very often there was a delay of four or five months before the round of testing was completed.</P>
    <P>It was this feature of the situation which prompted the Livestock Committee of the IFA in 1973 to suggest trained technicians should be employed to take blood samples.  I also agreed earlier this year to a 46 per cent increase in practitioners' fees for TB testing.  I do not begrudge them this increase because I am satisfied an increase on this scale was reasonable. At the same time, I have to make the point which is not generally appreciated that, while the vets were agitating for increased fees, the principals of the veterinary practices whom the Department were paying were not themselves testing the cattle in many instances, but were getting the work done by temporary assistants, young vets as well qualified as they are, and were paying these young vets not much more than 50 per cent of what the Department were paying them. They were just taking fees from the Department for work they sub-contracted to any vet who was available. In this way they deprived the farmer of his choice of vet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That happens in every profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  I am just wondering if the fees are so inadequate how could they expect members of their own profession to do the work for half the fee.  Although the farming organisations claim choice of vet is important to farmers, over the years many of them have had their cattle tested by whatever assistant the principal could hire at the time.  It is natural that established practitioners should resist any change in this system. It was equally natural, I suppose, half a century ago that misguided men should spike the corn fields in an effort <Col N="1195" /> to prevent the introduction of reapers and binders.  The reapers and binders came and the combine harvesters came later.</P>
      <P>Here we have a powerful organisation of professional, well educated and scientifically trained men determined to use every pressure to beat back the tide.  The tragedy is that there is work for them all, particularly if equitably shared.  As scientific knowledge increases their work will increase. Some spokesmen for the Irish Veterinary Union have made an effort to parade their sufferings for their principles.  It should hardly be necessary to remind them that the principle they are fighting for is the age old principle of what we have we hold. That is what they are determined to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>When negotiations have been given a fair trial, the time for decision comes.  Now is the time for decision.  I have made the decision to separate the two schemes altogether and to make certain other <Col N="1196" /> changes in the administration of the schemes.  Here are the details. Henceforth every herd owner will make his own arrangements with the veterinary practitioner of his choice to test his cattle annually for TB provided the district veterinary office has been advised beforehand that the test has been arranged and, provided the entire herd is tested, my Department will pay the veterinary practitioner who carries out the test a fee at the rate of payment which I recently offered to the IVU and which represents a 40 per cent increase on existing rates.  Payment will depend on the submission by the veterinary practitioner to the district veterinary office of the detailed results of the test made out in the prescribed form and furnished within a stated period after the completion of the test.</P>
      <P>Reactors will no longer be bought by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  Instead the herd owner will make his own arrangements to sell his reactors to a meat processing plant and a grant will be paid to him by the Department on each reactor animal so delivered to the meat factory.  This grant will vary according to the class of animal and the grants will be as follows: cows and in-calf heifers, pedigree £120; non-pedigree £85; other animals, pedigree £80 and non-pedigree £55.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, in no way for the future.  It will mean in some cases the grants will be too high and in other cases they will not be high enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>But, on the whole, the grants being offered are reasonably good grants and this scheme will do away with this whole question of several visits by inspectors from the Department going out and haggling over the price.  It is time we put a stop to this.  Farmers, as well as everybody else, were simply fed up with the whole business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was, I think, Deputy H. Gibbons who raised the possibility of having <Col N="1197" /> this taken care of by some form of insurance scheme.  I tried this over a long period and I could get no takers from among all the insurance business people.  I even tried the FBD insurance people to come up with proposals or suggestions and they would not take it on.</P>
    <P>In-calf heifers must be identifiable as such on <i>post mortem</i> examination at the meat plant.  The reason for that is we want to include in-calf heifers with cows from the point of view of the grant.  The full amount of the grant will be payable on every reactor, properly documented, delivered to an approved processing premises within four weeks of the reactor being identified and punched.  Thereafter the amount of the grant will be reduced by £10 a week or part of a week until the animal has been actually delivered to the factory.</P>
    <P>I appreciate fully these arrangements may be less satisfactory than methodical testing on an area basis but in the present circumstances the essential thing is to have TB testing resumed and a further effort made to get away from the stagnation and indifference that have characterised this scheme for the past ten years.  Nothing in the new arrangements will preclude my Department from testing any herd with its own authorised staff.  We have been doing this in the worst areas, such as Waterford and Kilkenny, in recent times.</P>
    <P>As regards brucellosis eradication, I consider I am now left with no alternative but to arrange that compulsory measures will be operated by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries using technicians supervised by its own staff and employing a combination of blood sampling or milk sampling as appropriate.  Reactors will be disposed of as in the case of TB reactors.  The pre-intensive scheme in the southern counties will continue as heretofore for the present.</P>

      <P>The animal health council which has developed from suggestions made during the negotiations will monitor progress under these arrangements and will advise me of any changes it considers desirable to accelerate the eradication programme and I am now arranging to call the council together.  I have frequently been criticised for holding up TB testing.  Now that these two schemes have been separated there is every reason why farmers should get their cattle tested for TB and no reason why the practitioners should not test them.  I would remind farmers there will be increasing difficulties about exporting live cattle if they are not regularly tested and if the incidence of TB is not progressively declining.  I have decided to end the wasteful process of buying reactors on farms.  The administration costs of this system are growing all the time and the grants I am now offering, plus the factory prices for the animals, should compensate farmers fairly for cattle which will be worth less and less as time goes on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I need hardly remind farmers that the cattle are not the Government's cattle or the taxpayers' cattle and it is up to the farmers themselves to clear their herds of disease and keep them clear.  I have no objection <Col N="1200" /> and the Government have no objection to providing large sums to help farmers eradicate diseases but we are entitled, in the interests of the taxpayers in general, to insist on results. I am now setting about a complete reorganisation of the brucellosis scheme and it will be my ambition to develop it in such a way that it can progress speedily and efficiently.</P>
      <P>We simply cannot afford to have any continuation of what I have just described as the stagnation and indifference which in recent years have characterised the business of disease eradication.  There is too much at stake. Already the British have taken action to counteract our failure to make progress in disease eradication.  Further restrictions are threatened from the North.  Our temporary derogations from the EEC rules will soon be coming up for review and, if we cannot make rapid and sustained progress, the pocket of every farmer who keeps cattle will be affected.  At the end of the day it is he who will be the ultimate loser if the job is not done efficiently and well.  I thought it necessary to make a detailed statement on the whole dispute that has gone on, as I say, for far too long, a dispute I never wanted because I realise how important it is, if we are to have success, that we should have the complete co-operation of all the people concerned, and that includes the veterinary practitioners, the administrative people in the Department and, above all, the farmers and the people who deal in cattle.  There has been a good deal of unscrupulous traffic, I am sorry to say, and it has made the job of efficient eradication extremely difficult for all concerned.</P>
      <P>I still want to appeal to the veterinary practitioners, even at this late hour, to decide to co-operate.  Too often the veterinary practitioners are regarded by farmers themselves as a fire brigade service.  This is a wrong attitude.  There should be contractual arrangements set up between groups of farmers and veterinary practitioners to advise the farmers on the best way to keep out disease and not to keep the animal from dying when it is seriously ill from disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1201" /> Deputy Gibbons made the point that the British market was rapidly disappearing for our cattle and beef, that the British were becoming more self-sufficient.  That is quite true, but he went on to say that the Department did not seem to be aware of the importance of Europe and the importance of encouraging the European breeds here if we were to sell our cattle in Europe.  There is a committee permanently in existence on which all the farming organisations, all the breed societies and all the people who have an input to make to the Department, to advise me on what should be done about the breeding of cattle.  What we have done is to make all these breeds available in the AI stations.  The fact of the matter is that the demand for these breeds has been disappointingly low.  We can do no more than make these breeds available, advise the farmers that, if they want to remain in the beef business and if they want to get the highest possible prices, it is in their own interests to improve the beef quality of cattle, certainly improve it from the point of view of producing the type of lean cattle that are required and that get premium prices in Europe.  We cannot do more than make farmers aware of the situation, and they must make their own decisions in the long run.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of comment about the modernisation scheme, and some Deputy over there said he did not like the idea of consigning so many to the limbo of the transitional category because this led to the decay of rural Ireland.  The grants being made available to transitional farmers are higher than any grants given before. It is wrong to say that these people are being put out of business. We are trying to do what we can to look after any of them that it is possible to bring up to development status.  We are also trying to get Directive No. 159 amended to be more suitable to this country.</P>
    <P>I want to keep the maximum number of people on the land, even as part-time farmers.  I heard criticism some time ago of the fact that we have 40,000 part-time farmers.  I was very pleased to hear there were that <Col N="1202" /> number, and provided these 40,000 have worthwhile employment outside the farms, I am anxious to keep them on the land.  It will be a poor day for this country if we go on reducing the number of people in farming as has been done in the past.  All the evidence we have now indicates that there are fewer people leaving the land than ever before, that more young people have gone into farming in the last year or so than has happened for a very long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is apparently so. The number that left farming in the past year would seem to be the lowest, I think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The comment is not correct.  There is ample evidence to indicate that more young people have gone into farming in the last year or year-and-a-half than have gone into farming in a similar period for many years, and fewer people, one fifth or one sixth of the number, have left the land in the past year.  Therefore there must be some prosperity and some happiness, and I think the future was never brighter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Callanan knows this is so.  There was a good deal of criticism, too, about the amount of money going into the disadvantaged <Col N="1203" /> areas.  Millions seem to mean nothing now to the Deputies of this House. Last year £11 million that had never previously gone into the West of Ireland went to that area, and this year both Italy and ourselves got an increase of 10 per cent in the grant. That has been entirely paid out, and the first report I see from one of the farming organisations says &ldquo;totally inadequate&rdquo;. This is the sort of reaction one gets.  There is an extra £1,500,000 going into these areas this year, but those who are critical and saying we are doing nothing for the West of Ireland are not making sense.</P>

We get quite a bit from Brussels, but I think he is perfectly <Col N="1204" /> right, and the sooner farmers get down to looking after their own interests and their own job and give up spending so much time talking about, considering and looking for subsidies from here, there and everywhere else, the better for themselves.</P>

If we are to get the best results we must have team work.  I should like to thank the farming organisations, and all the other agencies that have an important part to play in agriculture for the co-operation they have given me as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries since I took up that post.  It is absolutely essential that we have team work. We must regard ourselves as a team in existence for one purpose, to get the best results possible from our land.

The scheme should have been the subject of discussion during the debate on the Minister's Estimate.  It is scandalous treatment of the House.  Can the Minister quantify the cost to the nation's economy of this dispute between himself, the Department and the veterinary profession?

      <P>I understand the farmer must employ his own vet and the Department pay a 40 per cent increase for testing but I should like to know if the Minister is putting this over on the farmer now.  If the vets say they will not accept 40 per cent will the farmer have to pay the difference between the 40 per cent and what the vet will charge?  Will the farmer be caught all the time?  The row is because the vets will not accept the 40 per cent.  The farmers must now first get the vets to agree to do the testing. If the vets say they are still on strike and will not test the Minister is handing the strike breaking over to the farmer. If the farmer is charged more than the 40 per cent increase granted he has to pay it.  He is the loser all the time.</P>

    <Title>National Stud Bill, 1976: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to increase the share capital of the National Stud Company who were formed in 1945 to operate the National Stud at Tully, County Kildare.  Over the years the company have made a very significant contribution to the development of the Irish bloodstock industry. With increasing demands on their services and the growing popularity of the stud as a centre of tourist interest they now wish to buy extra bloodstock and to make further improvements in the stud amenities.  It is, therefore, necessary to improve the company's access to capital for investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" /> The company have seven stallions at Tully.  The stallions are available to breeders throughout Ireland for the service of approved mares at fees ranging from £100 for Linacre bought in 1965 to £2,000 each for their more recent acquisitions, Sallust and African Sky.  All fees are charged with &ldquo;no foal no fee&rdquo; and &ldquo;live foal&rdquo; concessions. The company also have seven mares for breeding whose progeny are sold as yearlings.</P>
    <P>The entire stud farm comprises 850 acres.  To maximise their returns the company are endeavouring to increase the output of cattle and crops on the farm.  They now produce almost their entire fodder requirements and, by careful planning, they hope to show a substantial profit on the farm in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Education and research have become an important function at the stud. The company conduct a six-month training course in stud management each year for boys and girls in the age group 18-25.  Many students from abroad have taken these courses and the demand for places far exceeds the supply.  The company also conduct short refresher courses for stud farm employees, and seminars and open-days for horsebreeders.  In addition, there are regular conducted tours throughout the week for visitors from Ireland and abroad.  The company also engage in research into stud management and disease control and co-operate with the Agricultural Institute and other bodies in various areas of equine research.</P>
    <P>The company provided the site and buildings for the Racing Apprentice Centre of Education&mdash;the training centre for jockeys at Tully&mdash;and help in the organisation of courses and the provision of lectures.  Finally, the company have responsibility for the Japanese Gardens which attracted 27,000 visitors in 1975.</P>
    <P>The company maintain close liaison with the other semi-State bodies associated with horses, that is the Racing Board and Bord na gCapall whose main functions are to promote horse racing and show jumping respectively.</P>
    <P>The company are devoting increasing <Col N="1211" /> attention to financial planning and cost control, desiring to provide a first-class service to the horse industry while maintaining a close watch on ever-increasing costs.  They have formulated a five-year development programme which envisages an increase in the number of stallions at the stud, extra stabling, laboratory and research facilities, a museum of the Irish horse and possibly a health farm for horses. They also hope to extend their educational and training programmes. Discussions are being held with the company about the details of the programme and its implications.</P>
    <P>Turning to the bloodstock industry generally, it continues to occupy an important place in the economy.  The capital value of the industry is estimated at £100 million.  The number of horses competing in Irish races in 1975 reached the record figure of 3,300. Total attendance at race meetings exceeded one million.  Total exports of horses in 1975 exceeded £6 million&mdash; £5.1 million bloodstock and £1 million other horses.</P>
    <P>In promoting this Bill the Government are showing their confidence in the future of the industry and in the magnificent work of the National Stud Company.  Those of us who have visited the stud are well aware that it has become a very worthy showplace for the Irish horse.  We also relish the many tributes which are paid to the stud by countless visitors from home and abroad.  I would like to thank the board of directors and the staff for their excellent work and wish them well in their plans for the future.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the details of the Bill. Section 1 contains the usual definitions. Section 2 increases the share capital of the company to £5 million from the existing £2 million which was fixed by the 1969 Act.  The shares will be taken up by the Minister for Finance from time to time for the purpose of financing approved programmes. In keeping with the increase in share capital it has been decided to increase the company's borrowing limits.  Section 3 increases the maximum amount which may be borrowed <Col N="1212" /> by the company from £0.2 million to £0.5 million.</P>
    <P>Section 4 relates to the pay of the company's chief officer.  As part of general policy on remuneration in the public service, it is desired to avail of this legislation to bring the chief officer's pay under ministerial control. Similar provisions have been made in recent legislation affecting other State-sponsored bodies.  Section 5 relates to the accounts to be kept by the company, the auditing of accounts and the submission of accounts and annual reports to the Minister for presentation to each House of the Oireachtas.  A modern text replaces provisions which were included in the 1945 and 1953 Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is another modernising provision.  It has become standard practice to provide that where a member of the board of a State-sponsored body is nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann or nominated for election to either House of the Oireachtas, he shall cease to be a member of the board.  Similarly, sitting members of either House may not become members or employees of the board.  Employees of a State-sponsored body stand seconded from their employment from the date of nomination if nominated as members of Seanad Éireann or nominated for election to either House.  There are no such provisions in the National Stud Acts.  Section 6 corrects this omission.</P>
    <P>As Members are aware, the Government have approved the transfer of direct responsibility for certain State-sponsored bodies from the Minister for Finance to other Ministers. One of these bodies is the National Stud Company for which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will in future have primary responsibility. This involves some textual changes which are set out in section 7.  Section 8 repeals the accounting provisions in the 1945 Act and repeals the 1953 and 1969 Acts in full.  I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Stud have performed very useful functions in the past, some of which have been detailed by the Minister.  The most important function the stud have performed <Col N="1213" /> is to make available to smaller breeders the opportunities which would not be within their financial range of competence if the stud did not exist.  I am no expert in the field covered by the National Stud and some of my colleagues who have a greater knowledge of this matter will be contributing to this debate.  There are one or two points I want to raise.</P>
      <P>The first was adverted to by the Minister almost at the end of his speech when he acknowledged that it has been announced that the responsibility for the National Stud is to be transferred to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries from the Minister for Finance.  The impression given by the announcement made by the Government was that this had been done.  Now the Minister says that it is to be done and has not yet been done.  Even when it is done, according to what the Minister says and according to the terms of section 7, the Minister for Finance will still retain responsibility.  He might spell out precisely what is proposed to be done and what the effect of the transfer to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, if there is a further Bill of this kind needed in the future in order to increase the share capital of the National Stud, will the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or the Minister for Finance be responsible for the passage of that legislation through the House?  The position at the moment seems quite unclear and it does not appear to me that the terms of section 7 would have such effect as to transfer responsibility in that regard to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  If that is so it is not clear what was the point of the announcement by the Government in relation to the transfer of responsibility for the National Stud from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  The terms of section 4, relating to the remuneration of the chief officer of the company, are in accordance with provisions made in a number of Bills from time to time.  I have never been quite clear why it is not possible to cover this kind of provision in a blanket Bill and why it has to await <Col N="1214" /> the introduction of legislation dealing with the particular State body&mdash;in some cases that may not happen for a few years&mdash;in order to effect what is provided in section 4.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to widen unduly the scope of this discussion but the bringing of the remuneration of the chief officer of this company and of other State bodies within the control effectively of the Minister for the Public Service can be a matter of vital importance in the whole question of remuneration in the public sector pay and could affect the negotiations for national pay agreements.  It is not clear therefore why this kind of provision must await the somewhat fortuitous introduction of Bills of this kind in relation to various companies.</P>
    <P>The Minister says in regard to section 5, which relates to the keeping and production of accounts by the company, that a modern text replaces provisions which were included in the 1945 and 1953 Acts.  When replying the Minister might specify the actual practical differences brought about by section 5 as against the existing provisions if any such practical alterations are being effected.  The provision in section 6 is also a common one introduced in relation to Bills of this kind as they come up for consideration by the Oireachtas.  I know there are differing views on the question of whether or not nomination of a director of a State company for election to either House of the Oireachtas should automatically exclude him from membership of the board concerned.  That question has been argued at considerable length in the past and I agree with the provisions of section 6 in regard to this and other State companies.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain precisely what is involved in the proposed transfer of responsibility from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in relation to the National Stud and I would ask him to specify what practical changes, if any, are being effected by section 5.</P>
    <P>Subject to those rather technical queries the question of the actual financial provision in this Bill, the general principle of increasing the <Col N="1215" /> availability of capital to the company, is one with which we agree but whether the amounts involved and the relationship between those provided for in sections 2 and 3 is correct is another matter.  My colleagues will have something to say on these matters and it will be interesting to hear what the Minister has to say in reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this legislation presents us with the opportunity of looking at one of our very important national institutions and examining its performance, considering its policies and looking at the contribution it is making to agriculture in the first instance and to the economy in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose it is not necessary to emphasise the fundamental national importance of our bloodstock breeding industry.  The Minister very succinctly mentioned that importance but I think it is important that I and my colleagues should take the opportunity to re-emphasise to all concerned the fundamentally important place our bloodstock breeding industry occupies in the economy.  It is a very important industry from the point of view of the contribution it makes in a material sense to our agricultural output, in the contribution it makes to employment.  Bloodstock breeding provides first-class employment in many areas where it would be impossible to provide employment of a similar calibre in any other way. A well-managed and well-run stud farm is the equivalent of a reasonably-sized factory as regards employment but the contribution bloodstock breeding makes does not stop there. It enhances our countryside in many ways; it can, and should be a very valuable element in our tourist industry. It can make a very important contribution to the general status of the country internationally; it can make a valuable contribution to our balance of payments and it is a necessary basis for our racing industry, which is also a great employer, and in addition, it is a very considerable tourist attraction.  It would be impossible to over-emphasise its importance in our national affairs.  Therefore, so far as <Col N="1216" /> the National Stud is an integral part of our bloodstock breeding industry, the measure before us deserves far greater attention than, perhaps, many Deputies would be inclined to afford it and the Minister in his approach would seem to indicate that he awards it.</P>
    <P>I should like to reiterate what Deputy Colley has said about the transfer situation.  The present situation is a most unhappy one.  Nothing is worse than to have an important State body in a sort of limbo situation where responsibility for it is divided between two different Ministers.  As Deputy Colley said, that is very much the position prevailing in regard to the National Stud at present.  There was an announcement which seemed to indicate that the responsibility was to be transferred to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  That would seem to be a very natural and logical step but it is clear from the way this Bill is coming before us, from what the Minister has said and from the provisions of the Bill that the transfer is more apparent than real and that the principal person concerned with the National Stud is still going to be the Minister for Finance. I am quite clear in my own mind that the Minister for Finance is not particularly interested in the National Stud.  I know that from the quality of this speech which he has made introducing this Bill, from the length of the speech, from its contents, and indeed from the way in which he galloped through the speech here this morning.  I am not going to castigate the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It sounds very like it, with all due respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to castigate him personally.  The Minister for Finance has enormous and onerous responsibility.  No Minister of the Government has the same pressures on him as the Minister for Finance has, and it is understandable and natural that in the situation in which the Minister for Finance finds himself, particularly this Minister for Finance, he would not be giving all the attention to the affairs of the National Stud <Col N="1217" /> that some of us would like to see him give.</P>
      <P>Let us then, for goodness sake, come to some positive decision about this matter.  Let the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries become fully and totally responsible for the National Stud.  Let him formulate a policy for it.  Let him appreciate its importance, and go on from there.  I want to reiterate my belief in the important role that the National Stud can play in our bloodstock breeding industry, in our racing industry, and indeed in the entire field of the Irish horse.</P>
      <P>I am going to be egotistical enough to quote something I said when I was establishing the survey team on the horse-breeding industry when I was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. I said to the team at the first meeting:</P>
      <P>I believe we should concentrate on what we are good at, and nobody has ever questioned our ability to breed and raise good horses of every kind.</P>
      <P>Even though I said that myself, I think it is a very sound statement.  In this country we have to undertake many forms of economic activity, some of which we are at a considerable and natural disadvantage in undertaking, but this is something that does not apply in the horse industry. We should aim to make Ireland the premier bloodstock-breeding country in the world.  That should be our target in so far as bloodstock breeding is concerned.  We have everything that is necessary to achieve that target.  We have all the necessary ingredients, all the natural advantages, the climate, the soil, the tradition, the accumulated knowledge, the experience, the basic structure, and the people.  We have everything available to us that can ensure that we do become the bloodstock centre of the world.  That is what I want to see established as firm Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that we are well on the way towards the achievement of that objective.  I believe that the Fianna Fáil Government of which Deputy Colley and myself were members made a very important, significant contribution towards the elaboration of that policy in the first instance and towards its achievement, secondly. <Col N="1218" /> I admit&mdash;&ldquo;admit&rdquo; is perhaps the wrong word&mdash;I acknowledge that this Government have also made an important contribution in carrying on the general line of the policy we laid down in that regard.  I believe some measures the Minister himself has taken as Minister for Finance have been very detrimental, but by and large nothing has happened that need interfere with or impair our efforts towards the achievement of what I regard as an important national objective.</P>
    <P>That brings me, then, to the role that the National Stud might play in that situation.  It seems to me that in developing our bloodstock breeding industry and our horse industry in general there are three separate aspects to be considered.  First of all there is the question of producing the animals, the horses, the yearlings. Then there is the question of selling them at the best possible advantage, and there is the whole area of racing, because the racing industry in this country is an integral, necessary part of our bloodstock breeding industry. It is essential on the one hand that we breed the horses to race and secondly that we have a completely adequate racing structure to provide the necessary outlet for the horses that we breed.  So I would look at our bloodstock breeding industry under those three separate headings: production, selling and racing.</P>
    <P>In so far as the National Stud is concerned it is on the production side that it has the most important part to play, but I want to emphasise that in my view it can have and should have an important part to play in the other two areas as well.  I will come back to that later.  For the moment let us look at the position of the National Stud in so far as the production of our bloodstock is concerned.  Away back at the very beginning I think the right decision, the fundamental, basic, correct decision in regard to the National Stud was taken: that the National Stud should be there primarily to help the small breeder.  It is important here to recognise that the bloodstock breeding industry is a very varied type of industry.  If it is to be the sort of industry we want it to be, <Col N="1219" /> it will necessarily include large-scale, heavily-capitalised stud farms.  It will and must also include the small farmer-breeder, and indeed various different-sized establishments in between these two extremes.</P>
    <P>From every point of view&mdash;the economic point of view, the natural point of view, the tourist point of view&mdash;that sort of structure in bloodstock breeding itself is essential, and the National Stud has a particularly important role to play where the small farmer-breeder is concerned.  I think everybody acknowledges that down the years, since it was taken over by an Irish Government, the National Stud has made a very important contribution in that regard.  It has set itself a policy of making stallions available to the smaller farmer-breeder on the best possible commercial terms.  I think we would all agree that there would be no dispute in the House about the desirability of the National Stud continuing to fulfil that role, continuing to be the friend of the small farmer-breeder, continuing to provide him with access to the sort of stallions he needs at reasonable prices and on favourable conditions.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the background which has led to the preparation of the Bill.  In a case decided early <Col N="1220" /> this month the Supreme Court declared an adoption order made in 1971 to be invalid and awarded custody of the child to its natural parents.  The court decided that the board had not discharged the statutory onus that is on it to be satisfied that the mother of the child was informed of her right to withdraw her consent to the making of the adoption order up to the time the order was actually made.  The fact that the board did not ensure that the mother was aware of what in one of the judgments is called the date of the hearing was also criticised by the court.  The point also arose that the mother did not know or may not have known her rights and that she was entitled to know them&mdash;this point being distinct from the board's duty to satisfy itself that this was the case.</P>
    <P>While, as was emphasised by the Chief Justice in his judgment, the combination of factors in the case decided by the Supreme Court was a very unusual one, some of the defects on which the decision of the court was based may have been present in some of the adoption orders that have been made.  The intention of the Bill in this regard is to validate all of the orders concerned to the extent that they may be invalid by reason of the defects in question.  Accordingly, the first substantive provision in the Bill&mdash;section 2&mdash; is that, provided a consent was duly given, the board shall be deemed to have discharged the onus I have mentioned notwithstanding that it had no evidence that the persons who gave their consent were aware that they could withdraw it at any time before the adoption orders were made or that they knew the dates on which the board proposed to make the orders.  I might add that the board's practice not to seek information in respect of these matters was based on the assumption that it was unnecessary for it to do so. A further provision in the Bill, linked with the first, proposes that the fact that a person who gave consent to the making of an adoption order was not aware that he could withdraw it up to the time the order was made or was not aware of the date on which the board proposed to make the order or of his right to be heard by the board shall not invalidate the order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1221" /> As regards future cases, the problems that arose in relation to the case recently decided probably could be completely avoided by changes in procedure on the part of the board, but the difficulty is that the changes in procedure that would appear to be necessary if the board were to be sure that it was fully complying would be changes that virtually everybody involved in adoption work would undoubtedly regard as very undesirable. Consequently the Bill has to authorise the board to adopt procedures which the present law, according to the courts decision, would not allow.  The main difficulty arose from the obligation which, on my reading of the judgments, the Supreme Court consider lies on the board under the existing legislation to inform a consenting party of the date of the hearing.</P>
    <P>I think I should explain at this juncture that there are, in fact, no proceedings before the board at which the various parties to an adoption arrangement are present or represented. The board's practice is first of all to scrutinize the formal documents &mdash;application form, consents, and so on&mdash;and then to seek and study various social reports on the placement. These include reports from inspectors who have visited the home and so on.  Towards the end of the procedure, all going well, the board interviews the prospective adopter or adopters.  This interview takes place in all cases.  If any other interested person has indicated his wish to discuss the case or if the board wishes to interview some other person, the interview takes place on a separate occasion.  The board, for obvious reasons, wishes to maintain this practice. The intention is to permit the board to continue its practice in this regard, but section 3 provides for the giving of additional information to persons who consent to the making of orders.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the board may authorise suitable persons to make inquiries on its behalf and may act on the basis of their reports.  It would appear from the Supreme Court decision that it is not sufficient for the board to have before it the sworn affidavit of consent and that, <Col N="1222" /> even if the consent form were to show on its face that the person giving consent fully understood the nature and effect of an adoption order and of the consent, including the fact that he or she may withdraw the consent, it would still be necessary for the board to have that fact confirmed independently.</P>
    <P>The provisions I have mentioned are intended to deal with the problems raised directly by the decision of the Supreme Court.  There are, however, two further provisions which deal with wider issues.  Section 5 provides that in proceedings for a declaration that an adoption order is invalid, the High Court, having regard to the interests of the child and to the rights under the Constitution of the persons concerned, may decline to make the declaration if it so thinks proper, and section 6 is intended to ensure that if, nevertheless, in a particular case an adoption order is declared invalid, no order relating to the custody of the child will be made without adequate notice to the adopter or adopters and then only on the basis that the decision will be made in accordance with the provisions of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, which specifies that the welfare of the child is to be the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision has generated considerable interest and quite an amount of emotion.  Some people's reaction has been to denounce our adoption laws <i>in toto</i> and to call for a completely new approach. I hope, however, that this Bill will be accepted as an adequate response to the immediate problems.  It has obviously been prepared quickly to meet a proven need.  I have an open mind on the question of the desirability of some further changes in the adoption code and it is a subject which will be receiving my attention. I have, however, already announced that the Government intend to bring forward proposals for an amendment of the Constitution to ensure that in any adoption situation the interests of the child shall prevail.  I think that the present Bill serves a useful purpose and I would ask the House to accept it and to give its approval with the minimum of delay.</P>
    <Col N="1223" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party welcome this Bill, one which is clearly, as the Minister himself suggested, an emergency measure to try and restore the situation as it obtained prior to the recent decision of the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister and the House appreciate that the production of emergency legislation, hurried legislation, is something about which all sides of the House have at all times been worried.  Whereas we realise it is necessary, nevertheless we want to make sure that we are doing the right and proper thing.  Because of the importance of this Bill I am glad that we are dealing only with the Second Stage this afternoon.</P>
      <P>My party are very firm in their belief that once an adoption order is made it cannot and indeed should not be set aside.  The adoption order is and must be a permanent order for all times.  If the situation were otherwise chaos would exist and an unbelievable amount of unnecessary suffering and agony on many fronts would follow.</P>
      <P>In a debate such as this we must be extremely careful of the fundamental rights of parents.  I am sure everybody will agree that those fundamental rights of parents cannot and should not be interefered with in any way.  In this Bill I note that we have to rely on the help of section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, for the protection of the welfare of the child.  In the operation of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, it must be remembered that the welfare of the child under this Act takes precedence, in that we would have a situation where the two legal parents would have difficulty in deciding on the welfare of the children, perhaps each looking for the custody of the children.  Certainly here the welfare of the child must take precedence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Adoption Acts and up to and until the adoption order is made the fundamental rights of the parents must take precedence over the welfare of the child.  I do not believe there is any disagreement on this point, but nevertheless I feel I should mention it because if the welfare of the child were to take precedence over <Col N="1224" /> the fundamental rights of the parents then we could have a situation where wealthy parents could adopt a child because they could look after the welfare of the child better than the natural parents.  Perhaps they might be in a position to provide a better standard of living or better education for the child.</P>
    <P>I am trying to point out the important difference between the underlying fundamental principles in the Adoption Acts and the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  Under the Adoption Acts the rights of the mother and the adoptive parents have to be taken into consideration.  The adoption agency places the child with the full consent of the mother and then the State takes the necessary steps to validate the agreement entered into and to protect the rights of the child.  Up to the time the adoption order is made the welfare of the child should not supersede the fundamental rights of the natural parents.</P>
    <P>The mother of the child being placed for adoption must be fully aware of her rights under the Adoption Acts.  I believe this is vitally important. I do not support those who condemn our adoption laws out of hand.  I believe those people are unfortunately allowing their emotions to run away with them.  In a situation such as this after the decision of the Supreme Court and where we have 23,000 adoption orders made since 1952 I believe we must exercise extreme restraint and extreme caution in our choice of words for the very real fear which exists of making the situation worse for those who are involved. In the course of this debate on this emergency legislation Members of the House should show the same restraint and caution I have just mentioned.  We must do everything we possibly can not to allow a situation to develop where we would unduly worry the many adoptive parents who are anxiously watching and waiting the new Bill which we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>I believe there are a few questions which must be asked.  There are some things I am not too happy about.  Let us take, for instance, the talk, about <Col N="1225" /> the constitutional referendum.  I have no doubt that since the question of the need for a constitutional referendum has arisen that it will cause worry to many people.  The mechanics of a constitutional referendum are so great that it is a worry to practising politicians never mind ordinary people and those who are emotionally on tenterhooks at the present time because of the result of the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister should spell out in detail why this constitutional referendum is necessary.  Is it necessary to render the Bill we are now discussing constitutional?  Is it, as I gathered from the Taoiseach this morning on the Order of Business, necessary to render the 1952 Act constitutional? I would like to hear the Minister telling us if we can amend the Constitution retrospectively.  This is a very serious matter.  It might be best if it could be clarified at this early stage.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to mention is that during the course of a recent debate in the House on the wealth tax and the capital acquisition tax it was discovered that both of those Acts have sections in them which say in effect that an adopted child, whether it was adopted here or abroad, is to be treated as a natural legitimate child of the parents concerned. I am slightly worried why we have to have a provision such as this in the Acts I have mentioned.  There are other Members of the House who have the same worry and who would like to know why a provision such as this has to be written into the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the Adoption Acts would have provided for all legal purposes of the child, that an adopted child should be treated in exactly the same way as a natural legitimate child of the parents concerned.  I am sure most people believe that the adopted child has full rights, has the same rights as the natural legitimate child.  I understand the Adoption Acts do not have blanket cover for the full rights of the adopted child.  If this is so I believe this Bill, which is to remedy the position of adopted children, should have a provision to guarantee them full <Col N="1226" /> rights.  Those couple of points are vitally important particularly to the children in question but also to the parents who adopt them.  Perhaps the Minister would have a look at them and if he needs more time on them perhaps during the course of the Committee Stage on Wednesday next, if business is so ordered, we can have further discussion on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to intervene very briefly on this subject with particular reference to one issue Deputy Collins raised which concerns the question of amending the Constitution and the feelings of adoptive parents and indeed adoptive families. First of all, I would like to say that I speak as one who is involved in that, as other Deputies are.  I do not like to make too much of that because I know that many people who are not adoptive parents fully share their feelings and understand them.  It has been one of the more reassuring and finer things about this.  I would also like to express my appreciation of the considerateness and, if I may say so, gentleness shown by Deputy Collins in his approach to this and his concern that nothing should be said here that would further trouble those families who are inevitably troubled by the discussion which has been set loose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one substantive point I want to make concerns the question of the need for constitutional amendment. Deputy Collins rightly said that many parents and indeed many children are on tenterhooks about this because many of the adopted children are old enough to get some sense of this debate.  Even surprisingly young children get a sense of it.  Nothing will permanently allay that sense of anxiety and uncertainty except a constitutional amendment.  That is fact.  Unless this is done the uncertainty will continue to hand over these families and will never go away although it might prove to be an unfounded uncertainty and may never be challenged.  Therefore, both as a member of the Government and as one of those affected by this legislation, I welcome the Bill and, in <Col N="1227" /> particular, I welcome the intention to amend the Constitution.  It has been a subject of much gratification to all of us that no one has endeavoured, either on this side or on the other side of the House, to make a political football out of this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

I should hope that both sides of the House would have a meeting of minds on this matter and that an appropriate constitutional change can be put before the people, a change which we can recommend unanimously from this Parliament and which will have the effect of rescuing people from the uncertainty and anxiety that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Collins in welcoming this measure.  It might be said that nothing which has occurred in our political life for some considerable time has caused such widespread anxious reaction as the decision of the Supreme Court in relation to an adopted child.  In common with other Deputies, I have had many communications by way of telephone calls, letters and personal calls, in relation to this situation.  The Government are to be commended on the way in which they have responded to the need for the amending legislation. What is essential is that adoptive parents and others be reassured as quickly and as fully as possible about the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it very difficult to understand the reasoning of the Supreme Court in reaching their decision.  As a consequence of that decision, it was absolutely necessary that the Government act quickly.  The Minister asks that we accept the Bill as an adequate response to the immediate problem and he goes on to say that the legislation was prepared quickly to meet a proven need.  We should be very careful to look on this piece of legislation in exactly the light in which it is put before us.  We have a sudden <Col N="1228" /> crisis situation which calls for a response from this Parliament and we are giving that adequate response.  It is very important, though, that we confine our thinking and our comments at this stage to that immediate problem, to the vital matter of reassuring adoptive parents and of stipulating that existing adoptions are as safe and as secure as the law of this land can make them.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that in this legislation we are doing that exactly.  We are giving these people the reassurance that they are seeking desperately.  I trust that the passing of the legislation will have the desired effect in that regard.  However, when we bring in legislation dealing with adoption we open up a very wide area.  Again, the Government are right at this stage in mentioning the need for an amendment to the Constitution and in not attempting to involve that amendment in this matter.  The amendment to the Constitution will be necessarily a much more serious and difficult question than the question of the immediate response which was necessary to meet the Supreme Court decision.  It is something about which we shall all have to think very long, anxiously and sincerely.</P>
    <P>I support fully Deputy Collins when he says that there is an important difference between the Guardianship of Infants Act and the Adoption Acts in that they deal with separate and totally different situations.  The Minister mentioned proposals for an amendment to the Constitution to ensure that in any adoptive situation the interest of the child shall prevail.  I am not very happy about that statement.  Admittedly, this question is at an early stage and we must have much more information in regard to it.  However, we must be very careful that the fundamental rights of parents are protected adequately by our Constitution and by our laws.  In the case of the invocation of the Guardianship of Infants Act there are involved two parents who in every respect are equal before the law but who, unfortunately, are arguing about the future of a child.  Therefore, the fact that the welfare of the child should be the paramount consideration is entirely appropriate <Col N="1229" /> but the Minister here uses the phrase &ldquo;in any adoption situation&rdquo;. That possibly means a situation before an adoption order is made.  It is something I wish to mention at this stage as being a matter to which we must give close scrutiny and careful examination.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Collins, too, when he says that once an adoption order is made it should be inviolable, sacrosanct and beyond the power or the capacity of anyone to interfere with.  When the Minister speaks of &ldquo;an adoption situation&rdquo;, he would seem to imply that the welfare of the child being of paramount importance comes into the operation at a very early stage of the proceedings.  This is a question which we must return to in depth and debate fully and sincerely so that, as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said, we might reach an agreed proposal to put before the people.</P>
    <P>To return to what I said originally, this measure is necessary.  A very harrowing situation arose as a result of the Supreme Court decision so that it was absolutely necessary that the Minister and the Dáil should act.  I comment the Minister for acting.  I hope and believe that the passing of this legislation and the unanimous support it will receive in this House will achieve its purpose, of totally and completely reassuring all those persons throughout the community at this point who are in need of that reassurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my few words to what has been said in an effort to make it clear to all those who are so anxiously concerned that it is the will of all of us in this House to resolve this problem satisfactorily and as soon as possible.  I hope this Bill will satisfactorily resolve the problem for which it has been designed to deal and I think it probably will.  However, I appreciate the point made by Deputy Collins that sometimes rushed legislation can lead one into greater difficulties than one is trying to cure.  Even though all of us want to have this matter resolved as quickly as possible, it is important to have some brief interval to enable more full consideration to be given to the terms of the Bill which has come out today.  Subject to that, it should be <Col N="1230" /> clear to everyone concerned that it is the will of Parliament to resolve this problem satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins has quite rightly raised a question with regard to the proposed constitutional amendment and Deputy Haughey, quite rightly, has drawn attention to some of the possible implications involved.  There are serious issues that can arise in regard to this but at the moment we are in the position that we do not know precisely what the Government have in mind in regard to the proposed constitutional amendment.  That may be because the Government have decided for reasons of prudence that that matter should not be gone into in detail while this Bill is being discussed and I appreciate the possible wisdom of that course of action.</P>
      <P>However, although there has been a public announcement of intention to bring forward a constitutional amendment it has the consequence that we are not in a position to discuss it adequately.  It is right that attention should be drawn at this early stage to the fact that a constitutional amendment in this area could have serious implications and consequences which, as Deputy Haughey said, need to be thought about very carefully and maturely.  I do not wish to develop the theme of the possible difficulties involved but, while all of us are anxious to avoid exacerbating anxieties even further, the question raised by Deputy Collins in regard to the implications of the announcement of a constitutional amendment are serious ones.  These questions will be raised in any event, if not in this House then outside it.  They should be raised here to give the Minister for Justice the opportunity to deal with them as fully and adequately as he can at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Conscious as all of us are of the possible difficulties that can arise, nevertheless I am absolutely convinced that given the desire and the political will on all sides to achieve a satisfactory solution it is possible to do so whatever may be the difficulties.  Once the political will is there on all sides to achieve it, it is not beyond the wit and ingenuity of man to achieve a <Col N="1231" /> satisfactory solution to this problem. While there may be difficulties&mdash;I am saying this in an effort to reassure those who are so concerned and who will be even more concerned in future as the implications of this matter are considered more deeply&mdash;we should not lose sight of the fact that all such problems can be solved satisfactorily. The evidence is clear already that the political will to resolve the problems exists on all sides and, given that, they can be solved.</P>
    <P>I should like to underline a point made by Deputy Collins because I am rather afraid the Minister may respond by saying it is an interesting point but is not relevant to this Bill which has a very limited purpose.  The point is in regard to the provisions of the Wealth Tax Act and the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act.  It may not be precisely involved in the problems sought to be solved now but I suggest it goes to the fundamental roots of the whole issue of adoption.  Quite frankly, I was horrified when I discovered that the basic adoption law in this country does not confer the same rights on the adopted child as on the natural legitimate child of a marriage.  I believed, as I think the vast majority of people did, that it did so.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Wealth Tax Act, I had occasion to examine this matter because, as the original provision was drafted, there was a defect which had the effect of conferring certain benefits on children adopted outside of the country while taking them away from those adopted in the country.  It was purely an oversight. In the course of examining this I had occasion to examine the basic Adoption Act and I discovered that it contains a number of sections that, in effect, say that for the purposes of X an adopted child shall have the same rights and privileges as the natural legitimate child of lawfully wedded parents and there was a similar provision for the purposes of Y and Z. As Deputy Collins pointed out, in the Wealth Tax Act there is a provision that for the purposes of that Act an adopted child will be treated in the same way as the natural legitimate <Col N="1232" /> child of lawfully wedded parents.  The question is, why should that be necessary?  As Deputy Collins said, why is it not so that, for all legal purposes if a child is adopted, the child will be treated in exactly the same way as the natural legitimate child of a marriage?  Maybe there is a good reason why it should not be done but I cannot think of one.  It seems to me that the vast majority of people, whether they are adoptive parents or not, believed that when a child was adopted the legal effect was that they were in exactly the same position as the child of the couple concerned but it appears that is not so.  If it were so, it would not have been necessary to put in those provisions in the Acts concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be tempted to respond to this by saying that it is not something that should be dealt with in this Bill which is of limited purpose. If there is substance in the point, I would urge him to cover it in this Bill.  The drafting should not present any problem.  It can be taken from one of the Acts recently passed simply by saying &ldquo;for all purposes&rdquo; instead of for the limited purposes specified in the sections.</P>
    <P>If what I have suggested is true, it is going to the root of the whole basis of legal adoption in this country and it should not be allowed to continue if that is the position.  We are trying to deal with a serious problem arising in regard to adoption but if the other position which I have described is the one that obtains, I suggest that it is at least as serious a problem in relation to adoption and should be cured immediately in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking as a Deputy who has been very close to this subject in recent weeks and who has been in communication with many adoptive parents.  All of us will agree that in matters of adoption once the usual procedures have been completed only the welfare of the child should have precedence in the law of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any other approach to this sensitive question would involve in the <Col N="1233" /> minds of people a departure from justice and human compassion.  It would be intolerable to our community. I am inclined to agree with the suggestion that nothing will permanently allay our anxiety except a firm conclusion in relation to our constitutional position.  This is probably correct because ordinary people do not always understand legal conclusions.  Indeed, some people are inclined to think that legal conclusions are not always right.  Because of the type of anxiety which can be raised in the minds of people, particularly in this sensitive area, this procedure may be necessary.  If it is necessary, I believe that it should be gone through with as little fuss as possible.  I do agree with the remarks made by Deputies Collins and Colley in relation to the rights of adopted children in other areas.  These matters should also be dealt with in this Bill.</P>

The primary purpose of this Bill has been to reassure adoptive parents and adopted children that their position will not be jeopardised by what I might call a legal technicality that is subsequently discovered.  The debate will give the reassurance that these people need and to which they are entitled.  The measures published in the Bill will go a long way towards giving that reassurance but, more importantly, this reassurance will be available by virtue of what Deputy Colley referred to as the expression of common political will to ensure that everything that needs to be done will be done.  We are all determined to ensure that the recent tragedy will never be repeated.  The Bill is an interim measure to deal with the immediate problems created by that particular decision.  I am satisfied that the Bill meets those immediate problems. The Bill also signals that there could be problems in other areas which no particular statute <i>per se</i> could deal with.  That is why reference has been made to amending the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with that point, I <Col N="1234" /> should like to deal with the other points raised by Deputies Collins and Colley in regard to the status of the adopted child.  I had always assumed that the incidents attaching to adoption were the full incidents of the natural child.  I was surprised by a suggestion in the debate on the Wealth Tax Bill that this might not be so, that the incidents had to be legislated for in every particular situation that might arise.  I will certainly consider that position because adoption should automatically bring with it the full legal status of the natural child.  I have no doubt that it was the intention of the Adoption Act, 1952 to put the adopted child in the same position as the natural child. If that intention has not been fully carried out, this will be an opportunity to remedy the situation.  I agree with Deputy Colley that it is a fundamental matter relating to the whole adoption code.  Again, I am speaking on a subject I have just heard for the first time.  When we look into this matter we may see that our fears are unnecessary.</P>

      <P>If they are valid and real, they will have to be cured.  The Bill deals specifically with the problems created by the Supreme Court decision.  Section 5 of the Bill, which is a far-reaching section, deals with the rights of the child, the rights of the parents and the constitutional position.  Section 5 proposes a matter on which we will have to reach agreement or agree to differ, that is, the respective positions of the child and the child's natural parents. The Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 has been quoted as asserting the primacy of the child in any dispute between parents.  But attention has not been paid to the provisions in section 2 of the Adoption Act, 1974, in which this principle is enunciated again in the context of any proceedings after the making of an adoption order.  Section 2 of the Adoption Act, 1974 reads:</P>
      <P>In any matter, application or proceedings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;before the Board or any Court relating to the arrangements for or the making of an adoption order, the Board or the Court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
      <P>That is the law as it stands.  I gather from some of the views that have been expressed that there are doubts whether that should be the law.  My view is that it expresses the law as it should be, that in considering the respective positions of the child and its natural parents the prime consideration must always be the welfare of the child.  This consideration will always have to remain paramount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The court can actually dispense with the consent if the consent is not forthcoming.  That is provided for in section 3 of the Adoption Act, 1974.  One of the matters which had to be reformed at that time was the situation where an adoption order could not be made because a consent would not be given, and you had a situation where children were being placed in homes and there was a long spell of uncertainty where a mother could not or would not make up her mind.  This was very bad for the adoptive parents and for the mother because she was <Col N="1236" /> in a state of uncertainty and it was bad for the child.  Power was taken in the Adoption Act, 1974 to dispense with the consent if the court so decided. That is an area in which the child can be taken where there is no consent.  This question may have to be debated again in the context of the constitutional amendment, but the point I was making was that in regard to section 5 of this Bill power is taken in that Bill to preclude the court from declaring an order invalid provided the court is satisfied that it would not be in the best interests of the child and that it would be proper having regard to those interests and to the rights under the Constitution of all persons concerned not to make such declaration.  In this legislation we want to reassure adoptive parents and children that their position, status and relationships will not be disturbed.  The only way in which that can be reassured is by providing a limit at some stage to the power of a person to intervene to upset those relationships.  Section 5 goes so far as to prevent the court declaring invalid an adoption order that might have been made illegally or that might have been made improperly if the court decided 3, 4 or 5 years afterwards that the interests of the child require that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is generally accepted and if this section is effective it will close off any loopholes for upsetting the relationship at a subsequent time.  But it cannot deny people their rights to challenge what is being done in the courts or here on constitutional grounds because that in itself would be unconstitutional.  That is why the section also says that the court must have regard to the rights under the Constitution of all persons concerned.  To make the assurance that we have given here totally absolute, we will have to examine the constitutional position possibly in relation to making the firm decision in that situation as to what rights are to be considered&mdash;the rights of the child or what used to be the constitutional rights of the natural parents. <Col N="1237" /> In that debate if we are to implement the principle which we all agree is the right one, we will have to decide on the primacy of the child.  There may be other measures to be dealt with in the constitutional amendment&mdash;the validity of the 1952 Act.  It would be as well to clear up any doubts that people might have about the constitutionality of the functions of the Adoption Board.  This is not, strictly speaking, relevant to this debate.  I mentioned it to say that the exact scope and specific details of the constitutional amendment have yet to be decided upon and spelled out. They will be before this House by way of a Bill and that will afford an opportunity to debate the question of the primacy and paramount rights of the child and other questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the details of the proposed constitutional amendment have not yet been worked out but can we take it that it would not be the intention of the Government to bring in a provision which will have the effect of preventing the mother of an illegitimate child holding on to that child if she wanted to?  In other words, it would be envisaged that she could continue to do that before the adoption order was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  We have to have regard to what we have already provided for in section 3 of the Adoption Act, 1974 which does envisage a situation where a mother is not giving her consent.  In that situation we decided that the court should be entitled to intervene to end this awful uncertainty for the mother, the adoptive parents and for the child. Subject to that I would say, yes to Deputy Colley's question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <P>To make it absolutely clear from this side of the House and from the reassurance point of view, once the adoption order is made we will go along with any amendment, constitutional or anything else that the Minister wishes to make after the adoption order is made so that in so far as adoptive parents are concerned now we are totally with the Minister in the reassurances that have been given.  We may have to discuss with the Minister the situation in regard to the natural fundamental rights of the parents before adoption orders are made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that point has been clarified.  That is common case between us.  I would like to thank Members for their contributions on this debate.  I would like to reiterate two points made by Deputy Collins, one of which is, to draw attention to the very successful operation of the Adoption Acts up to now.  Over 23,000 happy and successful adoptions have been effected under these Acts. We must not lose sight of the fact that our adoption code has worked well and effectively and that is important to realise.  People who seek radical changes are not justified in seeking them.  The record does not support them.  The second point is in relation to the expression of common political will to ensure that the hardship which arose in the previous case will never be repeated, and I assure the public that that will is present and will be translated into effective legislation and, if necessary, constitutional action.  The major steps in doing that are being taken under this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned I indicated that I divided our bloodstock breeding industry into three sections, production, selling and the racing side and I wanted to deal with the situation of the National Stud first of all in regard to production of our bloodstock.</P>
      <P>The Survey Team on the Horse Breeding Industry made a number of specific recommendations on the National Stud.  They made seven recommendations about the activities of the National Stud.  The first recommendation is that there should be at least one prestige stallion standing at the National Stud.  Secondly, the National Stud should be developed as a show place for Irish horses and Irish farming practices generally. Thirdly, the National Stud should run training courses for stud grooms and stud managers.  Fourthly, there should be more contact between the National Stud and breeders generally and an annual field day is suggested as a means towards that end.  Fifthly, the manager of the National Stud should be enabled to travel abroad in the off season to keep abreast of the latest techniques and practices. Sixthly, the National Stud should maintain close contact with international racing and breeding and a representative should attend all classic races in Ireland, England and France.  Seventhly, the management of the board of the National Stud should be changed.  They went on to indicate the manner in which the board should be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must all agree that all these recommendations have not been carried out.  The premier recommendation that at least one prestige stallion should always be standing at the National Stud is very important.  It has not been adhered to.  The board of the National Stud should immediately prepare themselves to implement that recommendation.  I would have hoped one of the principal reasons for bringing in this legislation now, increasing the capital of the National Stud and increasing their borrowing powers, would be to enable the board to carry out that recommendation. <Col N="1240" /> I was very disappointed the Minister did not indicate in his remarks that was one of the objectives of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The second recommendation is that the National Stud should be developed as a show place for Irish horses and Irish farming practices generally.  I do not think we could accept either that that recommendation has been carried out.  The third recommendation is that the National Stud should run training courses for grooms and managers. Here we can pay tribute to the management of the National Stud. Over the past few years they have actively pursued a policy of helping out with training in different areas. They have undertaken courses for stud managers and grooms and so on.  They have attempted to give a service in this area.  My only complaint in that regard is that they have not gone far enough and they have not undertaken this educational training function as comprehensively and on as wide a basis as the situation demands.  I would very strongly urge the board to expand their activities in that direction.</P>
    <P>The National Stud can be of enormous value in the dissemination of technical information of even traditional knowledge and of good practices.  One would like to visualise a situation in which the National Stud would be a showpiece to which everybody interested in the Irish horse would come at some stage of the year for a course, or lectures, or seminars, or something of that nature.  The board have the right outlook in this regard.  I would urge them to be a lot more imaginative and a lot more comprehensive in their approach.</P>
    <P>Closely allied to that suggestion is the fourth recommendation of the survey team that the National Stud and breeders generally should have more contact and that there should be an annual field day.  It is axiomatic that the National Stud should be the focus, the centre, the place to which breeders would come for information and where annual field days would be held.  The Agricultural Institute have done marvellous work in that regard. They have adopted the annual field day and seminar technique as an <Col N="1241" /> essential part of their operations.  The National Stud should do the same.</P>
    <P>The fifth recommendation is that the manager of the National Stud should be enabled to travel abroad in the off season to keep abreast of the latest techniques and practices.  Of course, that is absolute commonsense.  Later on I want to say a bit more about the status of the manager.  I am not sure to what extent that recommendation has been adhered to.  I would hope that if it has not, it will be fully adhered to in the future and that not alone the manager but other members of the staff will be given the fullest possible facilities to travel and find out what is going on in other centres and to make sure our National Stud is on a par with any similar institution anywhere in the world.  Our National Stud should be a leading centre in all the disciplines attached to the horse industry.</P>
    <P>The sixth recommendation is that the National Stud should maintain close contact with international racing and breeding and that a representative of the stud should attend all classic races in Ireland, England and France.  To some extent that is carried out, but there is scope for considerable expansion.  I would hope all members of the board of the National Stud would regard it as their duty to be constant attenders at all race meetings and certainly the classic races in this country, and that to the greatest possible extent they would make sure the board and the management would be represented at leading races in England, France and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Bloodstock breeding and racing are now very much international activities. To a large extent this country, Britain, France and the United States are more or less a common market so far as bloodstock and racing are concerned. It is absolutely essential that every member of the board and the management should be fully informed on everything that is going on because, in the area of bloodstock breeding and racing, the situation changes from year to year.  It is an annual business.  Our National Stud should be fully informed and right up <Col N="1242" /> to date on what is happening two-year olds and three-year olds every year, and on what lines are coming up and what lines are going down, and so on.</P>
    <P>The seventh recommendation is that the board of the National Stud should be changed along certain lines. My view is that the membership of the board is too small.  I do not think anyone would wish to see a large, unwieldy and, to that extent, inefficient board of directors.  Five is much too small a figure.  The board of the National Stud should be able to represent totally all the interests in this area.  It is impossible to do that with a board of five.  When the Minister was bringing in this legislation and making a change it was absolutely idiotic that he should have repeated the original provision that the membership of the board shall be not less than three or more than five.</P>
    <P>I suggest a board of seven or perhaps nine members is essential if they are to perform their functions adequately.  The board should represent all the different interests in the bloodstock breeding world.  They should be men of experience and judgment, men of standing and status, people respected for their knowledge and for their position in the bloodstock breeding world.  I believe a board of reasonably extended membership is essential.  Such a board doing their job properly would be fully involved in the policy of the National Stud, would have from time to time to take decisions as to what stallions should be bought or sold, and the wider the range of judgment and knowledge you could have in these decisions by the board the better.  I am, therefore, going to table an amendment suggesting that the number of directors should be at least nine.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is that I hope the Minister, whether himself or the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, will appoint people to the board who will be useful members of the board who will not be appointed for political or other reasons but will be appointed because of their knowledge, their qualities and their standing in the industry, <Col N="1243" /> men well equipped to be worthwhile and valuable members of the board.  That is vitally important and I hope the Minister will not succumb to the temptation to appoint people who would be interested only in membership of the board as a personal status symbol.  It would be disastrous if the Minister were to succumb to any temptation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope not.  I shall not say any more about the production side of things.  A great deal could be said about the production of our bloodstock and the methods, techniques, research and information so essential to that production but that sort of discussion should properly take place on another occasion.  The only thing I want to say about it is that the National Stud should not regard itself in any way as a remote, decorative institution, a place to which tourists can go and have a look around, a place to which distinguished visitors can be brought when the Department of Foreign Affairs cannot think of anywhere else to bring them. I would like the board of directors and the responsible Minister to look upon the National Stud as a driving force, a centre of activity, an example for the whole bloodstock breeding industry. It is not just a public monument and not just a nice national tourist centre.  It should be looked upon as a real, live, active, driving force in every matter connected with the bloodstock breeding industry and, indeed, with the horse industry generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no good producing good bloodstock if you cannot sell it.  This raises a very difficult and, indeed, almost an emotional question at the moment. We have had the unfortunate development where the attempt to provide one sales centre for Irish bloodstock unfortunately went awry and we now have two sales centres.  We have a sales complex in Ballsbridge and another at Kill, both excellently designed and very well built.  I am afraid I must say the obligations of the Government of the day, the Minister for <Col N="1244" /> Agriculture and Fisheries, or the Minister for Lands, or whoever should have undertaken responsibility, were not discharged fully in this regard.  This situation was allowed to develop.  It needed some <i>deus ex machina</i> to step in and say: &ldquo;We were going to have only one sales complex&rdquo;, because that was all the country could sustain and the Government were the final arbiters and, if all the different interests involved could not agree, then the Government should have taken the decision.  That should have been done by the Government.  It was not done and it is now too late.</P>
    <P>We have two complexes and I do not know whether, even at this late hour, anything can be done to resolve the situation.  It is a vital matter to put our bloodstock on display in the best possible circumstances, mobilising the best possible selling resources we can and getting the best possible price, particularly for the small farmer breeder.  As I say, I do not know whether at this late hour some rationalisation can be achieved. According to some people, the new selling complex should have been sited at the National Stud.  It is too late to do that now.  However, in the general context of this legislation I mention the fact that this is an outstanding problem which has not been resolved.</P>
    <P>The third aspect of our bloodstock breeding industry is racing and everything indicates and dictates that we should have a good, sound racing industry.  That is important from the point of view of breeding and from the point of view of the farming community. It is important from the point of view of our tourist industry and, indeed, important from every aspect at which one can look at it. The time has come when something should be done about racing.  I am driven to that conclusion by a report published in Britain in 1968.  It is not a Government report.  It is a report made by a committee of inquiry set up in Britain by the joint turf authorities.  It reported to these two bodies, not to the Government, and so the report cannot be dismissed on the basis that it was a Government <Col N="1245" /> interfering with private interests and with matters which should be the concern of private individuals.  It was a report by racing itself, as it were, to the bodies in control of racing and the important recommendation it made was that a new statutory authority should be established to control and develop the racing industry. It went on to outline how that authority should be constituted and what its functions should be.  The important thing is that the Jockey Club and the National Hunt Committee in Britain received that report from a committee set up by themselves, recommending that a new statutory authority should be established to control and develop the racing industry. Is that, I wonder, something we should consider here?  It is very important that racing should be developed and tailored to meet modern conditions and circumstances. Is it any longer valid that this important industry, racing, should be controlled by a small, exclusive, self-perpetuating club, which is the situation at present?  Is that type of body capable of meeting the challenges of today or should some new type of organisation be instituted? The National Hunt Committee have undoubtedly given great service down the years.  They have succeeded in establishing very high standards of integrity in Irish racing, and one must acknowledge that they have carried out their functions in that way.  But times change; circumstances change, and we are living in a very keen, competitive modern world.  Racing has to meet many new problems, new challenges. Should we consider some new way of controlling and developing our racing industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not specifically. Anyway, I shall not delay very much longer on it.  I just want to pose again <Col N="1246" /> this question to the Minister, because it is one for him as Minister for Finance: should the racing industry continue to be controlled and administered by, as I say, an exclusive, self-perpetuating club, as it has been for well over a century now?  Those are some of the things I wanted to say about the bloodstock breeding industry in general, and with your kind permission, I will now turn to the contents of the legislation itself.</P>
      <P>I have already mentioned the question of the constitution of the board of directors and I ask the Minister to consider favourably an amendment which I intend to put down increasing the maximum number of directors to nine, because I think that is important. Allied closely to the question of the constitution of the board of directors is the question of the management structure of the National Stud.  At present there is a very loose, old fashioned structure of management and control.  There is a board of directors and under the board of directors is a stud manager.  We are very fortunate indeed in that the present stud manager is probably the best man for that job that could be found today in Britain or Ireland or, indeed, the United States.  However, is the structure of management correct?  Is there a case for making him a managing director with a structure of management under him or should he not at least be a chief executive?  The Minister in this Bill proposes to bring the manager of the National Stud within the ambit of the general provisions which are now applied to all semi-State bodies.  His remuneration and so on will be subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.  As my colleague, Deputy Colley, pointed out, this practice is now being brought in for all State bodies, and I suppose it follows from the Devlin Report.  The Devlin Report recommends that, as far as the remuneration of the chief executive is concerned, the National Stud should rank with Ceimicí Teoranta, the Pigs and Bacon Commission, CBF, the Racing Board and An Foras Forbartha.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I could quarrel very <Col N="1247" /> much with that.  The only suggestion I want to make is that if the chief officer of the National Stud is to be brought within these provisions, then he should be given the same status as the chief officer of these other bodies with which the National Stud will now be grouped.  It seems reasonable that he should be either a general manager or a chief executive, but my own personal wish is that he would be managing director.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm here to mention to the Minister something that I believe has taken place since the Devlin Report was published, that is, that there is this absurd situation now, because of the provisions we have here in section 4, that in the case of many State organisations, the remuneration of the chief executive is controlled at a certain level, whereas the remuneration of persons working under him is not controlled.  Very often there are in these State companies persons who are under the chief executive earning, and rightly so, salaries which are considerably in excess of the levels stipulated in the Devlin Report.  That is just by way of general comment.</P>
    <P>In the context also I would like to say a word about the annual report of the National Stud.  I would not for a moment suggest that the National Stud should embark on the sort of status-seeking that other State-sponsored bodies go in for in producing the most elaborate, glossy annual reports, which very often perform more the function of gratification for the chief executive of the particular body rather than informing the general public.  However, I think the National Stud errs in the other direction.  The type of annual report which the National Stud have been producing for many years is totally inadequate, and certainly one would like to see much more statistical information contained in it.  It would be of very great interest and value to members of the horse industry throughout the country if the annual report could become an informative statistical record. Certainly it should give much more detailed statistics of the performance <Col N="1248" /> of the stallions in the stud, but it could also meet a very big gap at present by serving as an annual year book for the bloodstock industry generally.</P>
    <P>We used have a publication known as <i>The Irish Horse</i> which could be sent all over the world.  That publication gave very valuable information and statistics concerning our bloodstock industry.  It has ceased publication, probably for commercial reasons, but the National Stud in their annual report should give a lot more information which could become a very valuable guideline for the bloodstock breeding industry generally.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask a question about the farm accounts and the running of the farm of the National Stud. I should like to make it clear that I believe the first duty of the National Stud is to run a first class top level bloodstock breeding centre.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the statement which was issued by the Government Information Services on 29th April, 1976, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, the improvement of the national route linking Waterford/New Ross/Rosslare was one of the projects approved for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund.  In line with the fund regulation, this project was grouped with others to form a global application to the fund and assistance has been committed globally for all the projects in the application.  Thus the fund has not specified an individual aid figure for this project.  Fund assistance in respect of all projects is paid to the Exchequer and is used to increase the total resources available for development purposes, thus contributing to the financing of new investment in the areas of greatest need.  Any newspaper reports to which the Deputy refers are correct, therefore, only in so far as the project in question has been approved for regional fund assistance.</P>

      <P>I am saying that that is partly correct.  It is only fair to say that last year Wexford County Council got £218,000 for that road and this year they got £285,000 for it. Part of the fund can be used for that road but it does not start schemes.  A lot of people, including newspapers, get the impression that this fund money is for the purpose of starting new schemes.  It is only given where schemes are undertaken and can be used as portion of the cost of the scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite correct.  It is specifically laid down by the fund that they cannot get a specific sum for this or any other job from the fund but it is true that Wexford County Council have got not an ordinary Road Fund grant but an extraordinary Road Fund grant of £285,000 for this road this year.  They got £218,000 last year and Kilkenny County Council for the same road got £30,000 last year.  The Deputy is partly correct.  He is saying that the newspaper reports are incorrect in that they say the money was allocated for that road and if that is what he is saying he is correct.</P>

If £285,000 has been given this year and somebody wants to say that some of that comes from the European Fund he is perfectly entitled to do so.  In fact, the Minister for Finance on 29th April issued a statement about the whole thing.  The extraordinary thing about it is that <Col N="1251" /> while everybody seemed to see the rather misleading items of news they did not seem to see this notification sent out by the Minister for Finance which was a far larger notice.</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne reminds me of the farmer who left £100 in silver in a bank and ten years later would not take notes because he said he wanted back the silver he left in.  It does not matter how the money is made up, Wexford County Council got £285,000 for that road this year. If somebody wants to say that part of it is made up of European Fund money he is entitled to do so but it has not been specifically allocated; it goes into the Central Fund and it is allocated all around.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned the debate on this Bill for Question Time I was raising a question on the running of the farmland of the National Stud.  I should like to emphasise that the stud purposes must take priority; the entity is a stud.  That does not mean that the farm should not be run as efficiently and as profitably as possible.  There are 850 acres of good County Kildare land there. Even allowing for the fact that the stud and the breeding side must take total and complete priority, I still think we should get a better return from those 850 acres than the accounts disclosed over the last few years.  I am not making any carping criticism in that regard.  I would like the board of directors to devote perhaps increasing attention to that aspect and to ensure that the farmland of the stud makes the maximum contribution to the finances of the stud which can be used for the benefit of the bloodstock industry subsequently.</P>
      <P>In this report the chairman of the stud mentioned the danger that the Kildare by-pass might go through the lands of the national stud.  I would like very urgently to direct the attention of the Minister to that matter.  I hope no such proposal will be proceeded with.  The National Stud is an important national asset and should not under any circumstances be interfered with in that way.  It may well be that the board of directors might not have the power and the influence with the Kildare County Council to protect their vital interests.  I hope, if it comes to an issue, that the Minister for Finance preferably, or the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, whoever regards himself as being involved, will stand up stoutly for the interests of the National Stud and the national interest.  I am certain it should be possible to plan the road system in Kildare without interfering in any way with this very valuable property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> The Minister might be more interested in my next point than in anything I have said so far.  I want to ask him about the financial provision in this legislation.  First, very rightly, he is increasing the share capital from the existing level of £2 million to £5 million.  He is also increasing the borrowing power of the company from £200,000 to £500,000.  I suggest that there is a disproportion there.  When he is bringing in this legislation why does he continue to restrict the borrowing powers of the company in this way?  Would he not think that a company with a share capital of somewhere in the region of £5 million should also have borrowing powers on somewhat the same level? I suggest that if he is increasing the share capital to £5 million he should increase the borrowing powers to the same amount.  In this field of the bloodstock industry, £500,000 is a relatively minor sum today.  I intend to put down an amendment to that effect and hope the Minister will consider it favourably.  I cannot understand why he should restrict the company in this way.</P>
    <P>Apart from the share capital aspect, the bloodstock and other assets of the company, the value of 850 acres of land in Kildare would be security for a very considerable sum of money indeed.  I would also like to ask the Minister if the increasing of the share capital to £5 million is simply a legislative exercise, or is it his intention to take up these shares and provide his money for the company? There is a very important principle involved here.</P>
    <P>There are two different approaches to the finances of the National Stud. One school of thought suggests that the National Stud should become commercial in its activities and should seek to build up its own resources and its own funds and to have these at its disposal for the purchase of suitable stallions when they come on the market.  Another school of thought says that the primary purpose of the National Stud is to provide services for the small breeder at very reasonable costs.  In other words, the company should not be too commercially oriented in its outlook.  The way in <Col N="1258" /> which both schools of thought could be reconciled would be if the Minister were to provide, in the form of capital and borrowing powers, all the resources the company might need to enable them to buy one or more prestige stallions.  They could do that out of capital and at the same time maintain the service at a reasonable level for the smaller breeders.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us what exactly he has in mind on this. I hope he says that he proposes to take up the additional shares which this Bill will make possible because it would have a very important bearing on the activities on the National Stud in future.  We all want to see the National Stud maintaining the role of friend and helper of the small breeder. At the same time many of us would like to see the stud having at least one top-class international prestige stallion in their stable.</P>
    <P>These are the main matters I wish to raise on the Second Stage.  I hope the Minister will not regard the measure for which he has ministerial responsibility as simply a routine, technical ministerial chore that he has to dispense with as quickly as possible. I hope he would recognise that in the National Stud he is responsible for something that can be of very great importance and significance in regard to one of our fundamental interests, the bloodstock breeding industry.  I also hope he will avail of the opportunity of this legislation to direct the activities and the policies of the National Stud to a new and much wider area and that he will encourage the directors of the National Stud to regard themselves as the natural centre of progress and development in this field.</P>
    <P>There are other points about this legislation which I will make when we come to the Committee Stage.  At this stage, I conclude by welcoming the legislation.  In so far as I have been critical of it, I hope my criticism will be accepted in a <i>bona fide</i> way.  I regard the National Stud as a very important national institution.  I hope that the introduction of this legislation will be an important step forward in the history of the development of the stud</P>
    <Col N="1259" />
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be brief because my colleague, Deputy Haughey, has given a full race over the full course and a very fine performance.  However, there are a few points I would like to make with regard to the operations of the National Stud.  As we all know, the National Stud provides a service at reasonable cost, in particular, for the small breeders and we hope it will continue to do so.  It is the duty of the National Stud to have top-class sires available and, as Deputy Haughey said, at least one prestige sire.</P>
      <P>It is some considerable time since we had such a horse.  It is time to provide one again.  I know Sallust and African Sky are top class ones but we really need some top classic winners or international winners in this stud as well.  They should be made available to breeders at a reasonable cost since stud fees are prohibitive when they are in private ownership.</P>
      <P>As well as providing this type of animal the National Stud has a duty to the small breeder to provide national hunt sires.  As far as I know the National Stud has never concentrated on the national hunt sector of breeding.  It has, in the main, purchased horses who have a flat racing background of breeding and in due time if those horses were not successful in breeding flat racers they reverted to national hunt breeding. There are some very fine strains in horse breeding in the national hunt field and progeny of some very fine sires now dead which could be purchased by the National Stud.  Some of the progeny of horses like Vulgan, Fortina or Cottage and such well established strains could be of benefit in breeding.  The National Stud should concentrate on this side of the breeding business more than they have been doing.  Those sires should be made available to the small breeders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people who are not involved in breeding who would be involved if it was not such a costly business.  I am not criticising stud fees but there is another aspect of breeding which is putting it outside the bounds of possibility for small breeders.  When a breeder sends a mare to the <Col N="1260" /> National Stud her stay there is about eight to ten weeks.  It will cost £25 per week to keep that mare at the National Stud, which amounts to £250 for ten weeks.  The fee for Linacre is £100 and haulage will add £60 to £80 to the bill if the mare comes from Munster or a reasonable distance from the National Stud.  The fee of £250 for the mare's keep is definitely prohibitive to small breeders.</P>
    <P>The National Stud have 850 acres of land so it is very hard to understand the mechanics of this costing, particularly when one compares the cost of keeping a mare at a small private stud.  There are two national hunt sires whose fees are over £200. One is Minalek.  If a mare is sent to a horse like Minalek, which is privately owned somewhere in the south of Ireland, the owner of the mare is assured of a winner.  As far as I know the cost of keeping that mare at the stud is only £5 per week.  There is something definitely wrong if it costs £25 a week to keep a mare in the National Stud, which is run by the State and it only costs £5 a week if you go to a top class national hunt sire like Minalek.  The Minister should take this matter up with the National Stud when we are providing this extra share capital and borrowing power for them.  Since the National Stud have 850 acres of land it could be utilised to bring down this cost.  If the private man can keep mares for £5 a week surely the National Stud can do it?</P>
    <P>I should like to know if it costs £25 a week to keep a mare at the National Stud for ten weeks is it necessary to have the horse standing at the stud in Kildare?  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have a system where they lease thoroughbred sires to farmers and small stud owners, not particularly bloodstock owners, throughout the country to breed hunter type horses.  They have been doing this very successfully.  I believe it is quite feasible for the National Stud, if they acquire this type of sire, to lease them throughout the country. One or two could be leased in Munster and the same in Connacht. This would cut down the distance and also the cost of keep.  This would be most helpful to the small breeder, <Col N="1261" /> racing and our sales activities in the racing world, which is now over £6 million.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the National Stud should not engage in this type of boarding out because the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have been doing it in relation to non-thoroughbred horses for a number of years.  I would like the Minister to refer this matter to the board of the National Stud.  This will make a horse available far more easily to breeders and it will cut down the costs I have referred to, costs of possibly £250.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey dealt with the sales situation and racing.  It is regrettable that we have now two sales complexes instead of one which operated very successfully at Ballsbridge. The Ballsbridge sale was famous throughout the world and attracted a large number of purchasers every year.  They were very successful.  We have now a second one which appears to be competing with places such as Newmarket or Doncaster which continue to thrive in England. It would have been more successful, particularly from the point of view of the breeders, if we had only one centre that was run properly without any clash between interests, as is the position now.</P>
    <P>Racing is the shop window of the whole industry; breeding and sales will stand or fall on whether our racing activities are successful in our own country and internationally.  All of us know what it means for our breeding industry if a racehorse trained in this country wins an international classic for three-or four-yearolds. All of us benefit from such a success.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey referred to the system of stewarding and to the people who are responsible for the day-to-day running of our race meetings. The Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Committee control the day-to-day running and the way racing is conducted on the various tracks.  I share the view of Deputy Haughey that it is time to look at the way the stewards are appointed because it appears that the same family <Col N="1262" /> names recur year after year as stewards of these bodies.  There are occasions when some of the decisions made are questionable and perhaps I might give an example.</P>
    <P>Recently in the west a horse that was second favourite at nine to four won a race on which there was a stewards' inquiry.  Cameras were not available on the course on that day and the stewards made a decision based on their inspection of the track, particularly at one fence, and on the hoof marks before that fence.  They did not seem to consider the fact that two other races were run on that track on that day.  They decided to disqualify the winner.  I am sure the owner and trainer would have got over that but we must also consider the punters who are an important part of the racing world and who suffered a loss in this case.  As a result of the stewards' inquiry the second horse was placed first and the bookmakers paid out on that.</P>
    <P>The matter was referred to the stewards proper of the Irish National Hunt Committee.  They reversed the decision of the local stewards and maintained that the original winner was the correct one but the unfortunate people who backed the original winner will not be able to get any compensation.  This procedure must be changed.  If no winner was declared when the matter was referred to the stewards it should have remained that way until a final decision was made. An injustice took place and this could happen again.  The Minister should consider this matter with a view to correcting the procedure.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise the role the National Stud should continue to play with regard to the small breeder in making horses available to him.  In this connection I am referring to the small and medium-sized farmer who would like to get involved in thoroughbred breeding if it could be done at a reasonable cost.  The leasing or boarding-out of not very highly priced sires should be within the capability of the National Stud, as is the situation with regard to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in the non-thoroughbred breeding sector.  This <Col N="1263" /> would cut down the cost and it would be helpful to small breeders and to others who wish to enter this part of the industry.  The National Stud would be doing a good job if they embarked on such a course.  I am not talking about leasing horses of the calibre of Nijinsky; I am referring to lower priced sires with a proper breeding background, that could be traced back to successful sires and that, in turn, become successful when put to stud.  I would ask the Minister to ask the stud to develop such a scheme.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill because of the tremendous importance of the National Stud to the economy.  Anyone who has had the opportunity of visiting the National Stud in recent years will appreciate the valuable part it has played.  It has become not only an economic proposition but it is a place tourists can visit and see the tremendous strides that have been made in a short time.  Heretofore it was just a place on the map, referred to in passing through Kildare town.  Nowadays the gates are wide open and people from this country and elsewhere are welcome to visit it.  During the summer months the manager arranges that twice daily the sires are taken out and shown to the visitors who are given all information regarding the horses.</P>
      <P>At one time it was popular to breed horses at the stud and to have them trained and raced in the name of our President.  This practice has lapsed and it is a pity because on occasions we have extremely good yearlings that are offered for sale.  The fact that they are not kept, trained and raced by the stud, leads to the possibility that they may go into foreign hands.  Consequently, the impact of their future success can be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is an extremely costly business now to breed, train and race horses but the Minister for Finance is aware of the amount of revenue obtained from the industry.  Anything that can be done to improve the industry and to increase the amount of revenue coming into the country from the bloodstock industry must receive <Col N="1264" /> all the help and encouragement the Departments of Finance and Agriculture and Fisheries can give.</P>
    <P>Many people think the National Stud should be under the aegis of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. The Minister for Finance is responsible for providing the money and, consequently, he must be the major shareholder.  At the same time, because of the diversification of activities at the National Stud it would be in the interest of agriculture and bloodstock if the industry were under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear the remarks of the last speaker with regard to some of the stewards.  He regretted that the same names were appearing year after year.  Anyone who knows anything about this matter is aware that these people are dedicated to this service and is aware of the amount of time and energy they give to it.  I would not wish to change the position of a man who was giving a good service regardless of whether his name was cropping up again and again.  There are quite a number of people very deeply involved in the bloodstock industry whose names could be added to those already holding office and who would, I am sure, give good service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the people already there have treble-barrelled names.  I do not mind whether they are single, double or treble, so long as they are involved in the business and know their job.  They would be entitled to be heard at the round table whenever the occasion might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say how much I welcome this Bill but I have one reservation.  It is a pity to exclude a director from seeking or obtaining nominations to the Seanad or to this House but since that exclusion is incorporated in the Bill there must be very good reasons for it.  Why not make them a nominated body?  The Bloodstock Breeders' Association have <Col N="1265" /> nomination.  The National Stud could possibly follow suit.  It is an extremely important industry and any voice that can be heard in its favour or any representations that can be made would be in the best interest not only of bloodstock but of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appreciative of the manner in which the House has received the Bill but a number of criticisms were offered during the course of the debate which I will have occasion to rebut.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Malone says about the desirability of giving primary responsibility for the National Stud to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  That was the position in 1945 and 1953 when legislation in relation to the National Stud was first promoted.  When I arrived at the Department of Finance I found an anachronistic mess of responsibility.  Not only had the Minister for Finance responsibility, as he must have, for financial management and economic planning but his mandate also extended from support for the theatres to horse breeding, from sail training to sugar production, from rescue services for manufacturing industry to the revival of Irish.  I regard that as nonsense because no Minister for Finance or no Finance Department in any State could give sufficient attention to these multitudinous interests in addition to managing financial matters and economic planning.  Of course, Ministers for Finance, notwithstanding any image they may have to the contrary, are human beings with individual preferences and dislikes.  It is wrong that any Minister should insist upon drawing within his own ambit spheres in which he has a particular interest which on account of that might well receive preferential treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is, above all, a central agent who must ensure neutrality between conflicting demands being made on the public purse.  Therefore, he should deny himself the privilege which he can exert of dragging within his own Department <Col N="1266" /> spheres of responsibility which should be left elsewhere.  One of those was certainly the National Stud.  If you look through the legislation for 1945, 1953 and 1969 you will see that the central figure in relation to the National Stud was the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  Deputy Haughey had the temerity to chastise me for what he said was a certain responsibility for leaving the National Stud in a limbo situation.  It is in a limbo situation since 1969 when Deputy Haughey dragged it into that situation.  Before that it was the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  Even since 1969, 90 to 95 per cent of all the consultations and contacts between the National Stud and Government were with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries because the Ministry of Finance does not purport to have expertise in the field of bloodstock management and the horse-breeding industry generally.  Responsibility for the National Stud should not have been taken from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  That is where it naturally belongs and it is being returned to that Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we pass this Bill.  Legally, the situation has not changed.  It is still on the Statute Book and it will be seen that the central figure in this situation is the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries rather than the stallions and the mares which must be central to the National Stud. After that, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is the next most important element in the productive, generative and management process. What happened was that a decision on an administrative level was taken to grab the National Stud and drag it into the Department of Finance. Therefore, we have had this dual management which I regard as most unsatisfactory. As we are trying to rectify the situation, I decided that the right thing to do was to wait until we had occasion to introduce legislation in relation to the National Stud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As soon as this Bill is through both <Col N="1267" /> Houses of Parliament and is signed by the President we will get back to what I have no doubt Dáil Éireann originally intended, that was that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries should be primarily involved in the management and development of the National Stud.  The Minister for Finance will in the future as in the past in relation to this company and other companies be the shareholder. That is because the Minister for Finance must hold the shares on behalf of the Irish public and such powers as are reserved to the Minister for Finance or the Minister for the Public Service in this legislation as it is now being amended are similar to those which are reserved to the Minister for Finance and to the Minister for the Public Service in relation to other State bodies.  That is the only further involvement on what I might call a central or national level as far as the Department of Finance are concerned. What we are doing is recognising that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are in the best position to assist the National Stud in relation to its overall management.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The next Bill of this kind will, as in 1945 and 1953, be handled by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I think the 1969 Bill should have been handled by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries but we had drifted into a situation where for the time being under an administrative arrangement which was never sanctioned by this House the Department of Finance dealt with it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we wanted to tidy up this thing properly.  I will come to that when I am dealing with section 7 of the Bill.  It has been in a limbo and it has been most unsatisfactory. <Col N="1268" /> It could never be justified on any ground related to the best interests of the Irish bloodstock industry.  Deputy Colley asked me to explain the difference between section 5 of this Bill and the previous provisions in relation to the provision of accounts. What we are doing is modernising the provisions in respect of the furnishing of accounts.</P>
      <P>Section 25 of the 1945 Act provided that the company should within 90 days after the end of each accounting year furnish the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries with the balance sheet and so forth.  The differences are in accord with the changes that have taken place in other legislation and Section 5 is now in keeping with sections of a similar kind in relation to the accounts of other State bodies. There is no significant change but the new formulation, as it were, in section 5, is in accordance with that which was recommended by the Comptroller and Auditor General and which we have applied in relation to other semi-State bodies.  It will require that accounts should be kept in a form to be approved by the Minister in question, who will be the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries with the consent of the Minister for Finance. This will ensure that the accounts of the National Stud will be in a form similar to the accounts furnished by other bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional responsibility is imposed on the National Stud by the 1953 Act in relation to the keeping of accounts which are peculiar to the bloodstock industry.  In section 7 which deals with the articles of association of the company changes are being made over those which existed under the 1945 Act.  Substantially they are the same.  The only differences relate to pin-pointing the responsibility which will lie on the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in the future rather than on the Minister for Finance.  In future the articles will provide that the chairman and other directors shall be appointed by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries after consultation with the Minister for Finance instead of, as was provided in the legislation, to be appointed <Col N="1269" /> by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  The other provisions are the same with the exception that no person shall be nominated as an auditor of the company without the approval of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, again after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  It is simply a reversal of the roles of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Finance.  This is the right thing to do and it is in keeping with modern practice in relation to companies where prime responsibility lies on other Ministers, and the only involvement of the Minister for Finance is that he is the holder of the shares in the company, because it is desirable that there should be a common trustee, and the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Public Service must have a central responsibility in relation to remuneration, to standards of keeping accounts and so forth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey mentioned that it was his view that the Government should strive to make Ireland the centre of the bloodstock industry.  He is quite right.  This Government is entirely dedicated to that objective. Nobody could seriously challenge the dedication of this Government to achieving for Ireland a premier place in the bloodstock industry's sun.  That has been the Government's objective and it is in keeping with that objective that the National Stud is being aided in every possible way to achieve that goal.  Deputy Haughey said that he would like to see the National Stud becoming a show piece.  It is a show piece but doubtless it can be made even better.</P>
    <P>A lot of Deputy Haughey's criticisms might have been valid several years ago but in fairness to the existing board and to the manager we should put on record our admiration for the great progress in recent years. The National Stud has been opened up in more ways than one to stimulate the interest and involvement of people who are concerned with the bloodstock industry and they have also excited interest in other people who <Col N="1270" /> previously had not a direct involvement in this industry.  It is an historical accident that the National Stud has responsibility for the Japanese Gardens but this association has in its own way helped to develop an interest in the Irish bloodstock industry.</P>
    <P>One point where Deputy Haughey might have declared interest was when he spoke about a sales complex for the bloodstock industry.  It brought me back to the situation which faced the Government some years ago when there was an insistent and persistent demand that the Government should produce capital for the provision of a new sales complex for the bloodstock industry.  I took the view, as I am glad to say the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Government as a whole did, that the bloodstock industry were in a position to provide the capital necessary for a suitable sales complex without making an imposition on the general body of tax-payers for the provision of such a facility.</P>
    <P>Not only have the Government been proved right, but they have been proved right on the double, because there are now two sales complexes, both of which were financed out of the private sector.  This shows how right we were in forming our view that the industry had the ability to provide a sales complex without making an imposition on the Exchequer. I will not say what my own view is on having one or two sales complexes. Private enterprise made its own assessment of the situation and made its own decisions.  As a result, quite clearly we have been confirmed in the correctness of our opinion that there was no need to involve the taxpayer and the Exchequer in the provision of capital for the facilities which now exist.  They have been provided by private enterprise and I wish both enterprises every success.</P>
    <P>There was some hesitation over the provision in the Bill that the remuneration of the manager should be subject to the approval of the Minister for the Public Service.  I have the greatest admiration for the operations of the National Stud and for the personal contribution the present manager <Col N="1271" /> has made to the progress and success of the National Stud since his appointment.  In all recent legislation on State companies we have provided that the remuneration of the chief executive should be subject to the approval of the Minister primarily responsible, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service. This is in keeping with what is recommended in the Devlin Report.</P>
    <P>It is also in line with the almost universal practice in all continental countries that, if there is to be any discipline in relation to pay at any level, particularly in the public sector and related sectors, there must be some overall agency which compares like with like as far as possible.  It may be suggested it is difficult to find exact parallels.  It is not.  There must be some agency which endeavours to sort out the conflicting interests.</P>
    <P>I trust it will be found that the central control is not offensive and not operating in such a way as to discourage State enterprises or State-related enterprises from engaging the services of the very best available.  We cannot have in any of these concerns, including the National Stud, anybody who is second rate or expect that the best person should receive remuneration which is less than his fair reward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister deal with my point?  Can it happen in a State company that the salary of the chief executive is controlled in this way and salaries of persons under him are not and they sometimes receive more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has happened.  This is a development that I believe is now being brought under control.  I would hope by bringing all within the ambit of the supervision of the Department of the Public Service this kind of thing will not happen in future.  The notion previously existed that people at a certain level were outside central supervision. The result was people outside central supervision lost out.  When rises were given generally over the public <Col N="1272" /> sector, under national wage agreements or otherwise, those outside central control lost out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister misunderstands my point.  It is the operation of central supervision mechanism, as I understand it, that in some cases is bringing about the other situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is not quite so.  It was the non-automatic applicability of rises given to others which led to a situation in which people who were deemed to be outside the other sectors lost out.  I know they may have lost because an embargo was put on at a certain level.  Bringing all within the one discipline will mean the person at the top of the pyramid will rise if there is a raise at the base of the pyramid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in thinking the new mechanism the Minister is putting into operation in all State companies controls the remuneration of the chief executive only, and there is no guarantee that others in the company will not in certain circumstances have more than the chief executive, that they are not controlled by the central supervisory mechanism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, we have the review committee which deals with higher remuneration.  That body will be asked to review the remuneration of people whose office was examined some years ago but, by keeping all within the benign supervision of the Department of the Public Service, we will avoid a number of the anomalies which Deputy Haughey correctly points out arose in the past. They should not have arisen.  They arose because of a subtle distinction drawn in relation to the mechanism for fixing the remuneration of people at different levels in semi-State bodies, and in State bodies as well.  We have seen this apply to the upper levels of the civil service, to parliamentarians and to Ministers of State.  If all are subject to the same kind of discipline we will avoid many of the anomalies which existed in the past.  It is not an easy problem to resolve.  It has taken <Col N="1273" /> time and, I am sure, a great deal of patience on the part of many people. I hope it will be possible to resolve it in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>A number of well-deserved tributes have been paid to the National Stud and their management.  I endorse everything said in that regard.  Deputy Haughey spoke about the speed with which I made my opening statement. He seemed to infer from it that I was less than interested.  I would point out to him that a slow horse never won a race.  This is not the first occasion on which I have been criticised in this House for the speed of my delivery.</P>

      <P>If not in the House, certainly I know some of the hard-pressed recorders of our statements have found difficulty from time to time in keeping up with the speed of my delivery.  If I offended anybody by the speed of my delivery I apologise. I noticed Deputy Haughey was reading the script of my speech at one stage and later on I saw he was listening to what I was saying, from which I assume he was reading it even faster than I was.  He was in the advantageous position of not having to speak as he was reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Deputy Haughey's proposal that the borrowing limit should be raised to £5 million I find myself in serious disagreement with him for a number of reasons.  I suppose the principal one, which is a worthy one, is that past experience does not justify the need for giving borrowing powers in keeping with the capital involved.  We have not received a request from the board of the National Stud for any increase in their borrowing power, which at present is £.2 million.  I thought as we were increasing the capital, and having regard to the changes in money values since the borrowing limit was originally fixed, it would be appropriate to fix it at a limit of £.5 million. The only reason we need borrowing authority at all is that occasion might arise from time to time where the National Stud want to make a certain investment in relation to the purchase of a particular stallion, which <Col N="1274" /> would require temporary financial facilities, but I am satisfied on the basis of previous experience and on the basis of representations the board itself has made to me that in advancing from £.2 million to £.5 million we are making a sufficient improvement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett raised the question of the cost of maintaining a mare in the National Stud and suggested it is five times higher than the charge elsewhere. Now I have said very openly and I trust people will accept honestly &mdash;I think Deputy Haughey will&mdash;that we in the Department of Finance do not pretend to be experts in this field, but I have seen a recent report which says the average cost of maintaining a mare was £20 a week.  This was in March last.  The National Stud is charging £25 a week and it is not very much out of line, therefore, and possibly the £20 mentioned in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> of last March is not extraordinary. Here, again, this is an area of expertise which requires the familiarity and knowledge of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  Where the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is standing at this stage overrides Finance.  If I were as knowledgeable in this particular field as Deputy Haughey is&mdash;I acknowledge that&mdash;I might be able to answer him more specifically, but I can argue, and I do not think anybody can challenge my argument that obviously all this points to the need for this to be in the hands of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, he being the spokesman in this field in this House rather than the Minister for Finance of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to my colleague, I do not think he would keep a donkey for £5 a week these days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You might also have a cup of tea and even a drop of brandy for that.  I must say I was rather surprised at the figure produced and I was wondering who was making money and in what particular activity. I accept what Deputy Haughey says. I think £5 a week is extraordinarily low.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very reasonable, indeed. The cost of keeping a cat or a dog could reach such proportions these days.  With regard to the size of the board, I am sure I can say, and nobody can challenge it, that what matters is its quality and not its size. The interesting thing here is that the board of the National Stud at a maximum of five is working, is known to be working, and the evidence is there that it is working satisfactorily.  I am not a great believer in large boards and large committees.  That is the kind of thing that can produce a camel and the National Stud has no responsibility in that particular sphere in this environment anyway.  I would fear that a very large board could well lead to a situation in which you could have quite a number of people absent from meetings, whereas with a small board the tendency is to have a very high attendance record.  When I see things working I tend to leave them alone. Perhaps that classifies me as a conservative. I hope I am not a conservative either at heart or by inclination but, when I see a body working successfully, I do not naturally jump at any suggestions for change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noted what Deputy Haughey said in relation to the Kildare by-pass. He will appreciate it would be inappropriate for the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to endeavour to exert any influence over planning matters beyond that which is available to the private citizen.  The board will, no doubt&mdash;it has already made its voice heard in this field&mdash;make its impact in regard to any proposal to build a Kildare by-pass.  In this area my own personal view&mdash;it is supported by Deputy Haughey's remarks&mdash;is very much in favour of an improved road across the Curragh and the by-passing of Kildare.  I do not think anyone could seriously challenge the need for this.  One of the worst parts of the road from Dublin to Cork or to Limerick happens to be across the Curragh.  I think nobody would seriously challenge that.  I would also share with Deputy Haughey the hope it would not be necessary to split up the lands of the National Stud in <Col N="1276" /> order to achieve what no reasonable person could oppose.</P>
    <P>I do not regard the Bill as a routine technical exercise which I have to handle.  I have a certain fondness for all the particular areas of responsibility which come under my command, but I must discharge my greater obligation to free the Department of Finance from&mdash;I do not say this offensively and I am sure no one will take it offensively&mdash;the minutiae history has imposed upon it where it finds itself involved in decisions affecting sugar production, potato marketing, the care of the bloodstock industry and so on when there are other people much more competent to give a direct worthwhile contribution in the particular field.</P>

It is an occasion of some disappointment that the farm did not make a greater profit over the years, but I congratulate the present management and the board on the very great improvement they have brought about in recent times in the operation of the farm.  In 1975, we are likely to have a profit figure of about £10,000 from the farm.</P>

It is produced to provide fodder for the stud. The fact that they did not do this successfully without loss over a number of years must be a cause of regret, but the situation has improved and I believe the present management of the farm and the plans for the next five years will ensure there will be a continuing success in this field.  I trust I have dealt with the most significant points raised.</P>

We believe the interests of the bloodstock industry rise above political considerations and those who are really dedicated to this industry allow no political bias when they are making judgments as to what is good or what might be bad for the industry.  That will continue to be our policy.  I am sure we are making the right changes in ensuring that in future the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will virtually be in total control of the National Stud.  This is not minimising in any way the personal interest of any of my predecessors in this area, even though from an administrative point of view one might well fault the switch in administrative responsibility which might have occurred.  We are now putting the matter right and all I can say is that I have been encouraged by the reception my proposals received from those directly involved in the company itself and the bloodstock industry generally.</P>

      <P>At present only £1.7 million of the existing £2 million has been taken up, and what we visualise is that shares would be taken up in accordance with the programmed expansion of the National Stud as the occasion arises but, of course, not until then.  However, there would be no hesitation in taking them up as soon as the need for the expansion of capital actually arises.</P>

      <P>This point is related to my other amendment about borrowing powers.  The Minister should indicate here whether he is prepared to take up shares and provide capital for the National Stud only for permanent investment purposes, in other words, lands and buildings, facilities and so on, or whether he will make money available through the share capital mechanism for the purchase of bloodstock and sires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We certainly would for the purchase of bloodstock and sires.  It would not be a question merely of increasing capital for fixed assets as distinct from bloodstock, which we regard as a fundamental ingredient of the National Stud.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 21, to delete &ldquo;£500,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£5,000,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very simple amendment.  I have already adverted to it in my speech on Second Reading.  I suggested that, as the Minister is making changes, he should bring the situation in regard to borrowing powers more into line with modern practice. In other areas of the legislation he has updated the provisions in regard to the National Stud solely on the basis of bringing them into line with modern practice.  He is not following that principle here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this I want also to make a point about the share capital.  The National Stud should have a prestige stallion, and I would hope that very soon they <Col N="1279" /> will get round to having a really top-class, international, prestige, classic-type stallion.  The amount of money involved these days in the purchase of such a sire is enormous.  It can be £1 million or even £2 million.  Providing that sort of money through share capital might not be the best way from his point of view.  It might be better if he made that money available or if the directors of the National Stud could get that money through borrowing.  If they are doing their business properly, they can finance the purchase of a top-class international sire on a four-year repayment basis.  The modern practice is that a stallion of that quality repays his purchase price inside four years.  I might as well admit here that the reason for that very often is that it is four years before anybody knows whether that stallion is going to be a success or not, and the approach of the modern studs is to have the stallion liquidate his purchase price over a four-year period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Others, too.  In that situation I would like to see the board of directors of the National Stud having the power to borrow £1 million or £2 million to buy such a stallion on the basis that they would regard the purchase of that stallion as a normal commercial transaction.  The management of the stallion would be such that they would repay the borrowing in the four-year period as I have suggested. In that context I would be quite happy to see the Minister providing more share capital for general purposes but the purchase of top-class international sires might possibly be better done through borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also bear in mind&mdash;and I am sure Deputy Colley would agree with me in this from his experience&mdash; that, with the pressures on the Minister for Finance, if the board of directors of the National Stud come to the Minister and seek £1 million or £2 million <Col N="1280" /> for the purchase of a sire, he might have to tell them to take their place in the queue and wait until the following year or the year after, by which time the stallion might not be available. Therefore, it would be preferable from every point of view to have the board in a position, if a suitable sire comes on the market, to borrow the money on a straight-forward commercial basis to buy that horse.  That is why I would like the Minister to consider increasing the borrowing powers to £5 million, so that the share capital and the borrowing powers would be in line, and I think that is in accordance with the best modern commercial practice.  I am sure this is somewhere in the articles of association, that even though the board would have the statutory power to borrow up to £5 million, they would not be able to do so without the Minister's sanction, so he need not have the worry that the situation would get out of control; in other words he would still, on a particular occasion, have to sanction the borrowing the board wished to engage in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is desirable that the Dáil should give such extensive borrowing powers to any semi-State body.  Having regard to the financial position of the stud and the price which might have to be paid for a prestige stallion, I am satisfied that the proposed capital increase will cover the additional cost which might be involved in such purchase.  I do not believe we would be justified in asking for twice the amount, which, in fact, is Deputy Haughey's recommendation, that the capital should be increased to £5 million and that borrowing should be increased from £0.2 million to £5 million, which would be a very substantial increase on the existing borrowing requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that the Board has absolute wisdom in this field, but it is significant that the board itself has not sought any additional borrowing power.  They are quite satisfied with the £0.2 million that they already have and that they have not even used.  I do not think that they have used to the full the borrowing facilities which are available to them, and we are providing quite a significant increase.  If <Col N="1281" /> the board were to be authorised to borrow up to £5 million, it might exercise that power but it would then have to meet very high interest charges on its borrowing.  It must be a cause for some comment and a matter to be watched that the National Stud has not so far paid any dividend on the capital which it has received from the State. To receive capital interest-free is in itself a very generous contribution, particularly when interest rates are running as high as they are today.  I accept the view expressed by Deputy Colley that the National Stud approaching the Minister for Finance looking for an increase in its capital might be asked to take its place in the queue but that happens to be the experience of all organisations and agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be useful to tell them to go out and borrow the money if it is a straightforward commercial purchase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that not make the stallion dearer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It could make the stallion dearer because it would have to be paid for out of borrowed money and, therefore, the financial position of the National Stud would not in any way be relieved by such an enterprise. Supposing the particular judgment was unsuccessful, not due to any lack of expertise or dedication on their part but because of the laws of nature, then they could find themselves saddled with a very considerable debt which would not be generating any ability to repay.  It is much better to keep it on a capital basis.  Having regard to the very considerable expansion of capital and to the considerable increase in their borrowing powers, 150 per cent, we are going a long way to meeting the ordinary operating difficulties which could arise.  If we were wrong in our assessment of the situation I am sure the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would not hesitate to seek the additional borrowing power, and interim arrangements could be made to facilitate the purchase of an animal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> I would think that the probability is&mdash;I am not here to express any firm view&mdash;that if a stallion costing a considerable amount were to stimulate the interest of the National Stud it might be better to have a syndicated purchase rather than an outright purchase by the National Stud.  That may be a desirable thing and it certainly would spread the risk load.  If there was to be a great success the profit would not come entirely to the National Stud; but this is the kind of thing that is likely to happen in relation to future purchases in this area, as it happens generally in the private sector.  One must bear these things in mind.  It would be undesirable that a very large sum of money should be borrowed in relation to the purchase of a particular stallion and as a consequence put the whole viability of the National Stud at risk.  Surely it is better to spread the load.  We are enabling the National Stud to expand their capital and expand their borrowing up to £500,000.  That and other possibilities which are open to them should ensure that the National Stud will be able to make suitable acquisitions in future which will help to improve their own contribution to the Irish bloodstock industry and the reputation of that industry also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the sort of situation that sometimes makes me despair of the legislative process of this House.  The Minister knows perfectly well that what I am saying is unanswerable.  There is no reason why he should not give himself this flexibility. The argument that he can come along later and increase it does not stand up.  Why, if there is such a possibility, should we not legislate for it now?  Why waste the time of this House with the whole gambit of legislation and all that it means just to increase a figure from £500,000 to £5 million or whatever we decide?  I appeal to the Minister not to stick to £500,000 here because it is what is in the Bill.  I am afraid that is what he is doing.  He is inventing all sorts of unrealistic arguments just to defend that figure which is already in the Bill, simply because it is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, and the <Col N="1283" /> Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, will have full control over the borrowing operations of the company and there is no doubt about that.  The company will not be able to borrow a halfpenny without their consent.  All I am asking the Minister to do is to give himself, and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the flexibility to enable the company to borrow if they decide it is desirable they should do so.  I cannot understand why he does not accept this.  It is as clear as daylight to anybody looking at the proposal of the Minister that the present position is that there is £200,000 borrowing and £2 million capital, that one is one-tenth of the other.  When we come to drafting the Bill we increase the capital to £5 million. We stick by the old rule of thumb and have one-tenth of that for borrowing.  In that case the £200,000 goes up to £500,000 and the £2 million goes up to £5 million.  That is how this came into being in this Bill and no other way.  The Minister cannot attempt to deny that.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is a reasonable man at all he will accept that the right thing to do is to give the board the statutory power, the flexibility, to be able to borrow.  There is no question of the company bankrupting itself because of borrowing.  The Minister admits that sometimes the board will come to him looking for money and he would not be prepared to give it out of the Exchequer because the financial circumstances of the Exchequer would not permit it.  Why in those circumstances should the Minister not be able to say to the board: this is a commercial proposition you are engaging in, you are buying this horse as a straight-forward commercial proposition and you should go and borrow the money at normal commercial rates and buy the horse; do not be asking the Exchequer for the money?  Surely that is common sense.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the purchase of these top international sires is as I have outlined: it is an almost first rate situation.  One can pay £1 million or £2 million for one of these horses and be almost certain <Col N="1284" /> that one will recoup that money over a four-year period.  One can insure against fertility and all those things. The board of the National Stud in 99 cases out of a 100 could certainly go out with the Minister's blessing as a straight-forward commercial proposition and borrow £1 million or £2 million to get for themselves a prestige stallion.  I cannot understand why the Minister will not agree to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust the Deputy would not disagree with the desirability that risk should be spread and such risk could be spread by syndication. If syndication is engaged in by the National Stud then borrowing of £5 million is unnecessary in the foreseeable future.  Certainly, I see a need to increase their capital requirements and when we have a board, as we have in the National Stud, which does not seek any increase in the borrowing powers I must bear that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should put away his brief for a moment and apply his own common sense to this matter.  If he thinks about this for a moment I am sure he will agree with Deputy Haughey.  It makes sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I will not.  It is wrong that we should give excess borrowing powers to State bodies if they do not need them or if we consider it is undesirable that they should have them.  I do not think it is desirable that a State board with £5 million capital, if and when that is issued, should have a borrowing power henceforth, even subject to my control, of £5 million.  Eventually, as the State is the sole shareholder, it is the State that would have to bear the loss arising. I know these things can be insured against but I do not think it would be appropriate that borrowing power for £5 million should be given to a concern with a capital potential of £5 million.  I do not think it is necessary.  If by keeping a restriction we incur a syndication and spread the risk, that is desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not have brought up this point of syndication because in fact it is an argument in my favour.  The way in which <Col N="1285" /> the National Stud would syndicate a horse of this calibre would be that they would go out and buy the horse and then syndicate the horse to a lot of interested parties.  There would be a question of borrowing the purchase price of the horse in the interim, from the time it is bought and the time they syndicate it and this is where this power of borrowing would come in and be needed.  In bringing up the question of syndication the Minister is introducing an argument against himself.  The only other way in which syndication could come into this is where the National Stud as a breeder would go out and take a share in somebody else's syndication.  Perhaps, they would do that but in so far as they would be the syndicator this borrowing power would be absolutely essential and vital to them.  Reason does not prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, we are being very reasonable.  In accordance with known policy and prospects for the National Stud a borrowing requirement of £5 million is not anticipated and it is wrong that Parliament should issue a blank cheque.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was no need to look at the situation and what is anticipated in the future we would not need to put any ceiling at all.  We would allow every State body to have unfettered control.  It is proper that needs as they arise should be explained to the House.</P>
      <P>As far as the public capital programme is concerned, whether it is capital advanced or borrowing, there is risk involved, and one must look to what will be the competing demands on public capital for several years to come.  We have gone a long way to increase the borrowing capabilities of the National Stud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will bear in mind what the Deputy says and discuss it with the board. I have no doubt the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, who will have responsibility in this area, subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance, <Col N="1286" /> will not hesitate to come forward with proposals if and when it becomes necessary to extend the powers.  Frankly, I do not think that will be likely for a long time to come. They have resources of their own from which they can meet some of the cost.</P>

      <P>The Company shall supply the Minister with such information regarding the performance of its functions as he may from time to time require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of the National Stud have a very good opportunity here of performing a very important service for <Col N="1288" /> the breeders and the industry generally. I am disappointed to notice that the report and accounts for the year ended 31st December, 1971, gave more information than the report and accounts for the year ended 31st December, 1974.  That is only a minor matter.  I have already explained to the Minister that I do not want the National Stud to enter the status-seeking glossy report area which other State-sponsored bodies enter into from time to time.  I am satisfied they will not do that.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the performance of the seven stallions given in the report so that breeders could see exactly the calibre of the different sires, their achievements, their fertility rates, and so on.  In addition, at very little extra cost the stud could supply an annual yearbook for the industry and breeders giving important information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree we should have full information.  The new provision will enable the Minister to call for fuller information.  The old provision related to the balance sheet and profit and loss accounts and a report of the proceedings during a particular accounting year.  The new provision will enable the Minister to specify additional information, including information relating to bloodstock accounts.</P>
      <P>I would also remind the House that the National Stud is one of the State agencies which will be brought within the umbrella of the new Oireachtas Committee on semi-State bodies.  If the Minister does not produce adequate information, the members of the committee, with their curiosity, will extract more information.  I am not suggesting for one moment that the Minister should be lackadaisical in obtaining adequate information.  I can sympathise with the view expressed by Deputy Haughey.  I am sure the board will bear it in mind in relation to their annual statements in the future.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> In page 3, line 55 to delete &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;nine&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a very simple amendment.  It relates to a matter I mentioned on the Second Reading debate.  I raised the question of the size of the board and I do not think the Minister, in replying to the debate, dealt in any way persuasively with my suggestion. This is an important board.  It is one which will have to take important policy decisions.  I have already said that in my view&mdash;I was glad to hear that the Minister re-echoed my view &mdash;the present manager of the National Stud is a man of excellent qualities. I do not believe there is any way the board could get a better manager. However, management is one section and the board of directors have a different type of function.  I would like to see the directors of the National Stud fully reflecting in their membership the different interests in the bloodstock breeding industry, the small breeders, the large scale stud breeder and right across the board.  I do not believe the board can do this with a membership of five.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the Minister that the smaller you can keep a committee or board the better, consistent with the objective which it is intended to carry out.  In this case I would like to see a bigger board from two points of view.  First of all, I would like to see it as fully representative as possible of all the different interests involved. I would like to see it representative of all the different levels of breeders, racing interests and so on. Seven, eight or nine people would be necessary from that point of view.  I also believe, in regard to some of the policy decisions the board will have to take, a wider spread of knowledge is essential.  This can only be got from a larger board.</P>
    <P>I can see a situation arising where the board would want to buy a particular type horse for a particular purpose. It might be a prestige stallion, a classic type of stallion, a miler or even a national hunt type sire.  The way that normally proceeds is that the manager makes a report to the board on what the situation is.  The board then have to come to a very difficult policy decision as to whether or not to <Col N="1290" /> buy that horse, whether it is suitable for their purposes, whether it has the quality, stamina, courage, whether the different lines he represents are the type the stud want to get into Irish bloodstock.  All those considerations have to be taken into account.  It is important to have a board of right general knowledge and experience able to take such a decision.  I do not believe there is anything to be lost by having a board of nine members.  I prefer seven to five.  It is unduly restrictive for the articles of association to restrict the number of directors to five.  I again reiterate that I fully agree with the Minister that bigger is not necessarily better in this particular context.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke earlier, in relation to the subject matter of section 7, of the National Stud being in limbo.  Whatever view one may take of the situation that has obtained in relation to the National Stud since 1969 the real question which arises is the position of the National Stud since the Government announced their intention of transferring responsibility for it from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1291" /> and Fisheries.  What precisely is being done?  The Minister told us that in effect under this section the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was being substituted for the Minister for Finance in some cases and in others for the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
      <P>He spoke a few times about a purely administrative change.  He said in a somewhat complaining way that an administrative change had been made in the past without the sanction of the House.  I would like to know precisely what is supposed to be happening under this section that would have the effect the Minister spoke about, that is to ensure that the next Bill of this nature is brought in by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and not by the Minister for Finance? What provision of section 7 will bring that about or will it be an administrative change?  What will determine it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain the difference between section 13 and section 7 of the Bill.  Subsection (1) and subsection (2) (a), (b) and (f) are identical with the original Bill.  Paragraph (c) is a change in that it is provided that the appointments and removal will be made by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries after consultation with the Minister for Finance whereas the original one provided that persons would be appointed by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. That is the only difference.  The initiating Minister will be the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in consultation with the Minister for Finance. Subsection (2) (e) is similar.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is the initiating Minister and the Minister for Finance is the Minister who is consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (d) introduces the issue of remuneration and determination by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries with the approval of the Minister for the Public Service.  That is a new subsection entirely.  It can be seen here that we are putting the initiative in this area on the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whereas heretofore, strangely enough, it can be said, it lay <Col N="1292" /> on the Minister for Finance.  Although the original Act of 1945 vested the National Stud in the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the appointment of people to the board was left to the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  We had this limbo, to use Deputy Haughey's words, this confusion of responsibilities.  This is now an anachronism.  The practice has been to concentrate initiative in areas of responsibility on the Minister who had primary concern for the board in question. That is what we are doing here.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries tends to be a person better qualified to select people who can make a more significant contribution to the National Stud than the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance may be an expert on bloodstock, music, fishing or on a multitude of different activities but I think it is better to allow responsibility to remain with the person who has statutory responsibility and who has an obligation to the Dáil to defend the choice that is made.  That is what we are doing here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that because the section provides that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will be the Minister who nominates members of the board or the auditor that as a consequence it will be the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who will be responsible for initiating legislation in this House in relation to the National Stud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ministers and Secretaries Act has relevance to all ministerial responsibilities but the House has conferred already from the previous Act primary responsibility in this area to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  The selection of directors of a company is not a matter which the Ministers and Secretaries Act vests in the Minister for Finance. He has financial management.  I cannot now refer to the text and verse of <Col N="1293" /> the Ministers and Secretaries Act but, as the Deputy will know from his own experience, the practice has been to leave initiation of these matters with the Minister who has primary responsibility in the area of the company in question after consultation with the Minister for Finance who, no doubt, injects his financial responsibility at that point.  It is more a question of switching the emphasis rather than the decision-making power.  I accept that consultation does not require consent but, in practice, Ministers do not tend to appoint people in the absence of agreement on the part of another Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to approve the acceptance by the State of the agreement establishing a Financial Support Fund of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and to provide for the participation by the State in the fund.  The <Col N="1294" /> text of the agreement is set out in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Let me say at the outset that this agreement has not yet come into force nor has the Financial Support Fund established by the agreement come into operation.  In fact, given that member countries making up 90 per cent of the fund must ratify the agreement before it automatically comes into force, it may be quite some time before we see the fund in operation.</P>
    <P>The second point I would like to stress is that it is certainly not envisaged that Ireland will be seeking finance from the fund if and when it is set up.  Our interest in the agreement is to play our part in what we see as a useful international co-operative measure to boost confidence in the international financial system and to show solidarity with our OECD partners.  To the extent that the establishment of the fund succeeds in this objective, all member countries will benefit and the fund's resources will be available as a last resort to any member in serious balance of payments difficulties.</P>
    <P>The agreement to establish the fund developed as a reaction to the massive balance of payments difficulties encountered by many industrial and developed countries in the wake of the enormous oil price increases in 1973 and 1974.  One of the main effects of these increases was to cause a sudden and unprecedented transfer of wealth from oil importing to oil exporting countries.  Since the oil producers as a whole were not immediately able to spend this money on goods produced by the oil consumers, many of the oil consuming countries, and Ireland was no exception, were faced with the problem of financing the corresponding deficits in their balance of payments.  In the event, the recycling problem as it came to be known, that is, the passing of funds from oil importers to exporters and back again either directly or by way of loans through the international money markets, did not create any major payments crisis.  Nevertheless the massive flows of capital involved presented a significant threat to the <Col N="1295" /> stability of the international financial system.</P>
    <P>The Financial Support Fund is generally seen as a form of mutual insurance scheme through which OECD member countries in serious balance of payments difficulties could borrow from or on the credit-standing of the other members.  From this point of view the fund represents an earnest on the part of the OECD countries to work together to meet the problems facing the world economy.  This in itself helps to restore confidence in the ability of the international economic system to surmount the kinds of difficulties so recently presented by the twin problems of the oil price increases and the worst recession since the war.</P>
    <P>Although the immediate need for a fund is now perhaps less, as the world economy recovers, its existence will serve to lessen the pressure on member countries to resort to unilateral measures to reduce deficits in their trading balances.</P>
    <P>International co-operative measures of this kind cannot, of course, be a substitute for correct internal policies. I do not think anyone can be under any illusions on this score.  What the Financial Support Fund does is help maintain the proper international financial atmosphere in which well considered national measures to smooth the inevitable adjustment process become that much more feasible.</P>
    <P>Let me now briefly describe the main features of the fund.  Membership of the fund is confined to OECD countries.  All the member countries of the OECD, including Ireland, signed the agreement setting up the fund, subject to ratification, in the spring of 1975.  Since then the majority of OECD countries have passed legislation or taken the necessary administrative measures to implement the agreement.  Most of these countries have, in fact, gone on to ratify the agreement.  The agreement will come into force when member countries with at least 90 per cent of the quotas making up the fund have ratified it. The agreement may also be brought into force for themselves by the unanimous <Col N="1296" /> decision of at least 15 member countries of the OECD with at least 60 per cent of the quotas who have ratified the agreement.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the fund is to lend money to member countries who cannot finance their balance of payments deficits from normal sources.  In other words, it is intended that the fund will be a source of last resort.  Applicants for loans will be expected to have first drawn down all other reasonable sources of finance, for example, their normal access to private markets, the IMF and, in the case of Community countries, their access under the various EEC schemes. To enable the fund to lend, each OECD member country has been allocated a quota and the total of these quotas, amounting to 20 billion Special Drawing Rights of the International Monetary Fund or £13 billion at current exchange rates, constitutes the fund.  Quotas determine a country's maximum liability to lend to the fund, general level of access to the fund's resources, and voting rights.  The quotas have been determined on the basis of relative economic weight. Ireland's quota is SDR 120 million or about £80 million, which is more than one-half of 1 per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>In the event of the fund approving a loan to a member country, the fund will raise the money needed in two ways, either in international financial markets on the basis of the collective undertaking of the other member countries, or from individual member countries directly.</P>
    <P>Should the fund approach an individual member country for money, the member has the option of making a direct advance to the fund or providing an individual undertaking on which the fund can borrow the necessary amount.  In general it is expected that the fund will proceed on the basis of undertakings from the member countries.  There are elaborate provisions in the agreement to ensure that the burden of providing finance for loans and risks on loans made by the fund will be shared by member countries in proportion to their appropriate quota level in the fund.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> Loans by the fund will be subject to stringent economic policy conditions and the approval of different voting majorities of member countries depending on the amount of the loan to be provided.  Voting is on the basis of quota strength but for most decisions a majority of the members as such is also required.</P>
    <P>The lending powers of the fund will continue in force for two years from the entry into force of the agreement. The agreement may, however, be amended and its lending life perhaps extended by a unanimous decision of the members subject to the completion of any further legislative processes which may be necessary should this occur.</P>
    <P>The fund will be run by a governing committee on which all the members will be represented.  There will also be an advisory board.  The secretariat will be provided by the OECD.  The fund will have the usual immunities and privileges of an international organisation.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to the provisions of the Bill.  The arrangements in the Bill in general follow the arrangements which apply to the International Monetary Fund and the EEC medium-term assistance schemes to which the Financial Support Fund has some similarities.  In brief, the Central Bank of Ireland will handle the State's financial transactions with the fund up to the winding up of the fund.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines the terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 approves acceptance by the State of the agreement.  Section 3 designates the Central Bank as the single monetary authority responsible for transactions between the State and the fund.  Under the terms of the agreement each member country is required to designate such an authority.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the Central Bank shall on behalf of the State make any payments or provide any undertakings to the fund as and when it is necessary to make such payments or provide such undertakings.  The section also provides that moneys receivable by the State from the fund shall be paid to the bank on behalf of the State. These provisions do not apply to transactions <Col N="1298" /> arising out of the liquidation of the fund.</P>
    <P>Section 5 gives the Central Bank the necessary powers to issue notes or obligations or enter into commitments in connection with the exercise of its functions under section 4.  The section also provides for payments by the Central Bank in connection with the issue of such notes and obligations and so on.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the liquidation of the fund.  The section provides in effect for the assumption by the State of its ultimate financial liability in respect of the fund's operations.  It is of course most unlikely that an OECD member country would default on an international obligation and indeed the fund's existence is generally seen as aimed at reducing the possibility of such an unlikely event occurring.</P>
    <P>Section 7 will enable the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Central Bank, to bring the Act into force at the appropriate time.  Section 8 provides that any administrative expenses incurred by the Minister shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  In general, administrative expenses are expected to be of a minor nature.  Section 9 gives the short title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The immunities and privileges of the fund will be covered in the usual form of order under the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Acts, 1967-76.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the OECD Financial Support Fund Agreement is a useful if somewhat technical measure aimed at maintaining confidence in the international financial system.  I think it can be said that the agreement represents the kind of active willingness on the part of the international community of which we are a member to do something about the problems facing it which it is in the interests of a small country, such as ourselves, to support.  I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This fund, for which there is such an elaborate agreement as set out in the schedule, and into which so much effort has obviously been put, has still not been set up. <Col N="1299" /> This is indicative of the rather surprising situation that, despite the difficulties arising from the sharp increase in oil prices, the problems for non-oil producing countries have not been as serious as anticipated.  That is not to say that such problems have not existed, but the serious and chaotic situation anticipated to arise at one time from the increase in oil prices has not in fact developed, in particular in relation to balance of payments problems. While we have had difficulties, some of them quite serious, arising from the increase in oil prices, our balance of payments problems are not now a major consequence of the increase in oil prices.  Indeed, the effect of the increase in oil prices has been somewhat exaggerated on our economy.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that it has not been substantial and serious but I am saying that the effect had been exaggerated by some people on some occasions for party political purposes to explain failures in other directions. However, it is important that the fund should be implemented in so far as it is necessary to do so and that it should be available for the member countries of the OECD if they were to get into difficulties to be able to fall back on this safety net, which is how it can best be described.  The quota for this country, which amounts to £80 million, could be, if we were called upon to pay in full, a very serious imposition if it were to happen all at one time.  That is most unlikely to happen. Indeed, we may never be called on at all, and if we are it is most unlikely that the sum required would be anything like the full amount of the quota.  Nevertheless, it is a substantial contingent commitment to be taking on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the major features of the agreement, which are what one would expect, the principal thing that emerges is the fact that any country which proposes to avail itself of a loan from the fund is to be subjected to the most stringent control in regard to the economic policies that it follows. We see this first in section 2 of the agreement where it is provided that: &ldquo;The Governing Committee <Col N="1300" /> shall satisfy itself that the member applying to the Fund for a loan meets the eligibility requirements of paragraph (a) of this Section and that such member's policies are consistent with the objectives of the Fund specified in section 2 (a) of Article 1.&rdquo;  Those objectives include the following of appropriate domestic and international economic policies, including adequate balance of payment policies and co-operative policies promoting increased production and conservation of energy.</P>
    <P>We also find in section 3 that one of the conditions of obtaining a loan includes the following:</P>
    <P>(c)  Conditions relating to economic policies needed:</P>
    <P>(i)  to redress the external financial situation of the member which receives a loan from the Fund (hereinafter called the &ldquo;borrower&rdquo;) over an appropriate period and</P>
    <P>(ii)  for the fulfilment of the objectives of the Fund</P>
    <P>shall be agreed between the borrower and the Fund at the time the loan is granted.</P>
    <P>Clearly the implications for any borrower are stringent control externally of the economic policies to be followed by the country concerned.  This country is now aware of the fact that such controls can be applied as the price of borrowing by the State.  We were never aware of it before, because it had never happened until the recent loan negotiated from the EEC.  We should recognise the possibility that, so far as we might avail ourselves of the facilities provided for in this fund, we would be subjected to that amount of control externally in regard to the economy policy that we might follow. I hope it will not be necessary for us to avail ourselves of the facilities available in the fund.  But, even if it is not, I would agree with the Minister's assessment that the completion of the necessary formalities for the setting up of the fund is a useful exercise in regard to the provision of additional confidence in the international monetary system, a system which is very <Col N="1301" /> much in need of any propping up it can get.  On that basis as far as we are concerned, we would agree with adherence to the fund and the completion of the necessary formalities by this country and consequently with the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in section 5 of the Bill on which I would like to get the Minister's views.  It is clear from the Bill, and in particular from the wording of section 5, that the Central Bank are being given the responsibility to make decisions to enter into commitments, to issue notes and so on, in relation to either the receipt of money from the fund or the payment of money into the fund.  I would assume that if on some occasion this country were to borrow money from the fund that would be a decision of the Government of the day and not a decision of the Central Bank, although it might be executed through the Central Bank for administrative reasons. I would think that is what is envisaged and that that is the way it will be done.  But the Bill before us would appear on the face of it to authorise the Central Bank to make such decisions and such commitments without reference to the Government at all. I wonder whether that is appropriate or whether the Bill should not provide that the Central Bank can enter into various commitments and so on envisaged here after consultation with or on the advice of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Colley for his reception of the Bill and for his confirmation of what I said about this country's decision in relation to it.  It is unlikely that we will have occasion to use this safety net which would be available to a country only if it were unable to meet its financial requirements elsewhere, and that is not likely to arise in respect of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the powers of the Central Bank the agreement itself requires that the instrument from which the international co-operation will be exercised is the Central Bank of the individual member countries.  The Central Bank will be exercising responsibilities in this area and in other areas which would reflect the Government's <Col N="1302" /> thinking.  We have accepted commitments here.  We do not know the extent to which we will be called upon to meet those commitments.  We may have our views about it but in relation to any later developments our commitment here is going to be quite small.  If our commitment is correspondingly larger because our estimates are not in keeping with what ultimately occurs, the commitments and difficulties of others will be much greater than ours because they will be more deeply involved.  The Central Bank will be the instrument of State here in discharging our obligations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not in isolation. It is a business matter which would affect the general management of the finances of the State.  It is an area in which there is no existing legislation. We can to some extent isolate and identify responsibilities of the Minister for Finance on the one hand, and the Central Bank on the other.  But the two do not move independently of one another, and there will be of course the normal consultation between the responsible Irish authorities as Ireland as a State discharges its obligation under this agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that the questions relate to houses sold by Dublin Corporation <Col N="1254" /> under section 90 of the Housing Act, 1966, in accordance with sales schemes made prior to July, 1973.  On the basis of information supplied by the corporation, it is estimated that the cost of giving tenants, who purchased their houses by annual instalments under these schemes, a reduction of one-quarter of the repayment period is £8 million.  It is also estimated that the cost of giving the original outright purchasers of houses under these schemes a 25 per cent refund of the purchase price is £150,000.  It is not possible to establish the number of these purchasers who are still in possession of their houses.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the method of application of the proceeds of local authority house sales in 1976, 75 per cent of the cost accruing in that year of implementing the proposals would fall to be met by the Exchequer.  The amount of money available to local authorities for housing capital expenditure would be reduced by the remaining 25 per cent of the cost of the proposals.</P>
