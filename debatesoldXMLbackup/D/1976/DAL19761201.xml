      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This legislation is directed at women at work.  I have repeatedly stressed over the last two years that the status of women is fundamentally determined by the nature of the tasks traditionally assigned to them by society.</P>
      <P>The prevailing prejudice of our society enshrined in constitutional social theory in this country was that a woman's place is in the home.  It was not accepted that women had the same right of choice as other citizens. Whatever the merits of the social theory as laid down in Article 41 of the Constitution, what has been happening in Ireland is that there has been an upward trend in participation by women in the labour market; this matches trends elsewhere.  This is notable for two groups of women in particular&mdash;those in child bearing years who are increasingly remaining in the labour force; and those in middle years with grown children who have been returning to the job market in greater numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> Recently, the European Trade Union Confederation had harsh things to say about the small proportion of married women in the work force in this country.  We are at the bottom of the league they said, with 13.5 per cent of married women going out to work, compared with 57 per cent in Britain and 60 per cent in West Germany.  They see this as proof of discrimination against women.  What they have overlooked is that we have not been industrialised for as long as Britain and West Germany.  For historical and social reasons the entry of women into industry here is a more recent phenomenon.  Whilst I would not go along with the European Trade Union Confederation in their conclusions, I have to concede that prejudice undoubtedly exists against women in industry.</P>
    <P>In a work force where we have 26 per cent women, the statistics of women who hold managerial positions in Ireland reveal a depressing picture but, of course, no worse than the statistics of the number of women who hold decision-making positions in any sphere of activity in Ireland, whether we take politics, the public service, trade unions or any area of administration.  When we move away from the traditionally female occupations we find equally depressing statistics, for example, in the professions&mdash;only 1 per cent of engineers, 2 per cent of accountants, 3 per cent of architects and just over 7 per cent of the legal profession are women. Even in the occupations which are predominantly female, we find that the top administrative posts are held by men.  For some reason women are perceived by men and, indeed, sometimes by women themselves to lack the qualities which would fit them for positions of responsibility and leadership. I think this is a misconception which has no basis in fact.</P>
    <P>We are all familiar with the explanations which are usually advanced for the absence of women from managerial positions; first there is just plain prejudice, meaning mainly male prejudice, then there is the narrow concept of women's role &mdash;I previously referred to the reference <Col N="1025" /> in the Constitution to the appropriate place for women in our society&mdash;the effects of single sex schooling and, of course, the range of subjects which girls have traditionally studied at school.</P>
    <P>A policy for the greater involvement of women in managerial positions must be developed.  I do not believe that managerial ability is concentrated exclusively in the male sex. Managers, men or women, are not born; managerial talent is developed &mdash;and it is not developed overnight. The major inequality lies in the type of employment taken up by women, the lowliest jobs are those left to them and the cure for this is in the improvement in education and training which must be provided for them before they enter employment.</P>
    <P>Very few women have come forward for training at AnCO centres but increased efforts are now being made to change this situation and the number of women taking courses has increased considerably over the last few years.  In 1975 a total of 813 women, 25 per cent of whom were married, completed AnCO courses and this year up to September, 978 have been trained at AnCO centres and there are 510 undergoing training at present.  I have directed that all AnCO courses be open to women and a special effort is being made to encourage more women to take up apprenticeships.  Although some progress has been made in this area, as yet, possibly because of social attitudes, women have not come forward for apprenticeship training to any significant degree.</P>
    <P>This legislation which is now before the House is intended to remedy the imbalance which exists.  As I said before, it is the status of women's jobs which determines their place in the economy and ultimately their place in society.  The Bill will provide women with equal opportunity with men to realise their full potential in employment when it comes to selection for a job, training within the job, or promotion or working conditions. The Bill will make it unlawful to discriminate against women in employment and it will provide for enforcement <Col N="1026" /> procedures under which women who feel that they have been discriminated against can avail of legal remedies.  It will no longer be possible to segregate jobs, managerial or otherwise, into men's jobs and women's jobs.  I might mention that the Bill will permit &ldquo;positive&rdquo; discrimination in favour of women in regard to the provision of special training where this is necessary to adjust an unequal balance in a particular employment.  Positive discrimination of this nature, which I think is necessary if equal opportunity in employment is to become a reality, will be permitted under section 13.</P>
    <P>The Bill defines discrimination as arising in four ways : first of all, direct discrimination where a woman is treated less favourably than a man because of her sex, then indirect discrimination, where a condition or requirement is applied equally to men and women but the requirement is such that a considerably smaller proportion of women than of men could comply with it and the requirement is not essential for the particular job; thirdly where a married person is treated less favourably than an unmarried person; and, lastly, where a person is victimised because of pursuing the legal right to equal treatment which this Bill confers.</P>
    <P>Having defined discrimination, the Bill then sets out the employment situations in which it is unlawful to discriminate, namely recruitment, training, promotion and working conditions. While the Bill is aimed primarily at discrimination by employers it will also make unlawful discrimination in activities which are related to employment, such as, discrimination by organisations concerned with the provision of training courses, as well as placement and guidance services provided by employment agencies.  Admission to membership and the benefits provided by trade unions, and employer organisations is also covered by the Bill, for the reason that such membership can affect eligibility and prospects for employment.  Finally, discriminatory advertisements will be unlawful under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> While the Bill is intended to deal with discrimination against women in employment, it will equally apply where discrimination is practised against men.  It is my intention in this Bill that the coverage should be as comprehensive as possible and, consequently, exclusions from the scope of the Bill should be kept at a minimum. I have, however, accepted the case for the exclusion of employments listed in section 10; for example, the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána, the prison service and employment in a private household.  I have provided in this section that any of these employments may be brought within the scope of the legislation later by an affirmative order.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court will have a central role in the enforcement provisions of the Bill.  Officers of the Labour Court have been given various powers including the power to require persons to furnish information.  It has been represented to me that employers should not be required to disclose any references or reports relating to the character or suitability of any person seeking employment, for the purposes of investigation by officers of the Labour Court.  I have accepted that this should be so and provision is made accordingly.  I felt it was important to ensure that the confidentiality of the system of character references, should not be disturbed.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I intend to make provision for the establishment of an employment equality agency.  It has been represented to me by the Women's Representative Committee, which is under the chairmanship of Deputy Eileen Desmond, and other organisations representing women that an independent agency would be the most effective way of promoting equality of opportunity in employment as well as dealing with public interest cases.</P>
    <P>In the United States, an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was established in 1972.  In Britain an Equal Opportunity Commission was established last year with enforcement <Col N="1028" /> and promotional functions under the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975.  A similar commission has been established in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The agency will be concerned with eliminating discrimination in employment, promoting equality of opportunity in employment and advising on the working of anti-discrimination legislation.  The task of the body would be nothing less than the removal of all traces of injustice and inequality whether in our laws or social arrangements.</P>
    <P>The new equality agency will investigate practices that appear to be discriminatory. If such practices are found to be unlawful, the agency will use their enforcement powers to eliminate them.  They will have powers of formal investigation similar to those of a judicial inquiry to require information, production of documents, attendance of witnesses, and so on.  A nondiscrimination notice issued by the agency will require the person concerned to stop the practice in question. These notices will be enforceable in the courts by way of injunction.</P>
    <P>The agency will have sole rights to deal with discriminatory advertisements, instructions to discriminate and pressure to discriminate.  They will be able to assist individuals in important or significant cases which raise questions of principle.  They will undertake a programme of education about discrimination in employment aimed at opening up new opportunities and trying to change public attitudes which operate against the interests of women in employment.  Complete equality will only come to pass if people question the limitations put on women in the past and agree to get rid of them.</P>
    <P>The planning of the agency must be worked out carefully.  It will take a lot of work but it is hoped that the agency will become operative before the end of 1977.</P>
    <P>In commending this Bill to the House, I am fully aware that the law can never entirely prevent discrimination but it can get rid of the more obvious forms of it.  Progress towards equality of opportunity for women depends to a large extent on a change <Col N="1029" /> of attitude on the part of everyone&mdash; employers, workers and the public generally.  The aim is that, following the enactment of this legislation, both sides of industry would work together and secure by their joint efforts the improvements in the status of women in the employment field.  I hope that the Bill will create a climate favourable to change which will result in more and more able and well-qualified women reaching responsible positions on merit and in proportion to their numbers in the population.</P>
    <P>The demand of women for equal opportunity in all areas of employment is a just demand.  For society as a whole the implementation of the Bill must represent a significant advance by simply getting rid of a system of discrimination which is wasteful of talent and ability.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the promises of that hastily-prepared document, the election manifesto of the Coalition Parties in February, 1973, was that legislation would be introduced to end all forms of existing discrimination against women.  However, in no other area have the Minister and the Government failed so much as in their attempts to fulfil that promise.  I might remind the House that it was Fianna Fáil who set up the Commission on the Status of Women and that it was Fianna Fáil, too, who accepted the interim report of that commission in August, 1971.  That report referred basically to the equal pay question.  The first steps taken in that sphere were those contained in that interim agreement.  A final report from the commission was submitted to the then Minister for Finance in December, 1972, just before the change of Government.  To say the least the forwards-backwards approach to this matter during the past four years has been disappointing.</P>
      <P>We had the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill, 1974 early in the summer of that year but there was the disgraceful performance of the Government in reneging on the basic and agreed principle of that Act.  This was done by a short-cut measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill follows very much on the <Col N="1030" /> same lines of all the legislation being introduced by the Minister.  It is a Bill designed to eliminate discrimination against women and to eliminate discrimination at all levels in employment from the time a job is first advertised.  For a long time Fianna Fáil have been committed to making it easier for women to progress in their careers.  This Bill attempts also to do that but one must question seriously the intentions, genuine or otherwise, of the Government.  I offered my sympathy to the Minister in February last when he was forced by the arch-conservative Fine Gael Party to bring in an equal pay amendment Bill the Second Stage of which was not completed.  In view of the Minister's stupid utterances recently on one of his rare visits to his constituency I shall have more to say about that in a moment.  That amending Bill was not completed as a result of a directive from the EEC.  It was at that time, too, that our eminent Commissioner, Dr. Hillery, was referred to by the Minister for Finance as the Fianna Fáil Commissioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. Hillery is the man that we are proud to have as our President, he having been nominated for the office of President by this party.  His stand on the equal pay issue was in line with the attitude and the commitment of Fianna Fáil.  That attitude is very different from the type of window-dressing in which this Minister indulges.  There is window-dressing in this Bill but I welcome those aspects of it that are in line with the recommendations in the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women, but what has happened the other recommendations?  I also welcome the Minister's reference to the appointment of an agency but why has it taken until now to realise that this is most essential and I believe the most important thing if we are to make progress as we hope to do in giving equal opportunity to women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is amazing that the Minister this morning made no reference to the fact that the First Stage of this Bill was introduced in October, 1975. <Col N="1031" /> There were reasons for that; we had a by-election in Mayo; the sun was shining brightly then for the Coalition, the sun that is now sinking very rapidly.  At that time the Minister among other Ministers was anxious to maintain the image he had of being the champion of women.  In my opinion, he has reneged on that title in a disgraceful manner.  This Bill had been consigned to the limbo of forgotten things until this day two weeks ago when I questioned the Taoiseach here as to why it had been so long delayed.  Not having received a satisfactory reply, I repeated my question on the following morning.  It was ordered for the following Tuesday&mdash; last Tuesday&mdash;but it was not reached. It would still be lying forgotten if the promptings from this side of the House had not resulted in its resurrection. It was the resurrection of a measure hurriedly prepared and proof of that is that this morning, after 13 months, the Minister announces that he will be providing on Committee Stage for the appointment of an agency.  I regard the appointment of an agency as being vitally important if we are to make worthwhile progress under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I and my party are not the only people who regard this measure as inadequate, as only a token measure, but it has been improved by the announcement of the setting up of this agency.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to tell me when replying why does it take so long for this Bill to become operative.  He said that it would be operative towards the end of 1977; obviously, that is a year from now and more than a year after the introduction of the Bill.  So, from the time we introduce legislation until we can set up such an agency two years must elapse.  Obviously, before the end of 1977 we shall have a general election.  The Fianna Fáil Government will have no hesitation in having the agency operating in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>My comments on the inadequacies of the Bill are not confined to the Fianna Fáil Party.  With the permission of the Chair, I shall quote from the <Col N="1032" /><i>Irish Independent</i> of October 29th, 1975, shortly after the Bill had been introduced.  The article is headed: &ldquo;A further look at the Bill to end discrimination&rdquo;.  The main heading reads: &ldquo;Less would be embarrassing&rdquo;. The first paragraph says:</P>
    <P>If Ireland had a Trade Descriptions Act there would be no doubt that the Minister for Labour, Mr. O'Leary, would find himself in difficulty over the labelling of, and claims for, his latest piece of work.</P>
    <P>And it is highly doubtful if he would win a case brought against him on the ground that the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill, 1975 was misleading, in that he purported it to be a major contribution towards eliminating discrimination against women both in the workplace and at the entrance to the workplace.</P>
    <P>That was written by the newspaper's eminent industrial correspondent, proof again that here was somebody interested in industrial development, interested in women playing their rightful role in that development and completely disappointed and disillusioned with the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In another paragraph he said:</P>
    <P>Otherwise, even if this Bill becomes law, it is likely that it will make no impression on female employment, its terms and conditions. But it will change the appearance of newspaper and television advertisements for jobs and could change the face of collective pay agreements, in that women's rates will have to be abolished.</P>
    <P>The final paragraph, referring to legislation generally, says:</P>
    <P>This one&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>he means this Bill</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;is in danger of earning political kudos while leaving the problem untouched.</P>
    <P>I believe that proof of the lack of commitment here lies in the delay in bringing forward the Bill to the House on Second Stage.  It is almost unbelievable that a Minister could introduce a Second Stage this morning without <Col N="1033" /> any reference whatever to the delay. I believe the Minister himself is genuinely committed to the area of social reform but he is shackled and tied down by colleagues not so committed. Legislation in this area has been introduced haphazardly with individual Bills being processed piecemeal through the House and some of them left on the Order Paper at different Stages at present.  There has not been sufficient combined effort.  Later, I shall point out why I believe that there is at least one section of this Bill that is probably connected with&mdash; or an effort should be made to have it so connected&mdash;the Unfair Dismissals Bill.  I say that because they all concern workers' rights.  A streamlining of the machinery for securing these rights is desirable.  I make that point by way of constructive criticism.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a number of sections dealing with discrimination and a number of questionable ones dealing with exclusions, a number of sections dealing with the machinery to handle cases that will arise.  There is no reference to the agency which of course is so desirable and now being introduced, which further proves my point that the Bill was hurried, was not well prepared and is being added to piecemeal.</P>
    <P>May I go through some of the sections of the Bill?  We will have an opportunity of discussing this again in Committee and it will be interesting then.  There is a basis there by which I would hope we can improve the legislation that is being introduced. The first step is the setting up of the agency, an amendment we would have been tabling in any case on Committee Stage.  Whether we would have called it an agency or not is not important.  What is important is that we would be in favour of setting up a body to progress properly, to assist in equal opportunity of job promotion, of job availability to women.  I am looking at section 1 particularly.  I remember discussing a specific point in the definitions of the Unfair Dismissals Bill with the Minister on Committee Stage of that Bill last week.  At that time we referred to the &ldquo;relative&rdquo;<Col N="1034" /> clause.  It does not look well that with two Bills from the same Department going through this House during the same period, admittedly one introduced a year before the other, little things like this are not exactly the same.  It portrays a lack of combined effort by the Minister and his people towards the legislation that is so necessary.  For example, there is the definition of the &ldquo;close relative&rdquo;. I accept that probably legally one can take it as being the same definition as applies to those excluded under the Unfair Dismissals Bill, but certainly it does not read the same.  I believe it should.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that in this Bill there has not been a definition of the employer. What I want to see is consistency of approach to these measures that are all necessary social reforms designed to improve working conditions and to eliminate areas of discrimination, but all in the interest of the workers either male or female.</P>
    <P>Section 2, which deals with Discrimination for the purposes of the Act, must be embarrassing for the Minister.  I suspect that this section and the embarrassment created by it have probably been reasons why it was not produced for Second Stage long before now.  I have no doubt that when the Minister did introduce this Bill in October, 1975, he was committed then to the full operation of the principle and spirit contained in the Equal Pay Bill.  Others prevailed on him and told him it could not be so.  As a result he had to renege on the absolute commitment made by him and agreed by us.  The section reads:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this Act, discrimination shall be taken to occur in any of the following cases&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  where by reason of his sex a person is treated less favourably than a person of the other sex,</P>
    <P>(b)  where because he is married a married person is treated less favourably than an unmarried person of the same sex, ...</P>
    <P>and I presume <i>vice versa.</i> In other words, they are all treated equally. This, of course, has not been the case in the public sector especially, the <Col N="1035" /> sector in which the Minister has most control or should have the greatest interest.  It has not been observed with regard to equal pay.  This must be indeed a very embarrassing section for him.</P>
    <P>Section 3 goes on to discrimination by employers and the areas where discrimination can and should be prohibited. One point I would make is that quite honestly at this stage I cannot offer a better description, but I am a little concerned about the term &ldquo;prospective employee&rdquo;.  However, I am sure we will get an opportunity of discussing that in more detail on Committee Stage.  I understand what it is intended to mean.  I am not so sure that it is the correct definition or term to use there.  Section 3 (4) reads:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a person shall be taken to discriminate against an employee or prospective employee in relation to conditions of employment if he does not offer or afford to a person or class of persons the same terms of employment (other than remuneration and superannuation), the same working conditions and the same treatment in relation to overtime, shift work, short time, transfers, lay-offs, redundancies, dismissals (other than a dismissal referred to in section 21) and disciplinary measures as he offers or affords to another person or class of persons where both such persons or both such classes are or would be employed on like work.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister about the position there on shift work particularly with reference to night work.  How does this affect our commitment under the signing of Convention 89 of the ILO Convention?  He is President of the ILO now and is entitled to spell out clearly for us what exactly is meant by the shift work situation where women are concerned.  Does it mean that they may do night work in the same way as men do or are there certain restrictions on it?  He has a duty to spell it out to the House, particularly in his dual capacity as Minister for Labour and President of the ILO.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> Subsection (6) of the same section is completely impracticable.  It conveys to me that if ten people are suitably and equally qualified for promotion and only three promotional vacancies are there, then the employer is committing an offence if he does not promote all ten.  This he cannot do because there are only three vacancies. As that subsection reads certainly this is the explanation I take from it.  I presume this will be discussed on Committee Stage and I would ask the Minister to examine it.  I think it needs to be improved.  It is not the type of subsection that should be here to be questioned in this manner.  I believe it is a completely impracticable situation.</P>
    <P>We are eliminating discriminations in the trade unions, in the organisations of employers, in all professional bodies, in vocational training, and in the employment agencies and rightly so.  We will support this section but we will be asking questions about some of the terminology used.  For example section 6 (b) says:</P>
    <P>by refusing or omitting to provide any service.</P>
    <P>A very wide interpretation could be put on that.  I will not go into details of that interpretation now.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (1) refers to discriminatory advertising, a very necessary reference, and section 8 refers to where counselling another person also constitutes discrimination and section 9 refers to discrimination in collective agreements.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the first exclusion in section 10.  Again the Minister, who seems to have an obsession about keeping the public sector out of all his measures being introduced into this House, as in the Bill he had here last week, has excluded:</P>
    <P>(a)  in the Defence Forces,</P>
    <P>(b)  in the Garda Síochána,</P>
    <P>(c)  in the prison service,</P>
    <P>(d)  in a private residence or by a close relative, or</P>
    <P>(e)  by a minister of religion or a religious community.</P>
    <P>The question immediately springs to mind why the Garda Síochána, <Col N="1037" /> especially now that we have the BanGhardaí? Why this service at all? What is the reason for excluding it? I appreciate the point that the Minister may by order introduce it but I do not think that is right.</P>
    <P>When a former Member of this House, Mr. James Dillon, sat on these benches he always condemned legislation giving power to a Minister to legislate by order because he maintained, and I believe rightly so, that the Minister was taking away from the democratic rights of the elected Members of this House.  We have had much of that type of legislation in this and recent Bills but I do not believe it is right in this section.  I want the Minister to spell out clearly why the public sector have been excluded again and particularly why the male and female members of the Garda Síochána have been excluded.  That appears to me to be completely unreasonable and unacceptable if we are to make progress and if this is not just window dressing.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the dangerous sections.  I can understand how the industrial correspondent in the <i>Irish Independent</i> could refer to what he called the weaknesses and certain dangers hidden in this Bill.  I believe the sections dealing with exclusions are dangerous and could not only be used but I fear, may be abused. Section 11 reads:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Act shall make it unlawful for an employer&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) to refuse employment in a position to a person who will not undertake all the duties attached to that position or who will not accept all the conditions under which those duties are performed,</P>
    <P>I think it was Daniel O'Connell who said that one could drive a coach and four through any Act of Parliament. Section 11 can be used very widely to render ineffective the earlier sections of this Bill.  I would ask the Minister to have a further look at that section and its implications.  It is pointless introducing measures if we have qualifications or hidden sections that will take from their value and effectiveness. That is one of the reasons why <Col N="1038" /> I believe there is a great deal of window dressing attached to these measures.</P>
    <P>Section 12 goes to the limit.  Here the Minister is doing something which I have never seen in my short experience. He is taking to himself powers of saving not only applying to this Act but also applying to the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938, the Factories Act, 1955 and the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965. Section 12 (2) (b) reads:</P>
    <P>Where the Minister proposes to make an order under this subsection, a draft of the proposed order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) reads:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding any provision of this Act, nothing done by an employer in compliance with any requirement of or under an Act to which this section applies shall constitute discrimination in contravention of this Act.</P>
    <P>If Mr. James Dillon was in this House and saw this section he would be very annoyed with the Minister giving himself such wide powers.  I do not believe the Minister would use this section as a saving exercise for somebody who may be trying to perpetrate a breach of the Act but there is always the possibility of a Cabinet reshuffle.  We might yet have such a reshuffle because a certain gentleman, not with the goodwill or support of the Labour Party, was recently appointed to the European Commission, and there will be a change in his Department.  If, for example, one of the many conservatives in the present Cabinet were appointed to the Ministry of Labour, he might take powers to himself that this Minister would not take or support.  For that reason section 12 weakens the Bill.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the machinery set up to handle cases of discrimination. We will be going through these sections in greater detail on Committee <Col N="1039" /> Stage.  There is still room for much needed improvement in several areas. Section 19 deals with compensation. The Minister should take into consideration the difficulties that could be experienced by a small employer or a small firm.  We should approach this legislation in a more positive way.  As I said last week, there should never be an unfair dismissal.  That, of course, is the ideal.  We should legislate to encourage people to be fair.  That is why I consider the omission of that agency to be a very serious shortcoming.  I can see that agency playing a very valuable role in the elimination of discrimination.  There have been cases of discrimination against women in the past.  We should legislate to encourage and educate these people who through tradition or for any other reason are not committed to equal opportunity for all.</P>
    <P>I blame the Government for contributing towards the attitudes that exist in some quarters because of the high unemployment situation and their failure to make any worth-while improvement in that situation or to handle the school leaving situation. This has hardened the attitude of many people towards this type of necessary social reform.</P>
    <P>In the compensation section, section 19, the Minister should take into account where the shoe might pinch. I accept that I may be criticised as being a little contradictory in this respect, that here I am looking for him to exclude somebody.  It could be abused and I accept that that danger exists but I would rather depend on the integrity of the excellent inspectorate of the Department and other officials to ensure that abuses of this kind would not occur.</P>
    <P>Section 22 relates closely to the Bill dealing with unfair dismissals.  We are talking about the Labour Court here while in the other Bill we were talking about the redundancy tribunal.  My words of encouragement here are towards a streamlining of the machinery available to people investigating a dispute over discrimination or unfair dismissals.  We should tidy this up.  I can assure the Minister of my co-operation <Col N="1040" /> if he wishes to expedite measures in this House.  I want these measures streamlined, as effective and as simple as possible.  I want as little duplication as possible.  I read in a British newspaper recently that the introduction of the social legislation in Great Britain created a sizeable staff situation, a high cost in handling cases referred for consideration.  The newspaper stated that both sides of the industrial spectrum agreed that the biggest millstone was the introduction of tribunal cases.  It stated that they were clogging the machinery and adding to the high costs.  I would not like to see a similar situation develop here.</P>
    <P>I shall table a number of amendments for Committee Stage.  I have been critical of the Bill as not having gone far enough and I criticised the delay in introducing the Second Stage.  My party have been committed to support the opportunity for women to make progress in their careers, if and as they wish and that commitment is still there.  For that reason I support the legislation but we will endeavour to improve it on Committee Stage.  I hope we will not have the same delay we had between the introduction of a Bill and the debate on Second Stage.  I hope the Minister will explain why it will take him until the end of 1977 before the agency is set up.  The Minister made reference to the fact that Deputy Eileen Desmond, a colleague in my constituency, was chairman of the committee established by him but I should like to remind him that there are lady Members on this side of the House.  For that reason I hope that when he is establishing some committees he will stretch the interests of the ladies on such committees across the political spectrum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this very important piece of social legislation. The Bill was eagerly awaited by those interested in the promotion of rights for women.  That is understandable because it represents a major link in the chain of anti-discrimination legislation introduced in the last three years.  Without this Bill the Act dealing with equal pay would be limited <Col N="1041" /> in its application.  Many women could never benefit from the provisions of that Act because of the relegation of our work force into &ldquo;men only&rdquo; and &ldquo;women only&rdquo; jobs, the former to carry the superior wage rates, superior promotional prospects and superior job satisfaction.  Where we did not have &ldquo;men only&rdquo; at entry point &ldquo;women only&rdquo; remained the norm with regard to training, promotion, job advancement and job satisfaction.  It is sad that there was an acceptance of this situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that for some reason women are perceived by men and, indeed, sometimes by women themselves, to lack the qualities which would fit them for positions of responsibility and leadership.  I agree with the Minister and I also agree with him that it is a misconception that has no basis in fact.  I also agree with the Minister that managers, men or women, are not born; that managerial talent is developed but not over-night.  However, a good deal of the injustice to our women has its basis in these misconceptions.  Militating also against women is the tendency that still persists to regard all men as bread winners and to compensate them accordingly.</P>
      <P>Women, on the other hand, are divided into two categories by the many who hold this view, the career woman, who in most cases was single, and the married woman supported by her husband and earning pin money only.  The career woman was unmarried and had only herself to support. It was felt that she had no need to pay for the back-up services such as the provision of meals, laundry and so on that men generally pay for.  It was considered natural for a woman to be her own servant.  It was felt that there was no need to consider her for promotion or advancement of any kind as long as she had what was termed &ldquo;a nice little job&rdquo;.  We are familiar with the term which still persists &ldquo;a nice job for a girl&rdquo;.  Generally, that represented a dead-end job with a false sort of respectability and gentility about it but, nevertheless, it was thought very suitable for a girl because it was presumed she would marry or if she did not she had nobody to support but herself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> The fact that thousands of single girls supported aged parents and that many thousands supported a family and the fact that thousands of men support nobody but themselves did nothing to alter this attitude which obtains in relation to the greater need of men.  In order to be consistent about this theory about wage structure and opportunity based on dependants one would need to pay a man with six children more and to give him more opportunities than one would give a man with one or two children and also a married man more than a single man. It never occurred to those who advanced this theory that this should be done.  In fact, the theory is reserved only to justify discrimination against women.  We have also heard of the two-wage argument, the resistance to two wages going into one house.  In my view this argument is reserved for the husband and wife situation only; it is never applied to a household where there are six or seven wage earners provided one of the pay packets does not go to make a married woman independent. The dependant wife mentality is what permeates all our thinking in this area.  Society has blind spots and thinking has often been twisted, unjust and, indeed, cruel as far as women are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the White Paper on working women in Europe published by the women trade union leaders group of the European Trade Union Confederation.  This paper dealt with the overwhelmingly low proportion of Irish married women among female workers and cited it as evidence of the very, very high degree of discrimination practised against women in Ireland.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of Saturday, 20th November, there is a front page article on the situation.  I think the other papers carried this information too.  To quote:</P>
    <P>Figures show that in 1973 only 13.5 per cent of female workers in Ireland were married compared with 67.2 per cent in Britain, 62 per cent in France and 59.6 per cent in West Germany.  The second lowest country, Luxembourg, was more than three times higher than the Irish proportion with a figure of 43.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> Italy, considered the European country for <i>machismo,</i> was also well ahead of Ireland in this sector with 51.4 per cent of women workers also wearing wedding rings. Belgium, where traditional attitudes still tend to prevail about male-female roles, came out second top with 65.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point about our not being industrialised for as long a period as Britain and West Germany but he conceded that prejudice does exist against women in industry. We had the case of a transport firm ignoring constitutional law and dismissing nine female workers for the sole reason that they were members of a trade union.  A single woman who marries is required to resign or is dismissed from her employment.  Wage discrimination is flagrant.  In the clothing and shirt making industries the conditions in regard to wages and so on clearly infringe the provisions of the Anti-Discrimination Act.  In the case of an ice-cream manufacturing company, while men receive a bonus, women never receive any bonus based on the basic wage.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also states that under-employment of women in Ireland is &ldquo;of considerable proportions and is linked to a kind of `endemic' unemployment, as well as being due to the concept of the `restricted' role played by women in modern society.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To a certain extent this represents the background against which this Bill is introduced and this is therefore a very important and very vital measure.  To wait for public opinion to swing to the side of women would be to wait for a very long time for basic justice for 50 per cent of the population.  There is advancement in times of labour shortage but there is evidence now to some extent of the old prejudices being reinforced in the face of the unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on bringing in this Bill and getting it priority in the heavy programme of legislation awaiting the attention of the House.  It certainly is a priority <Col N="1044" /> and it is legislation which must be both strong and forceful because of the attitudes against change, which are still there, and which are hardening. Even among workers themselves there may be need to enforce this legislation and so it must be strong and enforceable.  Reference was made to the delay in bringing in the Bill. Some of the delay was well worth while because there have been discussions in the interim with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and other organisations which represent women's interests.  As a result of representations, consultations and negotiations the Bill has actually been improved and will possibly be improved further as it progresses through the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>Any unnecessary delay in completing its passage would be very regrettable because there are still very definite discrimination factors operating against women and delay would afford an opportunity for those who are not well disposed towards this Bill to conjure up ways and means of nullifying its effects.  It is important, therefore, that the Bill be afforded a speedy passage.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 define what constitutes discrimination.  It would be discrimination to treat a person less favourably than another because of sex.  That is basic to the whole concept of the Bill.  It will be discrimination to treat a married person less favourably than a single person of the same sex.  That is important.  In our labour force 88 per cent of women workers are single and provision must be made to ensure that a single person will not be treated less favourably than a married person.  If that is not covered there would be a loophole for discrimination in reverse. This amendment will have to be made on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Subsection (c) provides:</P>
    <P>where a person of one sex is obliged to comply with a requirement, relating to employment or membership of a body referred to in section 4, which is not an essential requirement for such employment or membership and in respect of which the proportion of <Col N="1045" /> persons of the other sex able to comply is substantially higher.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent provision and a very important one in the context of the Bill.  It has been pointed out to the Minister that too narrow limits may constitute discrimination since very many women, certainly a very high proportion of them, leave the labour force to rear children or to look after elderly relatives and we believe provision should be made specifically for these.</P>
    <P>Subsection (d) provides discrimination shall occur:</P>
    <P>Where a person is penalised for having in good faith&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  made a reference under section 15 or under section 7 of the Act of 1974,</P>
    <P>(ii)  opposed an act which is unlawful under this Act or the Act of 1974,</P>
    <P>(iii)  given evidence in any proceedings under this Act or the Act of 1974, or</P>
    <P>(iv)  given notice of an intention to do anything referred to in subparagraphs (i) to (iii),</P>
    <P>This is very important and very necessary.</P>
    <P>Situations in which it will be unlawful to discriminate are outlined in section 3 (1):</P>
    <P>A person who is an employer or who obtains under a contract with another person the services of employees of that other person shall not discriminate against an employee or a prospective employee or an employee of that other person in relation to access to employment, conditions of employment (other than remuneration and superannuation), training or experience for or in relation to employment, promotion or regrading in employment or classification of posts in employment.</P>
    <P>Discrimination does go on in all these situations and so the Bill should be of very real value to women working and have far-reaching beneficial effects for them.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1046" /> An employer, shall not have, in relation to his employees or employment by him, rules or instructions which would discriminate against an employee or class of employee.</P>
    <P>Much of the discrimination practised is not likely to be lifted in any set of rules or instructions because it has been established and tolerated over the years by actual practice in very many cases by management, workers and trade unions alike.  It is important, therefore, to provide that the subsection shall read &ldquo;rules or instructions or practices which would discriminate against an employee or class of employee&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides:</P>
    <P>A body which is a trade union, an organisation of employers or a professional or trade organisation or which controls entry to a profession or the carrying on of a profession shall not discriminate against a person in relation to membership of such body (or any benefits provided by it) or in relation to entry or the carrying on of the profession.</P>
    <P>Again this is very important.  The Minister stated this can affect eligibility and prospects for employment.  We are all familiar with cases where there have been bars, sometimes indeed in the most unlikely places.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the AnCO training courses and to the fact that they have attracted very few women. The position is improving but the proportion of women is still very low. Those who have availed of them have confined themselves mainly to traditional female skills.  I am not surprised this is so.  Advice was given to such girls that there were poor job prospects in areas other than those regarded as traditionally female skills. Experience has shown that those who ignored this advice and who were brave enough to venture into new sectors found it very difficult to get employment.  The Bill is vitally important in this area.  Pilot training schemes for girls in skills regarded as traditionally male should be embarked on simultaneously with the coming into operation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is worth while.  In addition <Col N="1047" /> to the provisions set out in the section it should also be operated to provide for special AnCO training courses.  For instance, courses in management should be provided.  AnCO training courses in the traditional male skills and also for jobs such as shop stewards and so on could be envisaged under this section and would be a considerable step forward.</P>
    <P>Discrimination goes much deeper into the educational system.  It is built into the system from the kindergarten upwards.  There is the segregation of the sexes, differing school subjects, counselling and so on.  The whole system needs a complete overhaul. What is needed is comprehensive legislation but that is not possible under the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 which deals with advertising is important.  It states:</P>
    <P>(1) A person shall not publish or display, or cause to be published or displayed, an advertisement which relates to employment and indicates an intention to discriminate, or might reasonably be understood as indicating such an intention.</P>
    <P>This is a good section but I would question what is meant by the phrase &ldquo;might reasonably be understood as indicating such an intention&rdquo;.  To leave it as vague as this might result in it being interpreted too widely and certainly not to the advantage of women workers.</P>
    <P>Section 38 (3) of the United Kingdom Act states that job descriptions with sexual connotations such as &ldquo;stewardess&rdquo;, &ldquo;waiter&rdquo;, &ldquo;salesman&rdquo; and so on shall be unlawful unless the Act indicates to the contrary. This is an important provision and something on these lines would improve our legislation.  The United Kingdom Act also makes it essential to state in the advertisement that both sexes may apply if the job is one that has previously been restricted to male workers only.  In this connection the legislators in the United Kingdom were thinking in terms of mechanics, electricians and so on.  It was felt that if these provisions were not included girls might be dissuaded from applying <Col N="1048" /> for jobs traditionally regarded as male skills.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 10 excludes the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána, the prison service, employment in a private residence or by a minister of religion or a religious community.  Personally I do not think a valid case can be made for all these exclusions.  With regard to employment by a religious community, the case has been made that this could debar all teachers and nurses from the provisions of the Bill.  I presume the Minister will undertake under this section to make orders to include such categories.  In relation to the prison service, the Garda Síochána where women are already working, and the whole range of back-up service to the Defence Forces such as telephonists and nurses, the Minister should take action under subsection (2) in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 10 (3) the exclusion of appointments under the Civil Service Commission or the Local Appointments Commission is difficult to defend. The commission have a huge volume of work to do.  They interview thousands of persons each year and I accept that there might be some difficulty involved.  However, that difficulty should be overcome.  It is not a sufficient reason for debarring the sections of the labour force from the provisions of the Bill.  It appears that there is need for an appeals machinery of some kind for those who feel the recruitment is not as it should be.  If possible, such employments should not be excluded from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the right to refuse employment or to dismiss an employee in certain cases.  It makes it lawful to refuse employment to a person who will not undertake all the duties and accept all the conditions of the job.  I should have thought this could have been dealt with through normal industrial relations procedures. It does not appear to me that there was any need to introduce it into this Bill.  By so introducing it we are putting in a rather negative note which is a pity because the Bill is positive in every other respect.  As has been <Col N="1049" /> pointed out, it may provide a loophole for unscrupulous employers.  Before the Bill becomes law such people may introduce new conditions of employment. They may introduce a small element of heavy manual labour into a job where it did not exist and thus make it difficult for a woman to do the job.  It is a provision that would be best excluded unless there are very good reasons for its inclusion.</P>
    <P>I interpret section 13 as a saver pending the repeal of protective legislation and in that context it appears necessary at this stage.  I understand an EEC directive will make it necessary for us to carry out the first revision of this protective legislation before 1980.  It is important that once this measure becomes law the first revision should commence.  Much of the protective legislation is not necessary in modern conditions and in cases where it perpetuates discrimination against women in employment it should be repealed.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the exclusion of posts where sex is an occupational qualification for the post.  One can envisage some situations where this provision would be necessary but in other respects it is rather vague.  What is meant by a post requiring the characteristics of a particular sex adequately to carry out the requirements of the post?  This would be very open to a prejudicial ruling.  For instance, 50 years ago only men were thought to possess the characteristics needed to drive a car.  Women were considered too frivolous and too indecisive to do many things.  There has been a change.  There are many posts which women hold today with very great ability, posts for which a few years ago it was considered women did not possess the necessary characteristics. This is a very wide section and is very open to a prejudicial interpretation.  It would be an improvement if it could be defined more closely.</P>
    <P>I now come to the enforcement sections of the Bill.  I believe everybody agrees that the Labour Court should have the central enforcement role.  We feel, however, that a special division of the Labour Court should be set up to specialise in cases under this Bill, the <Col N="1050" /> Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill and any other Acts of a similar nature in relation to employment which may be necessary in the future.  Specialisation would avoid varying interpretations. Decisions would be constant and consequent confusion would therefore be avoided.  We also feel that the involvement of suitable women in the Labour Court, particularly when dealing with this legislation, is very desirable.  I know that there are the ordinary procedures for the appointment of people to those positions.  I know they are nominated by the various bodies who are represented on them but I feel a suggestion to the nominating bodies that they might select women, where women are available for such work, would be a step in the right direction particularly in this area.</P>
    <P>A special section of the Labour Court set up to deal with all this legislation with women working on it would be a desirable aspect of the working of this legislation.  The Labour Court have provision to recommend reinstatement, which is very important.  A court process might be of very little use to many of the people affected by discrimination if the power to reinstate were not there.  One could envisage a situation where it might be more difficult for a person to secure alternative employment. It is very good that the option to reinstate employees forms part of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to refer to in relation to the Bill is the very excellent decision of the Minister to make provision on Committee Stage for the establishment of an employment equality agency.  He did not announce this for the first time this morning.  He announced the setting up of this agency to eliminate the discrimination against women on 15th April, 1976.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not announce it in the House or in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Second Stage of this Bill is the first opportunity he has had in the House.  The announcement was made on 15th April this year and it was repeated in an announcement regarding the functions of the agency in July, 1976.  We have been aware for three or four months <Col N="1051" /> that this agency was to form part of the Bill.  It is a very important part of the Bill.  It will give teeth to it and make it effective for very many people. The Minister said that this agency will be nothing less than the removal of all traces of injustice and inequality in our laws or social arrangements.  These are very broad terms of reference.  This will be a mammoth task.  The agency will have powers to investigate practices which appear to be discriminatory and will have enforcement powers to limit those practices.  The agency will be able to issue notices requiring that those discriminatory practices cease.  Such orders will be enforced by a court injunction.  A very important aspect of the agency is the power to investigate and enforce.</P>
      <P>The agency will also have sole rights to deal with discriminatory advertisements, instructions to discriminate and pressure to discriminate.  It is very important that it is envisaged that the agency will undertake a programme of education about discrimination in employment aimed at opening up new opportunities and trying to change public attitudes.  It is important that we have a simple authoritative body questioning the limitations placed on women in employment.  The educational role with regard to the rights of people under this Bill will be very important.</P>
      <P>The agency will give women a confidence that their rights are enshrined in law and that they will be upheld. The agency will have an important role to play in questioning the limitations on women because this is something which might not be done by individuals on their own behalf. Much discrimination goes unnoticed and it is important that there is somebody to pinpoint that discrimination, to bring it to light and to eliminate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable that the Bill should contain some provision for its coming into operation as an Act at an early date; for instance, within one month of its passage.  I have no doubt that once it is passed the Minister will make an early order to bring it into operation.  I would like his assurance that this is exactly what he intends <Col N="1052" /> to do.  The Bill is a very sincere effort to legislate for fundamental civil rights for women.  There will still be problems when it is law.  There will be problems in the general area and in the employment area.  Until we have women filling two roles, the domestic role and the work role, until we have staggered working hours and a sharing of domestic responsibilities there will be difficulties for women. Women will not be competing on fair terms with men, whatever is enshrined in this legislation.  However, the Bill is a very genuine effort to improve the situation for them, to eliminate a great deal of the injustices that still persist.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the passage of this Bill through the House, if possible through all Stages this side of Christmas.  I look forward particularly to the establishment of the agency which I hope will be ready early in 1977.  I understand the difficulties, that one has to be careful, that it is a vitally important agency and that it has to be set up with a great deal of care.  However, I hope it will be in operation early in 1977 and that it will be there to monitor progress towards the elimination of all forms of injustice against women in our society so far as employment is concerned. I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this Bill I see the need to condemn the Minister for the delaying tactics he has used to keep it away from the House for so long.  It was first introduced in October, 1975.  We wonder if his conservative colleagues in Government influenced him.  It is disgraceful that for a Bill as important as this it should take 13 months before we have a chance to debate the Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our aim must be to achieve equality of treatment for women.  Men's attitudes are most in need of change and men control the means of change. Therefore, a much greater involvement by women in the political life of the country is vital.  Anti-discrimination should and must bring with it equal pay, equal promotional opportunities, <Col N="1053" /> equal training and social welfare payments.  These are all important areas in which women suffer from serious injustices.</P>
    <P>Up to very recently, because of lack of opportunities in education and in training, women were ill-prepared for the exercise of a trade or profession. Women's employment is at present concentrated in certain sectors, mainly the services, and in certain types of less skilled jobs where the wages are lower and the opportunities for women are fewer.  The development of the working career of many women is influenced by marriage and by motherhood. Women who wish to return to work after absences for childbirth or child rearing face serious difficulties in getting a job or resuming their careers at the same level as before. In addition, women are often penalised as a result of prejudice.  In the eyes of many employers, a woman candidate for a job is a potential absentee.  All these things I have mentioned have combined to bring about a situation where the number of women on managerial staff and in decision-influencing positions in public life is very small.</P>
    <P>Equal pay for equal work must, of necessity, include work of equal value. Getting the proper rate for the work is only part of the story.  We must fight against discrimination in matters of access to employment, promotion, vocational training and equality of working conditions.  Women are becoming increasingly aware of the injustices to which they are subjected, and their insistence on being given a fair role in society is the strongest hope for the success of the movement for equality for women.  It certainly does not help the women's cause that the growth of this movement is coinciding with the time when the Government find themselves in considerable economic difficulty and faced with serious unemployment. Elimination of discriminations in social welfare will cost money, but we must be on our guard against any suggestion that justice and equality must only prevail in times of plenty, nor should we accept that any particular group in our society should have to carry an unfair share of the hardships. The hardships have to be distributed <Col N="1054" /> fairly throughout all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>All women welcomed the EEC directive on equality between men and women.  The number of employed or self-employed women in the European Economic Community is estimated to be in or around 35 million, and approximately 25 per cent of the working population in Ireland is female. Their work is concentrated in certain types of jobs, usually those requiring a lower level of qualification and this work, consequently, carries lower wages and provides fewer opportunities for promotion.  Women resent the discrimination which they suffer and their confinement to a ghetto of what they call &ldquo;women jobs&rdquo;, and they demand a big change towards greater equality of treatment.</P>
    <P>Because of the need to make up for neglect, the achievement of equality may entail&mdash;particularly in the short term&mdash;expenditure greater than can easily be incurred at a time of economic difficulty.  We must remember that short-term expenditure will bring a return in the long term as a result of the provision of competent and flexible labour for the economy and by the contribution which women workers will make to the country's gross national product, to tax revenue, and by way of social welfare contributions.  Progress has been made already during a time in which a Fianna Fáil Government were in power.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald, mentioned the fact that Fianna Fáil set up the Commission on the Status of Women.  As a result, the range of professions and trades open to women has widened.  The level of women's qualifications has been raised, education for girls has improved, and segregation has been reduced.  The rate of progress, however, since the Final Report from the Commission on the Status of Women was presented prior to the change of Government in early 1973 is inadequate.  The Government, who, after all, have the power to make changes, lay themselves open to reproach when they use the present economic difficulties&mdash;as, indeed, they have done&mdash;as a reason <Col N="1055" /> for postponing the measures needed to achieve full equality.</P>
    <P>The setting up of an employment equality agency which the Minister has told us about in his speech today is very welcome and is indeed essential. It will play a very valuable role in assisting the achievement of equal opportunities.  The general attitude towards women workers must change and the employment equality agency will help tremendously towards bringing this about.  Whether married or single, and whether her wage is the main or a supplementary source of income, a woman still tends to be regarded on the labour market, because she is a woman, with an element of suspicion, and the high proportion of women working in firms on the decline are often the casualties when these firms shut down, particularly in the textile, footwear and clothing industries.</P>
    <P>Equality of opportunity within a career is as important as access to a career and the ratio of women at the upper levels of almost any sector of the labour market is not proportionate to the number of women employed.  Women are under-represented, particularly at the professional level of employment and, therefore, the improvement of working conditions which would benefit both men and women is essential.  It is also a matter of co-operation between workers, their unions and management. It is important that women workers should be effectively represented in the leadership of trade unions in those concerns which employ significant numbers of women, and it is also desirable that managements and trade unions should make every effort to encourage more women to participate in such leadership.</P>
    <P>Married women involved in work outside the home are on the increase. Very often the reasons for this are financial.  Married couples today are finding it increasingly difficult to live on one person's wage and this has to be supplemented to meet everrising costs.  It is here that the working mother faces the most difficult dilemma.  She has to decide whether <Col N="1056" /> to look after her baby herself, or to arrange for someone else to do so.  If we are serious in giving equal opportunities to women, both married and single, we must cater for the many working mothers who urgently need a planned development of day nurseries and crèches.  I find no mention of the provision of such facilities in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I quote from the report submitted in December, 1972, by the Commission on the Status of Women, the section dealing with day care for children:</P>
    <P>Many married women find that they must re-enter employment, or mothers who are ill or hospitalised for any length of time, are faced with the task of finding suitable care facilities for young children. The most satisfactory solution to this problem is where arrangements can be made for parents or other relations to undertake responsibility for them while the mother is working or incapacitated.  Frequently, it is not possible for the mother to make this kind of arrangement and she must either try to avail of professional child-minding facilities or else depend on older children to look after the younger ones outside school hours.  This latter solution is clearly a very unsafe and unsatisfactory one but representations have been made to us that, in certain areas, it is not an infrequent occurrence where mothers are working and that the responsibility lies with the State and other authorities for not providing suitable crèche and day-nursery facilities where young children can receive skilled care if the mother is forced by economic necessity to resume work.  By the term &ldquo;crèche&rdquo; we mean a centre where children in good health up to between 2 and 3 years of age are cared for during all or the greater part of a normal working day by qualified, mainly professional personnel.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>We do consider, however, that where new housing schemes are being erected, provision should be made for the building of crèches <Col N="1057" /> or day-nurseries in the scheme and we recommend that the provision of facilities of this nature should be a condition for the grant of planning permission for such schemes where many women may have an economic necessity to take up part-time work.</P>
    <P>I feel very sincerely that, if we are serious about getting rid of inequality as it exists today, we must be serious about the provision of these facilities which are so necessary.  Our social welfare system as well must be reformed to ensure equal treatment of men and women, for example, to enable unemployed female school leavers to avail of benefit as their male counterparts do.</P>
    <P>While all of us on this side of the House have been pushing for the introduction of this Bill so as to have it processed through both Houses of the Oireachtas without delay, the Minister has made a political football of it. By introducing it many months ago he felt he was satisfying the many women's organisations who have fought so hard for equality, but now we find to our dismay that, not alone had we to wait 13 months before we could debate the Bill but that it will not become effective until the end of 1977.  Must we wait another year? Perhaps the Minister would tell us why we have to wait so long, or if, indeed, he does not intend introducing the Committee Stage of the Bill for the next six or seven months.</P>
    <P>Rather than getting rid of existing inequality the Minister introduced what I feel was a red herring, and a dangerous one at that, when he announced that he was creating another inequality, this time among women themselves, and I refer to the discrimination against women based on marital status in the public sector. This was disgusting and the Minister must be condemned for it.  However, let us look at section 2 of this Bill which reads:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this Act, discrimination shall be taken to occur in any of the following cases&mdash;</P>
    <P>And clause (b) provides:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> where because he is married a married person is treated less favourably than an unmarried person of the same sex.</P>
    <P>The opposite prevails at present I believe and the clause could be rephrased to read &ldquo;where because he is single a single person is treated less favourably than a married person of the same sex&rdquo;.  Has the Minister any concept of what social justice means, or is social justice something which he reserves for special occasions such as the famous Labour Party conference in Limerick not so long ago. What have been the utterances of Government Ministers in connection with equality?  At the recent Labour Party conference the Tánaiste saw fit to make a speech about policy that would influence society for the next ten years, and he never mentioned women.  I quote from a speech which was made by the Vice-Chairman of the Council for the Status of Women at the weekend at which she said as well that the Minister for Labour &mdash;who has special responsibility within the Government for women&mdash;in his reply at the same conference never mentioned women.  The Minister for Finance went further and in some of his usual thinking aloud came up with the bright suggestion that the children's allowance be taken away from mothers.  Perhaps the most unkind cut of all was that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who a few short years ago gatecrashed the Late Late Show to pledge his support for women's rights, and who recently told a Cork audience that whilst the law could not be changed back to bar married women from working they should be &ldquo;gently discouraged&rdquo;.  I wonder what the Minister meant by &ldquo;gentle discouragement&rdquo;.  I wonder if he or the Government or the Minister for Labour are serious at all when they introduce an anti-discrimination Bill in this House when we must gently discourage a section of the community from working.</P>
    <P>There are certain exclusions in the Bill which I hope to have an opportunity of clarifying on Committee Stage.  The one that comes to mind immediately is that relating to the <Col N="1059" /> public sector under section 10, and in particular clause (b) of that section which provides that the Act does not apply to employment in the Garda Síochána.  Unless I am very much mistaken there are a fair number of Ban-Ghardaí already employed in this sector of the community.  Why allow discrimination to continue here?</P>
    <P>There is a real benefit to society in improving the opportunities open to women.  Fianna Fáil are totally committed to equality and to ending discrimination of all kinds.  I believe our country has an enormous amount to gain from all the talent, the imagination and energy of women which up to the present has not been allowed to develop.  While I support this anti-discrimination measure, I urge the Minister to bring the operative date forward from the end of 1977 to the beginning of 1977 if he is interested in ending the many forms of discrimination that are in the labour force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn have said, I believe the Minister for Labour is to be congratulated on bringing this Bill before the House this morning, and I am certain it will be implemented in the very near future.  We all accept that such a Bill is necessary.  For whatever historical or social reasons, women have not had the same opportunities heretofore as men.  They have been edged out and left aside in the filling of all important posts whether it be at the political, judicial, professional, trade union, employer or any other level.  Women have not been allowed to develop their talents to the full or given the opportunities to help to build up this country.  This applies to every section of the community and every type of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One is bound to ask whether examination results could supply a reason for this.  If one studies the intermediate and leaving certificate results, one will find that over the years females have obtained a greater number of passes and honours results than males. There are reasons for our failure to tackle this problem up to now and <Col N="1060" /> why this discrimination has been allowed to happen.  Part of it is our very small industrial base.  The agricultural sector was our main employer until recently.  Opportunities for employment in industry have been small and this is one of the reasons for the limited opportunities for women.  Another reason is that there was large-scale female emigration over the years.  A great number of young girls emigrated, the majority of them staying away.  A small number of them returned and got married.  It would be wrong to say that this trend has been reversed; it is continuing.  There have been some improvements which would be more obvious in country areas.  In country areas there is a greater social consciousness and people are more agreeable to accepting female services, professional or otherwise. They realise that the services being provided are at least on a par with what men are providing.  There has been a social awakening but the improvement is slight.</P>
    <P>I agree with most of the Bill but the exclusions in section 10 worry me. Subsection (3) reads:</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 17 shall not apply in relation to an appointment to an office to which the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Acts. 1926 and 1940 apply, or in relation to an appointment to a position in respect of which a competition under the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, is held.</P>
    <P>I represent two counties, Laois and Offaly, and have served on a local authority for ten years.  I have reason to visit the local authority office regularly and on one occasion I met a female staff officer.  Whether we like it or not, we must accept that it is not accidental that so few women have managed to reach the status of staff officer.  A similar situation exists in county councils and health boards. I have never yet met a female county secretary, county manager or county engineer.  There is no doubt that it will take a long time to change the situation.</P>
    <P>A similar situation applies in regard to the Civil Service Commissioners.  I do not know who they are.  The <Col N="1061" /> Ceann Comhairle is chairman of the commission.  There are seven or eight men in charge of the Civil Service Commission and no women.  It is not right that the Minister should allow this situation to continue.  Other employers can be prosecuted under this Bill and if you want to pursue this matter in the House you can put down a question, but if you try to put down a question in regard to the Civil Service Commission you will be told that it is out of order.  I would say I am just on the point of being ruled out of order by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I may be pressing my luck in raising this matter put somebody had to say it.  The Civil Service Commission cannot be criticised.  Public servants are as much entitled to fair play as anybody else.  If we do not give a good example and ensure that justice is done, then we have no right to talk about discrimination in other areas.  The Minister should tackle this thorny problem.  I believe he has the ability to overcome it.</P>
    <P>There are a great number of people in domestic service who are not members of trade unions.  The current trend is for both husband and wife to work.  Until the crèches that Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn talked about are built there will be a need for domestic servants.  So many domestic servants are so badly paid that it could be described as slave labour.  This morning we talked about people having two jobs, but most domestic servants have one job.  The whole area of domestic service should be investigated as soon as possible.  If necessary, the Minister should take on extra staff to cope with such an investigation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill relates to vocational education committees and prohibits discrimination in relation to vocational training.  Many vocational education committees have helped in the avoidance of discrimination.  They have given good example in this area. It is hoped this will continue.  I hope a directive will be issued by the Department to all vocational education committees informing them of the provisions of this section.  I also hope that there will be communication with AnCO.  All bodies that come under the auspices of this or any other Government <Col N="1062" /> Department should be notified of this Bill when it becomes law. It is important that they all know their position in regard to it.</P>
    <P>I have received representations from employers, employees and others in relation to some legislation introduced by the Minister in recent times.  A number of employers expressed the view that the Government were being very extreme in the introduction of some of this legislation.  That did not apply to this Bill where I think the Minister has illustrated a fair balance, illustrating a common-sense approach particularly in regard to section 11. It is an important section and I compliment the Minister on having gone such a long way in meeting people. Section 11 deals with the right of dismissal for failure to carry out all duties a person is obliged to undertake. If a person is not prepared to carry out all of those duties and somebody replaces him it is important that an employer have some redress to ensure that such a person would not be allowed to continue in the job while not carrying out all of his duties.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with certain exclusions. I have read the Minister's speech, the explanatory memorandum and the Bill itself.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate somewhat on this section in his concluding remarks because I do not know what exactly he has in mind.  I suppose he has in mind hospitals and so on but I should be glad if he would clarify the position.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a good one but there are some points on which I should like further guidance.  I should like the Minister also to consider some of the points I have raised.  In relation to any legislation dealing with employment, where one is dealing with human relationships between employers and employees and people's approach in general, one of the best yardsticks to use is common sense and goodwill on all sides.  One can have the Statute Book full of legislation but it all boils down to common sense and good will on all sides in such matters.</P>
    <P>We should recognise the fact that we are Irish men and women, that we <Col N="1063" /> have an obligation to ourselves to discharge our duties whether we be in the position of employer or employee, as befits us, with honesty and pride in our work, in the knowledge that irrespective of who we are or where we are, we have to provide a living for ourselves, set our own standards and ensure that such standards are adhered to.  Nobody owes us a living; it is up to us to provide our own. In regard to any legislation it is we who must ensure that it is implemented properly and that applies to all shades of opinion and people in all walks of life.  I think the Bill will be a success and I compliment the Minister on its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Enright spoke before me.  It would be too bad if, apart from the spokesman on this side, the only Deputies who might contribute would be Deputies Desmond, Geoghegan-Quinn and Deputy Hogan O'Higgins whom I see coming in after me.  On that note I should like to make one mild complaint. In recent times in the Dáil we have not known when something is coming up for discussion.  It is not good enough to have the spokesman on our side moving around telling us at a late hour when such and such a Bill is coming up for discussion.  As in other parliaments, the Government could engage in more efficient planning and arrangement of the times when Bills are to be taken so that those of us who may have an interest will be able to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, we should not delude ourselves that laws and legislation can cover everything in life.  Men and women have useful qualities.  They also have defects.  Neither sex is superior to the other in that respect. There are areas in which people cannot be as useful as their opposite numbers and <i>vice versa.</i> To cite one example I have come across on numerous occasions&mdash;women can make a very significant contribution in the designing of homes in a way that no man really can.  But how often has this been recognised?  How often do local authorities, builders, developers, architects and so on <Col N="1064" /> acknowledge that fact?  Yet all of us who have been married for a considerable length of time are well aware of it.</P>
    <P>The Bill is confined to women in employment.  It is welcome in the sense that it endeavours to set an example in introducing legislation although, as a Deputy on our side has said, it is somewhat late.  A commission was set up by the previous Administration a considerable number of years ago.  In so far as our society, like many others, is backward and immature, laws alone will not rectify that.  It is a good thing that the Bill has been introduced.  On a broad front women tend to be discriminated against in all societies.  Perhaps this is because of the nature of their role in life.  It cannot be easy for a woman who has had, through the nature of things, to go out and earn a living and at a later stage&mdash;if she is getting married&mdash;to virtually abandon that role and take on the duties of a housewife and mother, the very essential duties of training and educating children apart from looking after her husband.  Then, when the children have reached a stage where they no longer need her, she must decide whether she will continue to lead a home life, take up some employment or, perhaps, follow some interest or profession.</P>
    <P>The difference here between the role of men and women in society is quite obvious.  There is a complete change-about involved for any married woman.  Any woman, once she has fulfilled her family duty, if she has not already done so, either has to take up some form of employment or outside interest through which she can contribute to society.  Married women should be encouraged to use their natural talents in employment or, if necessary, community work.</P>
    <P>Such might apply where economic circumstances do not dictate that she go out to work.  I think Deputy Desmond mentioned that where there is only a husband and wife at home it is not that essential for a woman to go out to work.  That does not necessarily mean she should be cast in the role of staying in the home <Col N="1065" /> indefinitely.  The old saying that a woman's place is in the home tends to be overdone and exaggerated.</P>
    <P>The motive behind it was that the best person fitted to look after children was and is the woman.  That does not mean that we should create an environmental situation where women are told &ldquo;You ought to be at home&rdquo;. There is no doubt in my mind that there is plenty of evidence that women can be and indeed are as capable as men if they get the opportunity.  To a considerable extent women are discouraged from seeking these opportunities. There are many examples in recent times of women who through unfortunate circumstances of one kind or another, where a husband has died, have come out into political life or business life and have made just as significant an impact as their husbands might have done.</P>
    <P>In the political area there is a feeling not alone among men but among women that women should not be involved in politics.  Any community loses through this.  That sort of attiture is perhaps a bit more alive in rural than in urban areas, but even in Dublin it is difficult to get women to join political parties and at the same time I know from my own experience that they are welcome.  In the many branches of our organisation, as in other political parties, members are wanted.  Recently is has been suggested by some women's organisations that a separate political party should be set up for women and that political parties should be called upon to put forward a proportion of women candidates.  My feeling in relation to party politics is that there are not even enough men in active participation, and that the idea of making a separation is not realistic.  We should encourage as many young people as possible to get involved in politics and to take an interest in what is happening in their community.  It is not realistic to talk about putting forward a proportionate number of women candidates in an election, because in the type of democratic selection that we engage in those who are deciding in convention will decide on whom they believe to be the best candidate.  They will not <Col N="1066" /> necessarily discriminate against women, except in the sense that in rural areas it is said that a man will get more votes than a woman.  That is part of the environment.  We cannot legislate for it.  All we can do is discourage it.</P>
    <P>There are many areas in which women can contribute and they should be encouraged to do so.  For example, women can contribute in areas of display, decoration, planning, architecture and advertising.  We know that in the professions&mdash;science, medicine, law and so on&mdash;women are just as capable as men, and we have also seen it in radio, television and in education.  We are possibly a little behind the United States in this but we are ahead of many other countries in the world.  In page 3 of his speech the Minister referred to the small number of women, particularly, married women, engaged in employment.  I do not think it is as bad as that.  Many of them would prefer to be at home.  I have heard many women say that they would prefer not to hold down jobs when there are many thousands of young people looking for work.  Many would say that they would prefer to see their daughter or son working than that they should be keeping one of them unemployed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn mentioned the exclusion of gardaí in section 10.  It occurs to me to mention to the Minister that over the past seven or eight years efforts have been made by the Garda to bring to an end this business of having gardaí doing administrative work in Garda stations, preparing summonses, typing out reports and so on.  I understand that has been going on and is still going on.  It is very necessary that the Garda authorities should encourage it and I wonder how the Minister fits in his exclusion in section 10 with that. Presumably if staff were to be brought in for that kind of work in order to release a garda for more dangerous and arduous work, the Minister would need to make provision for it.  Under section 11 an employer may refuse employment.  Has an employer the right to decide that a particular type of work, for instance heavy work, could be bad for women and that it could be done more usefully by men?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> We will have to learn as we go along, but there are all sorts of areas in which one could draw examples of where one sex or the other can be more effective or more proficient.  In the long run, while I welcome the Bill, I would say that it is the maturity of society that will prevail.  No person can be compelled to employ a man or a woman in the many different circumstances that exist.  The choice, I presume, other than where the State is concerned, must lie with the person providing the job and with the need for performance in any given area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to welcome this Bill.  We have waited for it for a long time but it is worth waiting for.  I would like to see the next Stage of it taken quickly and I would like to see it become law as quickly as possible.  There are many reasons why we have the situation in this country that we have where there is a great deal of discrimination against women. The main reason is historical.  In this country we tended to hang on to the Victorian era longer than other countries.  I remember as a small child that my grandmother used to say &ldquo;A lady should be seen and not heard&rdquo;.  Men of my father's generation were reared with that thought, that a good Catholic mother stayed in her home to bring up her children.  We are still suffering to some extent from that attitude.  I have always worked outside the home so far be it from me to criticise anybody who does likewise. Married women work generally for economic reasons but also because they have a wish to work outside the home.  There is a theory in European countries that once a woman marries she <i>ipso facto</i> becomes a good housewife and mother.  Let me say that many of us never make good housewives, whatever about the other attribute. I would say to women who hate housework that they should employ somebody to do those duties for them while they themselves return to their careers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brugha mentioned the question of women in politics.  He is right in saying that women are welcome in all political parties.  However, it is <Col N="1068" /> the case often that young girls are not interested in becoming involved at local branch level.  In my constituency which, incidentally, changes for every election, I encourage the young women I meet to become involved in the party. Their reluctance to become so involved, particularly in the past, may have been due in some way to the attitude of male members of political parties who tended to regard women merely as playing the role of teamakers or of writing up minutes. Women complain now that they have little say in politics but the situation has come about by reason of their reluctance to get in and fight their way up.  Regardless of what anyone on either side of the House may say, I know that men resent women in politics.  I recall an incident in 1965 when a senior Member of this House asked me if I intended recontesting the general election to be held in that year.  When I told him it was my intention to go forward again, he asked me if I did not consider Leinster House an unsuitable place for a lady. In reply I told him that I had never had any ambition to be a lady but that I always had held a wish to remain in politics.  The idea that ladies do not work is a nonsensical hangover from the Victorian era.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of this Bill is that it should result in giving to women an equal opportunity in the field of employment, in giving them equal pay, an equal chance of promotion and equal social welfare rights.</P>
    <P>At junior and secondary level education boys and girls now are given more or less the same opportunities and if they are going on to third-level education practically all the professions are open to both men and women.  Women can even undertake agriculture on a professional level.  Up to now at vocational level the trend was to stream the girls into domestic economy classes but I am glad to note that AnCO are arranging to admit girls to their courses.</P>
    <P>In regard to equal opportunity&mdash;and this is what I consider to be the most important aspect of this whole subject &mdash;girls must accept that if they are receiving equal pay they must be prepared <Col N="1069" /> to undertake equal work.  I know of a hospital in which equal pay was granted, not to the nursing staff but to other staff, some time ago but where some of the women workers decided that they would not undertake to work at night although they wished to be able to continue to receive equal pay.</P>
    <P>I trust that employers will be able to rid themselves of the notion that once a woman marries she will be a liability in some way to the firm because of working time that may be lost as a result of pregnancies.  That attitude tends to discriminate against women being employed.  Employers should regard all candidates as potential employees rather than to segregate them on a sex basis.  Women who find it necessary because of pregnancies to leave work for a short while should be entitled to return to their jobs if they so wish.  It is fashionable at the moment to criticise married women for going out to work but even if all the married women who are employed outside their homes were to relinquish their employment, the impact on the employment situation would be very small in terms of the numbers of jobs that would become available for other people.</P>
    <P>Another factor in this is that very often the jobs undertaken by married women would not be undertaken by single people.  In regard to this whole question we must consider our entire system of education.  It is my contention that married women are as much entitled to work as is anybody else. Recently I attended a meeting&mdash;it was not political&mdash;at which there was expressed much criticism of married women who go to work.  Afterwards I spoke to one of the men who had been most vociferous on the subject and, referring to the fact that he had quite a number of daughters, I asked whether he would not wish them to go to work after they had been through university.  This man's situation is not such as to warrant his children being eligible for free education at third level.  I asked him whether, if any of his girls should marry in her final year at the university, it would be his idea that she should not follow a career.  He became quite indignant and <Col N="1070" /> said that he would expect them to follow careers after so much money had been spent on them.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I had not expected this Bill to be before the House this morning so I am not as well prepared for it as I would have wished.  In addition to that, I was delayed by bad road conditions which meant that I was not here for the Minister's speech. However, there will be plenty of opportunities during the other Stages of the Bill for us to contribute further.</P>
    <P>It is a feature of a period of economic recession that where there are men and women employed in the lower paid jobs, the tendency is to employ men rather than women as vacancies occur.  This is particularly noticeable in regard to such categories of workers as waitresses, shop assistants and so on.  This is the case also in other countries.  A person who holds a senior position in the civil service in Italy told me that this is the case in that country.  This sort of discrimination should not be practised.  In the lower paid jobs women are to blame in regard to promotion in so far as they are reluctant to assume posts of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Recently in my constituency I attended the official opening of a big extension to a factory.  On the occasion the management paid much tribute to those girls who had been with the firm from the time of its inception and who were responsible for much of the success of the venture. Afterwards I spoke to the manager who was an American and asked him how many of those girls now held senior jobs with the company.  He replied that although the girls had been offered more responsible positions, they had refused to accept them. This attitude indicates a lack of education, a lack of confidence.  It is a hangover from the Victorian era that girls are taught to regard themselves as not as adequate, perhaps, as men in employment.</P>
    <P>More and more married women are working and they are perfectly entitled to work for whatever reasons, but they should provide, where they <Col N="1071" /> can afford it, an adequate child-minding service for themselves.  Many parents&mdash;both working in good jobs, as Deputy Enright said&mdash;do not provide this and they could do so out of their own resources.  I realise that women working because of necessity and because money is very scarce are not able to pay somebody to look after the children and that the State has a certain duty to provide some type of day centre or crèches.  The larger factories should also provide these facilities.  Many of the large industries are making enormous profits and the small cost of providing a day centre or crèche would be well worth while. They would gain happier employees and in the long run this would benefit the industry.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Enright that domestic help is very badly paid &mdash;he should be looking for it.  They are practically a dying race, which is a tremendous pity.  There is some stupid snobbery about this.  Girls should train in domestic skills and go into these jobs which are very well paid, as I know from people who have been in touch with me in an effort to get help.  Because of the snob attitude domestic jobs are not on.  In fact there are some very interesting jobs for girls in that area. If you employ somebody to look after your children while you are at work there should be an income tax allowance. There is not at present.  There is a housekeeper's allowance for a man, but not for a woman who is working, unless she is a widow.  I think that is the situation.  It is not unusual to pay £20 to £35 per week for domestic help and there is no income tax allowance for this.  There should be.  If you class a girl as a secretary, the expenses would be allowed against wages.  If she were working in an office or on the factory floor there would also be allowances but not in domestic employment or home help employed in the house. This position should be examined.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that in this day and age there should be discrimination between men and women in the social welfare field.  Mark you, I have <Col N="1072" /> reservations here.  I do not think that school leavers of any age should get unemployment assistance.  It tends to keep them on the dole and discourage them from seeking work.  The young people all think they should start at the top.  I think if they did not have social welfare they would take any sort of job and make &ldquo;a go&rdquo; of it if they were any good.  At present they seem to think they must start at the top or they will not take the job.  This is a mistake.  I think it is wrong to give unemployment assistance to either boys or girls in the first year of their leaving school.  It tends to encourage them to idle and this is not what we want in this society.</P>
    <P>We have reached a situation where we have a sort of equal pay system but it discriminates between one woman and another, married and single.  This will have to be rectified. I sympathise with the Minister because, having made these promises which I really believe the Government meant to carry out, things in the economic field did not turn out as hoped and we are in an economic recession at present.  But that does not&mdash;nothing does&mdash;justify discrimination, and every effort must be made despite the recession to give equal opportunities to men and women.</P>
    <P>Discrimination against the female sex for so long has resulted in the vocal element being extremely vocal and they can do themselves a certain amount of harm.  In England women now feel that the &ldquo;women's libbers&rdquo; have done a great deal of harm.  Now when they become divorced and have better-paid jobs than their husbands, they have to pay their husbands alimony.  Also, in England, a woman's job must be held for her for a year after a pregnancy and this discourages employment of married women.  This is why we must have a sense of balance. &ldquo;Women's libbers&rdquo; should not go too far and leave women at a disadvantage again so that they would be not only calling the tune but paying for it also.</P>
    <P>I have never believed in &ldquo;women's lib&rdquo; to any great extent, as I have said over and over again.  I do not believe in separate societies; I believe <Col N="1073" /> in an integrated society.  I believe that men and women complement each other and work very well as a team.  Because of the natural bias in society against women, women who get into well-paid jobs work about 25 per cent harder than men to prove their worth because all the time there is this bias against a woman and she must go on proving that she is as valuable to her employer as a man. Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn will probably agree with me in thinking that women politicians have to work 25 per cent harder to get the same number of votes.  They start under a handicap and so must be that bit better than the men to be elected.  No male Deputy will admit this.</P>
    <P>I am not happy about some things in the Bill but, as it goes on, I trust we shall be able to clarify it.  Section 10 has been mentioned and I am also not happy about section 14 and another section.  On Committee Stage, I am sure it will be clarified and we can say more on the subject.  I should like the Bill to get a speedy passage and become law as soon as possible. We can discuss Bills here and make fine speeches on them but they must get out of the House and on to the Statute Book and become law, before anything is done about them.  That is why it is so important to take the Committee Stage as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be brief but as this is an important measure I shall not deal flippantly with it.  First, while I support the principles of the Bill, it is rather a reflection on our society that we must bring in this legislation.  The Government are somewhat tardy in introducing the Bill.  It has been so long on the stocks that we thought, it had been forgotten.  It may well be that only for Deputy Fitzgerald's pertinent questions, which seemed to have reactivated Government interest in the measure, we would not be dealing with it even now.  I look forward to the Committee Stage to go more fully into the subject matter. I shall only speak for a few minutes today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The viewpoint of my generation was that any legislation must guarantee <Col N="1074" /> and enshrine the dignity of women. In this city things were much worse than they are now and we saw many a mother being forced out to work in order to rear a family after the loss of the breadwinner.  The system we want is, first of all, something to prevent discrimination, in the way that a woman is discriminated against when she loses her husband and has a family and to augment the State subsidy she has to go into industry to earn a living.  I would welcome any legislation which would ensure that no mother of a family is forced into industry and commerce not because she wants to go but because the system we have may well force her out.  At present she does stand the chance of being discriminated against.  She has already been discriminated against, despite what has been done over the years through children's allowances and widow's pensions which I am glad to say my party introduced.  We are driving on all the time to ensure that we will guarantee and protect the dignity of women and particularly of mothers so that they will be able to stay at home if they wish in order to rear their families.  If a woman decides to go into industry or commerce we must ensure that she will get equal pay for her equal work.  I stress that it is totally immoral that any woman would be denied an adequate salary because she is a woman.</P>
    <P>On the other hand I saw a scene in the city here recently where a woman was delivering stuff from a van and to my mind that woman was not quite able to lift the vessel she was trying to carry.  I thought that there was something wrong when that woman was struggling with that vessel &mdash;I do not know what it contained. She may have been drawing equal pay with the man who was used to the work or she may not.</P>
    <P>I do not think this Bill is going to improve women's opportunities of employment.  It has to go much further. We should drop our patronising attitude towards women.  The Minister in his brief said:</P>
    <P>A policy for the greater involvement of women in managerial positions must be developed.  I do not <Col N="1075" /> believe that managerial ability is concentrated exclusively in the male sex.</P>
    <P>Did anybody ever believe that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It reads that way.  The Minister says that he does not believe that managerial ability is concentrated in the male sex.  Managerial jobs may be but not ability.  Therefore I think he is being patronising.  However, I do not want to hold up the Minister but I will come back to this on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a pretty good discussion on some of the provisions of this legislation.  I might make the point that there has been, perhaps, an unnecessary and excessive sounding of party drums in this area, perhaps excessive claims made about the policy superiority of the Opposition Party by contrast with the record of the Government.  I do not know if this is of very great interest to people concerned with the advancement of women in our society.  It is to be deplored that legislation of this character should meet with that kind of reception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must initially dispose of one matter.  The record suggests that before 1973 nothing&mdash;I stress nothing &mdash;was done in the legislative area to <Col N="1076" /> advance the position of women in Irish society.  The point has been made that the Commission on the Status of Women were set up in 1970.  The point is forgotten that they made an interim report in 1971.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On equal pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On equal pay&mdash; that the final report of the commission was dated 1972, and that the interim report of 1971 asked that there be a phasing-in of equal pay.  Despite this, when this Government came to office in 1973 we found, when we opened up the filing cabinets to see what prepatory work had been got under way, that nothing was in preparation, despite the fact that the then Administration had been preparing for over a decade for entry into the European Community in which legislation relating to women's equality has been on the Statute Book for many years before we jointed the Community.</P>
      <P>It was well known to the Administration then negotiating entry to the Community that equality for women was important social legislation in fundamental legislation of each one of those European countries.  Yet no legislative preparation had been got under way over the 16 years of that Administration's term in Government. I do not know if this kind of point-scoring on a rather serious area is of much interest to us&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not scored yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but excessive time was taken up with this kind of pious platitudinising that we heard this morning from members of the Opposition.  It is hard when you understand that you are a member of a dead Administration which began to legislate in the area as against the ideals, protestations and agreements, which were all we had&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Minister get to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;prior to 1973. We have disposed of this type of partisan area which took up an excessive <Col N="1077" /> amount of our time this morning on this legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not think we can ignore the importance of law in this area or that we can exaggerate it either.  This legislation deals with the position of women in employment, their access to training and measures to ensure that there will be no form of discrimination after its passage, and that no unfair practices will exist.  It will also assist, I would hope, to bring about the required change in public attitudes.  I believe in this area of legislation that until we change our Constitution it cannot be said that we have totally eliminated in our legislation discrimination against women.  The confessional character of the Constitution&mdash; and here I refer in particular as I did in my opening speech, to Article 41 of the Constitution relating to woman's place in the home and to the position of the family, to the non-dissolution of marriage&mdash;has been criticised before, and rightly so, in an island where men and women are murdered because of fanatic hatreds fed in part by misconceptions of the role of religion. I would like a Constitution which favours no branch of the Christian belief over another, a Constitution whose fundamental provisions would be impartial as regards the particular witness of any one Christian religion.  To give an illustration of my meaning, I would favour the secular Constitution of 1922 over what I see increasingly as the confessional Constitutional of 1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking of the place of legislation in the general advance of women in our society, it cannot be said that the legal status of women in Ireland is secure as long as the 1937 Constitution continues in operation.  That Constitution reflects in its various provisions&mdash;and I mentioned Article 41&mdash; a narrow view of woman's role which even in 1937 owed much to a narrow 19th century Catholic social theory on women and their place in society. Even then those who drew it up were ignoring the work of the more advanced Catholic social theorists who were working at that period in the thirties.  It is ironic that while the authors of the narrow irredentist 1937 Constitution were at their work and <Col N="1078" /> confining women to the narrow role in society spelled out in the Constitution, a woman of the stature of Simone de Veil was working extending the frontiers of human consciousness trying to describe a new human understanding of God and creation.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the equality employment agency, which will be set up under this legislation in 1977, will be considering very early the provisions of the 1937 Constitution and will be working on the need for changing that Constitution.  I have no doubt that on Committee Stage we will be mentioning this aspect of the agency's work.  Reference was made to the delays in establishing that agency.  The Committee Stage amendment which will set up that agency will be in length almost equal to the Bill now before us.  I had the choice of introducing a separate Bill dealing with the equality employment agency but thought it better to keep it connected with this Bill.  A great deal of the so-called delay that Deputies have been concerned about relates to the preparation of that legislation and consultation with interests involved. I will be having consultations with the women's representative committee whose chairman, Deputy E. Desmond, contributed this morning, on the staffing and operation of that agency and I will also have consultations with other women's organisations.  That agency will be a permanent guarantor that the status of women in our society will continue to receive attention.</P>
    <P>It has also been said that it will take a year to establish this agency. That happens to be a description of the factual position but I will be disappointed if the agency is not in operation within the first six months of next year.  I accept that this is easier said than done because a great deal of consultation still has to be gone through and there is the question of staffing the agency.</P>
    <P>It was said that during the Labour Party Conference no reference was made to women in the labour debate. We had many important matters to discuss in Limerick and we wished to make arrangements for the continuation of the reform programme <Col N="1079" /> and it took some time before the arrangements were made and the democratic decision taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>And there were diverse views expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is aware of the satisfactory conclusion reached at that conference.  In the labour debate I had only ten minutes to reply.  I used my time to refer to another very important subject, namely, the incomes position.  I did not refer to any legislation under any heads in my reply.  That was the sole reason that there was no reference.  I referred solely to the problems we had of negotiations with unions and employers.</P>
      <P>As I said, there was apparently some misconception that this legislation would not be coming into effect for a year.  I do not know how this misconception arose; it may have been because of misunderstanding of the reference in my Second Reading speech to my hope of seeing the equality employment agency in operation before the end of 1977.  As I explained, I will be very disappointed if it is not in operation in the first six months of next year.</P>
      <P>As soon as this Bill goes through all Stages here and is passed in the Seanad, it will be immediately operational. In other words, I hope to see this legislation incorporated in the early months of next year.  With the co-operation of the House I hope we can get through all Stages while permitting as many helpful additions as possible to be made as it progresses through the various Stages.  I hope we get a speedy passage for this legislation on which there is no disagreement on principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the equal pay controversy.  For the record I would like to be factual about that decision.  I was asked by the two sides of a specific sector of industry to delay implementation of the equal pay legislation.  I referred that request to the Labour Court because the request was based on the feeling of the two sides in the shoe industry that unemployment would follow the implementation of the legislation.  I asked <Col N="1080" /> the court to investigate whether a genuine problem existed in relation to unemployment and the legislation and they reported that, in their opinion, it did and that there was a genuine case.  It was in reply to that joint request for action that I introduced the amendment last year.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the deductions for expenses granted to labourers for income tax purposes are normally flat rate allowances which are given without <Col N="1081" /> production of documentary evidence.

      <P>If, however, a labourer can show that the expenses actually incurred in the performance of his duties exceed the flat rate allowance, a greater amount is allowed as a deduction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received no complaints about low sugar content in the 1976 beet crop but I am informed by the Sugar Company that sugar content is below average this year, because of adverse weather conditions towards the end of the growing season.  I understand that there has been no change in the testing procedure, which is supervised at the fartories by beet growers' representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed to hear the Minister say he has had no complaints <Col N="1088" /> regarding this matter because there is grave concern among the farming community about the drop in the sugar content of beet.  Allegations have been made by growers that there has been a change in the testing procedure.  Will the Minister give the House more detailed information in this connection because the whole industry is concerned?  I believe certain farmers have sent samples to England for testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the farmers' representatives are always present at the intake points in the factories.  They have not complained to the Department that there has been a change in the testing which has had adverse effects on them.  I think it arises from the fact that there have been great difficulties in extracting sugar from the beet in the present year.  This is because of exceptional weather conditions.  A regrowth started when the rains came and when the beet was about ready to harvest.  Some of the sugar went up into the leaves but it increased the yield and in this way the farmers are getting the benefit of increased yields. The sugar content dropped as the yield increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been aware of all the difficulties but I would point out that they are not confined to Ireland.  England has experienced the same problems because of the weather conditions.  It is not due to any fault of the Sugar Company or to any change in the testing process.  Farmers can be assured of that.  As from next year they are changing their methods of testing in Holland and they will pay only on extractable sugar.  It is the farmers' own co-operatives who are processing because of the difficulty of putting on excess nitrogen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be aware of the concern of the farmers about this matter.  There is a fear that if there is a high tonnage yield there will be a low sugar content. Farmers are not satisfied that there is <Col N="1089" /> a uniform system for testing the sugar content.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to provide a fairly even flow of blood samples to the Department's laboratory for testing under the brucellosis eradication scheme, veterinary practitioners have been asked to co-operate as heretofore by spreading their sampling evenly throughout the round now in progress. The weekly rate of sampling suggested would, if adhered to, result in completion <Col N="1090" /> of a round of sampling in well under 12 months.  Supplies of boxes for the return of samples to the laboratory are made available to practitioners on the basis of their weekly requirements as estimated by the district veterinary offices.  These arrangements have worked smoothly in the past and there is no reason to fear that they will now slow up the testing of herds under the scheme. May I say that no round of testing in the past has ever been done in less than 12 months?</P>

      <P>My information is that veterinary surgeons carry out tests on only about 2½ per cent of the herds on their lists.  This means that some herds will not be tested until next August.

      <P>The Deputy in another forum this morning got considerable details of the enormous number of samples that arrive every day at the Department's laboratory for testing. The number is exceptional.  There must be some organisation about this matter.  If a number of veterinary surgeons decided suddenly to devote their entire time to taking blood samples the capacity of the laboratory would not be sufficient to cope with this.  The arrangements now being made will facilitate the completion of a round of testing well under 12 months, done at the rate they are being done.  You cannot expand and contract staff and space in a laboratory, as people think fit, if they want to have any order in the thing.  This order always existed and there is no change in the system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is <Col N="1092" /> aware of the losses suffered by beet suppliers because of the limited capacity of factories for taking in beet and that as a result farmers have to leave their produce on the side of the road for long periods thereby losing considerable sugar content; and if he will make a full statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>While losses can take place in the sugar content of beet stored for long periods, it is understood from the Sugar Company that they do all they can to minimise these losses by arranging, as far as possible, beet deliveries to the factories at the preferred time indicated by growers.</P>
      <P>The company are at present carrying out an extensive programme of modernisation which by increasing factory capacity will appreciably shorten the length of the beet campaign and so contribute towards reducing storage losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the huge losses suffered by producers because the factories were unable to take in the beet at the times scheduled?  As a result of those delays there was a lot of sprouting and because of the cut-off of the sprouts, there was a severe loss of weight for the beet suppliers and there was no way of compensating them.  Has the Minister been made aware of those losses and has he any way of compensating the people for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in the reply, the normal procedure is that growers are asked when they would like to take out their beet.  They are accommodated as far as it is possible to accommodate them on these times. I do not know if it is the grower's fault or the Sugar Company's fault. I believe in the major number of cases it is the grower's fault that he has beet out a long time waiting for collection.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The sugar content of 16 per cent to which payment for beet has been related here since the 1975 crop is the standard for the EEC minimum beet price.  This in turn is the basis for the contract price agreed between the Sugar Company and the growers.</P>
      <P>Information is not available as to the percentage of Irish growers who have achieved the 16 per cent sugar content level but for 1974-75 the average for the whole country for the entire campaign was only fractionally below that level.  It should of course be borne in mind that if a standard below 16 per cent were used for pricing purposes the basic price would be correspondingly reduced.</P>

As far as I am aware, the type of testing carried out here is the same as that being carried out all over Europe. The farmers' representatives are standing by, watching every sample being taken.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he has any proposals to install testing facilities and establish a centre for testing safety frames for tractors in view of the fact that it will be a statutory obligation to have them fitted from September, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the regulations safety frames fitted to tractors as from the 1st September next must be of a type capable of satisfying the <Col N="1096" /> tests prescribed in the OECD standard code for the official testing of agricultural tractors.  New tractors have, of course, complied with these regulations since 1970 and several makes of approved frames are being imported.  An Foras Talúntais are the officially designated authority for the implementation of the code in this country and can arrange for the testing of new types of frames manufactured in this country.  At present this testing is carried out in Britain on the institute's behalf.  This arrangement works satisfactorily and it is not considered that the establishment by the institute of separate testing facilities would be justified at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many smaller engineering firms are interested in manufacturing those safety frames and if they wish to have the prototypes tested they have to be sent to England and it costs something in the region of £500 or £600, plus carriage, to have that test carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">

Will the Department ensure that these facilities are available at the IIRS or the institute as this would be helpful to those small industrialists?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <P>Turbary rights are already provided on the lands for more than 80 local people.  The grazing potential of the remainder of the land is low.  In all the circumstances it is proposed to utilise the lands for afforestation&mdash;the purpose for which they were acquired.</P>

Would the Minister further agree that since his Department acquired these lands, the economics of grazing on lands such as these have changed dramatically and that this is primarily the reason that local smallholders now want to hold on to this mountain land for grazing purposes?

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am advised by the Land Commission that the grazing value of the area is minimal.  The only offer received for a grazing letting of 300 acres for six months up to 31st December 1975 was £12.  According to reports, the land is dangerous for stock.  I understand also that, at the time when the lands were <Col N="1104" /> allocated by the Land Commission for forestry purposes, a canvass was carried out by the Land Commission's local inspectors; local tenants were not, in the main, enthusiastic about taking turbary in the area and a cross-section of them indicated that they would welcome forestry in the district. I should tell the Deputy that, where land is reasonably suitable for Land Commission purposes, that is, for agriculture, it is the policy of my Department to leave it with the Land Commission.  On the other hand, as in this case, where land is unsuitable and, I am told, dangerous for stock, the proper policy is, firstly, to plant, to keep up the planting progress and, secondly, to maintain employment.</P>

Two hundred and ninety seven of these applications mostly received in 1974 were later withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to indicate the precise area involved as areas are not available until cases advance substantially beyond the preliminary stage.  In <Col N="1106" /> 343 cases completed or near completion the total area involved is 14,676 acres.  The number of cases completed is 229.  Of these 224 are receiving their annuities and five qualified for premium only.  In addition, price negotiations have been successfully completed in 114 other cases and the legal formalities are being completed. I am reasonably satisfied with progress made to date.  The level of applications is not, of course, as high as in the initial stages but as with any new scheme many of those who applied for consideration at that time did not have a genuine intention of participating.</P>
    <P>Those making application now, however, are fully aware of the conditions that have to be fulfilled and, accordingly, they are more likely to be genuinely interested in availing of the scheme.

In the first year it is natural to expect infinitely more applications than in succeeding years because there has been publicity for two years before that.  The scheme was brought into operation on the 1st May, 1974. There has been a steady stream of applications since.  There were 86 in the last six months.  The scheme is reasonably successful.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The advantages are that the farmer receives cash for market value.  If he is over 55 and married, he receives a pension of £800 a year for life plus a bonus of 10 per cent of the purchase money up to a maximum of £1,500 in the case of a sale or twice one year's rent subject to a maximum of £3,000 in the case of a lease.  He can continue to work, if he is able, in any other occupation including agriculture as a paid hand.  These are very attractive elements in the scheme.  He may also retain the dwelling house and two acres of land and live where he has always lived.  I am convinced that this is an attractive scheme for those for whom it is intended.  It is a great pity that those genuinely interested in getting farmers who are not successful or who are unhappy in agriculture out of it and getting their land into productive hands do not sell the scheme. Deputy Allen wanted to know if the farmer would not be better off to sell his land by public auction.  That is a matter entirely for himself.  There is no compulsion in this scheme; it is voluntary from beginning to end.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The baseline from which fishery limits are measured is the low water line along the coast except where the method of straight baselines is employed.  Straight baselines may be drawn only where the coastline is deeply indented and cut into or if there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity.</P>
      <P>Under the Straight Baselines Order, 1959, straight baselines were drawn along the west and south coasts which afforded the best possible advantage in determining fisheries limits.  It would not be possible to redraw these baselines to greater advantage without contravening the relevant rules of international law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding sharing the 200-mile limit with our partners is that under the Treaty of Accession negotiated by the previous Government.  The phraseology used applies, unfortunately, not merely to the existing 12-mile band but to fishing limits in the future as well as in the present.  Therefore, because of the wording selected at that time there is an automatic application of the common fisheries policy within the 200-mile zone.  This wording may have been forced on the then Government. What it involves depends on the common fisheries policy and on its renegotiation&mdash;a task that we have embarked on&mdash;but the policy applies automatically.</P>

It is a matter of opinion as to whether there existed a possibility that at some point in the future the 12-mile zone could be extended in other parts of the world.  As I see it, it seems something that was inherently possible even if it was not under active contemplation <Col N="1116" /> at the time.  If I am right in saying that such extension was inherently possible it would have been better if the wording of the Treaty had been such as to confine the common fisheries policy to a 12-mile zone. I have not looked at the files so I do not know whether this situation was due to the Government of the day not foreseeing this possibility or whether during negotiations, the possibility was foreseen but that the Government were not able to succeed in doing something better.</P>

      <P>Obviously that is something we could argue about for a long time.  The Minister knows that there was no concensus in regard to a 200-mile zone at the time of the Treaty of Accession.  Has he considered the effects of article 103 which indicates that before any new regime under the Treaty of Accession could be introduced a survey of the economic and social development of the coastal regions would be presented to the Commission and does the Minister accept that such a survey has not been presented and in view of that, that the provision which was negotiated by the Government was a safeguard on which he could now rely if he was in a position to do so and that he is not so doing?</P>

      <P>I do so regard it and I have, in fact, as the Deputy is aware, made that particular point in my juridical argument before the Council of Ministers.  In my view, the review as I have regarded it at this time taking place now, not being based on a separate and adequate report, is a defective review.  I argued that before the Council of Ministers. The Commission argued on the contrary, that their communication to the Council on which the proposal before the Council was founded contains data which it can legally be sustained, in their view, is such a report.  I have not accepted that.  It seems to me on the facts to be incorrect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, we had put down this amendment because we maintained on the Second Reading &mdash;and we still do&mdash;that the amount of money provided under this section, £300,000, is a very small sum and in our opinion would be totally inadequate. I am not disputing the decision of the Chair on the amendment.  In our opinion this sum would not be sufficient to meet the needs as we know them in order to give connections and bring current to many people, in rural Ireland particularly. We have no way of calculating what would cover everyone in rural Ireland who is being quoted a very large figure, apart from those who have been quoted prior to March, 1975.  Surely the ESB would be capable of providing a figure for the Minister if requested to do so because they have now come up with the terms of the easy payments scheme for those not included in this Bill.  They must have figures available.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's Second Reading speech it was mentioned that those people who were quoted a figure for electricity supply prior to March, 1975, were the people who would benefit under the Bill.  As he put it, all householders in each of these areas where work remains to be done, whether already quoted terms or not, who applied and qualified for subsidised supplies before 31st March, 1975, will still get supply on subsidised terms.  The Minister has also said that this was the sum requested by the ESB.  I do not know how they justify this.  I am sure the Minister will know that, since the Second Reading of the Bill, as most of us on this side of the House also know, there are very many people who are in grave doubt as to whether they will come under the Bill or not.  They have been in touch with us and, I suppose, with the Minister and with others on the opposite side of the House in an effort to get the position clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We accept that those who were <Col N="1122" /> quoted terms before March, 1975, will get supplies, but people are not clear as to where such people are, in what counties and so on.  I ask the Minister to be more specific in order to clarify the position generally.  Some people were quoted before March, 1975, and have since been quoted higher figures. Will they still come under the Bill even though some of the higher quotations have come quite recently?  There are also people who were quoted before this date and have paid the capital sums they were asked for, in some cases very recently.  Will they get a refund under this subsidy scheme because of the fact that they did pay when so many others did not?  We would like this clarified.</P>
    <P>There are also cases which have emerged since the Second Reading in which householders were quoted, but the houses or properties have now changed hands.  Their previous owners would have come under the Bill if they had remained in ownership of these properties.  They have changed hands.  Will the subsidy apply to the new owners in these cases?  I would like if the Minister could clarify these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who are covered by this section are clearly set out in subsection (1) (a), (b) and (c) which states that this Bill applies to people the cost of whose connection for rural electrification under the subsidised scheme exceeds £700, who are asked for a capital contribution and who refuse this supply because they could not afford that capital contribution. The State will now pay that capital contribution for them.</P>
      <P>As regards the size of the sum, I explained in my reply on Second Reading and on a number of other occasions that this is the assessment by the authorities in this field, the ESB, of the amount required, but this is not the total subsidy being paid in connection with these houses.  As I also said, the cost of rural electrification during the almost 30 years that it was in operation was about £80 million of which the State paid £27 million.  This £300,000 in the Bill is roughly in the same ratio to the total cost as the £27 million is to the £80 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> As regards those people whom Deputy Barrett speaks about who had the house originally and refused the terms and sold the house to which electricity has not yet been connected, of course that house is entitled to the benefits of the scheme.  As regards the people who were quoted terms even recently and have actually paid the money, if the connection has not been made the money will be refunded. However, the Deputy will appreciate that there must be a cut-off point at some stage at which we cannot have a retrospective Bill.  Obviously, if you start by including one category there would be pressure from, perhaps understandably, groups of people who are looking to have their category included again and we would get back to 1946, to anybody who paid capital contribution in the last 30 years.</P>
    <P>The people who are included in this are people whose cost of connection of rural electrification under the last phase of the rural electrification scheme was more than £700, from whom a capital contribution was required of an amount above £700 and to whom connection was refused because the people could not afford this capital contribution.</P>
    <P>Did I leave out any categories that Deputy Barrett asked about?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a further point to make.  The sum of £300,000 as far as the ESB and the people of rural Ireland are concerned is nothing. It is chicken feed.  It costs approximately £150 to £200 to put down one <Col N="1124" /> pole.  That is the quotation that any householder will get today from the ESB.  For £300,000 you can put down something in the region of 1,600 to 2,000 poles.  I am perfectly satisfied that it will take more than 2,000 poles to cover the Black Valley, Ballycroy and Woodford alone, not to mind covering other areas which are left out. I ask the Minister to tell the House exactly how many householders he intends to cover under this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that there were approximately 800 to 900 householders to be covered under this Bill despite the fact that the ESB survey had not been completed at the time he made this announcement.  I would ask him to say when the ESB survey will be completed and what he thinks the figure will be then.  I would also ask him to say what areas he intends to cover with this small sum of £300,000 which will mean the erection of approximately, 1,600 to 2,000 poles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obviously not getting my point across or else people do not understand what I am saying. I have explained this point dozens of times in this House in answer to questions, on Second Stage and again now.  The £300,000 is not the total cost of connecting these houses to rural electrification.  It is the State subsidy towards connecting to rural electrification.  There are two sets of people who are contributing to the cost.  They are the ESB themselves and the people who are looking for electricity supply.  The £300,000 is paying only the capital contributions required for them.  If it costs £800 to connect a house to electricity that is the cost of the connection, the poles, wiring, everything else that goes into bringing a supply into a house.  The ESB will recover £700 of that.  One is by the fixed charge and that in rural areas is decided on a square feet or ground floor basis and varies from one house to another.  You cannot be precise until you measure a house as to how much it will cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the £700 part of the cost the ESB require a return on the capital they have invested of 5.2 per cent of the £700, that is, £26.40 a year.  Out <Col N="1125" /> of that £26.40 comes a fixed charge of £12 and the balance is a special service charge which is the customer's contribution towards the capital cost of connecting him or her to electricity.  Where this cost of connection goes over £700 the ESB have been asking for a capital contribution of the amount over £700 involved. In the example I have given the customer would be required to pay £26.40 special service charge, £12 fixed charge and £100 cash, money. That is what the State will be paying and this Bill is about the £100 capital contribution the State is now going to pay.  This is the amount that is estimated by the ESB and it can only be estimated when the other costs are charged up.  This is the amount estimated by competent people.  Deputy O'Leary said that the ESB consider this sum totally inadequate. That is not so.  It is their estimate that the number of houses in the country is 800 to 900 and the capital contribution cost of those is in their estimation less than £300,000. We are putting a bit more in lest their estimation is on the conservative side and there are more houses involved. I hope Deputies have got this point.  I have explained it dozens of times.  To me it seems quite simple but, obviously, I am much more familiar with it than anybody else in the House.</P>

      <P>Do I take it that in paragraph (b) in relation to the £700 that the Minister is now clearly stating that the Bill applies only in the case where the capital charges are in excess of £700?  In his Second Reading speech he mentioned the sum of £36.40 and he now mentions £26.40.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still not clear about the £700.  It appears that people will have to pay a portion of this capital charge of £700.  In other words, the Bill as presented, does not provide a situation where people are getting <Col N="1126" /> electricity free as we were led to believe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to have spelled out quite clearly what is involved for the people whose capital charges are less than £700.  I understand the position where charges are over £700.  For how long will this £36.40 apply?  Is it a fixed charge which will continue over a period of years or is it a charge the consumer will have to pay while he has the electric power?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody pays a fixed charge.  That is there on every bill for all time.  The special service charge which, in the example I gave, was £36.40 minus £12 would be £24.40, can be bought if anybody so wishes.  Special service charges under the rural electrification scheme can always be bought out at a multiple of the amount.  The purchase price was 11 years but it is now being reduced to nine years because interest rates have risen.</P>
      <P>I was quite specific when I spoke in Deputy Gallagher's constituency and made it absolutely clear and I was satisfied the people knew that what is involved here is that they will not have to pay a capital contribution.  Deputy Gallagher mentioned cases where the cost of connection was under £700. They would not have been asked for a capital contribution at any stage.  They would have made their contribution to the £700, or a lesser charge, by means of the fixed charge plus the special service charge.</P>

      <P>The £36.40 will in each individual case be compounded differently according to the fixed charge.  In the example I gave it is £12 for the fixed charge and £24.40 for the service charge.  The fixed charge cannot be bought, but the £24.40 can be bought at the moment on a nine years' purchase.  It could happen that the house next door would have a fixed charge of £8 and a special service charge of £28.40.  The £28.40 can be bought on a nine years' purchase, but this varies from house to house.  You <Col N="1128" /> cannot give a blanket example that covers every house because the floor space in every house is different.</P>
      <P>Under this scheme anybody whose house is connected for electricity will be paying £36.40 a year.  That will be made up of two elements&mdash;a fixed charge, which cannot be bought and varies according to the square footage of the house, and the special service charge which is £36.40 minus the fixed charge, and that portion can now be bought on a nine years' purchase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They would have to come under the terms of the rural electrification scheme, 1971 to 1975, and people under £700 under that scheme would not be asked for a capital contribution and they would not therefore come under the terms of the Bill.  It is only those asked for a capital contribution who come under the terms of the Bill.  By definition, the Bill applies to people the cost of whose connection is over £700.  Anyone under that would not be in.</P>

      <P>It is obvious from the discussion that there is great confusion. Perhaps the Minister could help to resolve that confusion if he would have a pamphlet prepared outlining in greater detail what is involved and who qualifies for what <Col N="1131" /> under the Bill.  As we progress the position seems to be getting more confused.  The confusion must be even worse where those affected are concerned.  Even in the ESB there seems to be a certain amount of confusion as to who will and who will not benefit.  In one case I was told that where a person was quoted something over £1,200, as she was not quoted a capital contribution under the subsidised scheme, she was not eligible for a subsidy.  It is all very confusing and it is difficult to be helpful or co-operate in this confused situation.  Like Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Barrett, I, too, get a number of inquiries and, like them, I am wondering if £300,000 will be enough. Perhaps the Minister would give us something in writing to enable us to explain better the whole situation to the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to do that in one last effort.  The cost of connection is £1,200.  That is the amount of money the ESB will have to expend to bring electricity from the nearest point of connection to the actual house involved.  The £700 is made up of (a) a fixed charge and (b) a special service charge.  Now the fixed charge varies from house to house depending on the square footage.  The example I gave was a fixed charge of £1,200 and the special service charge &mdash;the ESB like to have a return on their capital of £700 at the rate of 5.2 per cent&mdash;is £36.40 on the £700.  Now there are two elements in the £36.40. One is the fixed charge.  The special service charge for the £700 is £36.40 less the £12, making a total of £24.40. If the £12 were £15 the special service charge would be £21.40.  One is dependent on the other.  That accounts for the first £700 of the £1,200 it costs to connect a house and the balance of £500 is called a capital contribution. Under the rural electrification scheme, 1971-75, this was required to be paid by people where the cost of connection was more than £700.  It varied in amounts from £50 to £1,000.  Many people paid it but there were others in the more remote areas&mdash;in the Black Valley, Woodford and in Ballycroy&mdash;<Col N="1132" /> who had not the cash to pay the capital contribution and they had to refuse the connection.  In this Bill we are now paying that capital contribution for those people.  I hope everybody is enlightened on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>A short time ago the Minister mentioned that it was necessary to have a cut-off point with regard to refunds.  As I understood it, he said that if a person had been given a quotation and had qualified, if he paid the capital charge but if connection had not been made, a refund of the capital charge would be made to him. It appears there is a strong case for referring the cut-off point for refunds back to 31st March, 1975.  I do not know what it would involve by way of refunds from the ESB.  To a certain extent we are victimising people who have paid after 1975.  Would it not be worth considering giving refunds of amounts paid after 31st March, 1975, to make that date the cut-off point?  I do not know what money would be involved, but it would appear to be a more just and fair way of rectifying the matter.</P>
      <P>There has been reference to people who have received subsidised quotations prior to 31st March, 1975.  I take it that this means quotations under the rural electrification schemes of the past.  There were occasions when the ESB decided that certain districts were completed under such a scheme quite some time before 31st March, 1975, and there may be people who received quotations but who are now excluded from the provisions of this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will tell the House if areas were completed under the subsidised scheme long before 31st March, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is referring to people in what are called &ldquo;closed&rdquo; areas who were quoted terms that included a capital contribution but who did not get electricity because they could not pay the capital contribution.</P>

      <P>They are included. It would not be possible to put back the cut-off point to 1975 because after the 1971-1975 scheme finished it would be necessary to go back to the earlier date, 1971, and include everybody. There might have been a fall-over from 31st March, 1975, in the actual quotations but the people concerned still came under the 1971-1975 scheme.  It would be necessary to go back four years and that would not be possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that under the rural electrification schemes in the past the Government and the ESB carried those schemes.  I think he said that the Government put up £80 million and the ESB £27 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole operation cost £80 million, of which the Government paid £27 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the ESB funded £53 million as against £27 million by the Government.  This brings us to the manner in which the ESB carry out their work and fund their various operations.  If we look at the annual report for last year and if we take note of a reply by the Minister to a question I put down last week, we will see that since March, 1973, the ESB have borrowed a substantial amount of money outside the sterling area.  They have borrowed US $132 million; Swiss francs 51 million; Belgian francs 1,700 million; French francs 40 million.  If converted to sterling it means that since March, 1973, the ESB have borrowed £125 million outside the sterling area and this is quite a sum.  According to their annual report the currency adjustment losses provided for in their accounts at 31st March, 1976, amounted to £23,871,278 and I estimate that an amount in the region of <Col N="1134" /> £24 million at least will have to be provided for the year ending 31st March, 1977.  The only way that can be provided is from the accounts paid by the customers.  At the same time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to do with the manner in which the ESB will make up the remainder of the cost in this instance.  The Government are only making up part of the cost.  It has to do with the financial structure of the ESB and the manner in which they use the money available to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling. If one follows this argument to its logical conclusion it means that 25p out of every £ ESB customers pay in bill goes towards the currency adjustment or the interest on foreign borrowings. We find that £125 million has been borrowed in three years outside the sterling area.  Could this be employed in a more advantageous manner?  Could part of this foreign borrowing have been put towards the cost of rural electrification which we are now discussing under this Bill?</P>

      <P>A sum of £300,000 has been mentioned in the Bill, which is the Government subsidy towards the capital cost for the people quoted prior to 1975.  What would it have cost <Col N="1135" /> if the ESB included all houses now receiving quotations in rural Ireland? We all welcome the tendency nowadays to build homes in rural Ireland and maintain the population there. Those people are receiving very hefty bills at the moment.  The Minister, in reply to a question last week, said that the new scheme he mentioned on the Second Stage of this Bill, about easy payments which the ESB have now devised, will mean that the people excluded by this Bill will now have to pay the first £300 after the £700 we have been talking about.</P>

      <P>Surely those people could have been included in the money provided under this Bill and given some relief towards the amount they are being asked to pay.  Our amendment was rejected.  We mentioned a figure of £1,500,000.  If the Minister increased the £300,000 to even £1,000,000 this would allow the ESB, if they did not require it all, to have something to work on so that they could embrace more people than the number that will be embraced by this Bill.  This would have eased the burden for a lot of people.  If a sum of £1,500,000 was provided it would help subsidise the people who will not be included in this Bill.  Many of those people come with very high quotations to us regularly.  Something should have been done for them.</P>

      <P>I am still not satisfied with the Minister's reply to my previous question that the sum of £300,000 under section 2 (4) is sufficient. I am satisfied it is not.  Will the Minister specifically reply to the following questions: (1) Why is there no time limit in this Bill for the ESB to carry out their functions in this Bill in relation to the whole country? (2) When was the survey by the ESB which stated that there were 800 to 900 houses only involved in the country completed?  (3) How many houses in the Minister's opinion are to be connected in the country and should be connected if all the people eligible accept the terms of this Bill? (4) How many poles&mdash;this is vitally important&mdash;are to be erected throughout the country under this Bill?  The number of poles is far more important than the number of houses because the cost will be incurred in the erection of the poles and not in respect of the householders and the connections. (5) How many transformers are to be erected under this Bill for £300,000?  I am not satisfied with section 2 unless the Minister gives me a satisfactory reply to each of the questions I have now put to him. They are reasonable questions which deserve reasonable replies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will not be satisfied because I cannot give him specific answers to the questions he has asked.  This estimation was made at the time I went to the Government to have this Bill drafted.  The ESB estimation then was 800 to 900 houses. I do not know what information Deputy O'Leary can have that would be different from the information the head office of the ESB have, drawing together information from all parts of the country.  The Deputy may have somebody in the ESB in Kerry who <Col N="1137" /> says to him: &ldquo;That is a ridiculous figure.  If there are 24 houses in the Black Valley and you multiply that by X you will get far more than 800 to 900 houses.&rdquo;  Perhaps that is the kind of sum being done.  The ESB head office are a responsible body and if they thought there was more than this amount they would put it in because they would want the Government to pay their share of connecting them rather than leave the ESB to carry the excess.</P>
      <P>As regards the fact that there is not a time limit on this, I thought about it and I decided if there was a time limit, such as suggested by somebody on the Second Stage, of 31st December, 1977, there would be a danger, coming to the autumn of next year, that because it was written into the Act, the ESB would have to do this work.  They would perhaps have to do it by drawing men away from other areas the houses in which are equally entitled to a supply of electricity or where there are people looking for newer transformers or three phase electricity for milking parlours and so forth.</P>
      <P>I thought it best to leave out a time limit but to impress on the ESB that I want it done quickly.  I cannot be specific on the number of houses. This is their estimation.  The cost is what we estimate it should cost plus a bit of fat in case that is wrong.  As to the number of transformers, I just have not got a notion.</P>

      <P>I do not know the number of poles or the number of transformers.  The ESB say the number is between 800 and 900.  The assessment of the cost is £300,000.  That is the sum I am asking the Dáil for.  Unfortunately, Deputy O'Leary was missing when I explained this on a previous occasion.  This is not an election Bill.  If it were, it should have been introduced after his by-election in 1967 when he promised it or his speakers promised it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions posed by Deputy O'Leary are reasonable.  I accept that the Minister cannot answer them today.  From calculating their estimate for this work the ESB must have the answers to those questions. In arriving at a figure of £300,000, they must have added up the number of poles, transformers, the mileage of electric wires and the cost of the labour involved.  Perhaps that information is not available to the Minister today and, therefore, he cannot answer Deputy O'Leary's questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Reading the Minister <Col N="1139" /> said he was setting his face against any further extension of the rural electrification scheme.  This will be a cause of worry to people who are building houses in rural areas which are not sited near an ESB line.  Consequently, the cost of extending electricity to them would be great.  The Minister should not close the door altogether.  In a few years' time some Government may take up the case of those people, even though they may be excluded from the terms of this Bill and legislation may be introduced or this legislation may be amended to include them.  A big number of people in rural Ireland will be affected and I should not like to see the door closed finally on them. They should be given an opportunity of getting the benefit of rural electrification.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that people in backward places have to suffer because of the fact that they are born in a certain area.  They have to live there and bring up their families there. They have no option but to stay there. It is unfortunate that, when schemes of this nature are being introduced, those people have to suffer and they cannot be accommodated in the same way as a person living near a main arterial road.  They cannot get the benefits of rural electrification, the telephone service, water supply schemes, and so on.  I do not think that is right.  Even though it would cost the Exchequer more money to bring those schemes to their doors, they should be accommodated.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking on Second Stage I mentioned the importance of having three phase current in most of our small towns and villages where many projects could be started.  Small industries could be encouraged if the people concerned had sufficient current to use the necessary machinery and put it into operation.  This would be an expensive exercise, but perhaps it would not be all that expensive because many towns are serviced by three phase current already.  It would be worth a try to give people in backward areas a chance to improve their area, to encourage industry and give employment to a small number of <Col N="1140" /> people&mdash;even to four or five would be a great asset to the area.  When legislation like this is introduced, those matters should be considered.  There should be no need to come back in two or three years' time, when possibly some industrialist is attempting to start an industry, and ask the ESB to provide three phase current.  The cost is then too high and the industrialist is frightened away to some other area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not yet quite clear on some of these sections. However, the Minister said he will issue a circular giving quotations and examples of what people will have to pay.  When we get that we can read it and digest it.  I cannot understand the fact that the Minister was not able to answer some of the questions put to him by Deputy O'Leary.  I have no bee in my bonnet.  If the ESB and the Minister's Department want to arrive at a realistic figure all these questions about mileage wires, poles and transformers must be gone into. The Minister admitted honestly that he did not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I want to get an estimate for something at home I must go into detail.  I must add a certain amount for inflation.  Another relevant question is: when is it proposed that this work will be finished? Will there be more inflation before it is finished?  I thought with the help of his back-up group the Minister would be able to answer Deputy O'Leary's questions approximately.  Apparently no research was done.  I am very unhappy about that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hussey mentioned the fact that this is a once and for all Bill.  I do not think that should be the case. Some people will avail of this provision and other may not be able to avail of it.  We should not give the impression to the country at large that this terminates the job; either one is included or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am still not crystal clear.  I suppose the Minister will smile and say it is difficult to be crystal clear about <Col N="1141" /> the implications of section 2.  But I expect that his Department will furnish us with some kind of an explanatory document we can give to people who inquire whether or not they are included and what it will cost them.  I am disappointed that the Minister was unable to give a more clear-cut answer to the questions posed by Deputy O'Leary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We are still at a loss to understand why the ESB requested only a sum of £300,000.  The Minister has told us that that is all they sought. Therefore, the fault must lie on the ESB's side&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  There is another reason why we dispute this amount.  Several months after the Minister's Ballycroy statement&mdash;I happened to be present that morning &mdash;about introducing the necessary legislation a few colleagues and I visited the ESB.  We asked them then if they had any idea how much they would be requesting the Minister to provide in the legislation he had undertaken to introduce in this House.  Deputy J. O'Leary was present with me on that occasion and they told us that they expected the amount would be in the region of £1 million which they would be requesting the Minister to supply by way of subsidy. As well as the chairman, there were other top brass of the ESB present. Yet, when the Bill was published, we found a sum of £300,000 mentioned. Even since Second Reading many people have come forward with inquiries as to whether or not they will be included.  We raised some of these queries here and the Minister has clarified some.  But we are beginning to treat ESB estimates with the gravest suspicion, as has been pointed out by some of my colleagues, with regard to the number of houses and poles that this money, plus the ESB's contribution, will provide and the effect it will have with the exception of a few areas such as Ballycroy and the Black Valley.  We fail to see how it will be adequate in easing the burden of those who have to meet <Col N="1142" /> huge costs, capital or otherwise, of being connected to electricity, which is a must for all people.</P>
      <P>When submitting their request for a given sum of money, it was an opportunity for the ESB to have included many more people in this subsidy, thereby making it easier for people to be connected as well as for those building new houses in rural areas who are very badly hit and who will not be included in the provisions of this Bill.  In our opinion this was an occasion to have a proper job carried out; if you like, to set their sights on completing rural electrification in a more general sense than is covered in the Bill.</P>
      <P>On Second Reading I mentioned people who have already been connected whether under the rural electrification scheme or otherwise.  Some people have built new houses.  Even though, prior to building those houses, they were customers of the ESB, they are asked now to pay the cost of connection to the new house. In some cases such houses are only a few hundred yards away from the older ones.  I know of one case where the people have had to pay £800.  Yet their new residence is only a short distance away from the old one.  The ESB are discontinuing the service to the old house but, nevertheless, these people are being treated as new customers.  Some provision should have been made for such people.</P>
      <P>It is easy to say that the ESB cannot make forecasts very far ahead. They can and they have batteries of accountants and so on in their establishment who from year to year know what is going to be required to meet their commitments.  For example, they were able to make forecasts of the growing demand for energy over a period of eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet they cannot make estimates about the £300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying they were able to forecast that eight years ahead but, of course, that forecast has been completely deflated by the oil crisis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We question the £300,000.  We fail to understand how the ESB some months ago told myself and three other Deputies from this side of the House, in the presence of their chairman, that they expected that the sum they would be requiring the Minister to provide in this Bill would be in the region of £1 million. Now we discover that the sum is £300,000.  Either they were wrong then and they are right now or they are wrong now and they were right then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suspect what they told the Deputy and his colleagues on that occasion was that the total cost of connecting these 800 houses would be nearly £1 million but they did not go on to say that the State would contribute £300,000; that is the same ratio of 27:80.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a letter here dated 22nd November from the ESB saying the figure of £300,000 was based on the best estimates of the 825 householders; that is in the last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there is a letter.  I am quoting our experience. We have also criticised the fact that more people were not included and that the ESB did not see fit to make a request for a larger amount of money in order to facilitate people excluded from the Bill.  We continue to maintain that this money is inadequate, that they could have done a much better job had they gone about it a different way.  That has been spelled out often enough here.  Perhaps the <Col N="1144" /> Minister would clarify also the question of the deferred payments system for these people mentioned by the Minister himself on Second Reading.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister says &ldquo;rural areas&rdquo; does he mean individual cases or a group of houses?  In some cases in my area the ESB are requesting over £2,000, a sum which could not be met by people living in the area I have in mind.  A figure of 825 houses was mentioned. What percentage of that would be in the Gaeltacht areas?  The Gaeltacht is an area that we would like to throw a little more light on in every respect to help it to establish small industries and it is only right and proper that something should be done. They have been left in the dark in many respects and I would like clarification. I welcome this Bill.  It may <Col N="1145" /> not be all that we want but at least it is a step in the right direction.</P>

It was not clear until the Bill was published last June or July that it would be so restricted in regard to the number of people and households to which it would apply.  The Bill represented an opportunity for the ESB and the Minister working together to do a proper job regarding ESB installations in connection with this very <Col N="1149" /> annoying and ongoing problem which we all come up against every week and every day in some weeks when people come to us asking us if there is any way of getting quotations reduced. This is a very grave problem throughout the country as we have all learned in recent years.  We are most disappointed that sufficient money was not made available to tackle it.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the arrangements to be made in connection with the assessment of the adequacy of security taken by a society and the persons who may report on the value of the security.  A duty is imposed on every director of a society to satisfy himself that the arrangements for assessing the adequacy of the security to be taken in respect of loans will ensure that the security will be assessed by a director or other officer of the society and that every such person or persons assessing the adequacy of the security shall have available a written report prepared and signed by a competent and experienced person other than an officer. The report shall refer to the value of any freehold or leasehold estate and to any other matter likely to affect the value of the security.  A report prepared by a person who has a financial interest in the disposal of the estate in question shall not be accepted by the person or persons assessing the adequacy of the security. Furthermore, the person assessing the adequacy of the security shall not be persons who have a financial interest in the disposal of the estate in question or persons who are entitled to receive any commission for introducing the parties to the transactions involving that disposal.</P>
      <P>This section, which is new, is considered a necessary safeguard to ensure that adequate procedures exist for the evaluation and assessment of securities being offered for loans that such evaluation and assessment be carried out in an impartial manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am far from happy about section 80 of this Bill. <Col N="1153" /> I have always had strong feelings regarding the propriety or otherwise of issuing loans on second mortgages or second charges.  I would even go so far as to say that local authorities should give a loan on a second charge or a second mortgage provided always that the value of the existing house or the house being erected on a building site exceeds by far the amount of first mortgage plus second mortgage or second charge.  I know personally that building societies have been very reluctant to, and rarely if ever do, give a loan on a second mortgage or a second charge.  This imposes grave hardship on many persons building or buying houses.  Some of these people go to the bank where the interest rate is rather high, but, more important still, the lending period is very short indeed.</P>
      <P>I am firmly convinced that there is nothing wrong whatsoever with the local authority or a building society giving a loan on a second mortgage or a second charge in the same way as banks very often do in respect of business premises or commercial enterprises. The building society would, of course, take the necessary steps to make sure that the value of the property would by far exceed the amount of the mortgages or the charges in the same way as the bank would.  Up to now the building societies have refused to give loans on second mortgage and second charge, but we have now reached the situation that if this Bill goes through with this section in it the building societies would say: &ldquo;Sorry, but we are now compelled by law not to give a loan on a second mortgage or a second charge because it would be illegal for us to do so&rdquo;. That just closes the case, but up to now it has been optional at least. From now onwards the books will be closed.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether this section is really necessary.  I have grave doubts about it.  I do not think it is necessary in this Bill because if the building society wants to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, they can say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, without being compelled by law to say it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to explain why it is necessary <Col N="1154" /> to have this section because I do not think that any society would be expected, as it were, to make a second mortgage on a situation where it does not relate to a prior mortgage made by the society.  For that reason I am wondering, first of all, why it is there.  Secondly, I would like to develop in a brief way the point made by Deputy O'Leary.  Where a society might for some lawful reason wish to make a second mortgage payable in favour of or in relation to a loan taken out from some other agency why should they be prohibited from doing so?  We find at present that some institutions lending money for the building of houses, including the local authorities, are in some circumstances very limited in the amount that they make available and the second loan is necessary in many cases.  Building societies, as I said a moment ago, might be slow to grant a second mortgage, but at least without this insertion they have the right to do so, again, as Deputy O'Leary said, provided that the value of the freehold or leasehold estate is not exceeded. For that reason there seems to be a case for at least leaving it to the discretion of the building societies. As I pointed out a moment ago, the total amount available for the SDA loans is very much below the level necessary to either build or buy a new house.  Therefore, the person who manages to get one of these loans needs a further sum of money to buy or build the house.  If building societies are willing to make that money available, they should have the right to do so.  I would like to hear why this section was included in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary misunderstood the position.  It is a re-enactment of a section of the 1894 Act.  Under existing legislation building societies are not allowed to give second mortgages.  As Deputy Faulkner rightly said, not many societies would give it. I believe it is right to put in this section because the societies will not have to face long arguments.  The law is there.  It has worked for 100 years and will continue to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been another misinterpretation <Col N="1155" /> about banks.  At present banks give second mortgages at very high interest rates because they can take risks building societies cannot.  For the last two years banks have been giving house building loans on a 20-year repayment, as distinct from second mortgages.  As Deputy Faulkner said, there is a big difference between the amount given by SDA loans and the amount necessary to build a house. At the same time, the new scheme will allow many people to get as much money as they require to build a house if they are in that category.  This point should not be contentious because it is simply a re-enactment of existing legislation and it is sensible to have it there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I was afraid that that would be the answer&mdash;that it is simply a re-enactment of existing legislation.  What we are doing here is bringing the legislation up to date. The circumstances which pertained when the original Act was passed have changed considerably.  Because this was part of the original legislation is no reason why it should be included here, especially if we can devise a new section which would be to the advantage of people who need to borrow.</P>
      <P>I agree that building societies are not likely to break their necks giving loans on a second mortgage, but it seems to be particularly prohibitive that we are writing into law, at a time when people are anxious to buy or build their own houses and cannot get mortgages from other sources, that building societies, whether they like it or not, cannot make a loan on a second mortgage.</P>
      <P>As I said, legislation passed 100 years ago would not be suitable for the present day.  I believe this is a good Bill and has made some very worth-while changes.  We should not rely simply on the fact that this section was in the previous legislation or that it would create problems for the building societies because they would have to argue with their customers as to whether they would give the loans.  It should only be there if we believe it is the proper thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> Deputy O'Leary made the case that showed that something better could have been substituted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the provision is a re-enactment of section 13 (1) of the 1894 Act.  As Deputy Faulkner said, that should not be the only reason and, of course, it is not. Common sense is another reason.  If a society makes loans on the security of property which was subject to a prior charge, not in favour of the society, the risk of incurring losses in the event of repossession of the property would be greatly increased as the amount outstanding on foot of the first charge would have to be settled in full before any part of the society's claim on foot of its interest in the property could be met.</P>
      <P>The situation is that somebody might borrow a certain amount of money and have a first charge on the property.  If the building societies proceeded to lend money on it at the normal rate of interest and if for any reason, failure to make repayments or repay interest over a period of a relatively short time, it could end with the building society getting very little after the first charge was satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>That is hardly worth discussing.  While I agree that Deputy O'Leary made a good case, we know building societies would concern themselves with the legal aspect before giving the loan.  What Deputy O'Leary objected to, and what I find objectionable, is the specific proviso which states that they cannot make this type of loan whether they like it or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>Deputy O'Leary said that up to now it was possible for building societies to give a second mortgage.  It was not possible because the 1894 Act stipulated that it could not be done.  It is imperative that the avoidance of losses should be safeguarded against.  If second mortgages <Col N="1157" /> were given and even a relatively small number turned sour and they failed to recover on them, there would be talk that the building societies were lending money on bad securities and they were not safe places to put money.  As Deputy Faulkner said, it is not worth talking about because even if we did not put it in, building societies would not lend money on a second mortgage.  It is to ensure that they do not put at risk investors' money that that section is there.</P>

      <P>Because the section is in the 1894 Act, does not necessarily mean it should be in the 1976 Bill.  It is well known that managers, secretaries and accountants of building societies are good business people.  They know if it is proper to give a second mortgage. They are the best people in the world to assess an applicant for the second mortgage or charge.  These societies should not be compelled by law not to consider a second application.</P>

Subsections (2) and (3) of section 12 made special provisions in relation to societies established before 1894; such provisions are no longer necessary.  In other <Col N="1158" /> words, they were a feature of very early societies but are not appropriate to modern building society operations.

      <P>Almost every building society mortgage confers on the society a power of sale of the mortgaged property in the event of default in making repayments, or on the breach by the mortgagor of some provision contained in the mortgage deed or in the rules of the society.  At present there is no statutory obligation on a society, on exercising a power of sale, to give to the defaulting borrower the value of his equity in the property, although it is the practice of the societies to do so.  This section, which follows in part the lines of section 39 (6) of the Housing Act, 1966, will put the matter on a statutory basis. I think it is a very good idea that this should be done.</P>

      <P>Under the section, where a society recovers possession of a mortgaged property on the default of the mortgagor and the property is sold, the society shall pay to the mortgagor the price obtained less the outstanding principal on the loan, interest and cost incurred by the society in the recovery and disposal of the property.  The section also provides that all practicable steps shall be taken to ensure that the property is sold for the best price reasonably obtainable at the time of sale and that the society shall, within 21 days of the completion of the sale, send to the mortgagor particulars of the sale in such form as the registrar may require. In addition to this latter requirement, the further provision is made that nothing in the section shall affect the operation of any rule of law relating to the duty of a mortgagee to account to a mortgagor.  As the period over which a building society loan is repayable normally extends for 20 years or more, the term &ldquo;mortgagor&rdquo; is defined to include the successors in title to a person to whom a loan is made by a society, so that the rights enjoyed by a mortgagor in this section shall also be enjoyed by his successors in title.</P>

    <P>Is there any way we can ensure this <Col N="1160" /> is done?  We do not want the case of two fellows walking in, one offering £X and the other offering £X+1 in which case he, being the highest bidder, will get the house and the amount offered may not represent the market value at all.

      <P>The best price will be obtained.  The house will be sold by auction.  Sometimes, and I am sure the Deputy is aware of this, when a bank sale takes place there is a boycott and the person who originally owned the property is able to buy it back at a fraction of what it cost. That is not what Deputy Moore has in mind.  I will check on this, but I am sure there would be a right of appeal to the registrar and possibly to the courts for someone who felt he had not got fair value.</P>

It will be noted that, in the case of registered land, a receipt under the seal of the society that all moneys secured by mortgage were fully paid shall be sufficient proof of the satisfaction of the mortgage and, in the case of unregistered land, such a receipt shall reconvey and vest the estate in the mortgagor without the necessity for a formal reconveyance or resurrender.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 49, before section 85, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;85. &mdash;The Registrar shall be appointed by the Government and may be removed by the Minister. Such removal shall not take effect except on the passage of a motion by each House of the Oireachtas with a two-thirds majority of those voting in each House&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is very important so far as we are concerned and it has grown in importance since the passing of the Friendly Societies Bill recently. Prior to that I was satisfied to have the Registrar for friendly societies act as registrar for building societies though I had put in an amendment to strengthen the hand of the registrar and I had hoped that during the passage of the Bill in relation to friendly societies the position of the registrar would have been strengthened.  When I noticed in the Friendly Societies Bill that the registrar could be removed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at will I became perturbed and I spoke in favour of an amendment tabled by Deputy O'Malley, the purpose of which was to ensure that the registrar could not be dismissed in this summary fashion but rather that the Oireachtas would be called upon to decide the issue in the event of the need arising to remove the registrar from office.  The Parliamentary Secretary, who was dealing with the Bill, resisted that amendment and we were <Col N="1162" /> left in a situation where the Minister for Industry and Commerce could remove the registrar from office when he felt like it.  This insecurity will mean that the registrar will feel obliged to conform to a considerable extent to the wishes of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the other Ministers concerned in the Building Societies Bill and the freedom we believe he should have in the exercise of his duties will not be available to him.  Another problem can very easily arise in that well qualified people who would be likely to apply for the position of registrar will not do so because they can be removed from office at will.  We will then have a situation where instead of the best people applying for the job we will get applications from people with second-rate qualifications.  This could be a calamity in what is an exceptionally important position.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on the Friendly Societies Bill the Parliamentary Secretary stated that it was more than likely that the person appointed to the position as registrar of friendly societies would not be a civil servant. I am fully in agreement with this. I should much prefer to see somebody from outside the service appointed to that position but the fact that this is likely to be the case creates an even greater problem.  The removal of a civil servant from the position of registrar usually would mean simply a transfer to another section of the Department without loss of pay unless there were some serious allegations involved and without loss of pension rights.  However, the removal of a person who came from outside the civil service would mean not alone the loss of his income but also the loss of pension rights.  Obviously a married man with a family would not consider he had the freedom to act in a manner required of a registrar of building societies.  As I said, I am in favour of a well-qualified person from outside the civil service getting the job but I have pointed out the problems that could arise and that could severely restrict the autonomy of the registrar.</P>
    <P>The amendment we have subtrar' <Col N="1163" /> mitted underlines the importance of the position of registrar and the need to ensure his freedom of action.  It is in line with all our thinking in relation to State involvement in this Bill. In relation to a number of amendments we submitted and which we withdrew with the proviso that we might resubmit them, we pointed out we were not happy with the amount of State intervention that can occur if this measure becomes law.  We must be concerned about this aspect also.  The registrar will have an exceptionally important job.  He will be dealing with the financial institutions that are very large bodies.  They have grown from small beginnings thanks to the energy and effort put into them by the management and others during the years.  In his dealings with such institutions the registrar should be autonomous and should have the freedom which we consider necessary if he is to carry out his duties.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that in the United Kingdom the registrar is even more tightly restricted than in this Bill. I read the British Act on a number of occasions during the course of my consideration of this Bill and I cannot agree with the Minister.  As I see it, the registrar is given the sole function of controlling the societies.  The system has worked very well in the United Kingdom since the Act was passed. The registrar is in control and is seen by his various activities to be in control.  This should be the position here and our amendments point to this.  It should be the duty of the registrar to consult with the appropriate Minister so that the Government can keep the whole system under surveillance but the registrar so far as possible should be free to act. We do not believe that a registrar who can be dismissed at will without reference to anybody other than the Minister can have the freedom of action which we consider vital.</P>
    <P>The person to be appointed as registrar must be highly qualified and he must have a full and suitably qualified staff.  He will quickly become <i>au fait</i> with the workings of the societies and will develop an expertise which we are convinced will redound <Col N="1164" /> to the advantage of the societies.  That would be a considerable improvement on the position we have had up to now where civil servants deal with the societies.  However competent they may be and however well versed in the affairs of the societies, almost invariably after a relatively short space of time the personnel concerned are transferred either on promotion or for some other reason.  The result is that some new people move in and they have to learn all about societies from the beginning.</P>
    <P>The basic point I am making is that the independence of the registrar must be assured and it must be seen to exist.  I am not at all happy that this will be the case in relation to the registrar of friendly societies.  After the discussion we had on that Bill I was forced by the situation that is evolving in relation to the registrar of friendly societies to withdraw my original amendment and to substitute another amendment.</P>
    <P>The registrar will be taking on an onerous task in dealing with financial institutions that have grown enormously in the past decade.  The argument put forward by the Minister in his defence of the wording of section 38 was that the registrar would fix limits in respect of investments by a society and not the Minister for Finance but the fact remains that he must consult with the Minister for Finance and, presumably, he must get advice from the Minister and his Department.  If, having got that advice, he decides it would not be in the interests of the societies he has then to concern himself whether he is sufficiently free to decide on his own and to act against the advice given by the Minister and his Department.  The fact that he can be removed by the Minister will prohibit him from acting as he might like to act in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>We feel strongly about this matter, as we felt about other aspects of what we considered was undue State interference in the commercial aspect of the workings of the building societies. I would ask the Minister to give further consideration to this matter, particularly in view of the attitude <Col N="1165" /> adopted by the Parliamentary Secretary on the Friendly Societies Bill when he refused to accept any amendment to the position as it was.  There are many other instances in the public service where certain appointees cannot be removed except with the permission of the Oireachtas.  The position we are discussing is not a menial one, it is a very important one. It concerns the future of building societies to quite a considerable extent and, therefore, is something in which those who borrow from and those who lend to the building societies must have a particular interest.  We must, in those circumstances, not only ensure that the registrar is completely free but, at the same time, we must allow the State the right to ensure that irregularities will be put down and that the registrar is as free as it is possible for us to make him.  I ask the Minister, especially in considering the position in relation to the Friendly Societies Bill, to reconsider this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Faulkner is making a mountain out of a molehill. The Bill, as drafted, proposes in section 85 that the Registrar of Friendly Societies shall, for the purpose of this Act, be the Registrar of Building Societies.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, as the Deputy said, recently passed through the Dáil a Bill entitled The Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill, 1976 which includes a provision for the appointment of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  I understand this section was very fully discussed by the Deputies during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner's amendment would require that a separate Registrar of Building Societies be appointed.  I gave full consideration to this matter before deciding that there was no necessity for two registrars, that one could amply cope with the duties of the two offices and that the appointment of the two registrars would be wasteful of resources. There are 25 registered building societies in Ireland.  In the United Kingdom, where there are over 450 registered building societies, the registrar of friendly societies acts as registrar for all the societies, friendly <Col N="1166" /> societies, building societies and so forth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner referred loosely to the powers they had in the Bill and he said he read the UK Bill a couple of times.  I suggest he read it again because, in fact, the registrar there cannot move without reference to the Treasury.  Here the registrar has wide powers.  Here he is not a civil servant. He will decide the amount of money which will be allocated or invested in certain funds, as the Deputy said. It is bordering on the ridiculous to suggest that it would require a two-thirds majority of the Houses of the Oireachtas to have him removed.  This applies to the Judiciary for a very good reason.  It is out of the question to suggest that this should apply to somebody employed on a job like this. I cannot understand why Deputy Faulkner should now find that this requirement is essential in view of the fact that since the 1935 Act the registrar could be removed.  There never was a requirement that there would be a two-thirds majority of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Deputy should suddenly get into his head that for some peculiar reason, not alone present Ministers but future Ministers, would be corrupt and would, therefore, for reasons of their own or political reasons, want to remove the registrar.  It is ridiculous to suggest that.  I believe Deputy Faulkner did more harm than good to this cause. I believe the regulation which is laid down is the sensible one.  He will not be a civil servant.  He will be a respected person in society.  He will be a qualified accountant with at least ten years' experience in practice after qualification.  He will easily be able to handle the matters which will come before him.</P>
    <P>Under the circumstances I do not think there is any merit in the case made by Deputy Faulkner. I am sorry I could not possibly accept his amendment because it would make a situation where we would have two registrars, one of whom would be a registrar for building societies looking after 25 societies and as he was looking after <Col N="1167" /> them he would then be a person to whom there would be special terms applicable while the Registrar of Friendly Societies, who would be dealing with a lot of other matters, would be under different terms of employment entirely.  I believe Deputy Faulkner, having had the matter debated on the other Bill, having had the matter teased out and a decision taken, must understand that the decision taken here is the correct one. The question of having a second registrar was considered fully and it was decided that it would not be justified under any circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make the point that because it was passed in relation to the Friendly Societies Bill it does not mean that it was right. It does not mean that we accept it. I would like to make my position clear in regard to this matter.  I did not want two registrars but I was forced into this particular situation because the only way I could put down an amendment was in the form I have it because I disagree with the situation that will prevail under the Friendly Societies Bill, if passed in its present form.  The Registrar of Friendly Societies who, in accordance with this Bill as it stands, will also be the registrar for building societies, can be removed from office at will by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>I need not go into the whole argument again but I believe the registrar who will be responsible for building societies will not have freedom to act in the way he feels he should act in certain circumstances.  That problem will always loom large in his mind when he feels that he must disagree with the advice given to him by the Minister and the Department of Finance.  This is why I was forced into a situation where I had to submit the amendment as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the Registrar of Friendly Societies was dealing with this work for many years.  Circumstances have changed very considerably, particularly in relation to building societies.  In the early days building societies were a relatively small financial group but now they are enormous. <Col N="1168" /> While it is true to say that in Britain the registrar has to deal with over 400 building societies and that there is only a relatively small number here, I would have preferred if we could have allowed this section to pass as it stands and that the registrar of Friendly Societies would also be the registrar of building societies if I were satisfied with the situation as it should have developed in relation to the friendly societies.  As the Minister said, and as I pointed out, we debated the position of the Registrar of Friendly Societies particularly regarding the fact that the Registrar of Friendly Societies would also be the Registrar of Building Societies.  We did not feel, in those circumstances, that an appointee who could be removed at will by a Minister would have the freedom of action we believe he should have. Therefore I have no option but to express my dislike of the situation which will now arise if we are to allow the registrar of friendly societies to become the registrar for building societies in circumstances where the appointee can be removed by the Minister at will.  The Minister also stated that the registrar for friendly societies in Britain was a civil servant and that he is not here.  To date so far as I know he is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>He is attached to the Department of Industry and Commerce. I accept that in the future it is the intention to have the registrar of friendly societies appointed from outside the service.  My basic problem has arisen principally because the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill has gone through the House.  I thought the Committee Stage of the Building Societies Bill would have gone through the House before the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill.  That is no fault of the Minister's.  I am just pointing out that I thought it would have done so, and we could have made our arguments here and have prevailed on the Minister in the circumstances of the case we were making to discuss the matter with his colleague in Government the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  For some <Col N="1169" /> reason or other, the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill went through the House quicker than this Bill.  Therefore I had to change the amendment I had put down.  I am not at all happy about the situation which will pertain if the Bill passes in its present form.</P>

      <P>I may have said inadvertently that the registrar should be a solicitor with ten years' service. If I said that, I did not mean it. I meant he should be an accountant with ten years' service.  I think that is what I said but, if there is any doubt about it, the record will show it.</P>
      <P>This is a matter on which there is a difference of opinion.  Deputy Faulkner holds a point of view which he is entitled to hold.  I hold a different point of view.  We will not meet no matter how long we argue about it. I considered the matter very deeply with my officials and eventually I came around to what is contained in the Bill.  I am sorry I am not able to accept the amendment.  If we are having one&mdash;and we are having one&mdash; it is not really a matter for this Bill. There could not be two different terms laid down, which appears to be what Deputy Faulkner is suggesting.  I must stick to my guns on the section and I am sorry I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;who is a qualified accountant with at least ten years' experience in practice after qualification&rdquo;.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Whoever is appointed I have sympathy for him.  It is often said that when somebody is appointed he should at least know who his boss is.  The fewer people he is responsible to the better, if he is to exercise his functions properly.  This person will find his boss is the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He will be appointed and can be dismissed by him.  He will also be subject to directions and rules and regulations from the Department of Local Government, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. That is not a very easy situation for the registrar to find himself in.  He will be trying to promote the interests of the building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill the registrar for friendly societies is the same person as the registrar for building societies. Deputy Faulkner said it was not his intention that we should have two registrars.  He is concerned about the independence of the registrar.  It is of vital importance that the registrar should be independent and should be able to say &ldquo;No.  I think you are wrong.&rdquo;  He has to agree with there or four different Departments.  He will know exactly what he is talking about. He will know the day-to-day operations of the building societies. Deputy Faulkner wants to make it as <Col N="1171" /> difficult as possible for the Minister for Industry and Commerce without taking his right away from him.</P>
    <P>Ministers should be consistent in their policies on appointing and removing people.  The Minister said only the Judiciary can be removed by a resolution of this House.

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The principle is the same. Two Departments cannot operate differently.  The registrar's job is important. He is just as important as any single member of the authority. Look at the responsibilities he is carrying. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in a section in the new Broadcasting Bill deems it necessary to provide that a resolution must be placed before this House with a proviso about being rescinded within 20 days.  The Minister for Local Government should be consistent with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who said his suggestion was more democratic. He said he did not want to take a dictatorial line.  He wants Oireachtas <Col N="1172" /> Éireann to decide whether he should remove the authority.  Deputy Faulkner is asking for the same type of resolution to be placed before the House which would make it more difficult for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to remove the registrar and enable the registrar to take independent decisions which may be unpopular at times.  At times Members of the Government can be demanding or unreasonable.  We want to ensure that the registrar has the type of independence we believe is necessary.</P>
      <P>The registrar will certainly carry a responsibility equal to that of any member of the RTE Authority with regard to millions of pounds of public investment and an enormous amount of property so far as loans are concerned. All of that will rest on his shoulders.  Since the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs deemed it necessary that even if one member of the RTE Authority was to be removed the matter was to be brought before this House, surely the registrar who will occupy a much more important position financially should have that protection also.  One must remember that the RTE Authority do not have any great control over the financial activities of RTE.  I cannot understand how the Minister can refuse an equal safeguard in this Bill which will play an important role in the expansion of building societies.  Indeed, if we want to have appointed a person capable of carrying out this job&mdash;and only the best in Irish society is good enough whether he be an accountant or financial expert; I am not worried about what field he is engaged in&mdash; such a person will not leave a good job without that safeguard in his terms of reference.  Such a person will have proved himself in the financial world whether through his own business or having been employed in some financial institution.  He will be very hesitant about leaving that position, having looked at his terms of reference and seeing how he can be removed from office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Faulkner's amendment is accepted, then we will have a proper applicant for the job; we will have the cream of our financial advisers <Col N="1173" /> applying because they will see that there is this extra guarantee that they cannot be removed because they happen to incur the displeasure of a Minister for Industry and Commerce. Perhaps the Minister would reconsider Deputy Faulkner's amendment. Furthermore, I would ask him to have a chat with his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and ask him why it was inserted in the Broadcasting Bill.  I cannot see any reason why it should not be included in this one.</P>

      <P>We cannot have it both ways.  We are talking about consistency. Last week during the discussion on the Bill Deputy O'Malley had an amendment down asking that the appointee be an accountant with at least ten years' experience.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said it did not matter who was appointed as long as he was the proper man for the job.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said he had a reservation about accountants anyway.  Therefore, where is the consistency?  We are making very heavy weather of this.  Two Opposition Deputies have already said they do not want two registrars.  There is no way the amendment could be accepted unless there were two registrars appointed.</P>
      <P>Again Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the millions of pounds over which the registrar will have control.  For example, the UK registrar has similar control over £24,000 million and he does not have to be safeguarded in the way suggested here.</P>
      <P>The debate has progressed very nicely.  We have had our disagreements across the House and all the rest of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> One thing I do not like&mdash;I do not think Deputies opposite mean it; I would hate to think they did&mdash;is the continual reference to the fact that nobody except somebody who was not a first-class person would be interested in the job because this safeguard is not written into the Bill, that Ministers for Industry and Commerce are merely waiting to have some fellow appointed and the first time he puts a foot wrong he will be thrown out, that, therefore, nobody else will apply.  That is wrong. I do not think Opposition Deputies really mean what they say&mdash;that this will inhibit people from applying.  I think the job will be applied for and will be well done by the registrar appointed whoever he or she may be. It is ridiculous to suggest that a registrar must have the right to come before the House of the Oireachtas no matter what he has done before he can be dismissed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned also the fact of his having more than one boss.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will be in charge.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick must know, possibly from his own experience in business, there are sections that will be dealt with by a number of people, with somebody answerable to a person in charge of a section, or possibly two or three different sections.  But ultimately they come back to the boss when a final decision has to be taken. The same situation arises here.  We are making an awful lot of mountain out of a very small molehill.</P>
    <P>Since Deputies do not want two registrars appointed, there is no way what they are talking about can be achieved at present.  In any case, all of those aspects were considered before the final draft of the Bill was placed before the Seanad.  It is reasonable for me to say that I am satisfied with the Bill as it stands.  If there are different opinions across the House that is too bad.  The House will decide finally what the issue will be and I am not prepared to alter the section.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's attitude because this simple request would give satisfaction all round.  May I put it to the Minister, as a trade unionist, that if somebody is unjustly dismissed naturally he would be up in arms and say that that must not happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>And if a competent professional man was dismissed in the wrong he would not have to go to a trade union.  I know the row he would kick up, and rightly so, if a particular Minister threw him out just because he did not like the colour of his hair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, legislation lasts so long.  In, say, 50 years or less circumstances may have changed considerably.  While individuals like ourselves will pass on, we hope parliament will last and that any person with a grievance would have the protection of the Oireachtas in ensuring that he was not penalised unjustly.  I want to ask the Minister also if there is any right of appeal for the registrar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The registrar will have a right of appeal, which anybody has, to the courts.  Anybody in the State who feels aggrieved has a right of appeal to the courts.  I am quite sure that a professional man who considered he was dismissed unjustly would not be very slow in availing of that right; it happens every day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What would it cost to pass a motion through this House and the Seanad?  It would cost about ten times as much as in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>But justice must be seen to be done even though the heavens may fall.  Therefore, if money is spent on it in the House of the Oireachtas, it is money well spent.  I cannot see why the Minister will not accept the amendment.  Deputies Faulkner and Fitzpatrick made a very able case.  They have been lavish in their praise of the Bill.  In order to remove a gnawing doubt in our minds the Minister might accept the amendment. <Col N="1176" /> The situation may never arise, a registrar may never be dismissed. To my mind, this will be a very prestigious appointment.  For example, in section 87, an amount of £20 million is mentioned.  This registrar must ensure that all moneys invested in building societies and the general running of them will be kept at the very highest pitch.  We want a man appointed who will be independent, who will realise he has fixity of tenure, who will not be afraid to step out of line, will do his duty fearlessly but he can only do that if he is assured of this fixity of tenure.</P>
      <P>We boast here that we have not got the spoils system as obtains in some other countries, where, after an election, many people in government service and so on are sacked.  Ours is a healthy situation.  We should like to ensure that the registrar would have the same protection as a civil servant or even that of a trade unionist.  The man working on some factory floor who is unjustly dismissed has the right of appeal.  It is ironic that here we are refusing to protect the registrar while at the same time passing the Unfair Dismissals Bill through the House Why should we be selective with our justice?</P>

      <P>Our society should improve as it develops.  We are asking the Minister to accept this amendment thereby making this a better Bill.  I cannot understand the Minister's reluctance.  If this was contrary to the principles of the Bill I could understand it, but it is not.  As far as this Bill is concerned the registrar is the most important man in the whole structure.  Deputy Faulkner's amendment is very reasonable and the Minister should match the reasonableness of Deputy Faulkner by accepting this amendment.  Even at this late stage I would like the Minister to give the registrar some right of appeal.  If we wanted to remove a judge, we would have to go through that procedure.  I do not know whether one would say that the registrar is equivalent to a judge but there are many people here who cannot be dismissed without the sanction of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I cannot understand why for some unknown reason the registrar in this case cannot be given the protection of the Oireachtas.  If the Minister thinks about this further, he might well see the sense of our case.</P>

In my experience of a somewhat similar situation where the security is not what it might be and where, fortunately, for the concern involved one or two worth-while applicants applied, one of whom obtained the position, applications were received from other people who would have ended the industry in a very short term given the opportunity.  The Minister states that a registrar has never been removed.  We are legislating for the future and one never knows what can happen.  What I said was that I would prefer to have one registrar but in the circumstances I was left with no option but to put in the amendment.</P>

This is true particularly in regard to section 80.

We have now reached a stage where we are able to wipe out old legislation instead of introducing small amendments here and there.

    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that the tourist industry is failing to make an adequate contribution to the national economy, due to the failure of the Government with regard to prices, its introduction of penal taxation and its failure to give guidance and adequate support to the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress yesterday I was endeavouring to highlight the dangers of pollution.  In this regard I was glad to note that the Minister shared my anxiety.  We all know the damage that pollution can cause to our lovely lakes and streams and what this damage means not only in terms of the environment but in terms of loss to our tourist industry. I have been pointing to ways that I considered would be suitable in making our country more attractive from the point of view of tourism.</P>
      <P>I should like to mention a few other points in the short time at my disposal. It is very important that our towns and villages should be kept as tidy as possible.  In almost every town and village there are derelict sites which are eyesores and urgently need attention.  I should like Bord Fáilte to play a more active part in regard to those eyesores.  Perhaps they could make more money available to have those sites cleared.  We also see indiscriminate dumping of refuse on many roads.  Again, I should like to have more control.  There is nothing as bad when driving along a road as seeing dumps on both sides, cardboard boxes, plastic bags, bottles and so on. This should be stopped and unless this kind of dumping is controlled the countryside will be spoiled.  A public relations exercise is needed in this respect and school children could perhaps be made aware of their responsibility and, perhaps, could impress on their parents the importance of avoiding dumping of this kind which is very undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like more control over caravan sites.  In recent years caravan holidays are playing a more important role in our tourist industry.  I think Bord Fáilte should have control over those sites, even those not registered <Col N="1183" /> under Bord Fáilte.  I have had complaints from people who booked caravans for holidays and who were very disappointed with what they were offered when they went to the seaside to take over their caravans.  The beds were not clean and the utensils were not satisfactory.  Generally speaking, the whole situation was wrong.  Either Bord Fáilte or the sanitary authorities should have power to inspect caravans and see that everything is right.  Usually, people take holidays only once a year and if they are not satisfied the whole holiday is spoiled for them for that year.</P>
    <P>In contributing yesterday to the debate I tried to point out that our tourist prices were not competitive.  I would not agree with the Minister for Transport and Power when he said yesterday that hotels, food, transport and drink prices here were ridiculously cheap.  Few would agree with him.  In this evening's newspaper some of those involved in tourism in this country have also rejected the Minister's idea that prices are cheaper here and that hotel prices are ridiculously low.  Our distinctive competitive advantage lies in the personal and cultural spheres and in the physical environment.  We should always strive to preserve those natural qualities.</P>
    <P>In any economic planning for the future tourism must get very high priority because of its great potential. This industry generates economic activity sufficient to support the employment of 100,000 people.  Without its foreign exchange earnings the projected balance of payments deficit for 1976 would be doubled.  Its import content is exceptionally small compared with manufacturing industry. More important as far as I am concerned, its impact is strongly felt in the underdeveloped regions.  The industry deserves full Government support but I fear it is not getting that kind of commitment from the Government at present.  We have only to examine the penal taxes imposed by the present Administration.  This can be blamed for the high prices now prevailing. When we see the price of petrol, of drink, of food and of transport we realise immediately that many of those increases were imposed by the <Col N="1184" /> Government.  Surely, then, they are failing to give wholehearted support to tourism.  There is merit in the suggestion I made yesterday that tourists should be given some concession as regards petrol.  They should be allowed to purchase it at the same price, perhaps, as that obtaining in Northern Ireland or Britain.  Unfortunately, that is not the case at present; petrol here is much dearer than in either Northern Ireland or Britain.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas that could be helped and they in turn would help tourism.  I should like to see more money put into the farm accommodation scheme, a very worthy project.  The rent-a-cottage scheme is another area.  It has been very successful in Tullycross and also in Ballycastle, County Mayo.  I should like more money to be put into this kind of project because it brings tourists to rural areas that do not enjoy the same natural amenities, perhaps, that exist in Salthill and other places.</P>

In my view our tourist industry is reasonably healthy considering the dark and dangerous forces that have been working against it for some time.  The industry experienced a slump in recent years but that was not confined to Ireland.  There was worldwide depression following the oil crisis in 1973.  The recently published OECD report for 1975 shows that after a year of decline in 1974 international tourism staged a recovery in 1975.  In the OECD area as a whole arrivals of foreigners into these countries which had fallen by 6 per cent in 1974, rose by 5 per cent in 1975.  This is a healthy sign in our recently published report and it shows an upward trend in world tourism which, after all, is the largest single item in world trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country we did not have to wait for the oil crisis for the fall-off in revenue from the tourist industry. In 1969-70 the troubles erupted in the North of Ireland and everyone of every political persuasion realised at once that the sector of our economy which would suffer most would be the tourist trade.  This was proved at the <Col N="1185" /> time and it has been the case ever since.  A few incidents stand out which dealt body blows, as it were, to the tourist trade.  We had the burning of the British Embassy in Dublin where one can of petrol did more damage to our tourist trade than all the economic difficulties we had ever dreamed of.  1972 was the darkest year for our tourism.  We cannot help but attribute to the burning of a foreign embassy in our midst this sharp slump in our tourist trade.  A year later we had the murder of Senator Billy Fox in Monaghan.  We had bombs going off and people being killed in Monaghan and Dublin.  This year we had the worst thing of all that could happen in a country, the savage assassination of the British Ambassador and his secretary.</P>
    <P>To say that violence in this country does not account for the slump in our tourist trade is contemptible.  Day after day and night after night the television screens in Britain carry this catalogue of crime and violence from Ireland.  Television, as we all know, has an impact far beyond anything we ever dreamed of.  The bombs going off, the people being killed, the destruction of property, the disturbance in the streets, all of these things are vividly brought into the homes of the entire British population.  As a result of this there has been a marked decline in the number of visitors coming into this country from Britain.  The ordinary man in England when he sees the disturbance and violence that is taking place in the north-eastern part of this country will not be convinced otherwise than that this affects every part of this island.  As a result of the violence people in England are very reluctant to come over here and spend their holidays amongst us.</P>
    <P>Another element in the reluctance of English people to come to Ireland is the severe economic difficulties at present besetting that country.  The fall in the value of the £ makes English people tighten their belts, as it were.  Tourism is a sustained and a discretionary income.  People can have a little extra money put aside and they can treat themselves to a trip abroad in the summer time.  When the recession <Col N="1186" /> came in England and harsh economic measures had to be taken there by the Government, this resulted in fewer people in England going abroad; they spent their holidays at home. Therefore, when there is an economic recession in England the tourist industry in this country is bound to suffer as a result.  The result has been very marked indeed.  The fall in the number of people coming to this country from England in the past five years has been something like 23 per cent but this 23 per cent in numbers represents something like 40 per cent in revenue, and this is certainly to be viewed with concern.</P>
    <P>It would be a very neat question indeed to ask how much money Bord Fáilte would require to spend on publicity to off-set the damaging coverage which the violence in Northern Ireland brings on this country.  That would be an insurmountable task, but I submit that the Government and Bord Fáilte are doing the best job possible with the resources available in trying to sell this country abroad and to cast aside the violent image which has been painted of us in the television screens throughout Britain and the rest of the world.  Ever since Bord Fáilte started promoting tourism and compiling statistics one fact that has emerged is that Britain is our greatest customer.  In any given year we have more visitors from Britain than from any other country, but here again we can ask ourselves how many of the people driving around the country in motorcars with GB plates on them are genuine English tourists. Take, for example, a man who has spent a considerable part of his working life in England and who comes on holiday here and spends some time in his old home.  Do we call him a tourist?  Do we call him an English tourist?  I think he would resent that term.  The majority of people visiting here from England are Irish-born coming to visit their friends and relatives.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that during the past five years there has been immigration into this country. A figure of 12,000 has been put on this.  Here again the vast majority of <Col N="1187" /> these would be people who emigrated in their youth, spent a great part of their working life in England or elsewhere, have gathered up some money and have decided to come home and set up house and buy a farm or a business and live on the land they were born and raised in.  This figure of 12,000 should be taken into account when we talk about decline in the British market for Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>The North American and continental markets paint a totally different picture.  In 1975 there was a 5 per cent increase in our visitors from America and there was something like an 11 per cent increase in those coming from the Continent.  Although the English visitor may be thin on the ground, Bord Fáilte and the tourist industry have done a very good job selling Ireland in America and on the Continent and attracting people here.</P>
    <P>A great deal of hard work and dedication to the selling of Ireland abroad has still to be done.  Do the Opposition think that if the Government were to double the allocation to Bord Fáilte this would result in a doubling of the number of tourists? I do not think that for a minute. Our tourist industry mushroomed in the sixties.  There was a general affluence all over Europe and America.  With the technological advance in communications Ireland began to open her doors and make preparations for and invite visitors from abroad.  When there was no talk of violence at home and when there was no oil crisis abroad, it was a very simple task for Bord Fáilte to sell the country and attract tourists.  They earned the reputation in the late sixties of being the glamour boy in the semi-State line-up.  As I said, it was a very pleasant task that was marked with success.</P>
    <P>When the troubles erupted in the North the picture changed.  Ever since Bord Fáilte have had to look at themselves, examine where they were going and make plans for the future. They have addressed themselves to one area of activity which is proving to be very profitable.  It has been <Col N="1188" /> established that in the early part of 1975 there was a dramatic rise in the tourist trade.  This accelerated growth was attributed to a large extent to Ireland's presidency of the EEC.  At that time there was an influx of foreign politicians, diplomats, journalists and staff from these countries. As a direct result our tourist revenue for that period increased.</P>
    <P>This is a sharp pointer to an area of activity that Bord Fáilte have been pursuing intensively of late and which will prove to be of great benefit to the country in the end.  I am speaking now of catering for international conventions. The number of visitors to conventions here has doubled.  Between 1972 and 1975 there were about 40,000.  The Convention Bureau of Ireland, which is representative of a broad spectrum of the tourist industry and which operates under the auspices of Bord Fáilte, are undertaking a new campaign to increase the number of people attending conventions to something like 63,000 by 1980.  They have set themselves a target of 43,000 for next year and they are very confident that this will be achieved.</P>
    <P>International conventions are emerging as a very sure and sound investment by Bord Fáilte.  Almost all this activity takes place in the winter.  As a result employment is maintained in this country which usually has a seasonal fall-off.  It has also been shown that people attending the international conventions spend three or four times as much as the casual visitor. Bord Fáilte and the Convention Bureau of Ireland are to be heartily congratulated on their success in this field.  The benefits that accrue from the holding of an international convention bring us valuable publicity, our visitors are shown what the country is like, they sample our hospitality and then go back to their families and friends and speak highly of this country. This is the best type of publicity Bord Fáilte could get.  It is better than all the glossy brochures ever published.</P>
    <P>Due to the slump Bord Fáilte have taken a very critical look at themselves and produced a national development <Col N="1189" /> plan for 1976-80.  This plan divides the country into regions which are then divided into zones.  It gives detailed analysis of accommodation, visitor origin, visitor spending and general interests in each area.  The organisation for the region covering Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath is known as the Lakeland Tourism Organisation.  This body, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, have set out very ambitious plans for their area. They have promoted with local interests to get this region into the tourist industry in the coming years.</P>
    <P>I would now like to pay tribute to some of the local authorities in that area who have contributed greatly to the tourist prospects for the area.  One local authority which has achieved great things in this field is the Monaghan County Council who set up, financed and got under way a museum which is proving to be a great attraction and has been praised by people from all walks of life.  The council got loans from the National Gallery and the Ulster Museum and have put Monaghan on the cultural map.  I would also like to pay a tribute to the Cavanagh Society in County Monaghan who are setting up a museum to commemorate the poet's life.  I am glad to see that Bord Fáilte are not only approving and praising this project but they will back up their words by giving generous financial assistance.  This is a very healthy sign for an area which has not fared well in the tourist trade in recent times.</P>
    <P>In the late 'sixties there were a very large number of fishermen visiting Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Sligo for coarse fishing in the lakes and rivers nearby.  Since the troubles this has come to an abrupt end.  I was very glad to read recently in the report by the Garda Commissioner that in this area, notably Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo and Leitrim, the level of crime is the lowest in the country.  That is a healthy sign for tourist prospects for the region.  It should be noted that visitors from abroad and our own nationals have nothing whatever to fear coming up into the Border areas.  In the debate so far Opposition Deputies have <Col N="1190" /> called for more money for Bord Fáilte and more money to be spent in all areas of activity designed to promote tourism.  If there were no financial constraints on the Exchequer, or if we were living in times of great economic progress, money could be lashed out in all directions. Unfortunately, we are not living in such times and there are very severe constraints on the Exchequer.  Instead of being able to spend money lavishly we have to curtail and prune expenditure.  There was no suggestion at all about Bord Fáilte spending the moneys allocated to it more wisely and no suggestion as to what steps it could take to promote tourism without the necessity of spending exorbitant sums.  In all the provincial towns Bord Fáilte have leased business premises.  It should be possible to function efficiently by having a counter or an office in part of the local post office.  Leasing premises is a very expensive way of promoting tourism.  Indeed, in some provincial towns the people living in the towns do not know where the tourist offices are located.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion about setting up a national selling agency. There is already a multiplicity of organisations.  There are too many organisations and, instead of calling for more, we should be calling for fewer organisations.  There would be no necessity for organisations if there was real co-operation and co-ordination by Departments and semi-State bodies and local authorities in promoting tourism.</P>
    <P>I believe the standards in our hotels leave a great deal to be desired and I hope Bord Fáilte will use all their powers to raise these standards and give a better quality deal to visitors.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to support the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Leonard's motion.  It is fairly obvious that the tourist industry is failing to make an adequate contribution to our economy.  That is proved in the numbers of visitors in the last year.  From Britain there was a drop of almost 50 per cent.  There was a very small <Col N="1191" /> increase in the numbers from North America and the Continent but, overall, there was no increase and the Minister himself said last night that the position was unsatisfactory.  It is especially unsatisfactory when one remembers that this should be an expanding industry.  Tourism is very big business today.  It is everybody's business because it affects all of us. Hundreds of millions are spent annually building hotels and restaurants, providing amenities and restoring places of interest, improving roads and providing a range of products and services designed to cater for the visitor.</P>
      <P>Tourism today is becoming highly professional.  We have people involved in marketing skills and different techniques designed to find out the preferences of tourists.  These are always under investigation.  Tourism is very competitive and it will be more competitive in the future because there is an ever-widening choice.  We have a great deal to offer and with the right encouragement from the Minister, his Department and the various agencies which operate under his Department more tourists would be visiting this country.  I was amazed to hear the Minister say he felt too many visitors were coming here.  This is very negative and sterile thinking.  It is thinking which could further jeopardise the tourist industry.  We cannot build a wall around the country and decide who will come and when and what kind of people will not be allowed to visit the country.  I hope this is not what the Minister has in mind.  We should encourage as many as possible to visit our shores.</P>
      <P>There is, first of all, the economic advantage.  Tourism is an invisible export which boosts the economy.  This is very important today when we have to import such costly items as oil and so on, imports which put a very heavy strain on our balance of payments. We are a trading nation and we have to import many products we cannot produce ourselves and so we have a trade deficit running into several millions.  The revenue from tourism would go a long way towards redressing that adverse balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> We believe the Government could make a greater contribution and we believe they are failing to do that. There is also the tremendous employment tourism generates.  We have a very high unemployment figure and this figure could be reduced by encouraging tourism.  Tourists consume millions of gallons of milk, millions of eggs and millions of tons of butter, meat and vegetables.  We produce all these ourselves.  There is a potential for jobs in agriculture as against the hotel and catering industry.  If we are to create further employment that employment will be created in industries related to agriculture.</P>
    <P>The foreign currency introduced into this country by tourists is spent in many different ways.  It filters through the economy because of what we call the multiplier effect.  The tourist will pay the hotelier, the latter will pay his staff, they will pay the grocer who, in turn, buys more goods and so it goes on.  The multiplier effect is something we should note when talking about the contribution of tourism to the economy.  I support the idea put forward by Deputy Leonard of creating a national selling agency. This could co-ordinate all aspects of selling and marketing and could identify the trends and preferences in the industry.  In addition, the idea of petrol concessions to tourists should be considered.  I understand it operates elsewhere where a voucher system has been introduced.</P>
    <P>Above all, the Government must take positive steps to counteract the increased cost of petrol, drink, tobacco and the increased rate of VAT on car hire.  Since 1973 there have been 14 increases in the price of a gallon of petrol.  At that time a gallon of petrol cost 38p.  This item alone has more than doubled in three years.  There is a danger that we will price ourselves out of the tourist market, if we have not done so already.  The voucher system I have suggested would improve the situation.</P>
    <P>The morale of the tourist industry is low as can be seen from the figures I mentioned.  There has been a drop of 5.3 per cent in the number of British visitors and there have been only <Col N="1193" /> minor increases in the numbers from North America and from the Continent.  The declaration by the Government of a state of emergency did considerable harm to the tourist industry. People will not be anxious to visit a country where a supposed national emergency exists.  We know of instances where groups or individuals postponed their bookings because of the Government announcement and there was one well-publicised case of a German group who could not get insurance to visit this country.</P>
    <P>I admit that the troubles in Northern Ireland are part of the problem, particularly with regard to visitors from Britain, but they are being used as an excuse by the Government for their failure to expand the industry.  The world recession was mentioned by some Government speakers but I would point out that other countries, particularly our partners in Europe, are making a serious effort to improve their position with regard to inflation and to secure a decrease in their unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have suggested that other countries are so badly off, that their standard of living has decreased so much that they are not inclined to visit any country let alone Ireland but I do not believe that.  After listening to Government speakers I wonder what exactly they think of the effect of the world recession on this country. Sometimes they say it is affecting Ireland but on other occasions we hear that we never had it so good, particularly in the west.  I mention this because I do not think the argument with regard to the world recession can be sustained.</P>
    <P>The Government are taking tourism for granted.  Tourism is competitive and is likely to become more competitive but there has not been an adequate injection of funds by the State in order to expand the industry.  There is also a lack of action to prevent serious pollution.  Last night the Minister said we had something unique, something of high quality to offer tourists and I agree with him but I think the Minister must agree we are <Col N="1194" /> in danger of losing some of these qualities.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed the Minister did not mention pollution when he spoke last night.  It is a very real problem and Bord Fáilte in their tourism plan for 1975 to 1978 gave us a warning. They told us there was evidence to show that an erosion has started which if it is not checked will lead to the collapse of Irish tourism as we know it.  I raised this matter before when we were discussing the Bill relating to tourist traffic.  Perhaps we could have some central body to deal with this problem.  As figures show, some 150,000 anglers visit this country each year but if the pollution of lakes and inland waters is allowed to continue we will lose that sector of the tourist industry.  It is essential in future planning and in the development of our tourist industry that we have plans to care for the environment. This matter should be tackled immediately.</P>
    <P>We are members of the EEC and we should try to get conventions and conferences held here.  In addition we should try to ensure that they are not always held in Dublin.  There are fine halls throughout the country and conferences could be held in them.  The expenditure by the participants would filter through the economy if this were done.  Each area has its own ethnic attraction and tourists admire the variety in each area.  It would be a pity if we neglected those places.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry will have problems in the future.  At the moment we have a litter problem and in some areas there is poor hygiene and cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired.  Any effort we put into tourism will be amply repaid because in the future people will have more leisure time, they will possibly have greater standards of living and they will be anxious to get the same quality they have always got in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the Minister's amendment.  I feel, coming from the Sligo-Leitrim region, that I should say something on this matter.  The value of tourism came home very forcibly to me in 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> When I moved around my constituency during the late harvest and into October I was amazed at the number of business people who spoke to me about tourism and the benefit it was to the country.  If there never was anything about tourism, Irish boys and girls and those who have settled down elsewhere and got married always come home to Ireland.  Whether it is in a central place or in the most backward place in Ireland they will always come home to enjoy a pleasant holiday where they were born and reared.</P>
    <P>The amount of money left in the various business houses, country pubs and hotels was brought home to me in 1974.  People were loud in their praise of the tourist trade.  Unfortunately, since then we had some very poor weather conditions and our financial position became bad after we lost severely in our crops.  This had a serious effect on the country in general and also on the tourist trade.</P>
    <P>That is over now.  I believe the Minister will give every possible encouragement to tourists to come to the country.  We have some beautiful scenery in the Sligo-Leitrim area around Lough Gill, which is described as the Killarney of the west by people who know the two areas.  We also have in Leitrim a well-known lake, Lough Melvin, which attracts fishermen from many parts of the world. Those two centres are known far and wide.</P>
    <P>Considerable sums of money have been spent by the Minister but I want to see more money spent if possible.  A great deal of work still needs to be done. We want to see greater development in the areas I have mentioned so that people can drive to those places and have picnics.  Quite a lot of publicity has been given to Kerry and Donegal. All politicians have visited the various counties and have seen what can be offered.  We know there are many places that still need money spent on them as well as Donegal and Kerry.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner reported on crime recently and he said that the crime rate in Sligo and Leitrim was the lowest in the country.  Many people are scared, because of the <Col N="1196" /> Northern crisis, to come to any county adjoining the Border but they need not have any fear about coming to Sligo and Leitrim.  The Minister for Justice is doing a very good job and the position all over the country has improved recently.  We should be proud of what the Garda Commissioner said about Sligo and Leitrim.</P>
    <P>We all know that the tourist trade is an uncertain one.  If we have a good year from the weather point of view the people in hotels and others who benefit from tourism have a very good season.  Everything depends on the weather.  The people going on a tour want good weather.  If they are not likely to get favourable weather conditions they will not travel long distances, spend their money on hotels and find themselves confined to those hotels most of the time.  The weather plays a very big part in a good season for people running hotels and farmhouse holidays.  The years 1975 and 1976 were very good years for tourism.  We had very good weather.  In other years it might be July or August before the weather takes up and the people start to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to support the motion in the name of Deputy Leonard which indicates that the tourist industry is not making an adequate contribution to the national economy.  I am well aware that the wording of the motion is correct.  I did not realise until the Minister spoke last night that it is now his clear intention and the policy of the Government to be selective.  He said last night he did not want mass tourism in the country.  Previous speakers have castigated Fianna Fáil because we mentioned a national selling agency.  I feel this is required to counteract the Minister's repelling agency.  Last night he laid great stress on the quality of life in Ireland.  He said that quality is everything.  He indicated that it was his policy to curtail tourism and the numbers coming here.  I can assure him that is not the policy of the party on this side of the House nor is it the policy of those who put down this motion.  I should like to <Col N="1197" /> ask the Minister&mdash;or anyone on the opposite benches&mdash;to let us know what is wrong with bringing many people to Ireland.  When numbers are our trouble, that is the time to start worrying about them.  It will be a long long time until all the beds available are occupied by tourists.</P>
      <P>The Minister quoted the bed and breakfast in Brussels which cost £28, and it was only a Continental breakfast at that.  He quoted the editor of some snazzy &ldquo;toney&rdquo; publication in the United States who marvelled that smoked salmon could still be bought here at seven dollars a lb.  The Minister should come down to earth.  Who can afford to stay at hotels like that or eat smoked salmon at seven dollars a lb.?  Only people who are not paying for it themselves like the Minister and others who have a large expense account.  Smoked salmon would not rate as a very high priority to the ordinary people we should try to attract here.  The Minister's speech last night proved to me that he is both isolated and insulated from the realities of life.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will probably appreciate a little story I heard about two priests who were curates together.  They were great friends.  They became parish priests and still maintained their friendship. Finally one was exalted and made a bishop.  His friend attended on the day he was made bishop and, when he had a quiet word with him, he said: &ldquo;I suppose from now on you will not eat a bad dinner or hear the truth.&rdquo;  What applies to bishops must also apply to Ministers.  I was never more conscious of the fact that a member of the Cabinet being so far removed from the realities of Ireland as they exist today than the Minister for Transport and Power was last night here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear of people who fail to rise above their humble upbringing.  That is bad enough, but it is sadder still to see people like the Minister who never manage to see below their own exalted positions.  That is the case with him.  To me the attitude of the Minister here last night was typical of the Fine Gael attitude of selectivity <Col N="1198" /> and snobbery, an attitude which has ensured that never were they in a position to get a mandate from the people to rule the country without the help of others.  It is the attitude of the select grocer who caters for select clients and discourages the riff-raff and finds that, since he did not move with the times, he is not able to compete and he goes bankrupt in the more modern selling and marketing systems of today.</P>
    <P>To my mind tourism should be second only to agriculture as a money spinner.  It is particularly attractive because of the part it can play in the balance of payments.  Can the Minister who is in charge of tourism afford to be selective and watch our tourist industry decline, when the Minister for Finance goes about Europe with his begging bowl looking for money anywhere he can get it to try to keep our heads above water and borrowing from anyone to help us to pay our way?  We are in a bad way in this country and this should percolate to the people in power.  They should swallow their pride.</P>
    <P>It might be well at this stage to remind them that before the election the 13th point in their plan&mdash;the 12th point referred to the status of women &mdash;referred to tourism development. The promise was that this Government would carry out a new dynamic development programme for tourism to enable the industry to overcome its present difficulties.  As bingo players might say, the 13th point is unlucky for some.  It is particularly unlucky for those engaged in the tourist industry. I see no evidence whatsoever of any dynamic development.  I do not see it in the sale of the 112 hotels which Deputy Leonard mentioned. The Minister agreed it was a fact but he said most of them were outdated and that they were no loss.  What about the quality of life of those who worked in those hotels?  If the Barry tourist repellent was not working, and the ordinary people who might not be very hoity-toity happened to come to occupy those hotels and keep those people in their jobs, I wonder would the people who are now on the dole and who worked in those hotels enjoy <Col N="1199" /> a better quality of life?  It is idle to talk about the quality of life when we have 110,000 people on the dole.</P>
    <P>The Minister was quoted in today's paper as saying that hotels, food, transport and drink are ridiculously cheap.  People would hardly believe a Minister would stand up in this House and tell us that.  It is obvious he has not got to pay for those items himself or he would realise how wrong he is. That is another proof to me of how far removed the members of this Cabinet are from everyday living. They are unaware of the cost of living in Ireland today.  Petrol is dearer here than in Northern Ireland, as a direct result of Government policy.  It is an example of another type of repellent. When petrol was cheaper here we were told that was a mistake.  Now it is much dearer than it is in Northern Ireland and that is no encouragement to people to come here and hire a car or to bring their own cars.</P>
    <P>Drink is much dearer here than it is in England or Northern Ireland.  If you compare the price of a Harp here with the price of a Harp in England, you will see what I am talking about. I am referring to people who come to my own county.  In Prosperous there is a small committee which endeavoured to improve coarse fishing.  They succeeded in bringing anglers from England.  I refer particularly to a group of disabled anglers who come every year.  They stay in small local guesthouses and enjoy the fare offered to them, simple country fare.  What interests them are food prices, the price of a drink at night and the cost of travel.  As a direct result of Government policy and Government taxation those things have now gone beyond their reach.</P>
    <P>The only reason tourism showed any increase in the past few years was due to what the Deputy from Lovely Leitrim called the two lovely hot summers we had.  When the long cold and lonely winter arrives, who will claim credit for that?  We must accept the blame as well as the credit.  I should like to refer to the declaration of emergency.  That was a very bad decision from the point of view of <Col N="1200" /> tourism.  Since 1969 we have been suffering from the troubles in Northern Ireland.  We had a &ldquo;beware of the bull&rdquo; notice in our fourth green field.  The declaration of emergency had the effect of putting up notices in the other three fields to keep people out, to warn people who might be inclined to come in of the danger that they might be attacked if they came to the rest of Ireland.  That is the effect it had.</P>
    <P>I listened to all the Government speakers and our own speakers. Neither the Minister, Deputy Toal nor Deputy McLaughlin would have sold Ireland to anybody.  I never heard more subdued or apologetic speeches. If the tourism industry was depending on them to go out and sell the industry, we would have very few visitors.  I thought it was the most lifeless approach in an endeavour to defend their policies that I ever heard.  I see no evidence anywhere of the dynamic approach we were promised.  I have yet to get confirmation of the new confidence the Minister spoke about last night which he injected into the tourist industry.  When you speak to a small hotelier in any town&mdash;and our country towns are not enjoying any great prospects&mdash;you do not get any evidence of this injection of confidence.</P>
    <P>The bed and breakfast people now find that their breakfasts are much dearer since this Government took office, and their beds are unoccupied. This refers to farmhouse holidays and hoteliers in seaside resorts.  Most of the blame can be laid at the door of the Government whose policy in regard to prices and taxation has the direct effect of making holidays much dearer here.  People are now leaving Ireland and going on holidays abroad. We are told that many people from England did not come to Ireland last year, but remained at home.  If the facts were looked into fully, we would find that people who might normally take their holidays in Ireland and see Ireland first as we were asked to do, are now taking a cheaper holiday abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attitude and self-confessed policy of being selective, of giving them a better quality of life <Col N="1201" /> here than they have abroad indicates to me that his policy is one of discouraging people from coming here. We should help Bord Fáilte because they have spent a lot of money endeavouring to attract people here on holiday; we have wonderful things to attract them.  Counties like my own, not aware of their tourist potential, are now awakening to the pastoral scene, to what we have to offer in sport and open spaces to people who would like to come and spend a holiday here.  Here I am not referring to the smoked salmon specialists or those who would be prepared to pay £28 for bed and breakfast.</P>
    <P>I can judge from the tone of this debate that it was timely and indicates the differences in approach of the present and previous Administrations.  I never before heard a Minister admit that he was not intent on bringing tourists to this country until last evening.  The Minister would be well advised to change his misinformed approach and go out and sell the country.  People who can afford to come here on holiday should be welcomed. We should attract tourists at all costs.  I do not think we will disfigure or make shanty towns out of any part of our country by so doing.  The Minister should first do that and let the industry tell him when it is time to stop.  We have very good seaside resorts so far uncluttered and unpolluted but the Government will have to pay particular attention to the problem of pollution.  In this respect we are fortunate in that we can benefit from events or mistakes that have occurred elsewhere, for example, in countries like Holland and so on where there are large numbers of people and a very small quantity of water they must guard very carefully.</P>
    <P>For far too long we have decided on a certain holiday period, from June to September, at the end of which people close their hotels.  We must endeavour to broaden our outlook here also and attract people during the off-season.  I do not know what the Minister might think about our attitude to free salmon fishing. We could attract people here at a certain time of the year for that and <Col N="1202" /> other sports&mdash;gun clubs and so on&mdash; which would cater for people during the off-season.  Such attractions exist already in my own constituency in Prosperous.  Some of them have received bad publicity.  Some continentals are reputed to fire at anything but that is not confined to continentals.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Minister is not here for the conclusion of this debate because, even at this late hour, he might have answered some of the questions put to him last evening.  In moving an amendment to our motion he expressed the view that he welcomes such motions as they afford an opportunity to discuss the problems besetting the tourist industry. We hoped we would have had an open discussion on it but it appears one never has an open discussion on anything so far as the Coalition are concerned.  They said they would provide open government but they are proving to be the direct opposite.  I was disappointed the Minister did not make any effort to deal with the points raised, especially the six submissions made to him so often.</P>
      <P>The Minister made no attempt whatsoever to explain the drop in tourism from Britain.  Neither did he suggest any measures to remedy that situation.  He had a responsibility to explain to us the fall-off in tourism from England because, in the tourist debate on 6th and 7th of April last&mdash; following the imposition of those taxes by the Government which affected tourism so badly&mdash;he told us indications were that there would be an increase in the number of tourists coming here in 1976.  I should have liked to have asked him on what he based that assumption because the figures quoted by myself and others last evening illustrated an overall drop of 7,000 people, our tourists in all sectors had dropped from 1,688,000 in 1975 to 1,681,000 in 1976, a drop of 47,000 on our projected 1975 figure and some 80,000 fewer than had been projected by Bord Fáilte in their estimates for the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> At a tourism seminar a week ago it was stated on good authority that for every 37 British tourists coming here one additional job would be created.  Had the 80,000 extra British tourists materialised it would have meant an increase in jobs of 2,162. That, at a time of such long dole queues, would have been a very welcome trend in our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister was critical also of the 112 hotels which have closed since 1973.  Last evening he seemed to make a sweeping condemnation of those hotels and hoteliers, which was not justified.  That would give the impression to most people that those hotels had failed because they had been run inefficiently, whereas the Minister did not seem to shoulder any responsibility for the measures introduced by the Government which in many instances accounted for their closure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power dealt very ably with the Minister's statement in which he implied that he would prefer to see visitors to high grade hotels, in the top social bracket.  No fair-minded person could go along with the Minister in those views.  It will be a sad day for this country when we become that selective and cater only for the snob element.  From my experience of talking with tourists, far from their being snobbish, the type of entertainment they enjoyed was traditional music and so on.  It was the &ldquo;Irishness&rdquo; of it which seemed to attract them and not the snobbish element or the type of jet-set entertainment the Minister seemed to imply.  Another speaker here, a neighbour of mine, seemed to be talking in the same vein as the Minister.  The Minister did not seem to imply that the drop in tourism was due to the Northern troubles whereas the other speaker, who lives adjacent to the Border and who would be in a position to know, seemed to place all of the blame for our problems on the Northern troubles.  A lot of people, especially speakers in the Coalition, are fond of looking for excuses.  We had the Suez crisis and the Northern troubles and so on.  Even if the Northern troubles were to disappear tomorrow Fine Gael and Labour <Col N="1204" /> politicians talking in ten years' time would still be referring to the Northern troubles.  With the help of God the Northern troubles are tapering off and hopefully we will soon see a return to sanity.</P>
    <P>The Minister accused me of talking about the closure of hotels.  I referred to that but the statistics for 1975 show that the average occupancy of Irish hotels was 37 per cent.  Even with the closure of those 112 hotels we have sufficient plant to cater for a very large increase in the number of visitors because as well as having only a 37 per cent average occupancy they also have profit before tax of 2.3 per cent.  I asked the Minister how could he expect any industry running at 37 per cent capacity within a profit margin of 2.3 per cent to maintain existing standards apart from providing additional facilities.  These figures indicate the serious position that the tourist industry is in.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed that my attitude towards access transport was in conflict with my colleague, Deputy Barrett.  I refute that completely.  I listed six suggestions that merit careful attention and I asked the Minister to give them consideration.  I said that there should be careful definition of the national interest, the tourist interest and the airline interest in regard to scheduled and chartered flights. The Minister tried to turn what I said and to say that I was in some way downgrading our airlines.  I made no mention of Aer Lingus becoming a charter company nor did I expect it to become subservient to the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of those who are representing the Minister tonight I will outline again the suggestions which I made last night.  The Minister had the opportunity of giving his opinion as to whether they were workable and to whether they would benefit the industry.  The suggestions were: duty free facilities between Ireland and Britain and a petrol concession to tourists.  The petrol concession suggestion was made at the time of the budget and had that been introduced in the spring of 1976 we <Col N="1205" /> would not be faced today with a fall off of 47,000 British tourists.  The petrol increase and other increases, including the increase in VAT, rather than the Northern troubles were factors in the fall off in the number of tourists.  The third suggestion was export tax relief for genuine sections of the tourist industry.  We also suggested the setting up of a tourist credit corporation to aid the industry, to raise capital at favourable rates in this time of vanishing profits, that special attention be given to the problems concerning access transportation and that a national selling agency should be formed.  I had hoped that the Minister would have been here to give us his opinion on these suggestions. Apart from the access transport suggestion the Minister did not give any indication at all as to what his thinking was on the other five suggestions. A national selling agency is a must which would co-ordinate all the individual efforts in the field of selling tourism abroad.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Minister's remarks about conflict, I would like to point out that Fianna Fáil are very <Col N="1206" /> aware of Aer Lingus and of the importance of keeping them viable. Fianna Fáil gave birth to Aer Lingus. It was reported in one of our papers today that the Minister had said that food and drink were ridiculously cheap in Ireland.  A report from the tourism seminar which was held in Cork on 24th November said that the seminar had been told that Ireland was becoming too expensive.  The Minister was present at that seminar and I was intrigued to read in a newspaper report that he had said that the problem of violence may have masked underlying developments which have had an adverse effect on Irish tourism and may be difficult to perceive, and questioned whether Ireland might be becoming too expensive.  Last night the Minister said that there was conflict between myself and another colleague.  I certainly think that there is definitely conflict between Peter Barry and Peter Barry.  I had hoped that I would have some time to refer to some of the suggestions made by other speakers.</P>
