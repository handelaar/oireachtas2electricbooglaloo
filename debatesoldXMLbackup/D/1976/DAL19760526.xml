      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 5 and 15, Vote 41; Private Members' Business from 7 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., No. 28 (resumed).  It is proposed that the Dáil will meet at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask on the Order of Business whether or not there is a request from the Government to this side of the House that either No. 5 or No. 15 be completed today because of a certain urgency involved? We would like to know where we stand before the debate starts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is.  I understand that the Department need the Estimate before the end of this week. I made that request to the Opposition Whip but I have not finished discussing the matter with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very unsatisfactory that the Government order their business in such a way that they impose deadlines on debates on important matters.  We need only refer back to the Finance Bill.  It is difficult for us to comply with the request. On the other hand it is most difficult not to comply when you are up against statutory deadlines and financial stringency deadlines.  However, I hope the matter will be threshed out amicably between the Whips.  It is not fair that these things should be thrown at us at the last minute on occasions like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I accept that it would be unreasonable to ask the Opposition to keep a debate within a certain number of hours.  The request <Col N="146" /> I made was accompanied by the proposal that the debate itself would be continued on a token Estimate or under a Redundancy Payments order which is due to be discussed shortly. There was no intention of curtailing debate; it is just the money we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I only suggest that the Government ought to be able to order their business in more disciplined fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all like to be able to foresee how business will go, but it requires co-operation from both sides.  That is usually forthcoming; but the reference the Leader of the Opposition made to the Finance Bill last week was to some extent unjustified.  Six days, by agreement, were spent on the Committee and remaining Stages of that Bill.  That is more than had been spent on it at any time in the last six or seven years, or as far back as I was able to look.  In one of the last years of Fianna Fáil Government only one day was spent on those Stages of the Finance Bill.  Six days was plenty of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We always introduced our Finance Bills in time and it was a matter for the Opposition to debate them for as long or as short as they liked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be more conducive to better business all round if the Government and the Opposition could mutually agree before business is taken roughly how long it will take. I do not mean that it should be a rigid timetable, but a flexible one would be of great advantage to all sides.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £14,931,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1976, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Labour including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The Estimate shows a net increase of £4,576,990 over the provision for the previous year.  The increase is due mainly to the increased subvention of over £4 million to AnCO for training.</P>
      <P>The Government's strategy for 1976 is to give priority to expenditure that would promote growth and sustain and increase employment.  Increased resources have been allocated for capital expenditure to provide a stimulus to domestic demand and output in the short term and to produce an environment and infrastructure more conductive to growth and job creation in the long term.  The 1976 capital programme has been settled at almost £600 million which is 28 per cent above expenditure in 1975.  Nearly half of the overall increase has been allocated to investment in industry which shows an increase of £64 million, or 71 per cent over expenditure in 1975.</P>
      <P>The State's commitment to assist the forces of recovery in our economy is spelled out in the size of the public capital programme.  This investment in jobs, if allowed to work through the economy, will return many now out of work back to productive employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A significant proportion of the public expenditure in the current year which comes under the control of the Department of Labour is aimed at ensuring that those who are without jobs as a result of the present recession are given the opportunity during the period of unemployment to increase the range of their skills.  I would refer in particular to the substantial increase in resources for industrial training.  Approximately £14 million <Col N="148" /> will be spent in 1976 on the provision of industrial training courses.</P>
    <P>In manpower training I have repeatedly spelled out the policy I have pursued through the current recession.  I believe that during a spell of high unemployment, such as we have been experiencing, our training facilities must be expanded.</P>
    <P>My objective has been to arrive as quickly as possible at the point where any unemployed person could avail of a training course whilst unemployed. The increase in expenditure over the past three years from just over £2 million in 1972-73 to approximately £14 million in 1976 is designed to meet this objective.</P>
    <P>Over 11,000 men and women will be enabled to follow courses of welding, engineering, electronic assembly, radio/tv servicing, machine tool operation, junior management, etc. in the 16 centres throughout the country.  In addition, of course, company based training schemes will continue and the provision of technical assistance grants for training by outside bodies will continue to be available from the training authority.  This figure of 11,000 means that we are providing training and retraining facilities for 1 per cent of the entire labour force in 1976.  I would point out to the House that as late as 1974 this 1 per cent target was set for realisation in the year 1978 but I was determined as the recession deepened to bring this date forward by arranging for the funding requirements that would make this possible.</P>
    <P>On the matter of employment, the Government's general approach has been based on use of the budget as an instrument to expansion and, as explained, the Government gave priority to expenditure that would promote growth and thus sustain employment.  The allocation of resources between current expenditure and capital expenditure was devised in such a way as to limit current expenditure where it does not increase substantially economic activity.  This has allowed us to increase the resources available for capital expenditure and should in the short term provide a stimulus to domestic <Col N="149" /> demand and domestic output.  Thus an environment and infrastructure more conducive to growth and job expansion will be created.</P>
    <P>Nearly half of the overall increase in the capital budget was allocated to investment in industry.  When account is taken of the expenditure proposed for construction in the whole public capital programme, the total provision affecting the building and construction industry alone is £325 million; an increase of £45 million over last year.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority, which is the major State jobcreation agency, continues to make valiant efforts to maintain foreign investment in our industrial effort.  An additional £16 million was provided to enable the IDA to continue their important work over the present difficult period.</P>
    <P>At this stage in the recession, it may be stated that unemployment is now the major social evil in every EEC country, and Ireland is no exception. All of the State agencies concerned with employment, the Industrial Development Authority, Córas Tráchtála, and the training authority for which I have statutory responsibility to the Dáil, are working to targets designed to offset the unemployment effects of the recession.</P>
    <P>In addition to the work of these statutorily established State agencies, the Oireachtas recently passed the provisions of the premium employment programme.  This programme is designed to assist an early return to work of those whose industries have been particularly affected during the present recession.  The State will assist by subsidy an employer who adds an unemployed worker to his existing work force after 20th June, 1975.  All industry has, of course, suffered in the present recession but textiles, footwear and engineering have been most grievously affected.  I am anxious that employers in these industries in particular should avail themselves of the provisions of the premium employment programme in an effort to return to work the thousands of workers who have become unemployed in these three industries alone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> The more our people are enabled to return to gainful employment, the faster the recovery will occur in our home economy.  There are at present factories and plants around the country where expensive machines stand idle.  As long as these machines are idle, our productive capacity is diminished. The investment in these machines and factories, often supported by State subsidy, is lost as long as these factories remain idle.</P>
    <P>So far over 4,500 of the unemployed have been restored to gainful employment with the aid of the premium employment programme. Whilst this figure does not satisfy me, I do accept that the programme depends for effectiveness on the co-operation of employers and on their expectation on the level of demand in the home and export markets.</P>
    <P>As already announced, I have been reviewing all aspects of the programme's operation.  I have now completed that review and I wish to inform the House that the period of operation of the premium employment programme, which was due to end next month, will be continued to the end of the year at increased rates. The House will recall that the programme provides weekly payments to employers who take on additional workers from the register of unemployed workers.  Under the existing arrangements, the subsidy per each additional worker is £12 per week. This will now be increased to £15 per week.</P>
    <P>With the co-operation of employers, thousands of people can be returned to gainful employment by means of the terms of the new extended premium employment programme.  Those charged with manpower planning in Irish industry will, I hope, appreciate that the economics of manpower planning are changed in the context of the renewed premium employment programme.  I would ask all personnel managers and production planners to consider seriously the advantages which lie in the premium employment programme.  I have directed all manpower offices throughout the country to contact local employers to examine afresh the steps by which the premium <Col N="151" /> employment programme may, at the new rates, with co-operation from employers, succeed in reducing local unemployment.  Trades councils and chambers of commerce may assist by informing their affiliated members and organisations of the advantages of the premium employment programme. Whilst I am especially anxious that the premium should be availed of by those industries most seriously affected by the recession&mdash; textiles, footwear and engineering&mdash; the programme can also assist such relatively new industries as pharmaceuticals, electronics and petro-chemical activities which are still in their growth stages.</P>
    <P>By providing an incentive to employers to increase their work force now&mdash;ahead of requirements&mdash;we can be better placed to expand production quickly and meet the all important delivery dates.  There is some evidence that the level of stocks in some of our industries has now been reduced to a level consistent with the slowdown in overall demand.  We should not allow this situation to persist for so long that we are unable to meet the initial surge of demand which will surely come.</P>
    <P>The premium employment programme will make it easier for the employee to get a job again and for the employer to offer the employment. For the employer who is delaying taking on workers until he sees positive signs of upturn the programme, by reducing the cost of taking on new workers, gives him a substantial inducement to do so now. In previous recessions here, unemployment has lasted longer than necessary because employers traditionally have met improvements in demand after recession by increasing the overtime available to existing staff without taking on new workers.  The programme will enable the employers to take on workers now in anticipation of the improvement already evident in certain of the major economies.</P>
    <P>I will shortly be introducing legislation to extend and increase the payment of this employment premium. While our major economic objective <Col N="152" /> must consist in the reduction of the level of unemployment, the programme of industrial law reform must be continued. Since March, 1973, the Department of Labour has engaged in a full review of the laws relating to industrial relations, trade unions, collective and individual rights and discrimination. This has been the first comprehensive review of these laws for many years.  The objective of this review has been to update the law where that was necessary; to facilitate developments in collective bargaining; to extend basic rights and protections to workers; and to end discriminatory employment practices.</P>
    <P>Some of the results of that review are already on the Statute Book. Others are before the Oireachtas and others again are at an advanced stage of preparation and will be introduced in the Dáil shortly.</P>
    <P>The Trade Union Act, 1975, came into force earlier this year.  Previously legislation on amalgamations was contained in a number of pre-1920 Acts which were clearly inappropriate to modern conditions.  The onerous voting requirements of previous legislation have been replaced.  In future a simple majority of those voting in favour will be sufficient to allow an amalgamation or transfer of engagements to take place.  The new procedures are operated through the Registrar of Friendly Societies who will safeguard the interests of individual members.  There is also provision for grants of money to trade unions to allay the cost of operating the procedure. The objective of the legislation is to facilitate amalgamations so that trade unions can provide a more efficient service to their members.</P>
    <P>In the area of women's rights the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, will shortly be complemented by the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill, 1975.  The major objective of this Bill is to eliminate certain practices which impede the progress of women and tend to restrict them to the less skilled and poorly paid jobs. It will make it unlawful to discriminate on grounds of sex or marriage as regards access to employment, training in preparation for and during <Col N="153" /> employment, promotion and working conditions.  It is proposed to establish an agency which will investigate practices that appear to be discriminatory. If such practices are found to be unlawful, the agency will use its enforcement powers to eliminate them. The agency will launch a comprehensive programme of information about rights under the anti-discrimination legislation and any other matters affecting the status of women.</P>
    <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill must still go through the remaining Stages in the Oireachtas.  The Bill will increase the minimum age of entry to employment; regulate maximum and normal working hours; and provide enforcement and inspection procedures for young workers.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Relations Bill, 1975, represents another significant legislative measure for the improvement of the general conditions of farm workers.  It replaced the Agricultural Wages Board, established in 1936, by a Joint Labour Committee which will permit farmers and farm workers to determine jointly the future conditions of employment in this important industry.  About 34,000 workers will be covered.  The operation of the Joint Labour Committee should lead to the elimination of the differences that have been allowed to develop over the years resulting in a growing gap between the work conditions of the farm workers and those of other industrial employees.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of discussion over the past ten years on the principles of worker participation but no concrete action has been taken. Detailed discussions have taken place on proposals put forward last July and a Bill will shortly be introduced to allow the election of employee directors to the boards of seven State enterprises employing about 50,000 workers.  The experience of a functioning participation system in our economic life should enable us to contribute to the development of an authentic reorganisation of work consonant with our democratic tradition.</P>
    <P>The programme of extending workers' rights by legislative means <Col N="154" /> must keep pace with the extension of those rights through collective bargaining. A number of further measures which are under preparation deal with individual and collective rights at the work place.</P>
    <P>A very large number of unnecessary industrial disputes resulting in strikes are caused each year because of unfair dismissals.  Probably a greater number of workers are dismissed arbitrarily in unorganised employments and have no come-back at their employers.  This is an area of serious social and economic injustice allowed to continue because there are at present no legal redresses for the victims.  A Bill is currently being drafted.  The legislation will set down criteria for fair and unfair dismissals, procedures for investigation and adjudication of disputes and the remedies including compensation and reinstatement.  This legislation will be a charter of the individual's right to security in employment.</P>
    <P>Too frequently worker rights in redundancy situations are ignored or insufficiently considered.  Legislation is being prepared which will require employers to give longer notice in the event of large scale redundancy.  It will also provide that trade unions will have a statutory right to examine the necessity for such redundancies and to propose alternative solutions to redundancy situations.  Proposals are also being prepared on the protection of the rights of workers in mergers and takeovers.</P>
    <P>There has been no basic change in legislation relating to safety and health in industry since 1955.  New legislation is being prepared which will modernise procedures and ensure workers a greater and more effective voice in improving the safety of the workplace.  Special legislation is also being prepared to cope with the safety aspects of offshore gas and oil installations.</P>
    <P>The programme of legislative reform that has been undertaken and is in process is wide ranging.  All areas of existing legislation have been rigorously and critically examined and, where necessary improved.  In addition, new areas have been opened <Col N="155" /> up such as anti-discrimination and worker participation.</P>
    <P>In addition to legislative reform, other activities of the Department's work have been intensified.  For example, the general inspection of minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment has been stepped up and prosecutions against offending employers have been instituted.</P>
    <P>In more detail under industrial training the Exchequer grant towards AnCO's training activities during 1976 is £8.5 million for current expenditure compared with £5 million in 1975. With matching grants from the ESF, AnCO expects to have about £14 million at its disposal which will enable it to train approximately 10,000 persons in its training centres this year. In addition, it is hoped to train 1,000 workers in 1976 by hiring facilities in private industry, also.  This figure represents almost 1 per cent of the labour force, a target originally set by AnCO for 1978 but brought forward in the light of the present recession.  AnCO are also receiving £1.55 million towards capital expenditure as against £1 million in 1975.</P>
    <P>AnCO has set up nine permanent and seven temporary training centres as well as several mobile training units throughout the country.  These mobile training units, which have now visited more than 30 towns, are designed to bring training for short periods to areas which are remote from training centres.  The courses given by these units last from four to eight weeks and accommodate between 12 and 24 trainees at a time.  The range of 45 different courses provided by AnCO for adults is being expanded to meet the needs of industry and to provide trainees with the maximum opportunity for local employment.</P>
    <P>When talking about AnCO, I thought it might prove of interest to Deputies to refer to the new apprenticeship regulations which will come into operation in September.  The implementation will be phased in gradually over a period of five years.  I am confident that it will ensure better training and education for all apprentices and that the skilled manpower <Col N="156" /> needs of the economy will be better catered for.</P>
    <P>This new system, which at full capacity will have an annual intake of over 3,000, will mean a period of full-time training in a recognised training centre for all apprentices during their first year and a reduction in the apprenticeship period from five years to four.  For those with leaving certificate or equivalent qualification, there will be a further one year reduction. The full-time training for all first-year apprentices will be at approved centres provided by industry, the training authority, or the vocational education committees.  In addition, apprentices will be obliged to attend courses in trade theory and general education at vocational colleges during the first three years of their apprenticeships.  There will be compulsory testing leading to the award of a national craft certificate on completion of training.</P>
    <P>Employers who set up their own apprentice training centres will receive a grant towards the cost of equipping them.  The wages of apprentices under the new system will be paid by industry for those who are being trained to meet its own needs.  However, firms in the levy-grant scheme may be allowed grants for full-time apprentice training.  The State will pay the wages of apprentices being trained for new industries.  The State will also bear capital and other operating costs.</P>
    <P>I believe that the training of young entrants to the work force must be seen as a priority area and of special national importance at the present time.  The need for improved training for young people is based on the increasing need for skill and adaptability in employment, the inequity of opportunities being missed by young people because of where they live or the state of the economy when they start work and the importance of initial training and job experiences in past attitudes to work.</P>
    <P>The main features of this new system are:</P>
    <P>(1)  Apprentices will do a period of off-the-job training in their <Col N="157" /> first year of apprenticeship in approved apprentice training centres. These centres will be provided in AnCO training centres, within industry or within the educational sector where industrial conditions will be simulated.  Apprentices will also during the first three years of apprenticeship attend courses of instruction each year in vocational schools and technical colleges for at least the equivalent of a day a week for 36 weeks.</P>
    <P>(2)  The period of apprenticeship will be reduced to four years for the normal intake of apprentices and a further reduction of one year for holders of leaving certificate qualifications.</P>
    <P>(3)  There will be a representative curriculum advisory committee which will oversee the provision of curricula for apprentice training and education and there will also be compulsory testing and certification.</P>
    <P>(4)  Provision is also being made to ensure that apprentices with the necessary qualifications and ambition may proceed to higher levels of education and training.</P>
    <P>(5)  Special provision is being made to provide suitable training courses for existing craftsmen who wish to up-date their skills and for courses for unemployed craftsmen and apprentices.</P>
    <P>(6)  Apprentice intake will be planned each year to ensure that shortages of craftsmen will not hinder future industrial development.</P>
    <P>(7)  Places are being made available in 1975-76 in the training centres for qualified girls who may wish to take up apprenticeships and already a number of girls are undergoing apprentice courses in AnCO centres in three trades which up to now have been dominated by men.</P>
    <P>A special programme was started in 1974 to train redundant and unemployed apprentices.  From the beginning of 1975 to date AnCO has provided training for about 440 redundant <Col N="158" /> apprentices, the majority of whom were employed in the construction and engineering industries.</P>
    <P>On the question of the company based training which has been the subject of some controversy of late, I would like to say that there are levy grant schemes operating now in seven sectors of industry.  Firms above a certain size pay a levy of between 1 per cent and 1.25 per cent of their total annual payroll into a special fund, from which they may regain up to 90 per cent of what they have paid, in grants for appointing training personnel, identifying training needs and implementing programmes to meet these needs.</P>
    <P>Experience to date shows that the levy grant system has been responsible for stimulating worthwhile training in industry.  Despite the present economic recession, indications are that companies have not restricted their training programmes.  Payment of levy has been satisfactory, with the exception of the construction industry which has special problems because of the very large number of small firms.</P>
    <P>While levy grant should continue in its present form until the training function has been accepted and firmly established in industry at large, AnCO is developing a system to rate the quality and quantity of company training.  The system is being introduced at present in a number of designated industries on a voluntary trial basis to test its feasibility for general application.  AnCO has more than 100 training advisers who assist companies in devising and implementing training to meet their needs.  The future role of this service will concentrate less on the promotional aspects of training and levy/grant and more on indepth training assistance, review of training progress and recommendations of new and improved methods of training.</P>
    <P>Instructor training courses, varying in length from a few days to three weeks, are conducted by AnCO mainly at the Dublin training centre but also in other parts of the country and within companies as required.  To date 3,644 instructors have, in fact, been trained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> AnCO administers a technical assistance grants scheme to encourage the attendance of managers, supervisors and trade union officials at appropriate training courses.  Grants of up to 50 per cent of the cost of attendance at approved courses are available to firms in the manufacturing and distribution industries.  In 1975 assistance was given to over 7,000 participants on courses and grants totalling £292,131 were paid.</P>
    <P>Whilst the support of my Government colleagues ensured that the necessary funds were forthcoming from the Exchequer for the training expansion which has taken place, full utilisation of grants from the European Social Fund also assisted in the rate of expansion which has been achieved.</P>
    <P>In regard to CERT, we have appointed a new and enlarged council. It is a body which is now attached to the Department of Labour.  There has been, also, in its charter a redefinition of its objectives which give CERT a broader field of activity, taking in tourism and catering.  This reflects a more unified approach, an approach that I was anxious to see adopted in this body.  This more unified approach means that there will be a dovetailing of the training needs of these industries.  As a sign of its increasing involvement in the tourism sector, CERT has since January, 1975 been represented at a series of marketing meetings organised by Bord Fáilte. These meetings provided an opportunity to establish initial contact with the various sectors of the tourism industry.  A manpower and training needs survey of all sectors of tourism additional to the accommodation sector will be completed during 1976.  Based on the results of this survey a full range of training programmes will be implemented.</P>
    <P>There have also been a number of developments on the catering side, including the arrangement of training courses following the identification of training needs in particular sectors. A survey was carried out, in conjunction with the Department of Health, <Col N="160" /> to ascertain the training needs of hospital catering grades and resulting from this a series of courses has been run for health board catering staff. A full-scale manpower and training needs survey covering the industrial, institutional and licensed premises sectors of the industry has also been initiated.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer grants towards the cost of CERT's activities for 1976 is £360,000.  This of course will be supplemented by finance from the European Social Fund.  The European Social Fund have already approved grants of £209,488 for 1975 and £237,000 and £154,000 for 1976 and 1977, respectively, and further applications have been submitted for additional grants.</P>
    <P>Despite recession in the industry CERT decided to increase the number of trainees entering formal training courses in 1975.  This is an investment in tomorrow's skills when hopefully there will be an upturn in the economy. Applications for the 438 places available for pre-entry training courses rose by more than 35 per cent on the 1974 figure of 1,400 to a record 1,900.</P>
    <P>CERT recently purchased the former De La Salle Brothers property at Roebuck Road, Dublin 14.  Their headquarters will be located there and they plan to establish a new training centre there also which will provide training facilities for those engaged in the hotel, catering and tourism industries which are not already available in existing training institutions.</P>
    <P>At 11 formal training centres throughout the country, CERT co-ordinate the training of new entrants to the industry at both management and craft levels.  The total number of trainees undergoing formal training in 1975-76 is 1,057.  The number of new entrants at craft level was 428. Second year craft, management, receptionists and housekeepers totalled 629.</P>
    <P>In 1975 some 1,686 persons participated in in-service courses carried out by CERT's regional training advisers.  The categories involved included management, supervisory, instructor, diningroom, bar, kitchen, housekeeping, porterage and guesthouse management personnel.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> Because of the seasonal nature of a significant portion of the hotel industry, specially geared courses have been designed and operated at 25 locations.  These courses were held in advance of the 1975 season for 750 persons and 666 persons are at present in training for the 1976 season A high proportion of the trainees were school leavers.  CERT will continue to pay particular attention to the special position and needs of seasonal hotels.</P>
    <P>CERT concern themselves with the initial placement of persons trained on the courses in hotels and the replacement of hotel staff.  The total number of requests from hoteliers for trainees in 1975 was 1,207 and the total number of available trainees who sought employment was 526. CERT, of course, maintain close links with the National Manpower Service in the field of placement.  They also play a co-ordinating role in the placement arrangements of trainees wishing to obtain European experience.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the Irish Management Institute, the House should note that heavy investment in the training of workers is jeopardised if it is not matched by effective management training.  My Department encourage management training by direct subvention of the Irish Management Institute and by means of the technical assistance grants scheme operated by AnCO.  With the industry's current problems, never was it so important that the institute's efforts to improve the standard of management should succeed.  While the survival of many Irish firms will depend on the skills of the entire work force, the major responsibility must be borne by management.  To compensate for the geographical and historical disadvantages from which Irish industry suffers, <i>vis-à-vis</i> their competitors abroad, Irish employers must develop a higher degree of personal skill and must make more use of modern management techniques.  One great obstacle is to get management to recognise the realities of the open market situation.  Once the issues are faced, there is ample evidence to suggest that Irish managers can compete successfully with the best from other countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> The institute prepared a five-year programme for 1974-78.  The programme is based on an analysis of the needs of Irish business and provides for a comprehensive range of both on-the-job and off-the-job training courses which can be geared to the special needs of individual firms or sectors of industry.  There is, of course, continuous co-operation in the organisation of course between the IMI, AnCO and the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer grant to the institute for 1976 is £300,000.  This will be supplemented by European Social Fund money.  To date, the institute have received £505,045 from the fund in respect of 1973 and 1974 and a further grant of £300,000 has been approved for 1975.  A similar amount is expected to be approved for 1976.</P>
    <P>The institute have a crucial role to play in helping managers to overcome the numerous problems posed by the recession, technological change and legitimate aspirations of employees seeking a say in the management of the firms in which they work.</P>
    <P>In regard to the National Manpower Service, Deputies may like to note that in 1975 a total of 15,023 placements were made from 22,115 vacancies which were notified.  Comparable figures for 1974 were 15,724 placements made from 24,234 vacancies notified.  In the first three months of 1976, 3,919 placements were made from 5,746 vacancies notified. It is gratifying that more and more people, job seekers and employers alike, are recognising the benefits of the service.  This manpower service has both an economic and a social function which I feel cannot be separated. Its main economic tasks are: to help employers to fill vacancies as quickly as possible with workers who have the ability or who can be trained to do the required job; and to help workers who are unemployed or redundant, or who wish to change their job, to find a new job which matches their abilities and aptitudes.  By doing this the manpower service help to keep down the level of unemployment by reducing the time spent in moving between jobs, and the loss of output arising from unfilled jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> Equally important, however, is the social responsibility which the service have to those workers who experience difficulty in obtaining or keeping employment. Sometimes it is a question of giving advice or guidance to such people or of drawing their attention to opportunities for training.  The extent to which the manpower service are able to fulfil their role depends to a large extent on their knowledge of the labour market and the extensive contacts which they have established with employers in their normal day-to-day work.</P>
    <P>I would on this occasion appeal to employers to use the National Manpower Service when recruiting workers of any kind and at all levels or for advice or information on manpower matters.  The service now have a network of 26 manpower offices and a further three offices will be opened during this year.  It is my intention that the manpower service should be further strengthened as quickly as possible so that they can make an even greater contribution towards increasing the efficiency of the labour market at this difficult time.</P>
    <P>Despite the recession, information literature on careers is now a great necessity.  Accurate and up-to-date information is one of the great needs of young people and more so today than ever before.  Over 250 career leaflets, covering most careers and opportunities in this country have been published and widely distributed. I am most anxious that the information available reaches every child and every parent.  Though the number of career guidance teachers in the schools has increased and an increasing number of young people are availing themselves of the services provided, I am still not satisfied that the information is reaching those most in need of it.  To meet as wide a section of the public as possible, staff of my Department are attending a greater number of careers exhibitions as well as local shows and trade fairs.</P>
    <P>A short audio-visual programme on the subject of choosing a career has been produced and has been shown at a number of exhibitions.  It is proposed <Col N="164" /> to have further programmes on various careers produced before the end of the year.  Slide versions of all programmes will be available for distribution to schools and youth organisations.</P>
    <P>In regard to an occupational guidance service, I believe the essential feature of a modern employment service is the provision of a staff specially trained and qualified in occupational guidance.  These staff do not in any way duplicate the work of the schools counselling service, being concerned only with adults and young people who have left school.  I see a special role for the occupational guidance service in assisting redundant workers, whose skills have become obsolete, to make a fresh start in employment. Married women wishing to return to the work force after a number of years spent at home raising a family, should also find this service of great benefit to them.  A start with this service has been made in the Dublin and Galway offices of the manpower service last summer and I hope to expand it into other offices during this year.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the resettlement assistance scheme is to remedy structural and regional or area imbalances in the labour force and secure the best possible match between manpower supply and demand to the advantage of national economic development. The scheme provides financial assistance to those who are obliged to move to other areas within the country and emigrants returning home to take up employment arranged for them through the National Manpower Service.  It is still difficult to arrange for inner mobility within the country in relation to job opportunities, even at the present time.  Grants are also payable to persons to travel to undertake training or to be tested as to their suitability for such training. The numbers availing themselves of the grants under the scheme are increasing annually and I am confident that the scheme will help towards ensuring that sufficient skilled workers will be available for the industrial developments now proceeding in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> The question of the free movement of workers within the EEC is often raised in relation to the National Manpower Service.  The National Manpower Service of my Department are now responsible for the implementation of the EEC regulations on freedom of movement of workers within the Community.  This, in effect, means helping workers who want to move and also employers, both here and in the other EEC countries, in recruiting workers for jobs which cannot be filled within their own states.  Under the terms negotiated for entry to the European Economic Communities this country was allowed to retain its existing controls on the admission of non-nationals for work up to the end of 1977.  However, the manpower service are obliged, in common with their opposite numbers in the Community, to notify the EEC secretariat at Brussels and the other member states each month of vacancies which they cannot fill from within this country and also to furnish a return giving an occupational breakdown of Irish workers interested in working in the other EEC countries.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence of any major movement of workers from Ireland to the continental countries.  Since accession to the EEC our records show that not more than some 800 persons expressed an interest in going abroad.  We know that of these, 94 were offered employment, and that the majority went in order to improve their skills, broaden their experience or to perfect their knowledge of languages.  Our figures relate, of course, only to those who went through the manpower service.  We are aware that others went on their own initiative or in response to Press advertisements; some of the latter, as we learned later, with not too happy results.</P>
    <P>My main priority in this matter is to press that the energies of the Community policies and institutions of which we are members be directed towards bringing jobs to people rather than encouraging emigration to find work.  Firms which have problems in recruiting workers should be encouraged to locate new plants in the <Col N="166" /> regions of the Community where manpower is available.</P>
    <P>This has been a bad year for school leavers seeking employment.  The unprecedented high rate of unemployment has made it difficult if not impossible for many school leavers to get jobs.  This was why I asked the training authority to set up a community youth training programme.  In co-operation with the National Manpower Service, local authorities and voluntary organisations, training is being provided for unemployed young people in basic skills while undertaking projects of social value.</P>
    <P>Following some basic training at a training centre, the young people gain working experience on the site under the supervision of a senior trainee who is an unemployed craftsman. The work, which would not otherwise have been done by full-time workers, includes repairs to old folks' homes, community halls, children's playgrounds, centres for handicapped children and premises for travelling people.  Local authorities and voluntary bodies put forward the projects and the training authority assess their training content before including them in the programme.</P>
    <P>In addition, the introduction of the new apprenticeship system will mean increased opportunities for young people and the substantially increased funds made available to the training authority will benefit young people because the majority of trainees of the training authority are in the 18-25 age group.  It is planned to provide training places in the training centres for 1,000 apprentices in 1976.  With the assistance of the European Social Fund, technician courses for approximately 800 students are being provided by the Department of Education at regional technical colleges. These students are paid an allowance of over £8 per week while training. Recruitment for these courses was carried out jointly by the Department of Education and the National Manpower Service.  The expansion of the CERT training programme for new recruits to the hotels and catering industry, which I have described, is also aimed mainly at school leavers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> Last year I set up a working party to examine the position as to manpower and training for employment arising from the discovery of natural gas off Kinsale and the further possibilities resulting from the extensive exploration off our coasts for oil and gas.  The working party submitted their first report to me recently and the report has been made public.  This report contained a series of recommendations about co-ordination of third-level education for the industry, introduction of additional third-level courses relevant to the industry, use of funds for education and training provided by the oil companies, action by the training authority on training of skilled workers and provision of employment services by the National Manpower Service to secure maximum employment opportunities for our workers.  The recommendations in the report are now being followed up in consultation with the other Departments concerned and the National Manpower Service have started discussions with the oil companies and the contractors involved, about employment opportunities for Irish workers on the various operations started and planned.  My aim is to secure effective action by the official agencies involved so that Irish people are employed to the maximum extent practicable on the exploration and development work and the &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; activities arising from the explorations of our natural resources.</P>
    <P>The continuing success of the Labour Court and of the Rights Commissioner Service is evidenced from the increasing demands being imposed on them.  In 1975, the Labour Court and its Conciliation Service dealt with 1,157 cases as compared with 987 in 1974.  During 1975, 1,139 cases were referred to the Rights Commissioner, an increase of 38 per cent on the 1974 figure.  Because of the increasing demands on the service, I appointed an additional Rights Commissioner on 14th February, 1976.</P>
    <P>The extent to which the Government attach importance to a well-informed and responsible trade union movement can be gauged from the <Col N="168" /> allocation of Exchequer funds for trade union education and training. This year that allocation is £150,000. To achieve the best utilisation of this money, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions at my request submitted to me a co-ordinated programme of education and training for the trade union movement in 1975.  It will be noted that the increase of funds to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is about three times what it was in 1973.  I am hopeful that this programme means that future co-ordination between the training activities of Congress and its affiliated unions will be possible.</P>
    <P>The Government are conscious, as indeed is the trade union movement itself, of the need to rationalise the existing rather unwieldy structure of trade union organisation in this country.  However, I see the role of Government in this area as essentially supportive of the positive measures that trade unions themselves may adopt to remedy the situation. Already Government initiatives in trade union law have been directed towards providing an incentive towards rationalisation and assistance in preventing further fragmentation.</P>
    <P>The Trade Union Act, 1975, is designed to bring some order and clarity into some obscure legal areas. The Act, some details of which have been given for the information of Deputies, will facilitate amalgamations and transfers of engagements between those trade unions wishing to do so of their own volition and it provides for financial assistance towards the expenses incurred in any such transfers or amalgamations.  A special feature of this Act was the inclusion of a significant provision, in view of the all-Ireland structure of the trade union movement itself and of many of its constituent unions, enabling the Thirty-two County membership of British-based trade unions, if they so wish, to proceed with an amalgamation or transfer of engagements as if that membership itself constituted a trade union. Naturally, I am hopeful that this measure will stimulate progress towards the rationalisation which we all so earnestly desire.  The Act <Col N="169" /> further provides that British-based unions operating in this country must have an executive located within the Thirty-two Counties with power to take decisions over a wide range of matters.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Relations Act, 1976, is primarily designed to provide for the replacement of the Agricultural Wages Board by a Joint Labour Committee for agricultural workers set up under the aegis of the Labour Court. The proposed committee will be responsible for regulating the rates of pay and conditions of employment of agricultural workers of whom there are 20,000 in full-time employment and 14,000 in part-time employment. The Joint Labour Committee will, in its representation, permit farmers and their workers to determine together the future conditions of employment in this important industry. The Agricultural Wages Board will be disbanded as and from the making of the first employment regulation order covering agricultural workers, the provisions of which will be enforced by the Department's general inspectorate.  I believe that future agreements arrived at by utilising the procedures of this Act will lead to the elimination of the differential that has been allowed to develop over the years resulting in a growing gap between the working conditions of the farm workers and those of other industrial employees.</P>
    <P>The Act also provides for the appointment of at least one extra division of the Labour Court.  The widening range of worker protection legislation has imposed a heavier work-load on the Labour Court.  The court at present operates in three divisions and the Bill facilitates the appointment of additional divisions by order to enable it to deal with this increasing work-load.  Section 9 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, provides for the appointment of two Labour Court members&mdash;one employers', one workers'&mdash;to arbitration boards in the public service; the appointment to be made on the making of the appropriate order by me.  The fullest consultations have taken place with the parties concerned <Col N="170" /> and it has been agreed that the implementation of section 9 should be deferred on the understanding that, as from 16th July, 1975, one employers' member and one workers' member of the court will sit on an arbitration board for a particular claim when either side so requests.  This arrangement is an interim one and will be reviewed after a year of its operation.</P>
    <P>I have previously indicated my intention to introduce further legislation to improve the overall climate of industrial relations.  In connection with this I am reviewing the operation of the Rights Commissioner service and I intend to bring forward soon proposals for its development.  The first Rights Commissioners were appointed in 1970.  Since then the Rights Commissioner service has become an integral part of our industrial relations institutions.</P>
    <P>I have given considerable attention to the problems of lower paid workers and I have, in consultation with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Labour Court, under consideration proposals for improving the existing legislation dealing with the statutory regulation of wages.  I feel that one method of tackling the problem of low pay is through the establishment of further joint labour committees where low pay can be identified.  I have already requested the Labour Court to establish a Joint Labour Committee for the restaurant trade, and, as I have already stated a Joint Labour Committee is about to be set up for agricultural workers. The legislation affecting these committees could I feel, in the light of experience gained since 1946, be improved upon so as to improve the efficiency of operation of existing committees and make it easier to establish new committees.  A new development that I might mention briefly here is the establishment of the industrial relations monitoring unit charged with the difficult task of anticipating areas of potential conflict where the public interest might be involved.</P>
    <P>On the question of minimum wages and conditions of employment, I should like to state that while the <Col N="171" /> salaries and wages of a major portion of the workers are catered for under voluntary agreements, there are others to whom for one reason or another this does not apply.  These are workers, numbering about 40,000, who come within the scope of employment regulation orders made by the Labour Court on the proposals of the various Joint Labour Committees set up under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.  In addition, there are also about 60,000 workers, who are covered by the terms and conditions of the employment agreements registered by the Labour Court, mainly in the construction industry.  It is my responsibility to enforce the provisions of the employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements on behalf of these 100,000 workers.</P>
    <P>My policy is to prosecute employers who fail to observe the terms of the employment regulations orders particularly with reference to wages.  I have been pursuing this policy through the general inspection section of my Department.  The number of inspections made during the year 1975 was 4,271 and payment of arrears due to workers amounting to £7,200 was effected.  Defaulting employers are, in fact, in a minority.</P>
    <P>My main purpose in initiating prosecutions is to alert workers to the protection which the law can afford them and the facilities available to them through the services of my Department.  I also hope that the prosecutions will serve as a deterrent to other employers, a minority though they may be, who are disposed to underpay their employees.  A decline in the volume of arrears found to be due to workers suggests that my policy of prosecuting defaulting employers is succeeding.</P>
    <P>In addition to the enforcement of the statutory minimum wages and conditions laid down in employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements.  I have the responsibility of ensuring that the worker protection measures laid down in various Acts are complied with, notably the Conditions of Employment <Col N="172" /> Acts, the Holidays Act and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act.  A piece of worker protection legislation of current interest is that contained in the European Community Social Regulation on Road Transport.  Briefly, these govern maximum hours of driving and provide for the introduction of monitoring equipment in vehicles.  While deferment of part of the requirements of these regulations has been obtained, we must plan for a smooth transition to the full requirements of the legislation when this becomes necessary.</P>
    <P>The redundancy payments scheme which started in 1968 has helped over 67,000 persons who lost their jobs because of redundancy.  The scheme was amended in 1971 and again in 1974 in order to improve benefits and to bring more people within the scope of the benefits.</P>
    <P>The main features of the scheme are, a lump sum payment and a system of weekly payments.  The lump sum is payable by the employer and the weekly payments are made from the redundancy fund.  A proportion of the lump sum is recoverable from the fund by the employer.  Another feature of the scheme is that payment of the lump sum is guaranteed to a redundant worker where an employer is unable to make payment because of, for example, insolvency.  In that case the lump sum may be paid direct from the redundancy fund.  The liability incurred by the fund in respect of such lump sum payments since the inception of the scheme amounted to almost £½ million by the end of 1975. The bulk of this was in respect of firms in receivership, insolvent and so on.  The fund is financed by weekly contributions from employers and employees. In 1975 the fund had a deficit of over £2¾ million in income to meet its statutory outgoings and it was necessary to meet this deficit by way of repayable Exchequer advances and by exhausting the fund's investment account.  The contribution increases recently provided for are designed to reduce the current deficit in the fund by the end of 1977.  The detailed reasons for the increases are threefold.  Firstly, the higher than expected rate of redundancy <Col N="173" /> in 1975.  Secondly, a greater number of redundant workers tended to remain unemployed far longer than usual because of a depressed employment market.  Thirdly, a larger number of workers than usual lost their jobs because of liquidations and receiverships and it was necessary to step in and pay the lump sums of these workers from the fund, a possibility that is provided for in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The industrial inspectorate of my Department is the body which has the responsibility of promoting the safety, health and welfare of workers.  This body has the task of ensuring that employers meet their obligations under the various worker-protection Acts administered by the Department, particularly the Factories Act, 1955 and the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965. An additional activity of the inspectorate is to provide a safety-advisory and accident-prevention service to industry.</P>
    <P>The importance of the advisory functions of the inspectorate can hardly be overstressed.  Only if safety considerations are kept constantly in mind can the toll of industrial accidents be kept to a minimum.  Any employer with a problem in the field of worker safety is invited to seek the advice of the inspectorate at any time.  I again appeal to managements to make the fullest use of this service.  Industrial growth and the increasing complexity of industrial processes continue to place a strain on the resources of the inspectorate.  Its strength has been increased and arrangements have been made to augment it still further.</P>
    <P>The efforts of the industrial inspectorate in the interests of worker safety are supplemented by the National Industrial Safety Organisation (NISO). NISO is a voluntary body, supported in part and when necessary, by a grant from the Department of Labour which also supplies it with staff and accommodation. It seeks to help management and workers in tackling safety problems in the work place, by collecting information on worker safety from kindred organisations in other countries, by publishing leaflets, posters and booklets on the subject and by putting on safety films and exhibitions, holding lectures <Col N="174" /> and seminars and putting on safety training courses for personnel.  As a useful step towards creating an atmosphere of greater safety consciousness among workers, I appeal to all employers who have not already done so to join the National Industrial Safety Organisation.</P>
    <P>With increasing industrialisation new hazards to the safety and health of the worker continually arise or are acknowledged as such.  In this connection I should like to refer to concern about disease associated with asbestos dust which was recently the subject of a question in this House.  I have made regulations under the Factories Act providing for the protection of workers who might be exposed to the dangers arising from the handling of asbestos or materials containing asbestos and Deputies can be assured that the up-to-date safety standards laid down will be enforced so as to safeguard the health of the workers concerned.  Ideally, occupational health hazards should be anticipated and corrective or preventive action taken.  In an effort to achieve this end the surveys of health hazards in industry are continuing and I have plans for setting up an occupational health service.  A new development has been the appointment of a doctor as industrial medical adviser in the occupational health service and I expect that he will take up duty within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>In recent times the trend towards worker democracy has been gaining increasing momentum throughout Europe.  It seemed, however, that Ireland was going to remain an island isolated from this movement, not participating in the European movement. That is not to deny the existence here of a <i>de facto</i> form of worker participation through the collective bargaining system.  In this way, as Deputies know, workers can influence decisions through consultations and negotiations at plant and industry level and, in the case of some agreements, like the national wage agreement, at national level.</P>
    <P>Yet what I regard as a fundamental right&mdash;the right to codecision&mdash;is not guaranteed to workers.  It has, of course, been the subject of some discussion on <Col N="175" /> occasions.  Nevertheless, no firm legislative commitment had been given or no positive action had been taken in this direction until this Government &mdash;as an integral part of its policy&mdash; committed itself to the introduction of worker participation in State enterprises by way of the election of employee representatives to State boards.</P>
    <P>Towards this end, I set up a special unit within my Department with responsibility for the advancement of worker participation.  I gave priority to the drafting of the legislation necessary for the implementation of the Government's undertaking.  I have already announced the broad proposals which I have in mind and which have been approved by the Government.  The consultations with the interests concerned are at an advanced stage, and I hope to be in a position to introduce the Bill in the Dáil shortly.</P>
    <P>I regard this legislation as a most practical and significant contribution towards improving industrial relations: for the first time in the history of our State, workers in an enterprise will be represented when important policy decisions which affect their interests are being taken at board level.  The legislation which I envisage would give a legal right to workers to elect representatives to the boards of State enterprises.  These representatives will sit on the board with other directors and will participate fully with the other directors in determining the policy-making decisions of the enterprise.  The legislation will be limited initially to seven State enterprises&mdash;Aer Lingus Teoranta; Bord na Móna; British and Irish Steam Packet Company Limited; Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta; Coras Iompair Éireann; Electricity Supply Board; Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta&mdash; to see how it works.</P>
    <P>I believe that the State has an obligation to be in the forefront of social change.  If, therefore, the proposed legislation is confined to State enterprises it is because&mdash;being an area in which the State can directly influence policy&mdash;they commend themselves to me as being the most <Col N="176" /> suitable area for social innovation.  It is not my intention to dogmatise about solutions: I am, therefore, seeking to provide legislation of maximum flexibility.  In this way, with a careful monitoring and a critical analysis of developments I would hope to be able, if necessary, to introduce whatever modifications may be necessary in the light of experience.  I shall, moreover, ensure that the distinctive features in the Irish social, economic and political situation, which demand distinctive treatment, are taken into account.  It is my conviction that worker democracy is an essential complement to political democracy.  In this regard, I hope to provide a model in State enterprises which can serve as an example for the rest of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I do not see the appointment of worker directors as the be all and end all of worker participation&mdash;far from it.  It is my aim to ensure that continuing progress will be made in the entire area.  Other forms of participation are being examined in my Department.  The worker participation unit is also studying measures which would improve worker participation at various other levels of decision making.  These include: measures to improve the quality and design of jobs; the enlargement and enrichment of jobs generally and the possibility of setting up semi-autonomous work groups.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of Women had examined comprehensively the position of women in Ireland and the recommendations in their report of May, 1973, has furnished much of the impetus for the legal reform initiated in this area by this Administration.</P>
    <P>In this connection I would like to refer to the work of the Women's Representative Committee, which I set up, under the chairmanship of Eileen Desmond, T.D.  The setting up of an official body to represent women's interests was one of the recommendations in the commission's report.  One of the tasks which I assigned to this committee was to report to me on progress towards the implementation of the recommendations <Col N="177" /> in the report and to make submissions on the legislative and administrative reforms which will ensure that Irish women participate fully in Irish society, in politics, in local government, wherever vital decisions affecting the lives of our citizens are being made.</P>
    <P>The Women's Representative Committee has a broad and challenging role.  Apart from its main function to report on progress towards the implementation of the recommendations in the Commission on the Status of Women's report it may make recommendations on any other matters affecting women which arise in the future.</P>
    <P>During the past year the committee has made recommendations on the training of girl apprentices and on improved industrial training for women and has made other submissions and recommendations relating to reform of the law, free legal civil aid and advice.  The committee is also examining areas such as social welfare, taxation of married women, flexible working hours and creche facilities.  The committee regards its work as ongoing and intends to press ahead vigorously in the coming year with a comprehensive programme to highlight the many areas of discrimination against women which still exist.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, the reforms required to enable women in this country to participate in all spheres of life with men will not be accomplished overnight.  However, it is the intention of my colleagues and I that the recommendations from this committee are implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>During 1975 the Women's Representative Committee acted as an advisory body in relation to the national programme for United Nations International Women's Year.  Many successful seminars, projects and exhibitions were held and I am confident that the Year succeeded in drawing the attention of men and women to the necessity of the increased involvement of women in forming the society of equality we wish to have in this country.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to legislation <Col N="178" /> passed which will provide equality of treatment in respect of pay at work, for example, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and to legislation pending that is the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill which I hope to bring before the House shortly.  I think the provisions of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, are well known to most Members of the House.  Basically, it entitles women doing like work with men or work of equal value to equal remuneration and allows individual women who feel they have been discriminated against in this regard to avail themselves of legal remedies to attain such rights.</P>
    <P>In respect of this Act Deputies will be aware that application has been made to the European Community seeking financial aid to deal with possible employment consequences which could follow its immediate implementation in the case of certain firms.  We were compelled to take this step since the procedure suggested in our proposed Anti-Discrimination (Pay) (Amendment) Bill, namely, that where employees in an undertaking were convinced that job loss would be a consequence of the implementation of the 1974 equal pay Act that such employees would have the right to decide on their own pace of phasing in of the provision of the 1974 Act subject to a time limit of two years, were not acceptable to the commission.  The Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill which has yet to become law will make it unlawful to discriminate on grounds of sex or marriage as regards access to employment, training for or during employment, conditions of employment, promotion, re-grading in employment and job classification.  It is open to individual women who are the victims of such discrimination to have recourse to the procedure of the Labour Court or the courts of law for legal remedies.</P>
    <P>The legislation will apply to employers in general.  It will also apply to employment agencies in so far as their activities in offering vacancies and submitting people for jobs must not be discriminatory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> The Bill deals with the situation where an organisation confines its membership, or the benefits deriving from membership, on grounds of sex. Trade unions, employers' organisations and professional and trade organisations come into this category since membership of these organisations can affect eligibility and opportunity for employment or the carrying on of a business or profession.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide power to initiate action in cases of discrimination where it would not be reasonable to rely on reference of disputes by individuals and where procedures for enforcement in the public interest would be desirable.  Such cases would include discriminatory advertisements or where there was pressure to discriminate or where a general policy of discrimination was being followed by a firm or organisation.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that an agency will be established under this Bill which will investigate practices that appear to be discriminatory. If such practices are found to be unlawful the agency will use their enforcement powers to eliminate them.  The agency will launch a comprehensive programme of information about rights under the anti-discrimination legislation and any other matters affecting the status of women.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that the Bill gives power to repeal by affirmative order protective legislation affecting women in employment which is no longer justified.  A review of this legislation will first of all be carried out in consultation with the social partners, the employers and unions.</P>
    <P>Apart from the action I have already taken to curb discrimination against women in employment, it is also my intention to tackle other areas where I find discrimination widely practised.  Two possible areas of discrimination which I have had recently researched are those of age and social origin.  The conclusions are now being examined in my Department.  There is evidence of late to suggest that discrimination on social grounds operates at the level of unskilled educationally deprived young people of socially disadvantaged <Col N="180" /> backgrounds.  It would seem to be confined to certain areas of Dublin and to a lesser extent in the large cities and towns where industry is concentrated.  Further areas where discriminatory practices come to light will also be probed and legislation introduced if there seems good reason to do so.</P>
    <P>I have arranged for the formulation of legislative proposals to protect employees who are unfairly dismissed. At present, an employee seeking legal redress in a dismissal case can do so only through the civil courts.  The formality, delays and costs of such proceedings can often act as a major deterrent to the use of the civil court machinery.  The legislation which I will propose will provide a simple, effective and cheap means of having the fairness of a dismissal tested.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the new legislation would provide an appeals machinery under which the circumstances of a dismissal could be objectively investigated and adjudicated upon in accordance with specified criteria.  Where an employee was found to have been unfairly dismissed, the remedies would include re-engagement or compensation.</P>
    <P>The Government have given their approval to the proposals and the Bill is at present being drafted.  Consultations are taking place with the social partners and Government Departments. I hope to introduce the legislation shortly.</P>
    <P>A Bill is also being prepared aimed at affording greater protection to workers threatened by collective redundancies and at bringing about harmonisation of policies in the EEC member countries for dealing with collective redundancies.  The Bill will require employers contemplating collective redundancies to consult workers' representatives about ways of avoiding such redundancies and of mitigating their consequences.  Worker representatives must be given information as to the reason for the proposed redundancies, the number of workers to be made redundant, the number of workers normally employed and the period over which the redundancies are to be effected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> I should like now to comment on secondary legislation on safety, health and welfare.  The making of regulations under the Factories Act, 1955, and the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965, is a continuing feature of the administration of these Acts.  Technological change and increased knowledge arising from research into the causes of accidents and industrial diseases require that the operating conditions in factories, mines and quarries be kept under review and that the statutory rules for securing the safety and health of workers are adapted as frequently as necessary.</P>
    <P>The industrial inspectorate of my Department is continuously monitoring working conditions with particular attention to the identification of new hazards; 43 sets of regulations have been made since April, 1973, prescribing special precautions to be taken in certain industrial processes. Preparatory work is in progress on other regulations.  It is through the medium of these various regulations taken in conjunction with the provisions of the parent Acts that my Department can develop a flexible response to the hazards arising from changing conditions of production.</P>
    <P>In the area of legislation there is, too, the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill.  Deputies will be generally familiar with the subject matter of this Bill which is at present before the Seanad.  It sets down certain minimum conditions of employment for people under 18 years.  The various standards incorporated in the Bill relate to the minimum age for entry into employment, the limited exceptions below that age, the maximum working hours which a young employee may not be permitted to exceed, normal working hours, rest intervals and restrictions on night work.  In addition, there are provisions about evidence of age, keeping of appropriate records, powers of inspection, prosecution and penalties.</P>
    <P>I have thought it desirable to have a comprehensive review of the Factories Act, 1955, carried out.  As Deputies know, technological developments affecting production methods and materials can be a source of new <Col N="182" /> hazards and risks to the safety and health of workers.  The review was designed to assess the adequacy of the main powers which I have under the Act so as to ensure that the greatest possible protection for the safety and health of workers in modern industrial conditions can be arranged. Following this study I propose to seek Government approval for legislation which will provide further measures for the protection of the worker.</P>
    <P>On the question of EEC social policy, our twin concerns in the area of social policy have consisted in extending the range of Community social policy as well as a consistent effort to make the European Social Fund an instrument better attuned to the problems of underdevelopment, social and economic, throughout the Community.  Our objective has been to make social policy at Community level respond to the employment problem being experienced throughout the Nine.  Our central concern in the social policy area has consisted in an endeavour to end the separation of social from economic policy in the hope that this must eventually confront Community social policy with the principal social evil of our time in Europe, that is unemployment.  Irish emphasis on the need to make Community social policy responsive to the problems created by unemployment now has greater support within the Community than formerly, though there is still quite a long way to go before one could express satisfaction with the sum of Community endeavour on this matter.  We can, however, take some pride in the fact that input in policy formation at European level is now bearing some fruit. Next month's Tripartite Conference in Luxembourg should see additional progress being made in the direction sought by us all along over the past three years.</P>
    <P>The holding of the first meeting of the Standing Committee on Employment under the Irish Presidency and our efforts to obtain joint meetings of Ministers for Finance and Labour, European employer and trade union bodies have been consistent with our overall objectives in the social policy <Col N="183" /> area.  During the Irish Presidency of the Social Affairs Council, I advocated a joint approach to the serious employment situation involving Ministers for Finance and Social Affairs. I am glad to say that these interests referred to attended such a meeting on 18th November, 1975, involving Ministers for Finance, Social Affairs and the social partners.  Discussion at this conference centred on problems of recovery of the economy and on the general employment situation. There was a consensus for an active community employment policy with special attention being paid to young workers and mobility of workers.  The need for reflation of the economies of member states without at the same time generating further inflation; the importance of investment in both the public and private sectors as well as the problems arising from increasing costs of raw materials were other subjects discussed at the conference. At the conference I argued that the Community response to the present employment crisis was totally inadequate and that the Community needed a financial instrument such as an employment fund, which could be brought to bear directly on the employment situation by existing member countries in measures to create and maintain employment.  I have since given an outline of my ideas for such a fund to the Commission.</P>
    <P>Any appraisal of the effectiveness of Community social policy over the past few years must inevitably lead to the conclusion that a fresh instrument is needed which will have a direct impact on employment with the resources of a separate fund behind it.</P>
    <P>Speaking of community social policy brings to mind the question of the social fund; that it cannot operate successfully without the requisite resources remains the Irish position.  We shall continue in the context of developing community social policy to criticise, I hope, constructively shortcomings as we see them in the structure of the social fund as at present organised.  In doing so, however, I should like to make it clear that we <Col N="184" /> have done extremely well in terms of support from the fund in relation to our size and population.</P>
    <P>In 1973, which was the first full year of operation of the new fund, we submitted 22 applications for assistance to a total figure of approximately £5.3 million.  Our applications were successful to a total figure of approximately £4.6 million of which £4.1 million related to operations scheduled to take place in 1973 and the balance of about £½ million related to commitments for operations proposed for 1974 and 1975.</P>
    <P>For 1975 we lodged 64 applications for an amount of about £16.5 million. Of the £16.5 million requested in the applications the Commission has approved assistance of about £14.1 million.</P>
    <P>A total of 47 applications for an amount of £12.1 million has been lodged by us with the Commission in relation to operations commencing in 1976.  Further applications will be submitted throughout this year.  One aspect of the administration of the fund which has been a cause of dissatisfaction has been the delays in making grants payments.  The Commission undertook to take measures which, it was hoped, would help to streamline procedures.  I expect that the position should improve from now on but the whole question is one which I will continue to keep under review and if delays persist, I will continue to press the Commission to take whatever remedial action may be necessary. I should make it clear that any criticisms I have to make are not intended in any way to reflect on the attitudes of individual Commission officials.  Indeed, I should express my appreciation of the assistance which Commission officials dealing with the social fund have always given to my Department.</P>
    <P>Although the resources of the social fund in 1976 were increased by 85 million units of account over the amount provided in the 1975 budget the insufficiency of the amount available this year is already evident.  The latest figures available to us show that the amounts of fund assistance requested in current applications on the <Col N="185" /> part of countries are in the region of 2½ times as much as the amounts available for distribution under both Articles 4 and 5.  These figures do not, of course, take account of further applications which will be submitted later in 1976.  The result is that numerous worthwhile applications for fund assistance will either have to be denied assistance altogether or can receive only limited help.</P>
    <P>While we are not happy with the level of increase proposed by the Commission for the social fund as a whole in 1977, we have even more serious reservations about the proposal to allocate the entire amount of that increase to Article 4.  Whilst we understand that the proposal to bring the amounts of credits for the two Articles 4 and 5 into balance in 1977 may be seen as a step in that necessary direction, we consider that the Commission should proceed more cautiously towards equilibrium between the two Articles.</P>
    <P>As we see it, the reason for the initial advantage given to Article 5 apart from the time needed to introduce areas of Article 4 intervention, was to allow less-developed regions of the Community a chance to catch up with the standards of the more developed regions.  Economic conditions especially during the present recession, has meant that the position of less developed regions has deteriorated sharply.  We consider, therefore, that much more time is needed to allow the less-developed Community regions to improve their relative positions and that a strong Article 5 should be maintained to help that trend.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this matter of the social fund, which after the agricultural fund provides most financial assistance to the State from the EEC, I should refer to the fact that since the Department of Labour is the body designated by the Government to have overall responsibility for the social fund, I arranged recently for a meeting to take place which would review the experience of Irish applications to the European Social Fund over the past three years.  This meeting took place on 12th March, 1976 and the <Col N="186" /> attendance included representatives of employers, trade unions, Government Departments and semi-State bodies; representatives of 50 private firms and rehabilitation bodies who had benefited from the fund also attended.</P>
    <P>Finally, on EEC matters generally, I would like to tell the House that on 6th May the first meeting of the Administrative Board of the European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions took place in Dublin.  The foundation is the first EEC body to be located in Ireland and will have a budget of approximately £500,000 for 1976.  I should like on this occasion to thank our colleagues in the other EEC countries, who after our intensive lobbying in both the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers and in the Council of Social Affairs Ministers accorded us the necessary support to obtain this foundation for Ireland.  As a principal research centre of the European Community, it has, I believe, a very important role to play in the future of the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the 10th anniversary of the setting up of the Department of Labour by a Fianna Fáil Government.  I have listened to the lengthy speech of the Minister for Labour, who has been one-third of that time in office.  If he were at the beginning of his Ministry, one would say he was the Minister who promised most or, to put it another way, the most promising Minister.  Experience, however, over that period has shown that his contribution in that vital Ministry in our present-day society has been disappointing, to say the least.  The past 18 months particularly has seen him moving from crisis to crisis, from disaster to disaster.  While he made a long Estimate speech this morning, he avoided going into detail on the main areas giving us concern at present.  For the past 15 months I have been spokesman on this Department on this side of the House.  This is the first time in that 15 months that we have had an opportunity of debating the Labour Estimate.  It is unfortunate that when presented to us there <Col N="187" /> is an urgency about this Estimate, as we discovered earlier on the Order of Business this morning.  This highlights the fire-brigade type of tactics employed by this Minister and his Government.  They never do anything until the last minute, until money is really needed.  Is it any wonder that the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Saturday morning last carried the headline &ldquo;We Are Broke&rdquo;, that there is no money to pay the public service if a pay rise is agreed to?  That independent organ, which not even the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, by any stretch of the imagination, or even in his wildest, most irresponsible moments could say was a Fianna Fáil organ, saw fit to carry that headline.  When one listened to the Minister's speech this morning one could express so much disappointment with it.  The Minister's fear to mention specifically or to deal in detail with the areas really affecting our society is a further indictment of his lack of performance in this vital role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer to the economic climate and outlook and to illustrate this I will comment on the economic review of the Confederation of Irish Industry published last week&mdash;No. 1 of 1976. This body have played a very important role in our industrial development. They refer to the Irish economic performance since the oil crisis and mention the OECD report on the economic outlook.  They produce four tables, one for 1974, one for 1975, a forecast for 1976 and an overall table for the period.  The indicators used, which are mainly concerned with employment, are the difference between the actual GNP growth, and the average GNP growth during the sixties, the difference between the actual inflation and average inflation during the sixties, the change in the foreign balance in 1973 as a percentage of the GNP and, most important, the change in unemployment since 1973 as a percentage of the labour force.  Twenty countries are listed in these four tables.  In 1974, on table 1, Ireland's overall rank is nineteenth, the only one behind us is Australia, where the Government who <Col N="188" /> then operated have since been removed from office.  In the 1975 table, the 1976 table and the overall table from 1974 to 1976 we are placed twentieth.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that it says that the message is clear enough, that not all of the blame for our current economic situation can be ascribed to the oil crisis and world recession?  Poor economic management is the other obvious contributory factor.  That is why this morning our Minister for Labour absolutely ignored the major problem facing us&mdash;the problem of continuing high unemployment figures, that presently bear no relation to the register of such figures circulated to us weekly. By June, which is only next month our actual and factual unemployment figures will have exceeded 200,000 people.  The Minister has made very brief and rather indifferent reference to the plight of our school leavers within that huge figure.  Those young people will eventually blame the Minister for the lack of opportunity for them when their school days are over. The Minister referred to the fact that last year was a difficult year for many of them and that many failed to gain employment.  What about the huge number that are now coming on the employment market, some of them having repeated a further year and with very little effort being made to create employment for them?  The Minister has concealed the true facts of the lack of effort by this Government to take any positive measures to solve that problem.  It is the Minister's duty to solve it.  It is time the Minister came out from within the cossetted area he has allowed himself to be put into, covered in cotton wool, advised by intellectual economists who are not able to put their own intellectual economic philosophy into practice, or who would not be able to put any type of economic growth or progress into practice.</P>
    <P>My party and I have subscribed in the past, and will continue to support, the concept of State enterprise, State industry, and semi-State bodies.  Our former Taoiseach inaugurated and developed most of them.  The private sector is also a very important industrial <Col N="189" /> sector providing employment. The Minister and his colleagues seem to believe that that sector is not entitled to support, that that sector can go it alone.  That is a sector which has given a very high volume of employment, and could give more if the proper climate was created by the State, if the proper type of assistance was given, even State support if necessary, to some industries that have ailed in the past and are still ailing.  The type of people advising the Minister have never had the experience of the tough graft of private enterprise and private industry, where management has not always been perfect and where there is room for improvement.  Both good and bad managements have experienced difficulties of meeting the cost of continuing employment, and the cost of the weekly wage bill.  Until this Government realise that these people deserve support and that expansion should be encouraged our employment situation will not improve appreciably.  There has been an upsurge in the world economy, but there will be no improvement here until we positively face the problems that beset us.  This Government are obsessed with the idea of tax equity.  I fully support that idea.  However, the Government have regarded profit making as a sin totally opposed to their sociological ideals.  I frown on profit sharing used for the gainful advantage of an individual or a group of individuals.  But if profit is being put back into industrial development, if it is creating more jobs and continuing to update technology and equipment available to industry, then we should support and encourage it. We must bear in mind today the necessity for keeping our industry competitive.  That is one of the main areas where unemployment figures are so terribly high and why we are placed in a most unenviable position at the tail of a league such as this.  A vear or two ago the Minister for Finance referred to us as a small country floating in a terrible world-wide recession.  If one looks at the countries at the top of that league one sees that the vast majority are small also. <Col N="190" /> If we look at certain areas&mdash;and I shall include the premium employment programme and this morning's comment by the Minister on it&mdash; where have we lost the greatest number of jobs?  We have lost them in the textile, footwear, engineering, motor assembly and building industries, all industries that have been good to us traditionally, good to us in a social sort of way particularly.  One finds textile and footwear industries especially based all over rural Ireland. The closures that have taken place and which could have been averted constitute a serious economic problem.  They also create very serious social tragedies for many areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the slight effort made by the Minister in the programme to which he referred this morning. Although it may have been imaginative last year, there is no imagination in what he is doing today.  It was foreseeable that the programme would have to be extended.  The disappointing feature of it is that he did not do what we have been asking him to do for so long&mdash;extend its scope.  One must remember that for the most part very few school leavers can qualify under that programme.  Secondly, certain industries are excluded, for example, the building and service industries.  It was extended a few times previously because of our pressures. There is no glory or kudos to be gained for the Minister by saying that he will increase the premium paid under that programme from £12 to £15 because most of that increase will be absorbed into Government funds on account of the stamp and income tax increases.  Therefore, there is nothing new in that area.  The increased premium will merely keep it somewhere in line with the £12 given last year.</P>
    <P>In the Book of Estimates we see a figure of £1,250,000 for 1975.  I understood that figure was intended to cater for the target the Minister had in mind in respect of that scheme of 10,000 jobs.  Although on previous occasions the Minister mentioned 5,000, in the House this morning he admitted the truth by saying that 4,500 jobs only have been created under that programme. One must ask then if there <Col N="191" /> was a saving of more than £600,000 on that last year.  The same figure is shown in the 1976 Estimates as was shown for last year.  I would ask the Minister seriously to review the conditions of that premium employment programme.  In introducing this Estimate for £1,250,000, it is the Minister's duty to ensure that that sum is utilised fully for the re-employment of a number of people.  Dear knows it is little enough in these times.</P>
    <P>In his final comments the Minister referred to the European social policy and to the EEC Social Fund.  As I said earlier, the Minister has occupied his office for a third of the life of his ministry.  He has been the luckiest holder of the office because no predecessor of his had available to him the type of assistance now available from Europe.  While the entire amount of the Estimate does not go to the Department, most of it goes to agencies directly under its control.  A small amount will go to other people but the vast majority goes to AnCO, CERT and so on.  In 1973 we received £4.6 million from the fund.  In 1975 we received £14.1 million, a very significant contribution to the activities of this Minister and his Department. The question we must ask ourselves is: how well has the Minister spent the money?  Has it been spent as gainfully for the benefit of our people as it should and, hopefully, it has been.  The bulk of it went to AnCO.  In the Estimates here this morning there is £8,250,000 being provided by the Exchequer for AnCO for administration and general expenses. There is approximately £5,500,000 coming from Europe, which amounts to £14 million, not counting the £1,250,000 capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>I compliment AnCO on the wonderful work they have been and are doing.  I wish them well in the continuance of that work and in the expansion of their activities.  They are doing a marvellous job in training but there is a little more to training than the Minister seems to realise.  It must be frustrating for AnCO people and, indeed, for trained and retrained workers especially that there are so <Col N="192" /> few outlets for them.  I commend the idea of increasing the training to 11,000 but training is not the be all or end all of employment.  It is but the beginning.  Opportunities must be found for such people.  That is why I particularly criticise the Minister for referring here this morning to the sum of money made available in the public capital budget for the building and construction industry.  There the Minister is not comparing like with like because the increase in costs has been so great&mdash;some of the costs were demonstrated in this House last evening by Deputy O'Malley&mdash;particularly in the building industry in the past three years that the amount of money allocated now to building and construction bears no relation to what would have been allocated a couple of years ago.  The reality of the situation is that almost 12,000 more people are unemployed in that industry than there were at the beginning of last year.  That is particularly disappointing when one looks at the efforts of AnCo because, within that industry, there was a lot of room in the past for apprenticeships.  Indeed, within that and allied industries there were opportunities both for young trained and retrained workers.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there must be further developments from AnCO.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to say he is doing this this year because the reality of the situation is that we are training people for the dole queues.  There is no point in having well trained or well educated dole queues.  We must tackle the dole queues.  We must get people back to work.  This is what my party would and will do in the not too distant future, through the necessary restoration of confidence in our economy so sadly lacking at present. I read in the Press during the week a comment of the Minister for Industry and Commerce appealing for restoration of confidence and a stop to talk about there being no confidence in the economy at present.  The harsh reality of the situation is that we need many jobs.  We are not saying that.  It is not scare-mongering from here because in every type of production and newspaper one reads everyone is saying it.  We need jobs urgently.  We need <Col N="193" /> short term schemes.  We need long term ones also.</P>
    <P>The IDA have published a paper by Michael J. Killeen on industrial development and full employment.  The IDA have contributed a lot to employment in the past and they are continuing to do a very good job in those difficult times although they are not being helped by the industrial climate created by the Government.  Mr. Killeen in his paper, in relation to manufacturing, is talking of a figure from 17,000 to 19,000, which is a 1975 figure.  This year the figure in manufacturing industry is probably 25,000 jobs.  There must also be an equivalent figure in relation to the services industry, the non-manufacturing sector. Therefore, we are talking in the region of 40,000 new jobs needed in the next decade.</P>
    <P>This is a major task.  Unless steps are taken in time this cannot be done. If the will is not there there is no hope that it can ever be achieved.  This is not unachievable because the actual gross new jobs created during the two years ended December, 1974 were 17,800 in 1973 and 16,200 in 1974. Those jobs were not created in 1973 or 1974 and there is no point in the Minister for Labour or any of his colleagues claiming credit for them.  They were created in the three to five years prior to that period when the foundation had to be laid for the industrial development that created those jobs. The situation now is a sad departure from what we had then.  The worsening situation is not entirely the fault of world recession or the oil crisis.  It is more than half the fault of the people at present carrying the responsibility of guiding the affairs of the economy.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us why the farm apprenticeship scheme is in financial difficulties at the moment and why money is short?  We know it is not entirely the concern of his Department, that it is probably under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. If it is an apprenticeship scheme and if money is available from the social fund surely it should be available to help the farm apprenticeship <Col N="194" /> scheme?  If this scheme is having difficulties under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries it is time the Minister for Labour examined it.  If there is an area where job creation can be cultivated and extended it is in the area of agriculture.  If the stories circulating regarding the shortage of money for that scheme are true it is time the Minister for Labour stepped in and helped it from some of the social fund money.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment CERT. Before our radio and television services went off the air the CERT advertisement was one of the pleasant ones on radio.  Deputies do not often have the chance to see television during the week but when travelling by car we can listen to the radio.  It was encouraging to hear CERT calling for school leavers at a time when the Minister has created very few opportunities for them.  Those coming up to examination time were given some little encouragement by the CERT advertisements.  I was a school leaver during the time of a former Coalition and I know what it felt like then to fail to get a job.</P>
    <P>I referred to rising costs and the fears created in the private sector.  I understand we have a redundancy order coming before the House shortly curtailing redundancy payments. This order can only be described as a group of Ministers who do not seem to know where they are going.  We were told by Deputy O'Malley last night, who researched the matter in great detail, that inflation had increased by about 65 per cent during the life of this Government, that rising costs were affecting every sector and that it was understandable that social welfare would have to be increased to meet those rising costs.  It is to the eternal shame of the Government that they try to make so much capital out of their contribution to the social welfare recipients.  Their approach has been a negative rather than a positive one from the beginning or perhaps there was another angle to it.</P>
    <P>The contribution of the last Coalition Government to social welfare <Col N="195" /> was miserable.  Those who remember it better than I do tell me that it was 2s. 6d. to old age pensioners in a period of three years or in old money terms 10d. a year.  This is what got them the name of the tenpenny Government.  This time they wanted to bury forever the tenpenny image which was attached to them. The attack this time has been on the workers.  They are now mainly bearing the burden of increased social welfare stamp contributions and of increased income tax payments.  This is also affecting small industries which are so vital to the economic and social life of rural Ireland.  Their increased contribution to the cost of the stamp is further slowing down the creation of employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>We have a growing population, a diminishing work force and no job openings.  Yesterday in the House there was a discussion on the census of population and the reasons why it was not being taken.  The Taoiseach told us there was no necessity for it, that we had all sorts of manpower surveys being carried out but in the Estimate before us there are some interesting remarks in relation to research. The explanation of research states that it is expenses in connection with manpower surveys and other research work.  Last year a sum of £30,000 was allocated and this year the figure is the same.  This effectively means a reduction.  I ask the Minister to explain why there is no increase and why there has been no increase particularly in view of the Taoiseach's statement in the House yesterday. Less actual work is being carried out in research this year because the money allocated is only the same as that allocated for last year and in the meantime costs have increased very substantially.  Again I ask the Minister why?  I expect him to explain that.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to growth and opportunities in the building industry, and how necessary it is that that industry be kept viable.  It has for a long time become our economic barometer. Before my political life began I was closely associated with that industry. <Col N="196" /> In the 'sixties great opportunities were provided in that industry.  There was a great deal of employment and apprenticeships.  Trades and skills were scarce.  It was almost impossible to get skilled labour.  What is the position now?  The reverse is the case.</P>
    <P>I would like now to quote from the foreword to the annual report for 1975-76 of the Construction Industry Federation issued recently:</P>
    <P>It is misleading to continue to blame the oil crisis for the industry's and the economy's present state.  The difficulties which it posed have been exacerbated by misguided fiscal policies which might be appropirate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and this is very important</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;to a fully developed economy which was thriving.  In an under-developed country suffering a recession, these policies have been a disaster and counterproductive....</P>
    <P>In summary, what the economy and the industry needs vitally is a financial policy of encouragement to investment and to work, instead of the present counterproductive policy of taxes and more taxes.</P>
    <P>It is amazing the similarity one reads in all reports published nowadays.  I know the Minister will say&mdash;and some of his backbenchers would have the audacity to say&mdash;that these people who write these reports support the Opposition.  This goes back to what I said earlier.  The Minister and his colleagues are cossetting themselves in cotton wool and listening to people who have no knowledge of the practical difficulties being faced by industry, and the building industry particularly, at present.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to see why last Saturday's <i>Irish Independent</i> said we were broke.  They referred to the inability of this Government to meet any further increases.  This seems similar to a development we had earlier this year when we had the famous equal pay saga.  Late in 1975 the Minister was probably told by his colleagues that there was no money to meet the principle of the 1974 Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill.  The <Col N="197" /> public sector would have to be denied their rights under that legislation.  In typical fashion, he began to hide behind the private sector, to plead and quote the private sector as the reason why he was looking for a derogation, why he was back-tracking, why he was ceding his title as champion of women's rights.  Yet, when the first step had been taken by this House he tried to rat on what had been conceded.</P>
    <P>I understand from what he said this morning that the principles of that Bill eliminating all discrimination between men and women are now being implemented in the public sector, but it is tragic it took so long.  The European Commission had to tell him what he had to do under home and European legislation.  This kind of fire brigade disaster we are going through is further highlighted by the Minister speaking in Dáil Éireann today, the democratically elected institution of this country, and not once referring to the national wage agreement and its problems.  Is it that he was not in a position to speak about it?  Is it that he had no agreement from his colleagues to speak on it?  Is it that he had no idea of what is happening?  There must be some reason why the Minister presently charged with the responsibility for Labour should today, 26th May, 1976, when a national wage agreement is being negotiated for such a long time, should not even refer to it in his speech.  I fully appreciate the seriousness and the importance of the situation.</P>
    <P>The Government should never have been involved in these negotiations from an early stage.  We have been criticised in this House for referring to the British budget.  How thick can that cottonwool pack get?  If you look at the British economy which is so like ours, and which is experiencing similar difficulties, you will see the performance of their Chancellor who is faced with similar difficulties as our Minister for Finance.  He has created a respectable climate where moderation can be exercised as distinct from our Minister for Finance who says to the workers: &ldquo;I am giving a blanket <Col N="198" /> increase in the cost of living across the board in all the vital commodities that affect you, and I want you to take a pay pause.&rdquo;  Of course, there was no way that could be accepted.</P>
    <P>Our party were, and still are, committed to the national wage agreement concept.  I wish the talks well.  I sincerely hope they succeed.  It is important for our future that they succeed.  I know the people involved on all sides are very responsible.  It is a good job that we have at least two bodies that are responsible when we have such an irresponsible Government. Not only do they not know what they are doing but, in my opinion, they have no will to try to do the right thing.  One would think at times that some of the Ministers are determined to wreck the economy before they leave office in the usual disgraceful way Coalition Governments have left office in the past.  For them this end is now inevitable&mdash;and it is not too far distant either.</P>
    <P>I referred to the saga of equal pay. I suppose when a champion loses his title he loses a bit of integrity as well. This morning the Minister spoke of his efforts on behalf of women, as though he had championed every single right along the way.  We know that there is legislation pending since October or November, 1975, which has not yet been advanced to Second Stage.  It was introduced prior to the Mayo by-election and it is rather strange that it was not referred to to any great extent until just before two more by-elections. This may be accidental; it may be the Minister's way of appealing to the electorate that he is still there and doing his job.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the Women's Representative Committee, to their efforts during the past year and to their continuing efforts now. However, he informed the House recently that the Government spent approximately £10,000 on International Women's Year.  That amount seems a small figure in the light of present day costs.  It does not seem that the Minister was so sincere when it came to the purse.  This is particularly obvious when one looks at the propaganda machine operated by the <Col N="199" /> Government, where the director of the Government Information Services gets more than £10,000, the amount spent by the Government in International Women's Year.  This proves that the Minister is just paying lip service in order to sound popular.  He has betrayed his commitment and he will continue to do this despite any other statements he may make.  The Minister also referred to career information&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should avoid disparaging people outside this House in the course of his remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have offered no disparagement and I completely deny the Minister's allegation.  I have spoken about the Government's priorities in the way of financial commitments. I have not spoken disparagingly about anyone and it is not my intention to do so, either in this House or outside it.</P>
      <P>I was glad the Minister referred to the important matter of career information. However, I want to know from him if this is another question of lip service.  In the Estimate the expenditure on career information in 1975 was £5,000 and the same amount is provided for this item in 1976.  There is no improvement here.  Perhaps the Minister will explain what has happened?  It may be covered under some other heading.  I endorse all the Minister had to say regarding the importance of career guidance.  It is essential that it be done in conjunction with education. In view of the gas explorations and the hoped-for oil explorations it is important that career guidance be directed in such a way that technical skills may be encouraged.  We must not forget that there are very many university graduates desperately seeking employment, with little or no opportunities available. I will deal with the oil and gas situation later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made so many promises in the last three-and-a-half years that it is difficult to expect us to believe any of them, or to believe in what legislation may or may not be introduced.  It is understandable in view of the by-elections, <Col N="200" /> and particularly having regard to the Minister's statements in this House a number of years ago, that he should like to make nice noises at the time of an Estimate debate.  I refer particularly to his references to the 1955 Act on safety and to his comments on the safety, health and welfare of workers.  This is an area of vital importance.  I will quote from the Official Report, dated 6th November, 1969, column 368, on the Estimate for the Department of Labour.  The Minister who was then in Opposition was referring to the updating of the 1936 Act&mdash; there is still a lot in that Act that needs updating&mdash;and he stated:</P>
    <P>Should not a Government that is so proud to proclaim its concern and sympathy for workers have done something to update that Act since 1936?  This is 1969.  The same applies to the Factories Act, 1955, which is only a copy of the 1937 Act in Britain.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not been consistent. He has been in office for nearly three-and-a-half years and it is only now that he is making promises regarding the updating of the Act.  With our industrial development and the hoped-for offshore development, it is tantamount to criminal negligence that he has failed to provide any new statutory protection for workers.  This applies to factory, building and dock workers and it applies even more to the exploration work off our coasts.  We know that the safety health regulations there bear no relation to modern techniques.  I commend the inspectorate of the Department for what they have done and I want to encourage them to do more. They must get assistance to do a very important and difficult job.  There is a high incidence of industrial accidents and huge awards have been paid out in court, all affecting our economic structure.  Regulations have to be updated and it is strange that now we are told the Minister intends to update them.</P>
    <P>There is quite an amount of legislation floating around which has been with us for a long time.  One of the main pieces of legislation is the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill, 1974.  It has been lying around in <Col N="201" /> the Seanad since February or March, 1975, approximately 15 months ago. We were not given any explanation why the Bill has been in the Seanad for so long.  Is the Minister having a rethink about the matter?  Is he being prompted from somewhere that it should not be introduced?  Are some vested interests whispering in his ear that the Bill which deals with the protection of young persons is not desirable? If that is the case the Minister is doing a disservice to the young people.  It is difficult for us to reconcile his expressions of faith and his promises with performance.  When he promises something on the updating of the 1955 safety Act one would be inclined to wonder if that promise will meet with the same fate as the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill and the Bill on discrimination against women introduced in 1975.</P>
    <P>We supported the Bill on trade union amalgamation which was introduced in 1975.  I support the necessity for a strong, virile and active trade union movement.  The necessity is great for rationalisation and amalgamation. I support the Minister's approach in this regard.  It must be encouraged but it is important that it is expedited and this is admitted in trade union circles and everywhere else.  Everybody wants progress made as soon as possible on this important matter.  The Minister made many promises on the question of worker participation, but it has taken a long time for him to carry out the simple operation he has done, to introduce legislation to put employee representatives on State boards.  I support the move but it is not enough.  It is a departure for the Government because if this legislation was not put through the House we would have a continuance of the type of appointments to these boards as has been the practice since the Government assumed office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is again trying to twist what I said.  I <Col N="202" /> support the move but it is a departure from what the Minister and the Government have been doing in the past, appointing party friends to these positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not seem to matter whether such people were qualified for such appointments.  It is possible that the recent difficulties experienced are directly related to the type of people the Minister has been appointing to these boards.  I support the existence of employee representatives on State boards but progress in this regard has been too slow. Obviously, the Minister has lost the initiative and drive he had in Opposition. There is a need for encouragement of this development.  Many firms would have been saved had there been better communication between the shop floor and the management. The breakdown in communications has helped to expedite the collapse of some companies who, perhaps through pride or delaying tactics by Government agencies, could have been saved from collapse had money been made available in time.  However, in many cases the work force were not aware of the situation until it was too late.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the desirability of having more information on redundancies.  I agree with him in this regard but information is no good unless action is taken.  It is deplorable that people from outside our shores can make a decision making hundreds of people redundant. I call on the Minister to intervene in the industry in Dublin where this will happen in the next three or four weeks.  There are many economic and social reasons why this should be prevented. If the Minister feels he does not have sufficient power under existing legislation I assure him that my party will support any measures to help if such a situation arises in any part of the country regarding employment and jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope before the Minister produces the legislation in relation to the <Col N="203" /> employment premium programme he will bear in mind what I had to say about that.  The Minister's speech was highlighted by the fact that he spoke at length about areas where he felt some political kudos could be gained.  He skipped briefly over the serious areas in which he has created monsters and crises, for instance, the early warning unit which was set up in his Department and which was intended to warn us of disputes, particularly in areas of public utility.  It is possible that the absence of RTE and radio may not be a serious loss to the people in the Minister's constituency, and the Dublin area, but I can assure the House that its absence is felt in most other parts of the country.  Where was the early warning system in regard to this dispute?  Is there any truth in the rumour that those involved in this unit are not recognised by any of the negotiating bodies?  Will the Minister spell out the terms of reference of this unit?  Are they on negotiating or speaking terms with trade unions?  Is their presence resented by many people?  We should be given replies to those questions.  I suspected for a long time that the unit was designed to screen or push into the background the disgraceful happenings that took place last autumn with the switching of the chief conciliation officer of the Labour Court and the shenanigans that followed.  We all remember that the Minister had to eat humble pie for an obvious mistake at that time. No Government Department could make progress with the Minister's type of management in that Department over the past 15 months.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations are of immense importance and if they are not operating within the Department, or are not operated by the Minister who is responsible for industrial relations, there is no hope that the system can work.  It is time that the RTE dispute was ended because the absence of programmes from that station is a great loss to many people.  Many people now have to depend on the daily newspapers.</P>
    <P>I have not yet referred to the manpower <Col N="204" /> service because I pity its administrators at present particularly because of the lack of job opportunities for boys and girls or anybody who becomes unemployed.  Public representatives and many others have pestered AnCO offices throughout the country. They are a credit to the Department for the way they have tried to deal with an impossible situation.  It is time the Minister appreciated their efforts and took positive steps to do something about providing job opportunities so that they can get some break in the nightmare they have been enduring. I do not think this is too much to hope for from a man who promised so much.  I have already spelled out many areas that I thought should have been tackled.  The actual number unemployed will exceed 200,000 in a few weeks' time.  We must face the problem.  I have called already for emergency action and decision in what I believe to be this national crisis but there is a vast difference between what this Government do in such situations and what the previous Government did.  Although I can only remember it as a child, the war years represented the period of greatest difficulty in this country and the preservation of our neutrality was a great achievement. Still greater was the performance then of the man who was appointed Minister for Supplies with specific responsibility in that field.  The Minister may mock or laugh&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not thinking of that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a very serious subject and I am sorry if the Minister is not concerned about the employment situation; I certainly am and I think he should be.  The appointment of a Minister for Supplies in that emergency situation was a major step.  He had specific responsibility. I have repeatedly said that the present critical situation requires a man with specific responsibility in the area of employment whether for six months or 12 months.  The Taoiseach has erred in not having already appointed one Minister with the sole duty and responsibility of dealing with <Col N="205" /> unemployment, our greatest problem. It involves the short-term provision of jobs.</P>
      <P>The community employment programme was glossed over by the Minister who made it sound very real and nice but nobody contradicted me when I said that only 28 people are already employed on that programme. There are schemes in the pipeline but we have moved very slowly in this regard. This community youth employment scheme should have been off the ground long ago.  Too much time has been allowed to pass.  Today the Minister did not refer to a specific figure.  Various figures were suggested by himself, his Department and by AnCO but we have not been contradicted in saying that only 28 are so far employed.</P>
      <P>We are all pleased and extremely grateful that gas has been found off our coast and we are hopeful that oil will also be found although in one of yesterday's evening papers a commentator suggested there was doubt about oil being available in the Celtic Sea.  We sincerely hope it is there&mdash; we are not sure and we must wait to find out&mdash;but we are sure that exploration is being carried out.  For the benefit of our people we must maximise the benefits to be gained from exploration, maximise the number of jobs we can get on the exploration rigs.  We had an experience recently where an effort was made not to employ a small Cork crew, a small percentage of the entire crew of the rig, although the agency had instructions to take them on, because cheaper Scottish labour was available. Obviously, without training we shall have neither skilled nor semi-skilled personnel to take even a small percentage of places in the rigs comng here later this year.  We have people with the capacity and the capability to perform any job.  I shall not go again into what has happened in recent months but the way the Government have so often turned their backs on industry is regrettable because in most areas, whether at top or bottom, our people can equal those of any country.  This has been proved by them in the past within industry in every country in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> Similarly, we have people who, if they had training opportunities, could take their places on those rigs not as hewers of wood or drawers of water; they would be trained.  But it is too late to train people when the exploration is over.  The time to train them is before it starts.  We must maximise the benefits for ourselves.  We are sure that there is exploration; we hope there is oil.  In fact, I believe the Government have gambled a good deal on oil being found in economic quantities.  While the exploration is going on we must ensure that we as a nation will gain all we possibly can out of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening comments, said:</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy for 1976 is to give priority to expenditure that would promote growth and sustain and increase employment.</P>
    <P>May I ask him for evidence as to where that has been done by this Government and when?  It is not enough to produce figures which show an increase on those in 1975 because 1975 costs, and no one knows this better than the Minister for Local Government who has just come in, bear no relation whatsoever to costs two, three or four years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister further stated:</P>
    <P>A significant proportion of the public expenditure in the current year which comes under the control of the Department of Labour is aimed at ensuring that those who are without jobs as a result of the present recession are given the opportunity during the period of unemployment to increase the range of their skills.</P>
    <P>I must correct the Minister here.  I proved him wrong earlier on.  The unemployed are without jobs not because of the present recession but because of the lack of ability on the part of the Government in managing the affairs of the State.</P>

      <P>Unemployment is a very serious matter.  I have already quoted many people&mdash;if the Minister likes to read the debate he will find what I said&mdash;who are not of the Fianna Fáil persuasion at all who have said that the reason for the present mess is Government mismanagement. I am sure the Minister has read these comments and it is not necessary for me to quote them again.</P>
      <P>I agree with the idea of training but there must be an outlet for people when they are trained.  We must be able to put them somewhere.  The Minister said that unemployment is now the major social evil in every EEC country and Ireland is no exception. Would the Minister face reality and realise that it is worse here than anywhere else?  Why?  Because no effort is made to cope with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not worse here, of course, than anywhere else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the employment premium programme.  I hope the services industries will be included and an opportunity given to school leavers.  I have dealt with women's rights.  We will, of course, support the measures the Minister will be introducing.  I would encourage him to look further at the private sector because I am convinced that in that area the time has come when the Government must encourage development and, indeed, go even a bit further and think in terms of capital growth sharing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in the Minister's reference to the necessity for education <Col N="208" /> and advisory services within the trade union movement and his commitment to those of £150,000 this year.  He did not mention that that figure is the same as the figure last year and worth considerably less because of increasing costs and the fall in the value of money.</P>
    <P>Why is there a cutback in the grant for advisory services for emigrants? Is there some specific reason for that? If there is I should like to know what it is.  It is desirable the House should be aware of why this reduction has taken place.</P>
    <P>I have covered the main areas mentioned by the Minister.  The next question is the future of the Department. How does one see it in the hoped-for changing economic climate? The Minister for Labour's first move has to be towards greater employment, to maximise, in close co-operation particularly with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the employment opportunities from whatever there are, whether it be in relation to gas and oil, directly or indirectly, the production of fertiliser or the building of ships.  We must ensure that Ireland gets the basic opportunities, just like Spain, who, when they build an ammonia or a urea plant insist that it is their own firms who construct it. There is expertise in this country equal to or better than that in most other countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister must face up to the employment question first.  I have commended AnCO and the work they are doing, but they cannot go on forever, because eventually we will be training people for no opportunity or for export, if export opportunities exist.  The National Manpower Service must be very confused and disilusioned. Obviously, from the figures given to us this morning, there is only one reason why the National Manpower Service have succeeded in keeping up the figures for the numbers of people for whom they find employment, that is, that more vacancies are being channelled into them.  This of course is thanks to the people administering the National Manpower Service. However, if our economy had <Col N="209" /> been handled correctly there should be a big increase year by year in the number of people they would be channelling into employment.  It would also remove from them the overloaded burden and the hopeless situation that can arise for them.</P>
    <P>I have said in the past to the Minister that this party will support any moves by him, will combine in any effort with him, to examine the unemployment situation.  I have already suggested to him that, with the appointment of a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary with a specific responsibility in this field, an action committee responsible to the Government of course, be set up drawn from all sides of the social partnership, the employer organisations and trade union organisations, the unemployed, the financial institutions and banks, with the main object of co-operating with those now responsible for the community youth project.  The functions of this committee would not be confined to youth or to old people in the employment field; they would be looking for chances for everybody and trying to create them.</P>
    <P>This is not impossible, because I was reading this morning about a deputation, which included Deputy Moore, from Dublin Corporation yesterday, to the Minister for Local Government regarding redundancies there. I can produce evidence of redundancies in the local authority in my own county.  Surely this is the wrong time to allow redundancies in such bodies.  I am sure the financial situation in Cork is typical of that in every other county.  In the roads area there, the only promise that can be made is that the existing workforce will be retained until the year's end, that no new persons will be taken on for those retiring, and goodness knows our workforce in Cork has diminished considerably in recent years.  In the cottage and house repair section there are redundancies.  This is not confined to Cork, but the Minister should encourage the absorption of these redundant workers, say, in the building of one-off houses as is being done in many counties.  It is difficult enough to get a contractor to do the one-off <Col N="210" /> house, and they are expensive enough as well.  In order to preserve that workforce, why can this not be done by direct labour?</P>
    <P>These are areas I would envisage the action committee examining.  There are many others I would point out to them, as I have done in the past There is so much productive work that can be done around the country.  People's morale is slipping.  There are young people who are going to become employable and, because of lack of opportunity, they will involve themselves in the wrong type of activities that scares the father and mother.  It also gives little hope to those following on at school.  This is the greatest evil we are facing and this is the one that the Minister and his colleagues have shied away from and have shown no concern for.  Future generations will judge the Minister by his failure to look at that social evil, and social evil it is.  There is frustration in every home.  I have seen parents, supporters of the Minister's party, outside the church gates condemning their policies completely because of lack of opportunity for their sons or daughters.</P>
    <P>Despite free education given to so many people by this party's Minister for Education, a burden is placed on the homes that send those boys and girls to school.  There is the young lad now aged 19 or 20 who fails to get a job; his brother or sister is leaving school this year, but there may be two or three younger children behind. Their morale is also shattered.  The Government are creating a group of people to whom they are offering no hope and whom they are encouraging to do things that none of us want to see them doing.  The danger is that they are moving towards alcoholism, drug addiction or worse, subversion.  These are good, responsible young people who will react to prompting, to guidance and to leadership, but we have not had leadership from this Government.  Until there is leadership and courageous action and until appreciation and concern are shown for the plight of those young people, who may also have fathers or mothers in the dole queue, the outlook is dismal.  The solution is not by paying out money to those people.  That is not <Col N="211" /> what the average person wants.  People want work because they are independent, strong-willed people.  They know their own mind.  They do not want to be serfs or dependent on a hand-out which has become the only solution this Government have offered to the employment situation.</P>

      <P>In my gullibility or in my optimism I came here this morning hoping for a radical document from the Government because of the frightful state of the economy and particularly the unemployment figures.  What we got was a very conservative document showing little original thinking and giving no grounds whatever for instilling any confidence in the parents of boys or girls who are seeking employment, or, indeed in any of the 120,000 people who are registered at the employment exchanges.  This was a time when the Government could have come forth with some radical proposals to boost the morale of the people and to offer some hope that we could get out of the economic morass into which the Government have led us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three years ago at the formation of this Government, many promises were made and the trumpets sounded the coming of the Government of all the talents.  Therefore if there is cynicism in the hearts of the people today we can place the blame on the shoulders of the Government.  The Coalition Government remind me of a plant called a &ldquo;morning glory&rdquo;.  The &ldquo;morning glory&rdquo; is in that category of plants that blooms early in the morning.  It is a thing of beauty then, but as the day goes on it starts to wilt, by sunset it has wilted completely and the plant then dies.  No matter what the elements may do, whether it is the rain or the wind, the heat or anything else, nothing will revive that plant.  I see the Government as being similar to a &ldquo;morning glory&rdquo;.  They started off with all kinds of promises, telling <Col N="212" /> us what they would do and how much better they would do it compared with the Fianna Fáil Government.  Their arguments convinced the people and they took power.  As Deputy Fitzgerald just mentioned, we shall shortly have about 200,000 people unemployed. That gives us no satisfaction on this side of the House.  It renews our determination to show the people what can be done to remedy the disastrous situation.  The first step is the replacement of the Government.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that I thought we would have an emergency document and, talking about emergencies, I remember when the Government were on this side of the House they called daily for the declaration of a housing emergency.  I never knew what they meant by this and I do not think they knew either, but today we can say we have a housing emergency. There are thousands of our building craftsmen and workers queueing at the employment exchanges; there are thousands on the housing waiting list.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will make a statement on the likely effects of the restrictions proposed by the UK Government on imports of Irish cattle; and their likely effect on trade here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together. The British Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland have made orders providing that, with effect from 1st June next, cattle imported into Britain by sea from this country, other than castrated males and those intended to be moved direct from the landing place to a slaughterhouse for immediate slaughter, must, within the 30 days immediately preceding shipment, have passed a comparative TB test.</P>
      <P>The test may be carried out by veterinary practitioners engaged to do so by the exporters.  Veterinary inspectors of my Department will, on the strength of the practitioners' certificates, complete an official certificate in relation to each consignment at the time of export.  The Deputies will appreciate that the vast bulk of animals in our export trade to Britain are bullocks which will not be subject to the test.  Most of the remainder of the cattle to which the new orders relate already have to be subjected to a blood test for brucellosis before export. Accordingly, I do not consider that the new requirement relating to TB testing will have any significant effect on the cattle export trade between the two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not acknowledge that, in the case of the export trade in breeding heifers, this new imposition by the British Ministry would have a deterrent effect?  Does the Minister not acknowledge also that the action of the British Government accentuates the need for a settlement between the <Col N="217" /> Minister and the veterinary profession of the dispute that has been going on now for 18 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not acknowledge that it will have any very deleterious effect on trade for the reasons given in the first reply.  In respect of the action of the British Government, we are not responsible for that but the move has been taken. Therefore, we must take steps to see that our trade is protected and defended. These tests have been taken and, as the brucellosis test must be taken anyway, it would appear as if the other test will not have any real effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Minister to say that his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, is in no way responsible for the present situation or for inducing the British Ministry to protect their own livestock?  Surely it is the failure of the Minister to get a settlement of the dispute between himself and the veterinary profession that is responsible for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is very keen to get a settlement and a settlement would help things greatly.  But, in the intervening period before this very desirable settlement is effected, the action of the British Government will not have a serious effect.  It would be wrong if people took that view, because, as has been stated in the first reply, the vast bulk of animals are bullocks exported for this trade. Those that are not bullocks have to be subjected to a brucellosis test anyway. Therefore, it is merely a matter of an extra test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister the he use his good offices with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, to persuade him to accept the employment of lay technicians in the disease eradication scheme in a non-professional capacity because that is the only way he will get the scheme going again?  It is well past the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Minister that female cattle being exported have not to come off a TB-free herd?  Would I not be right in saying that the order is not alone must the cattle be tested but that they must come off a completely TB-free herd?  Does this not take us back to the question posed by Deputy Gibbons about the veterinary strike&mdash;that an awful lot of people are testing merely the cattle they have for sale but that, when their herds are tested, there would probably be found to be reactors in them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that for entry into accredited herds or clearance areas in the United Kingdom all breeding and store cattle, except bullocks over six months, must come from a brucellosis-free herd here and have passed a blood test within 30 days of export.  For entry into other herds such animals, if over 12 months of age, must have passed a brucellosis blood test within 30 days of export.  It is understood that very few of these animals are exported at 12 months old or less.  There has to be a few days' interval between the time a blood sample is taken and the result of the test is made available.  Accordingly, the carrying out of the required TB test&mdash;which has to be completed 72 hours after injection&mdash;should not disrupt trading arrangements for these categories of cattle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is satisfied that the measures taken to prevent the entry of dogs to this country are adequate to meet the problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that everything possible is being done here to prevent the illegal importation of dogs.  The stringent veterinary precautions taken under our statutory regulations governing the importation of dogs and other rabies-susceptible animals to prevent the introduction of that dreaded disease into this country are closely co-ordinated with those operated in our neighbouring islands.  These security measures include the prohibition, except under licence, of the importation of any rabies-susceptible animal other than animals from Northern Ireland and cats and dogs from Britain, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Animals allowed in here under licence must immediately on landing undergo a period of not less than six months quarantine and must be vaccinated against rabies during quarantine.</P>
      <P>The possibility of illegal importations is guarded against by continuous and intensive surveillance at all ports and airports as well as at harbours or other landing places around our coast where foreign yachts and fishing vessels put in.</P>
      <P>Posters warning about the rabies danger have been widely circulated for display at such landing points and at the continental car-ferry at Le Havre. Hand-outs on our import regulations have been supplied to airline and shipping companies here, and to yachting clubs and tourist organisations here and on the Continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> Close liaison is maintained between the Irish and British authorities so as to ensure against either country being used as a back-door entry for rabies-susceptible animals from abroad.  Our controls are being strictly applied and are kept under continuous review in the light of developments in the present rabies situation abroad.</P>
    <P>My Department are at present intensifying their efforts through widespread publicity in the Press and other media, to focus the attention of the public on the dangers of smuggling or other evasion of our import regulations. Naturally the fullest co-operation and vigilance on the part of the public is essential in this very serious matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister's reply would allay some people's fears. Will the Minister state definitely that the fact that he is satisfied with the present arrangements means that there is no need for fear in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is satisfied that the present arrangements are the best that could be entered into. There should be no fears as long as people do not try to circumvent these arrangements.  The position is that the publicity the Deputy can give by putting down this question and that the Press can give it, is highly important; that every person in this country, or any other country, who owns a dog or any other rabies-susceptible animal should be made aware of the dreadful deed he does if he tries to contravene these regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider having the announcement made on aeroplanes asking people who have been in touch with farm animals or on farms to report to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries either supplanted or supplemented now by a similar sort of announcement about rabies precautions?  Is the Minister aware that the announcement in regard to foot and mouth disease perhaps is not as relevant now as it was when first introduced and that it might be a good idea to have it changed to the sort of announcement to which I referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="221" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister. However, I can give the Deputy the following information: no case of rabies has been reported in Ireland since 1903.  Apart from two cases in 1969 and 1970 Britain has been free from the disease, outside quarantine, since 1922.  Dogs and cats may be moved in either direction, between Ireland and Britain without restriction. In order that that fortunate situation may be maintained, the two countries adopt a common stand in relation to the import of rabies-susceptible animals from abroad.  Close liaison is maintained between the Irish and British authorities to ensure against either country being used as a back-door entry to the other for illegal importation of rabies-susceptible animals.  The two countries operate a reciprocal arrangement under which advance notification is given to the other in the case of animals from abroad being trans-shipped at a landing point in one country for final destination in the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that it is equally true that there has not been an outbreak of foot and mouth disease here since the forties but that this announcement is still made on our aeroplanes.  Perhaps a similar type of announcement might be made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is said that unscrupulous or uncaring persons resort to the practice, particularly in regard to small animals, small dogs, of drugging them and illegally bringing them in conveyances into this country, and to other countries, when they are in this state of stupefaction?  Perhaps it is something to which our authorities, at various points of entry, should be more alert at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think our authorities at the point of entry are alert.  If such a very disagreeable practice as was outlined by the Deputy is in fact extant, this publicity today will bring <Col N="222" /> people to the realisation that we must keep this disease out of our country, that the regulations must be obeyed and that complete surveillance is being applied to see to it that those who would in any way break those regulations shall pay the very heavy penalty.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>In 1975 and previous years there was no maximum limitation on the amount of grant paid under the beef cattle incentive scheme and the size of grant which any herdowner could earn was determined by the number of eligible animals presented.  This year it is necessary to apply a maximum in order to bring the scheme into line with the cattle headage payments scheme under which the ceiling on grants will continue to operate.</P>
      <P>Details of the 1976 schemes will be announced at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is not sufficient for the Minister to state that the details of the scheme will be announced at an early date?  Surely we have passed a deadline by now?

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers of Ireland will know when conclusion has been reached with the EEC on the matter.  The EEC officials have intimated that the beef incentive scheme grants are of a type which have no hope of securing Community approval and they should be eliminated. They insist at this point in time that they should be and be seen to be much less attractive outside the disadvantaged areas than inside.  It is not possible to give much information at this stage pending EEC agreement on these proposals except to say that the scheme is being substantially adapted in the light of EEC requirements at this point in time.  We must reach agreement with the EEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there is not agreement at the moment with the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters' Society to operate a scheme on a certain basis.  For that reason, as I indicated in the last sentence of my original reply, there are aspects which are still under consideration.  In the meantime, the Minister is taking every step he can to see to it that there is proper classification.  It is again, a matter where there are two sides to this and agreement must be reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the fact that this has been going on now for three or four years, will the Minister not agree that it is time for mandatory action to be taken regarding classification of producers' cattle in factories?  There is a widespread feeling <Col N="229" /> that there is malpractice in this area and that cattle which eventually make prime quality in factories are paid for at the second-class rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Technical specifications for a scheme were drawn up in February, 1972, by a technical study group set up to advise in the matter. These criteria were operated on a trial basis at a meat factory over a period of 12 months.  When purchase of beef under the EEC intervention system commenced, the technical specifications were useful for intervention purposes. In the light of experience gained, certain modifications were introduced and specifications have now been finalised.  The main points at issue in regard to the proposed beef classification scheme were (a) who would operate the scheme and (b) who would pay the cost.</P>
      <P>In September, 1973, the Department wrote to Córas Beostoic agus Feola suggesting that the scheme should be introduced on the basis that trained staff employed by the individual beef exporters would carry out the actual classification.  A limited number of qualified Córas Beostoic agus Feola personnel would keep a general check on the classification standards and that this Department would co-operate in the training of staff and demonstration of educational work related to the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October, 1973, the Irish Freshmeat Exporters' Society stated that under no circumstances would they agree to operate a scheme on this basis, nor would they agree to any involvement at Córas Beostoic agus Feola in the operation and supervision of the scheme.  The society recently indicated that they favoured the introduction of a beef classification scheme, but only if it were to be operated by the Department.  The proposed scheme was discussed separately with the IFA and the ICMSA.  Both organisations agreed in principle with the proposed scheme and appeared to accept as reasonable that the cost would be met by the Department and producers on a pound for pound basis.  Both indicated they would prefer a scheme under Department <Col N="230" /> supervision.  It has been estimated that up to 30 classifiers would be required supported by about 40 to 45 factory personnel attending to the more mechanical procedures.  In addition, there would be five or six supervisors. Classifiers and supervisors would be recruited for factory and departmental staff who have considerable experience of meat factories, preferably beef plants.  That is the present state of play.  The desire is to get agreement and a beef classification scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the amount by which usage of phosphate and potash fertilisers has fallen in the past two years; and the effects of this drop on agricultural production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that the usage of both phosphate and potash declined by about 40 per cent over the latest two years for which figures are available.  As root and cereal crops continue to be fairly well fertilised and because of reserves of potash and phosphates in the soils, the decline in usage did not seriously affect production and the position was also helped by some increase in the use of nitrogen.  A more serious factor affecting production last season was the lack of adequate rainfall, particularly in the eastern half of the country, during the growing season.</P>
      <P>However, the possible longer term depletion of soil reserves of potash and phosphate is a matter of concern and so I have been encouraging farmers to reverse the downward trend in fertiliser usage.  There has, in fact, been some improvement in the position in recent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that his reply seems to be suggesting that there is no great need for alarm in the fact that the consumption of phosphate and potash, the basic <Col N="232" /> raw materials for everything coming off the land, has fallen to nearly half in that two-year period?  Will he say whether he has something more definite than soft talk and good advice to offer the farmers who are not in a position to do anything about it themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a huge increase in the cost of fertiliser in the year in which the decline occurred, and farmers reacted by not putting on fertilisers.  In many cases, if they had equated the application of fertiliser to an acre of ground with the benefits contained therein and the extra prices secured for them by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries through EEC negotiation, they would have been just as well off if they had applied the fertiliser at the high price.  I am glad to give the Deputy good news.</P>
      <P>It is highly probable that phosphatic fertiliser prices will fall dramatically in the near future.  Phosphate rock which was commanding a price of $68 per ton in 1975 is currently being quoted at $39 per ton or less.  This should entail a drop of about £1 per unit of phosphate, taking into account the drop in the value of the pound <i>vis-à-vis</i> the dollar.  American triple superphosphate, 19 per cent phosphate, can be landed here at £55 per ton and sold at £70 per ton or £3.60 per unit phosphate.  The current price of 8 per cent superphosphate is £45-46 per ton or £5.50 per unit phosphate.  It is anticipated that the continued drop in world phospherous prices will affect the significant increase in the use of phospherous in the coming fertiliser season.  If you want advice from the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries it is, use more phosphates, potash and nitrogen.</P>

      <P>I agree that the fines need revision and the Minister has indicated that he is in the process of examining this.  The real penalty is confiscation of gear and catch and the delay, inconvenience and the loss of fishing time caused by the law of the sea regulation, which means that the vessel must be boarded, examined and brought to port.  The costs, for instance, of going to sea again of <Col N="234" /> the Russian vessel caught last year was £60,000.

      <P>My question related to the reason for the withdrawal of the grant.  Will the Minister state why it was withdrawn from the IAOS?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can so inform the House.  It was a once-for-all operation in which it was hoped that the IAOS would do certain things. They operated on that basis in 1970-71. It was agreed as part of the arrangement that the IAOS would, in addition to the normal grant from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, get a sliding scale of grants from BIM funds: £5,000 in 1970-71; £4,000 in 1971-72; £3,000 in 1972-73; £2,000 in 1973-74 and £1,000 in 1974-75.  The total was £15,000.  That was for a once-for-all job to organise fishery co-operatives. The job was attempted and it was done.  The record of the IAOS in developing fishery co-operatives has been poor.  While there are at present over 20 registered societies, only six are really operative and these appear to have little or no sense of dependency on the IAOS.  The IAOS failed completely in their efforts to establish a producer organisation of fishermen and it was left to BIM to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the grant was sought in the first instance by the Federation of Fishing Co-operatives?  Further, is he aware that at that time no conditions were laid down as to when the grant would be terminated?  It was understood at the time that the grant would be paid annually to the IAOS to assist the Federation of Fishing Co-operatives.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he is aware of the inconvenience caused to travellers between Donegal and points south-east of the Border and of the adverse effects on tourist traffic caused by the long delays occasioned by British Army checkpoints along the Border especially at Aughnacloy, Strabane and Culmore; and, if so, if he will state the action he has taken or proposes to take to ease the situation to at least bearable proportions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The British authorities are aware of the anxiety of the Government that the inconvenience caused to traffic by the presence of cross-Border security checkpoints should be minimised.  However, checkpoints are necessary for security purposes and as long as the present situation continues, some measure of inconvenience will be inevitable.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that such delays have had the adverse effect on tourist traffic to which the Deputy refers; I repeat what I have recently told this House in a similar context, that damage to our tourism arises from more fundamental causes than such checkpoints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When representations are made to me about the situation at any particular crossing, the matter is investigated and, where appropriate, the question is pursued with the British authorities.  I have received no such representations in regard to Strabance or Culmore.  Delays at Aughnacloy <Col N="244" /> have, however, frequently, come to my attention.  While accepting the exigencies of the security situation, I share with the Deputy the view that delays at this point are over-long and have made this known to the British authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is now clear, after a number of years of experience, that very special intimidatory checkpoint procedures are in operation at Aughnacloy and, to a lesser degree, at Strabane and to the full degree at Culmore?  Would he agree that there is a significance in this?  I ask the Minister to take note of the fact that it appears that this special treatment is in order to initimidate travellers between points south-east of the Border and Donegal county which belongs to the rest of the Twenty-six counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, I am not aware of the problems at Strabane and Culmore.  Nothing about problems at those points has been drawn to my attention.  I note what the Deputy says and I would be happy to have any concrete information from him about problems there so that I could take whatever action might be appropriate. There is a serious problem of delay at Aughnacloy.  On the occasions I have crossed there I have been lucky but I know that on occasions there were extremely long delays and while provision has been made to process a number of cars simultaneously that arrangement does not seem to be effective most of the time.  There is a delay problem there which is quite serious and in respect of which we have had to make frequent representations. These have led to facilities being provided that would enable a faster processing of vehicles but the manning has not matched the facilities and as a result the delays are disturbingly long at times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I further ask the Minister personally to go into this matter urgently in view of the fact that while the facilities are there they are not being manned by the British?  They are obviously deliberately being undermanned, and <Col N="245" /> even the manpower available is being under-used and the delays are completely unnecessary.  Checks are made on the double within the same compound which can have no purpose other than delay and intimidation. Finally&mdash;I put this seriously to the Minister&mdash;will all those who are likely to be going to Donegal in the weeks ahead please go by that traditional route unannounced so that there will be no special arrangements made to see them through quickly and so that they will get firsthand experience of the sort of tortuous procedure that those who must use that route have to undergo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about the benefit of special procedures. They have just been lucky to go there at times when very few vehicles are passing.  I am well aware of the delays.  I know what the Deputy has said about them and we will certainly make further representations in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister bear in mind in his representations that we depend heavily on our tourist industry in Donegal and that this industry has been growing due to more east coast residents coming through, that it should be possible to bring home to people living on the coast that the short route to Donegal is that route and that there should be no intimidation on the way?  I would ask the Minister to do this urgently because of its very great importance.  Again I say: please come that way when you are travelling to Donegal and do not tell them you are coming until you see what sort of treatment you get.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I had looked forward on this occasion to the Government producing a radical document in the form of the Minister's Estimate but, unfortunately, in fact it gives little hope for confidence in the Government's handling of the economy as shown through the Department of Labour.  It hardy serves its purpose because it will not bring about confidence in the people or boost national morale.  I find few good things in the Estimate.  Indeed, the omissions are startling.  For one thing, the Minister did not deal with industrial relations at any length or even mention the problem of the national pay agreement. Yet, we are in a situation which could lead to economic chaos if the question of pay and salary increases is not resolved in an expert way that will give equity to all section.  It is, therefore, time for the Government to define their role in wage negotiations. Without going into details, a typical example of this is the RTE dispute.  People living in single-channel areas have been ten or 11 days now without the national television service.</P>

      <P>The dispute in question is a very distinct matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to aggravate the situation but, according to the newspapers, the question now is whether the Government will permit the agreement reached between the Authority and the unions to become effective. I do not know the actual issue the Government face here but I think the situation puts into true perspective the position of the Government as regards any wage agreement.  It is now back to the Government.  If the newspapers are right&mdash;I presume they have been briefed by somebody&mdash;and if the Government say no, do we have a continuation of the RTE dispute?  If they say yes, do we hope that the strike will be over?  My point is that the Government have to be brought in now after an 11-day strike: why did they not use their good offices earlier? It would have saved the loss of the service and saved many people involved in the strike much hardship.</P>
      <P>The same applies to the national pay agreement situation.  The Government held back, then put suggestions forward and then held back again. This is not good for negotiations because the unions no doubt strive to do their best for their members, not hurt the economy and reach agreement.  I suppose the same can be said for the employers.  If, at the outset the Government had spelled out their idea of a settlement&mdash;I know they cannot impose a settlement&mdash;and given guidelines to both sides the position could have been made clear and we could have had a national pay agreement adopted long before now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the negotiations succeed; indeed, they must succeed or we shall face chaos.  Things are bad enough with 120,000 people unemployed, with many more threatened with loss of jobs all because of the diffidence of the Government in not producing guidelines for an agreement.  I do not suggest the Government can have their own way in such a matter but I believe all sides in the negotiations would welcome guidance from the Government in regard to the serious <Col N="250" /> issues involved.  Instead, the Government have been standing aside, giving no lead.  I believe in free, collective bargaining but I realise that in the present situation the Government which are probably the largest employer cannot stand by without offering any help and hope that the best solution will be reached. I cannot understand the diffidence of the Government on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but I would prefer if he would refer to matters which are specifically the responsibility of the Minister for Labour, whose Estimate we are discussing, rather than refer to matters appertaining to the Government.  Matters related to the Department of Labour are relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Labour is the key in the whole matter of industrial relations and pay negotiations on a national scale.  If this were a private dispute between two companies I should not attempt to raise it here.  The State, of which the Minister is a servant, should be spelling things out for trade unions and employers.  However, if the Chair would prefer me not to continue with this matter, I shall certainly desist, but I suggest we should take a look at some of the other countries in the EEC and find out the way in which they manage these negotiations. I am not saying they have the perfect system.  I am not saying they do not have strikes.  Of course they do, but they have far less industrial trouble than we have.  In this latter quarter of the twentieth century the State must have a big part to play.  I should hate to see a national pay agreement arrived at and the Government, any Government, pleading inability to pay.  Were that to happen the Government would simply be asking for trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is making efforts, even though they may be feeble efforts, to provide some training especially for young people who have become unemployed or who have failed to obtain employment in the first instance. Lack of job opportunity for young <Col N="251" /> people is one of the biggest problems facing the country.  If an individual becomes unemployed in middle age, or later, social welfare benefits compensate to some extent, but only to some extent.  More mature people are able to assess and accept the situation though they go on hoping they will soon be back in employment.  I deplore speakers who say people do not want to work.  The vast majority want to work in gainful employment.</P>
    <P>Only one who has suffered unemployment can appreciate the feelings of the unemployed, particularly the feeling that there is no place for one in society, the feeling of being rejected by society.  We should try to understand the feelings of the unemployed person.  We should respect him and we should try to give him some dignity by way of adequate social welfare benefits if we cannot so arrange economic matters that each person seeking employment will be able to obtain that employment.  I know that is not easily done.  There are problems.  In the situation in which the Government now are, in the situation in which the country finds itself, the Government should come forward with worth-while proposals, get down with the trade unions and the employers and face facts squarely.  Economically we have gone wrong somewhere and it will be a long hard road back to stability and prosperity.  But this effort must be made.  The drive must be spearheaded by the Department, especially in the interests of the young people who cannot get work.</P>
    <P>Consider the reaction of the young boy or girl who, having obtained an intermediate or leaving certificate, finds he or she cannot obtain employment. I can well appreciate the disappointment and disillusionment they must suffer.  Their parents strive to provide them with a sound education, an education which will prepare them for life later on.  One cannot go very far in life unless there are employment opportunities.  The bulk of our youth at the moment are suffering grievously because they cannot find employment.  It may be suggested that there is an economic blight&mdash;perhaps <Col N="252" />&ldquo;blight&rdquo; is too strong a word, an economic imbalance&mdash;and that is why these young people are being denied the right to work and prepare themselves effectively to be good members of society.  I believe the Minister's proposals for the training of youth are too little, if not too late.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well feel almost complacent and say he has more in training than were ever in training before.  I accept his word for that but I can also say that never before were there so many people without jobs. The Minister talks about the money being put into training.  That may be so, but inflation was never so high. I want to pay tribute to AnCO and CERT for the efforts they are making to give young people a proper training. As Deputy Fitzgerald said, it is heartening to hear on the radio&mdash;that is, when we have a radio service&mdash;advice to young people to contact CERT and be trained in the hotel industry. Mention was made of 500 posts; 500 out of the total of 50,000 leaving school is pretty small.  It gives one some idea of the training opportunities there are.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed a wish that every person seeking retraining would be able to have it.  We all subscribe to that but it is just not on at the moment.  That is why we, on this side, are compelled to make suggestions which might give those who have lost their employment and those who have never been able to find employment some hope for the future.  We can point to what may happen to young people if they do not get proper employment.  I believe our young people today are as good as any of their predecessors.  I believe they are being asked to shoulder a burden of unemployment which, with proper economic planning, could well have been avoided.</P>
    <P>The construction industry affords tremendous opportunities for enlargement; yet the Minister refuses to include that industry in the premium employment programme.  The Minister told me on a previous occasion that he would examine this, and he decided that it was not practical.  I have not got the expert guidance the Minister <Col N="253" /> has, but in present circumstances the Minister must re-examine this and try to offer some retraining or re-employment for those people who have lost their jobs in the construction industry. I am not an economist, but it has always struck me as crazy that, when we have the skilled personnel to build houses, when we have many of the materials produced here at home and a colossal demand for houses, we cannot evolve a system which would enable us to put the idle craftsmen back to work building houses.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I attended a conference in the House here with the Minister for Local Government on matters affecting the housing situation in Dublin.  There is the prospect that up to 400 men will be displaced in Dublin Corporation's housing maintenance Department because of a cutback in finance.  I know this is not the time or the place to deal with the corporation's financial troubles, but it is symptomatic of the position we are in at the moment that we shall have to forego the proper maintenance of existing housing stock because of a shortage of money, that these houses will deteriorate and in two or three years' time it will cost more money to restore them to the condition they should be in now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to pursue that line.  I just mentioned the matter in passing.  What I am trying to lead up to is the idea that if the Government had a plan for economic development, we could overcome many of these ills, and this is where the Minister has failed in his approach to this question.  Admittedly, he has provided for more training for people who are unemployed, but that is only a drop in the ocean.  Fine craftsmen in the construction industry are being made idle and they can then claim in social benefits 85 per cent of their normal income.  Surely it would not take a genius to work out a scheme whereby the men could be paid an extra 15 per cent for building flats, <Col N="254" /> houses and other buildings.  Apart from the benefit to the economy, these people would be given employment, which is good for any human being and which the vast majority of unemployed people are seeking today.</P>
      <P>In the Government's mind there is a blind spot and they will not admit that things are as bad as they are.  If the Government were to admit that things were very bad, that they were at least a contributory cause to the present state of things, and then set about righting this, they might make some progress.  As long as they treat these problems in a cavalier fashion, the revival of the economy we all seek will not materialise.</P>
      <P>I have spoken at length, both in this House and outside it, about young people.  It may be boring to some listeners, but I have tried to hammer it home that unless the Government formulate some worth-while schemes within the next few months, there will be a great deal of social unrest, and if that sets in the Government will face a much bigger problem than they face at the moment.  If they could convince the people that they are doing everything possible to bring about a wave of prosperity, it would help immensely, but they are not doing that.  The Minister's brief convinces me that while he is aware of the problems, he has made no worth-while attempt to solve them, I appreciate that they are not easily solved, but they must be tackled as firmly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that when the Minister was on this side of the House he and his colleagues called on many occasions for the declaration of a housing emergency.  The calling of such an emergency may have influenced the trend of events, because we now have that housing emergency which the then Opposition called for, but not in quite the same way as they meant it.  I suppose they meant at that time that emergency measures should be taken to cure the housing shortage. Now the construction industry is in a bad way.  Workers have become disemployed and the housing list has grown bigger, in the city anyway.  I am sure that in the future somebody <Col N="255" /> will look back on these years and see what a crazy set-up existed.  The Minister, being a member of the Government, must take his share of responsibility for the present state of things.  I have spoken to some young apprentices who have been released by their employers and are being trained under the AnCO scheme.  They were satisfied with the training they received.  The only thing about it is that it is not long enough, that because of the restriction of financial aid these young men are given certain training and then have to move out so that someone else can move in.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is not easy to keep young boys in training until they get employment.  I am afraid that young boys who are let go by AnCO and do not find employment will lose their skills and expertise.  This is a pity. The Minister should look at the possibility of providing training from the time a young person or even an older person becomes unemployed to the time he goes back into employment. The Minister might get together with employers and unions to work out a system and to remove any restrictions which might hamper this solution. The Minister in another scheme has provided temporary employment of a semi-social nature for these young men, and it is a worth-while project. However all this is inadequate to meet the present situation, and the Government must step up their efforts and investment in the training of young people until such time as conditions are so that industry, public and private, can take on young people and put them into good employment.  In order that their training under AnCO will not be lost it is essential that the training period be extended to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt at some length, but not at very great length, with career information.  Even in normal times career guidance is absolutely essential if we are to have a well organised, well trained work force. When we were leaving school there was very little career guidance.  A person would take any sort of a job <Col N="256" /> offered and may have paid later in life for his impetuosity in accepting the first job that came along.  It was inevitable at that time that many people would end up in the wrong career or with no career at all.  I think the Minister could have dealt at much greater length with the matter of career guidance.  Although jobs are hard to come by we should not curtail in any way a full career guidance operation.  The Minister said that 250 career leaflets were sent out.  This is all to the good, but more definite steps should be taken to ensure that every boy and girl is given the benefit of a career guidance scheme and where possible they should be given aptitude tests.</P>
    <P>I noted in one city on the Continent last year that at the end of the school holidays a career guidance seminar was organised in the local town hall and representatives from the various professions were available to brief boys and girls in their chosen careers.  I know the Department do something like this but it is not on the same scale.  I want to emphasise that although young people find it difficult at present to obtain employment we should at least try to compensate for that by demonstrating our interest in their future, by saying that if we cannot give them a full-time job, we will at least give them the benefit of our experience in career guidance.  If young people do not get jobs at 16 or 18 they should be given the benefit of the doubt and should not be considered too old to become apprentices or enter a profession in a few years time, because their failure to gain employment initially would have been due to the bad years of the seventies when employment was not to be had. We must give them some latitude to make up for our failure to provide employment for them.</P>
    <P>The resettlement scheme mentioned by the Minister would not, I suppose, apply to young people.  The Minister said that the numbers availing themselves of the grants under the scheme are increasing annually and that he is confident that the scheme will help towards ensuring that sufficient skilled workers will be available for the <Col N="257" /> industrial developments now proceeding in various parts of the country. Perhaps the seed of proper thinking is there, but I do not know if it is big enough through the National Manpower Service to cater for all the people who are looking for jobs. Some time ago I asked the Minister if the manpower service was free from Government directions as to how jobs should be filled.  The Minister said that no Minister had directed the National Manpower Service to inform him of any vacancy.  I accept the Minister's word on that although I have been told that that is not so. The Minister might spell out further the independence of the National Manpower Service.  Any undue Government interference there might well not be in the interests of the service.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the manpower and training for oil and gas exploration and development. We do not know what the future in this sphere is, whether we will find vast resources of oil and gas off our coasts or whether we shall find very little.  Naturally, we all hope we will strike a bonanza here and there.  What we can say is that, having found some gas off Kinsale, it would be most unlikely if we did not find more in other parts of our coast.  Therefore, our workers must be trained to play their full part in this exploration.  Here I do not mean merely men who use a shovel to dig or a pump to pump water away and so on.  I mean a man who helps a tradesman or an engineer, that such people be trained to play their full part in this new development of that section of our economy because it could be a very big thing indeed. The Dutch, British and others who found such resources off their coasts, in turn, trained their workers.  However, we do know that we must have foreign expertise in certain operations. This is the promise of a further dimension in employment-giving services.  I hope the Minister will pursue this to an effective end, giving us hope in the future, so that we may be able to say: &ldquo;Yes, we are training people to help in these operations and to contribute to the expertise being given under a proper training system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> I am disappointed at the lack of comment by the Minister on industrial relations.  The Minister speaks of the success of the Labour Court which, indeed, has been very successful. One must pay tribute also to the Congress of Trade Unions which, despite many difficulties, helped in the solution of many disputes in the general field of industrial relations. On some future occasion, perhaps, the Minister could devote a whole brief to this very important sector.  I often feel that we have quite a sophisticated system.  Nevertheless, I have seen instances where the congress, the trade unions and employers, having spent a long time negotiating something, see it all negatived because somebody takes unofficial action.  I know very well that the Government, congress or employers do not find it easy to stop unofficial action.  But they can try to establish why men will take unofficial action when they have at their disposal the full resources of the Labour Court, the trade unions and employers' organisations.  Such action must be taken from a sense of grievance.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in the future, we must probe much deeper than heretofore into each industrial dispute.  First of all, we must ensure that our industrial relations legislation is up-to-date, is modernised and is effective.  I know it will be very difficult to stop every individual from acting irresponsibly because the action of even one man placing a picket on a large factory can cause chaos.  The Government, unions and employers will have to probe more deeply into our system of industrial relations, first of all, in an endeavour to obviate the necessity to strike.  Though I speak as a member of a union.  I always feel that, when one goes on strike, one has actually lost one's argument, that the great strength of the strike weapon is when it is being threatened.  As soon as a man goes on strike he loses pay and, very often, his family suffers. One must remember that he can ill afford a loss of wages, whereas employers do not feel the pinch so easily.</P>
    <P>I do make a plea&mdash;in the 20th century, especially in this country&mdash; for greater consideration by all concerned <Col N="259" /> in an industrial dispute so that we will not aggravate the present high level of unemployment.  In saying that I probably speak for the vast majority of people who do not want disputes, strikes, or even ill-feeling.  Nevertheless, we must face the fact that there are certain irritants that cause a man, or men, to go on strike.  One of those might well be the length of time it takes to have a grievance resolved; something may drag on for months while the position continues to worsen when, perhaps, an unofficial strike takes place.  Then one reads that certain steps have been taken to bring the matter to the Labour Court or, perhaps, that even the Government have stepped in.  While the Minister's early alarm system is probably of great importance here, he must always remember that industrial relations are really human relations and that a man who may go on strike on a factory floor is no different from the rest of us who may have some grievance with life; he does not act merely to cause trouble but because he knows that, by so doing, he can bring the matter to a head much quicker.</P>
    <P>When the Minister introduces new legislation on industrial relations he might ensure the speeding up of the hearing of any dispute from the time it is recorded to the time it is heard by the Labour Court.  I have great admiration for the work done by the Labour Court since its establishment. We may have to record millions of days lost through industrial action but we must remember also the millions of days saved because of the dedication of members of the Labour Court and, indeed, of the trade unions and employers' organisations.  The point I am trying to make to the Minister is that, in introducing his new legislation, he must ensure that the most modern techniques are included in respect of the hearing of disputes because if a man has a grievance burning in his breast all day, it continues to worsen and, by the time he takes action, he is a very embittered person and it is much more difficult for him to accept a suggestion of the Labour Court or an employer that he call off his protest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> I hope the Minister will refer to the amalgamation of the trade unions in his reply.  We have, I think, 93 trade unions for a comparatively small labour force.  There may be an historic reason for that.  But if we are to maintain the level of European economic and industrial development, we must see how others on the continent do such things.  I do not suggest that they are perfect but, with the exception of one country, possibly we have the worst record for days lost through industrial disputes.  At least on three or four occasions we topped the league. There must be reasons for this in our case.  Perhaps, it is that we have not a long tradition of industrial development or relations.  But we must learn very quickly, indeed, because, if we are ever to have full employment, we will achieve it only when we have perfected our financial and industrial machinery and also improved human relations.  If one of those things is missing, we will not be able to reach the true fulfilment of our ambitions. In this country we believe in free collective bargaining and the right of people to strike.  Each one of us can do a lot to bring about a better atmosphere in industrial relations and save many thousands of people having to strike with the consequent loss to the men and women involved and also to the national economy.  We are inclined to accept, with unemployment figures so high at present, that we must always have unemployment. It is fatal to accept that.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Department of Labour is one of the most interesting and rewarding Departments of Government. The Minister may say that it is one of the most trying also to the individual or to the Government. This side of the House are not satisfied with the Minister's performance in the Department because we feel he is not doing enough for the people who are unemployed.  There is a very high percentage of people unemployed in Dublin and we also have thousands of school leavers who cannot get gainful employment.  I have been told by one large industrial concern that there is great trouble brewing there. I do not want to mention the name of the firm because I do not think it <Col N="261" /> would help.  I feel that the industrial scene is not improving and that it is much easier to solve our industrial problems if employment figures rise. If we had full employment in the north and south of the country, but particularly in the north, we would have a lot less trouble than we have had in the last few years.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to look at much of the contents of his brief and he will have to set out to convince the people that the Government have some plan for the improvement of the economy.  So far they have failed to do this.  A national despondency is setting in and the people are inclined to lose all hope.  They want some moral booster.  The greatest boost they could get is if the Government convinced them that they are a competent Government. They will find that very hard to do.  We feel that the only step which can be taken to ensure a general improvement in the national outlook is to have a change of Government. I look forward to the day when that will happen which I feel will be in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start by taking up where the previous speaker ended, that is, to stress the need for an injection of confidence in the people.  The present unemployment situation should be regarded as a crisis one that needs immediate attention. The position of those on the unemployment register is alarming enough but we all know that in the very near future thousands leaving schools and colleges will also be looking for work and will inflate the unemployment figures very considerably.  It is serious enough when one finds people of mature age without work but it is far more serious when young people starting their careers full of hope and ambition, anxious to make homes, settle down and secure their future find that after preparing themselves to the best of their ability for a position in life they are unable to obtain a situation. That is worthy of serious consideration by everybody both inside and outside the House.  It should be regarded as a crisis and something drastic should be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear and read a good deal <Col N="262" /> about the visits of the Taoiseach and various Ministers to America and other countries to entice industrialists to come over here, start industries and give employment.  We also read that each job created in that fashion costs several thousand pounds.  I cannot appreciate why more effort is not made to keep those presently at work employed and not allow industries to close if it is possible to keep them open.  We know that there are some industries which cannot be kept open and that it would be wasteful to try to keep them open but I feel that financial help should be given to others to enable them to keep open and keep their people employed until alternative accommodation has been found for those employees or a new industry has been created in the area.</P>
    <P>I do not want particularly to single out one factory but the Cork Shoe Company had at least 200 employed but because of bad management posibly they had to close down.  It certainly was not bad workmanship because they had the orders and the market.  This firm were in debt and they eventually had to close.  The 200 people thrown on the unemployment market are now costing the community as much as the interest on loans the firm had from the banks or other institutions to keep the people employed.  I feel that it would only have been necessary to help them for a very short time.  I only use this argument because I do not believe the people throughout the country are satisfied that enough is being done to keep those presently employed in their employment rather than throwing them on the unemployment exchanges and social welfare.  This demoralises them and causes a great deal of agitation and worry to their families and the community of which they are part.</P>
    <P>If we want to have full employment we must have people who are able and willing to invest money in industry. That should be very clear to everybody.  Why should a potential employer risk his life's savings or what he can borrow from the bank or any institution to invest in an industry at the present time without confidence that the industry will succeed?  First <Col N="263" /> of all, he would have to meet competition in whatever industry he went into and, secondly, he would have to put up with labour relations which have not got the best possible reputation in the country.  He would also have to be tax gatherer for the Minister for Finance, for his employees and himself.  He would have to account for every penny he made and if he made a profit it would be very seriously taxed.  The time has come when such a man will lawfully be expected to sit down and make up his mind between two choices: first, to risk everything for the sake of satisfying the Minister for Finance eventually that the profit he has made is not taxable and he is entitled to keep and use it to expand industry and employ more people, or there is the temptation to invest the money in Government stock at 14 per cent.  Then he can put his feet up, smoke cigars for the rest of his life and live on his interest.  He takes no risk when he does that.</P>
    <P>The job of the Government and our job in Dáil Éireann is to try to make it clear to such a person that he should invest his money in industry.  One will not get very far asking a man to risk everything he has and the future of his family in an altruistic&mdash;I will not use the word &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo;&mdash;gesture, like starting an industry which he does not have much hope will succeed.  We must be able to persuade him that he has the help and the blessing of the Government to succeed and he will be allowed retain something if he succeeds in making the business viable. That, to my mind, is fundamental. Until such time as we have restored the confidence of such people, we will not get anywhere with employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about an increase in the amount given to create new jobs.  That sort of thing is merely a sop to the people.  If the tax measures seemed less penal, and a person felt he was entitled to a profit, that would do much to restore confidence. The worker, too, must have confidence that he will get a fair return for his work.  I am not casting any reflection on those who cannot work through no fault of their own&mdash;I want <Col N="264" /> them to live as well as the country can afford and I would like them to have a good living and to be well off&mdash; but to keep a man's mind at ease, he must feel that he is better off working than being idle.</P>
    <P>Official and unofficial strikes were briefly referred to.  We have the extraordinary and unfortunate position in this country where two people can decide to go on strike, walk up and down outside a factory carrying a placard and keeping 1,000 men out of work.  That is an unofficial strike and is deplorable.  Nobody should want to see such a situation occur.  I am not blaming the two men.  Maybe they have tried every avenue to redress their grievance but could not succeed.</P>
    <P>We are inclined to blame certain sections of the workers if they do something drastic, such as withdrawing their labour from a key industry and holding the country to ransom.  We have a salutary lesson in what happened here in the last few months. Educated men with a great deal of advantages&mdash;the Department and the Minister on one side and the teachers on the other&mdash;were holding up students for six months.  A decision could not be reached until strike action was taken.  In this case the students, the innocent victims, had to suffer.  My point is: have we not reached the stage when educated men can sit around a table and hammer out a solution, which will have to be reached eventually?  A solution has been reached now, but, to my mind, six months too late.  This leads to a lack of confidence.  It stretches into every home in which there is a student, the mainstay of this country in years to come.  They are now feeling for the first time this awful uncertainty which can be caused by strikes.</P>
    <P>We are told that every Department has problems; there are world problems and it is not the Government's fault that things are as bad as they are.  Every family has to face problems.  A family is judged by the way they overcome those problems.  Whether the Government like it or not, they will be judged by the people on how they face up to their problems and deal with them.  It would be hard for even die-hard suppene <Col N="265" /> porters to make the case that the Government have acted wisely all the time and have made a fair show to overcome these problems.  There is no point in informing the population of how bad things are in other countries, while things are not so good here.</P>
    <P>It is only very recently that some Ministers admitted that there was a shortage of money.  I think there is one Minister who does not admit that.  He says that there is money available for supplying what he wants for the country.  That view cannot be substantiated and the people do not believe it.  Other Ministers have used diversionary tactics to take people's minds off the economic problems.  That is a reflection on the people's intelligence: it implies that they do not understand such things.  The Government will find in the next election that people are not as gullible as some of us think.  They have the intelligence to know what is right and wrong and what is true.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is reaching into every home.  The first thing the Minister must do is restore confidence which has been ebbing away through the economic life of the country.  I must say once more that the man who is in a position to invest money should be assured that he will be entitled to keep a fair return for his investment.  This is one of the most serious problems facing the country at the present time, mainly because it is affecting the breadwinner and hundreds of young people whose future is at stake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject we are dealing with here on this Vote is something that permeates all the Estimates where expenditure is involved and it permeates the whole fabric of the State. For that reason it is very difficult to confine oneself to a mere consideration of the details of policy of labour, to the technicalities such as rates of payment, numbers employed and so on which may be involved.  They are not so much technicalities as specifics related to the Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to deal adequately with the subject, one has to take into account the fact that the whole subject of labour permeates the economic and <Col N="266" /> social structure of the State.  Therefore, it has a bearing on every facet.  Keeping that in mind it is highly undesirable to attempt a debate of this nature on narrow, political lines.  I should like to approach the problems posed by the raising of this Estimate at this time in a constructive spirit so that we may examine what affects the state of labour in the community at present and also the impact on the community of the state of labour within it.  Therefore, I shall preface my remarks by saying that it is in an objective spirit, not in a competitive spirit&mdash;to which we might very easily succumb&mdash;that I approach this Estimate on which I have not contributed very frequently in the past.</P>
    <P>By way of background, may I say that I think we are losing our perspectives at present in all our policies. In particular, the Government as the agency responsible are losing their perspectives in failing to recognise that for the healthy functioning of any community there must be a continuing active economic development and activity which is productive of wealth and of the wherewithal by which a community lives and prospers. If sight is lost of that fact the consequences could be disastrous.</P>
    <P>When all is said and done any community is governed by what is commonly called &ldquo;Adam's curse&rdquo;.  All that means is that humanity must work, must strive and must produce the wherewithal for surviving in the first instance and for developing in the second instance.  It must produce that wherewithal from the natural resources about it.  If a community fails to do this the result is starvation and decline in some shape or form.  When I use the word &ldquo;starvation&rdquo; I am not merely confining it to starvation of the body through hunger which would be the extreme and logical conclusion of the failure of a community to take steps to provide the means of living.  I am using the word in a much wider sense.  From the point of view of the community, in some way it will be starved, deprived or inhibited in its growth.  Its standards will fall unless it is nourished by productive activity which is generating the wherewithal to live; to use a technical <Col N="267" /> term, it is production generating wealth in real terms.</P>
    <P>Under the aegis of the present Government the word &ldquo;wealth&rdquo; tends to be used as an expression of opprobrium and contempt.  However, I am talking about the wealth of a community, what it has or should have, not what its individuals must have in monetary terms.  Wealth for the community in real terms is not only highly desirable but it is an absolute necessity for the community to live in health and comfort.</P>
    <P>These remarks may seem abstract and remote from the issue but sometimes it is essential to consider our perspectives before dealing with the specifics.  In this case I plead it is essential in order that we do not degenerate into a dispute or argument, scoring points when at present as a community we can hardly afford the luxury of such, so serious is the situation.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some remarks about priorities before I get down to particulars.  It would be in the tradition of the House if I were to refer to previous experiences.  If I refer to achievements when we were on the Government side, I do not do so in any spirit of boasting or claiming credit but simply as a factual demonstration of the validity of the line of thought I am advocating and with which I am attempting to approach this Estimate.  In 1955-56 the Government which, like the present, was a coalition of Fine Gael and Labour essentially, were faced with a situation which was in some respects analogous to the situation this Government have had to face.  Whatever our criticisms of the way they handled the situation then&mdash;I leave those to history&mdash;there are essential facts relevant.  In 1956 there was a problem of unemployment, a problem of economic depression and a problem of emigration. There was the problem of improving the situation and of finding the resources to do it in a depressed situation.</P>
    <P>It is only fair that I should say that a Coalition Minister for Finance, the late Deputy Sweetman, appreciated <Col N="268" /> the problems and, within the scope available to him in a Coalition which had such elements of doctrinaire irrationality attached to it on the wings, made a contribution. He attempted to prevent deterioration and, without taking credit from those who succeeded him, provided a precursor to recovery.  I do not make that statement in an attempt to be generous or for any other reason but objectively.  The result of his contribution was that the situation was nothing like as bad as it is today.  His successor in this Coalition has not realised the magnitude of the problem facing him and that successor has made the problems facing the Government and the country more difficult than they were at the end of 1956.  One cannot push comparisons too far because there are differences in the situation.  I frankly admit that, perhaps, the environmental pressures and problems are greater in the present context and in leading into it than they were in 1956.</P>
    <P>However, under a new Government and particularly under the far-sighted direction of the late Deputy Seán Lemass in 1957 it was possible to implement a programme of recovery and thereafter a programme of expansion. Vital and important in that was the labour element.  Vital to the labour element was the fact that the keynote of the whole thing was a programme for economic expansion, where there was a drive to develop basic economic activity productive of wealth and that in turn reacted on the labour situation and the labour situation in turn reacted on it.  That is the lesson to be learned from this.  What is conspicuously absent at present is that we do not have the stimulus let alone an expanding economic activity producing wealth.  As we do not have that, we have labour problems and difficulties to face of a disturbing magnitude. On the other hand, the lesson of that time was that that expansion could not have been possible without the labour element's active implementation of it.  That could not have been got unless the morale of managements and workers was built up by the policies embarked upon.  The fact that their confidence was sustained enabled them to do the job and without that <Col N="269" /> confidence it would have been futile to talk about plans for economic expansion or anything else.  Though it would be highly interesting from a logical point of view to go into the details of the success of that approach, suffice to say that on the basis of real economic activity whatever can be said about the economic expansion of the sixties the rising of the standard of living of our people and a certain prosperity were the hallmarks of that period and they did not happen by accident.</P>
    <P>What is wrong today?  We do not have that element.  On the other hand, we have the emphasis on administration, on taxation, on the alleviation of the consequences of depression while we are not doing enough to stimulate and develop the source of support for social services and the like.  This is the key to it.  Today, we find high unemployment in our community. The Minister may say&mdash; reasonable people will see beyond causes, beyond mere political polemics&mdash;that there was depression and so on which was responsible. That may be true initially, but what are we doing positively to get people to work, raise their morale so that they will work and so that there will be a general contribution of the community, management and workers, to production?  Instead, we are, without meaning it or otherwise, providing disincentives.  Instead of trying to deal basically with the amelioration of unemployment by providing jobs, we have been content to try to alleviate the want created by people being out of jobs.  That must be done; I do not suggest that people can be left to starve.  It was this party, when it came into office, that adopted the progressive approach many years ago when the party with which the Minister is associated took a more conservative line.  That in itself is not enough.  You cannot support a policy of that kind unless you have productivity which will supply the financial resources to furnish these reliefs and social services. This is the kernel of the whole thing.  When a community or a Government anywhere <Col N="270" /> forget the priorities or get them mixed up, things go wrong.</P>
    <P>The priorities for any democratic Government are that you first have a clear, political policy which you can make evident to the community, which will inspire them, raise their morale and induce them to follow you. You have that when, having made a rational decision, you are prepared to take the consequences of objection to your policy and when you are determined and completely committed to its implementation because you believe in it and it appears to be right.  If it is adopted by a majority of the people, you can be sure there is sufficient justification that will make it a success.  If you are prepared to commit yourself to a definite productive policy and argue with those who will object&mdash;and there are bound to be objections of various sorts and if the plan is worthwhile there will certainly be debate and opposition&mdash; and if you seek and get the support of the community and feel there is sufficient justification to push it through, then push it through and let the issue be decided in public as it should be in a democratic society. The best man will win.</P>
    <P>That has been the history of all successful democracies no less than it has been the history here.  I stress the political angle because it is from it that the confidence of the people steams, workers, managers and all concerned in this Vote.  As in the case of an army, if you give a clear lead and the morale of those behind you is high, some measures of success will be achieved for the benefit of all.</P>
    <P>Granted the political element, you have the psychological prerequisite to get down to work.  In those circumstances people will make personal effort and even personal sacrifice if they know it will be worth while in the interests of the future.  They will work and build and the community will advance. This is borne out in our history for anybody who looks at how the State developed from the beginning, the circumstances that enabled it to survive the emergency, the unity of the community then and the high morale and co-operation that was evident. <Col N="271" /> There was also that period in the sixties of which I spoke and in all these cases there is material to support my argument.  Where there is a clear political lead and the morale of the workforce and others concerned is raised, the people will make the effort and even make sacrifices as they did in the economic war, as the small farmers and agricultural labourers did at that time, for the ultimate benefit of all.</P>
    <P>This is the first prerequisite.  The activity must be directed to production, towards gaining real wealth for the community and by that production confidence is generated to produce more.  When that is achieved, you have the surplus for social services and for the expansion of desirable activities such as expanding education, improving the lot of the aged, the unemployable and so on.  If you mix priorities, you get demoralisation. The priorities are; first, to give the lead and build up morale, then provide activity that is productive and in itself morale-sustaining because the results of the development are seen as you progress.  It is like tending a garden: when you see the plants coming up, you are encouraged to do more; if they wither and die, you are rather liable to say that you might as well read a book inside.  But, if you see the production there, then the wealth multiplies and, when you have got that, that is your second priority and the third priority then is the surplus available.</P>
    <P>In order to complete my argument I freely grant you cannot plan things altogether as neatly as that and, in the course of activity as in the course of battle in war, there will be emergencies and perturbations.  I freely grant you cannot wait to give social services.  You will have to find the money&mdash;we had to do it back in the thirties&mdash;to alleviate unemployment while you are actually trying to correct it.  You will have to find money for social services so that people will not sink to absolutely destitute standards. These are the problems of battle.  They are also the problems of life.  I am not for a moment suggesting <Col N="272" /> these things must not be done. What I am saying is that they can only be done effectively, even though there are sacrifices at the moment and there is a drawing off from the main stream, if you keep your eye fixed on the necessity for encouraging agricultural production, industrial production, trade and all that produces wealth for the community and thereby raises the standard of living.</P>
    <P>Again, this steams back to political morale, economic activity and these other things in their particular priorities.  If any of these priorities is wrong, you have demoralisation.  If priorities are wrong, morale goes and when morale goes, productive activity suffers and, after that, it becomes very nearly a free-for-all on the one hand and coercive action on the part of the lead on the other hand.  Let me draw an analogy again with an army, the analogy I drew on the Finance Bill.  The successful army in action will have a sure lead and high morale; its troops will be co-ordinated and producing the desired results.  There will be problems of battle but, by and large, that army will succeed.  If the lead falls and morale degenerates, then disco-ordination sets in and the fighting troops fail, the fighting troops being equivalent to the productive elements in the community, in industry, in agriculture and so on.  When failure begins to show itself, the high command, instead of leading, has to go back and try to drive and it becomes a free-for-all with the danger of a breakdown along the line and the high command is forced into coercive efforts and the result is, of course, disaster and defeat.  There is a very close analogy here.</P>
    <P>The high command of this State, the Government, have failed to give a lead and have allowed demoralisation to set in in the fighting troops&mdash; that is, in the productive elements&mdash;because of the necessity of trying to hold things together and provide for the contingencies of battle which have arisen&mdash;for instance, unemployment as a result, high casualties, even factors beyond the control of the Government.  Nobody will concede quicker than I will the difficulties this <Col N="273" /> Government found themselves in from 1973, difficulties beyond their control, but when a Government find themselves in this position, not giving a lead, they have to use coercive methods.  What are those coercive methods?  Taxation at a level that threatens now to cause serious social disturbance, as I pointed out on the Finance Bill only a week or so ago.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt but I think the Deputy will agree he is ranging pretty wide of the Estimate for the Department of Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am getting to the Estimate.  When I say these things I say them objectively because it is relevant to this Estimate that the failure of productive activity is responsible for the unemployment figures at the moment.  There is a failure to give a lead.  There is high unemployment and that high unemployment is to be attributed to the failure of this Government to take timely steps to keep productive activity in motion.  I think that is relevant to the Estimate.  The high unemployment figures and the lack of activity by the Government are responsible for a lack of confidence on the part of business and management and that lack of confidence has resulted in a failure by business and management to provide employment opportunities. Is that relevant?  I think so. I think it is very relevant, but I will bow to the Chair's ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said it was not relevant, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  I am trying to show that I am trying to be relevant.  If the Government gave a lead, if managements were prepared to expand and make use of money that I think is available, albeit at very high rates, we might be able to make a more productive inroad in solving the problem of unemployment.  Will we take the risk?  This is my point about the political lead and the morale of the Government.  Because of the absence of these things, there is a depression and, following from that, there is something that comes very <Col N="274" /> near this labour situation where, when you have high unemployment, you get a demoralisation that brings almost a free for all and then you are bound to have management, and even labour, looking for solutions that minimise the employment content of industry.</P>
      <P>In order to keep logic right I find it hard to know which to put first, whether to point out that, because of inflation, taxation and so on, labour costs tend to soar and, because of that, management and even labour itself tend towards solutions that bring about redundancies and a minimisation instead of a maximisation of jobs. Or, logically, should I say that the present situation is making the labour force lack the confidence to have faith in the future and to invest, as well as the management element, in the future by voluntary co-operation and effort? Does the present problem in regard to remuneration stem from inflation or does it stem from a lack of co-operation as a result of a lack of confidence on the part of both sides in the future?</P>
      <P>However I put it, the factual situation is that labour costs are now so high that there is a positive disincentive to expansion of industry that is labour-intensive and the tendency seems to be to look for solutions that will minimise jobs rather than maximise them.  The result of this is further demands for remuneration, further taxation, and then the burden of taxation aggravates this trend. There is a demoralisation setting in that is disturbing to anybody who thinks about it, so disturbing that one hesitates to proceed with a logical discussion on it for fear of aggravating an already serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago I listened to various elements of the community coming on radio or television, all pressing their own claims, all with their own solution as to what the Government should do and should give them, without appearing to understand that there are other elements and that the improvement in their position that they were looking for depended on the improvement of the whole.  I think that is a demoralisation, and it all stems from the lack of concentration on productive <Col N="275" /> activity, which is my theme in this.  Therefore, if I appear to be somewhat general in my remarks, it is in a desire to avoid aggravating particular issues at the moment.  I would not like to be put in the position of having to deal with certain issues at this stage, but there are these signs of demoralisation there.</P>
    <P>I have already placed on record here an insistance on productive activity, that is, employment in industry, employment in agriculture, employment in business that is productive in the real sense of the word.</P>
    <P>We have now also to consider what is the problem of employment in what I might call the service sector.  The service sector also involves the State sector.  Again, one has to understand that all the service sectors, for their support and standard of living and standard of remuneration, depend essentially on the productive sector. What we are witnessing here today is that, in order to support the service sector in our community and also to support the demands of the social services, the Minister for Finance has to resort to taxation at a level that is further inhibiting what should be the main activities of the community.  Perhaps, a Cheann Comhairle, you will extend me a little indulgence here, in that, although I think I would be perfectly within my rights in being fairly specific about this at this moment, today I do not wish to do so.  However, I will say that generally the burden of taxation has made workers restless and indirect taxation has made the whole community restless, despondent and discouraged, has tended to depress the standard of living, and that this is the root cause of the lack of confidence in labour and managements. What is more, unless productive labour and productive management are stimulated to provide the wherewithal, the goose with the golden egg will be sick, indeed, for those who eat eggs.</P>
    <P>Turning the pages of the Minister's brief at random, I see he talks about the general economic climate, about unemployment premiums and their extension, about industrial disputes <Col N="276" /> and strikes, about remuneration and so forth.  All these things are unified. All these things stem from what I have tried to emphasise here.  We should be seeking some positive approach instead of just collecting money as we are doing.  As I said on the Finance Bill, the Revenue Commissioners are being driven into the position of the publican in the gospel, and I fear very much that ere long they will attract the odium which will be a disaster.  Instead of scraping the barrel in this way the Government should be embarking on a constructive programme of expansion whereby people would be encouraged to invest their resources, workers could be encouraged to co-operate in the area in which they are working and to have confidence in their own future, and ready to invest a little in their own efforts and show restraint in the sure knowledge that such co-operation, under the lead of proper Government, would bring them worthwhile results.  If we could do that, many of the demoralising factors present at the moment would disappear.  It probably would still be necessary to keep taxation at a fairly high level; but at least the man in the street and the manager would know that the money that was being taken in was, in a reasonable proportion anyway, being applied to stimulate the economy and to help in producing the money that is being collected in taxation, not as things are at the moment.</P>
    <P>Young people have, as we all know, at the moment a problem in being placed in employment.  It might be possible to do something to provide employment for them or at least to do something that will ensure that when opportunities for employment come this generation that is passing through is not unemployable.  One of the great dangers of the present situation is that the generation passing through this year might find themselves in a category of the unemployable because of the situation obtaining when they were going through the critical age.  There is no longer the traditional safety valve of emigration to relieve the pressure.  There was a time when we strove against the drain and regarded it as a great <Col N="277" /> achievement when the drain was curtailed. It is the maximisation of employment that must be sought not current trends which seek to control costs by minimising the number of jobs.  Industry no more than anyone else can survive uncompetitive burdens and it has been forced into this situation by increased costs, and cannot be blamed for this.  It all steams from a lack of appreciation of priorities by the Government.</P>
    <P>Another problem that has become acute is that as the numbers engaged in the active sector, the wealth producing sectors, decrease in proportion to those in the service sectors or in the category of the supported, there must be an aggravation of the present situation.  It has reached the stage where the warning that was given on the Finance Bill may be very relevant.  There is not only a disincentive generally to industrial revival and the confidence of workers and managements but there is a positive personal disincentive built into the labour situation.  The worker who finds that when he gains higher remuneration he is getting a decrease in return for his efforts will quickly realise that it is not worth going beyond a certain point.  It is a desperately demoralising thing for society when this happens, and I suggest that it is happening at the present moment.  Inflation in this country is pretty high, and that is putting it mildly.  There is a positive disincentive in that whatever a worker's net pay packet is, when he looks at the rate of inflation, instead of investing with confidence in the future for himself, let alone the community, the tendency is to spend it now, because the value is likely to be so decreased tomorrow.  This often means spending it on amusements or something like that.</P>
    <P>Is it not demoralising to have a situation where workers reach a point where they feel that further effort is unrewarding?  Is it not demoralising when they feel that what they earn is not worth investing in the future for themselves but must be blown immediately?  That is a psychological attitude which is sufficiently abroad <Col N="278" /> to be disturbing.  It is not wholesale but there is enough of it there to call for comment and to say that it is disturbing.  These things must be corrected.  Unless they are, we will find ourselves accepting the pattern which is developing in regard to labour, that is unemployment in the very place where unemployment should not be, the productive sector. Then there is the necessity of servicing the unemployed.  This Government have looked at that from the point of view of even boasting of it. Our employed people have to pay for it and then when that happens we have Government corrective action coming in.  Money is taken from the community all the time and dissipated in an unproductive way.  The standard of living of all is tending to fall.  What can be expected from a labour force in this situation?</P>
    <P>I have been purposely very general in my remarks out of a certain sympathy for the problems of the Government, which may seem strange for me to say.  I do so to exhort them, even at this moment to get their priorities right.  Get production going; give a lead; let us have confidence or, if they cannot do it, get out and let somebody else do it.  Let us have expansion and recovery as we had at the end of the fifties and go into another period when the historic task of this generation will once more be&mdash;to quote the late Seán Lemass&mdash;to lay, not this time the economic foundations of independence, but the economic foundations of the survival of this State and the community at a dignified level and a proper standard of living.  Let us have a lead, a policy.  Let us get our priorities right and, if that can be done, there is no reason for the country to be despondent.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for his indulgence. I hope the Minister will understand the reason for my generality, that it was in order that I should not exacerbate what is already a very difficult problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity of contributing somewhat briefly to this debate resultant on the Minister's introductory speech <Col N="279" /> concerning the Estimate for his Department. I am glad, in the political sense, to have an opportunity to speak because all of today, apart from the Minister's contribution has consisted of speeches from the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy de Valera's speech with some interest.  It seemed to me that he spoke in a very negative sense, and in a political sense, in that there was no attempt to relate the problems existing here today, in the area of the economy with which he concerned himself, to events happening outside these shores.  It would be comforting, in the mid-1970s, to propound solutions and to have within ourselves the capacity of carrying out such solutions for the problems within this island but it simply cannot be done because we are living in a much wider world than that of the era of protectionism in the thirties.  The problems we have today relate and interrelate to a very great extent to events that happen in other parts of the world.  It seems to me that the tendency in the speeches of Fianna Fáil spokesmen has been&mdash;and I suppose it is a legitimate political device by an Opposition&mdash;to look at our problems within this island and to lack the appreciation necessary of the extent to which our policies and efforts at creating employment here are hampered and limited by world events.</P>
      <P>I have before me some references from the <i>OECD Observer</i>, No. 76, for July and August, 1975, lest some people believe that it is fiction that there are problems in other countries. At the start of a brief article relating to unemployment benefits and related payments in the seven major countries in the OECD&mdash;which would comprise most of the larger countries of Europe&mdash;I see the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faced with the prospect of sharp rises in unemployment to levels unprecedented since the Great Depression, some countries began taking action, in late 1974 and early 1975, to improve income maintenance. This was primarily achieved by increasing coverage, by easing eligibility provisions, by extending <Col N="280" /> benefits beyond normal benefit periods, by raising benefit rates, with increased payments for training and job creation programmes in some instances.  Action has also been taken in some countries to raise contributions to unemployment insurance schemes. Given the likelihood of continuing high levels of unemployment, further changes in unemployment transfer schemes in the course of 1975 cannot be ruled out.</P>
    <P>I merely read that short quotation to put the Irish situation into perspective because, from listening to the debate we have been having in the economic area in this country for the last six months, one would imagine that we had an almost extreme left wing, socialist Government introducing a welter of measures completely repugnant to our people, completely in isolation, and entirely unrelated to the policies of other countries.  Indeed some of the countries quoted in that article, with that type of social policy, are amongst those that might be termed middle or right&mdash;when we talk about Canada, the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom, or Italy.  Therefore there is something akin to a mirage in this debate, a lack of reality sometimes very hard to accept and, certainly for those of us on this side of the House, difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>If I might relate that to Deputy de Valera's speech, when he spoke about what he termed the emphasis in this Administration on taxation, he said we were doing nothing to stimulate the source, namely, industry. Then he converted that to suggesting that we were not doing enough.  Then there was an inference that, instead of providing jobs, we were only alleviating the want.  Then he suggested that we must be prepared to commit ourselves to a productive policy.  It seems to me that running through that speech there is an inference and an assumption that, in some way, this Government, in 1976, are against development, against job creation, against the increase of our productive wealth.  Apparently that inference and <Col N="281" /> assumption are made because there is a social policy.  They are not mutually exclusive and we would need to point that out.</P>
    <P>We would need also to look at the recent record of the Fianna Fáil Party in speeches in Opposition, and their performance when in Government, relating to certain aspects of economic development.  It was not my intention to make a speech of a political nature but, faced with this kind of remarks, inferences and assumptions about the attitude of the Government, it is necessary to put certain matters into perspective.  For example, where the Government are concerned, there is the widest range of incentives available to productive investment that exists in any country in western Europe, and probably in any country in the developed world.  There is a range of incentives which runs through the tax concessions, complete relief on export sales, capital grants towards costs of fixed assets, the policies of the Minister for Labour in the employment premium which was increased recently.  Then there is the credit support through the Government Industrial Credit Company, research support through the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, marketing support through córas Tráchtála, the technical assistance grants administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce. And there is the support in the country to the local authorities for industrial development and employment. Therefore to suggest, as Deputy de Valera attempted, that the Government are in some way against development in circumstances in which the development programme of the Government is more progressive and favourable in terms of tax climates and investment climates than any country in the developed world, is to fly completely in the face of facts. It is sad that certain elements in this country apparently are buying the story some of our Opposition spokesmen are selling.</P>
    <P>I can understand, in an economic climate which is depressed, as is the present economic climate, depression in the business community.  I can understand an attempt in some circles <Col N="282" /> to make it rub off on the Government. I can understand the human tendency of an individual to see that the buck must stop somewhere and that the Government of the day are going to be blamed.  But objectively we must look at these facts.  We must look at this range of incentives and at the international position.  We must look at the crisis that hit this country, which was the greatest since World War II, which put an appealling trough into every developed economy in the world and affected this country in two or three serious ways.  There was the enormous imbalance in payments from the oil crisis, with a downturn in exports from existing manufacturing industry&mdash;because of depression on world markets; with a downturn in industrial investment here, again for the very same reasons.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Government, in this context, have kept the country on an even keel, are continuing to do so, that indeed at present there are suggestions that there is an upturn and that, without any question, there are better times ahead.  As against that it is fair to ask&mdash;as Deputy de Valera referred to the matter I hope I will be allowed to refer to the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party in the area of labour development and of employment&mdash;what is happening there. One of the major initiatives of the Government was in an area which will hopefully be vital to our financial interests in future years.  I refer to the policy in regard to offshore oil and gas development.  We can see in certain other countries in Europe at present&mdash;in Britain and in Norway&mdash;massive developments taking place which will bring them in enormous wealth. We can see a situation in Norway where oil resources will provide between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of the entire gross product of the country, a resource that had not existed a decade ago.</P>
    <P>If they have this wealth in Norway and if they are beginning to have it in Britain they have it as a result of policies developed by the Norwegian and British Governments a decade ago.  Fianna Fáil were in office for 16 consecutive years.  What were they doing that time ruling the country <Col N="283" /> which supposedly had an offshore wealth and the only concession granted during that time was to one particular oil company for a pittance? There were no other concessions; there was no thinking; there was no research; there was no employment of consultants to analyse.  We slept when the other European countries that had this wealth got on with developing it. The result is that we are a decade behind.  It took the present Minister for Industry and Commerce to get that moving.</P>
    <P>Let us face certain facts and let us get away from the snide inference that the only party in the country concerned about industrial development are the Fianna Fáil Party and that the Coalition Government are weak on development.  If we are concerned about the Opposition Party who aspire to running the country what about their policy on industry at present?  Their spokesman on Industry and Commerce two or three months ago introduced a motion which categorically sought a situation under which the IDA would be bound to give half of their grants to native industry.  In theory this sounds fine but if there is a limitation to the extent of native industrial building it means in effect that the IDA would have to cut back enormously on the grants which they are presently giving for manufacturing investment in the country and consequently in jobs.</P>
    <P>This is the stated policy in the industrial field and in the employment creation field of the party who aspire to running the country better than the present Government do.  We can see also that in the difficult times which I have discussed Irish exports in the 12 months ended April, 1976, reached a record breaking level of £1,520 million exceeding the April, 1975, figure of £1,200 million by over £300 million.  These are the facts.  If we are to have a discussion about economic performance, or performance where employment creation is concerned, let us look at the difficulties we are facing in the context of difficulties experienced by other countries.  Let us put Ireland into <Col N="284" /> perspective and let us talk about the facts in the country rather than have philosophical speeches about the supposed policies for the past 30 to 40 years.</P>
    <P>I would particularly like to congratulate the Minister for Labour on his achievement in being instrumental more than any other person in arranging that the European Foundation for Living and Working conditions, an institute of the EEC, which is under the ambit of his Department and other such Departments in Europe, will be, through his initiative and with the support of other agencies, established the first EEC building in the country.  It is a desirable development. It brings an EEC institution into the country.  It will certainly be a most welcome development.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to note from the Minister's speech, and knowing of the developments in AnCO, that there has been an increased allocation from £5 million last year to £8.5 million this year in the training area.  We should remember that this in effect doubles the money spent here because we are getting pound for pound from the European Social Fund so that in effect after bringing the level up from £5 million to £8½ million means expenditure in the region of about £16 million in the training area which is most welcome.</P>
    <P>It is very apt at this time to say a few words about this type of training which AnCO are providing which is, singly, the most valuable type of training and education which can be provided in the country at present. With the development of free second and third level education and with the natural ambitions of parents for university status for their children in recent years we tended to go overboard so far as the liberal arts were concerned and so far as university education was concerned.  The extent to which we went overboard in this attitude, which I suppose is human and understandable, is seen very clearly and in a very startling way at present when we look at the list of graduates coming out of our university system. We have a very considerable surplus of doctors.  There is also a very big <Col N="285" /> surplus of teachers and arts graduates coming on the market.  We read recently that only 57.6 per cent of those who qualified with the higher diploma in education are engaged in permanent teaching appointments and 20 per cent of those who are trained to be teachers are not in teaching jobs. Of the 1,110 jobs taken by graduates in general a very small proportion went into industry.  Only about 126 of that number went into industry which means that the liberal arts training may be all right in the bigger company and it may be all right in certain management positions but the emphasis for development is that the skills have got to be in technology and technical training.  It seems to me that the future in the job market will lie to a very great extent with the people who have technical training.  Therefore, the increased commitment by the Government in the technical training area is absolutely vital and most necessary.</P>
    <P>At present, because of the high level of unemployment many school leavers find that work is not available.  We hope that the economy will improve quite a lot in the next two to three years and if a substantial number of those school leavers can be absorbed into training programmes it will be an extremely useful social and economic function which we should stress. I understand this is being done in other countries.</P>
    <P>There is a policy in Britain which we might look at, under which they pay a subsidy to companies of £5 per week per place for the first 26 weeks of work for unemployed school leavers.  This is something which would not cost a fortune and it might help to get employed school leavers into their first jobs.  It might also give incentives to certain companies to take them on.</P>
    <P>I note the reference in the Minister's speech to the building industry. Despite all the criticism of the capital budget there is a commitment to spend £325 million, an increase of £45 million on last year.  Deputy de Valera urged the Government to become involved in the matter of providing jobs.  He stated categorically <Col N="286" /> that the high unemployment rate was due to the failure of the Government to keep productive activity in motion.  This is a lot of rot.  He spoke of a lack of confidence in business and management.  If there is lack of confidence in business and management and if it develops the Opposition will have played no small role in encouraging such lack of confidence by the nature of some of the speeches we have heard lately.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera urged the Government to provide the actual jobs. Is this by direct Government investment? Does it entail an increase in the capital budget?  If it does Opposition spokesmen are ranting every day in the week about the extent of the capital budget so where is the logicality of suggesting that the Government should provide the actual jobs and at the same time suggesting that the capital budget must be kept in check? It is much easier in Opposition than it is in Government to level those charges.</P>
    <P>At present, while there is an appalling problem in relation to unemployment and while the percentage is high, the situation is entirely different from that which obtained here 20 years ago.  At that time there were substantial outlets abroad for employment.  There were substantial outlets for work in the United States and in the United Kingdom.  Those outlets do not exist now.  There are benefits, conversely, within the country which fortunately allow a much higher proportion of people to stay here than could afford to do so 20 years ago.  We are not comparing like with like when we speak like this.</P>
    <P>I was very interested to note the Minister's reference to what he termed the community youth training programme in which the local authorities and vocational bodies put forward programmes.  It is possible that I am not a very diligent member of the local authority of which I am a member, or of this House, but I do not believe that that is the case.  It seems to me that not a sufficient number of people are aware of this programme.  The Department of Labour might engage in more public <Col N="287" /> relations activity, releases or advertising, to acquaint people throughout the country of the extent of this interesting programme.</P>
    <P>As a Government in the labour area we want to tackle certain problems and anomalies in rural Ireland.  We have unemployment benefits and, at the same time, local improvement schemes which entail work on minor roads for which there is not sufficient money. We know the reason for that&mdash;financial constraints.  There is an anomaly in the sense that labour is available and these schemes, in which there is a high labour content, need to be done.  In my opinion, we have not looked sufficiently at issues such as this to see if we can possibly relate the situation where unemployed persons and schemes, such a minor road and drainage schemes, are concerned. We should make some attempt to get the available productive labour which is not working, channelled into such schemes and increase the level of activity which can be engaged in.  We should also attempt to provide an income for such people on public works schemes rather than through the unemployment benefits system.</P>
    <P>This is an issue to which there is not a simple answer.  I do not think it applies to the city to the same extent as it does to the country.  The will to work is there in the country, but we need to give a lead in this area to see if we can develop such schemes. It is worthy of engaging in a feasability study by Departments, such as the Department of Labour or the Department of Social Welfare, to see if something could be done in that area.  I wish the Minister well in a difficult area and at a difficult time.</P>

      <P>In the Minister's speech there are many generalities with which many people will agree.  In my view, he does not get to the root cause of many of the factors involved. The previous speaker mentioned something I am keen on.  I do not see why people of 19 and 20 years should be retrained by AnCO.  That is wrong. We must look at their earlier lives to find out where the causes lie and try to remedy them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> When we look at our second-level schools system, I wonder if the Minister has made any effort, in consultation with the Minister for Education, to bring about a more favourable balance in relation to the practical or technical, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the theoretical. Some years ago&mdash;I think around 1976 &mdash;statistics showed that 75 per cent of our output from these schools tended to be theoretical and only 25 per cent practical.  In some of the Scandinavian countries, the reverse was the case.  If we have a hard look at this, we might be able to start along the road to recovery.  There is not much point in people leaving school after 12 or 13 years with a theoretical education if job opportunities are not seen to be there for them within a reasonable time.  They then have to move in to a third level to be trained in a technical field.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Faulkner established the regional training colleges, that was a move in the right direction.  I do not think we fully appreciate the value of these colleges.  While they meet the bill in many respects, I would encourage the Minister to get in touch with his colleague, the Minister for Education, to see how best the individual can be served in second-level schools. It is a great pity to see so many people leaving the schools unqualified for any employment.  It is the right of a young person after 13, 15 or even 20 years full-time education to expect a job at a level that would be compatible with his educational qualifications or standing.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal of talk over recent years about schemes in the public work sector.  The previous speaker mentioned local improvement and amenity schemes.  That is all very well but they are manual jobs.  After 13 or 15 years' formal theoretical education, these young people would not find this work compatible.  It would hardly be socially acceptable to the Minister if this suggestion were put forward.  Many people would be only too glad to take this kind of employment as a holding operation. Nevertheless, this of itself is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>These schemes are suitable for people who are accustomed to manual <Col N="289" /> outdoor work.  Has the Minister been in contact with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare to have a look at employment exchanges?  What defeats progress within the system itself are these minor classifications.  Might it not be opportune for the Minister to have his colleague look at the various classifications of the registered unemployed? Would it not be possible to broaden the categories or make them more general?  Some surveys uncovered the fact that there were not sufficient would-be workers available in the categories in which schemes might be proposed.  If the Minister has further information on that, he might like to comment on it later.  Could it be that this system already defeats any programme of local improvement, amenity or small drainage schemes we might have?  These schemes might beautify various small areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a duty to combine his efforts with those of the Minister for Education who is the person responsible for education.  We must consider whether people are geared for life when they finish school. Unfortunately, we know only too well that there are very few opportunities available now.  It requires a large investment on the part of the State for a person to continue for two further years undergoing a training programme which might have been done effectively, even in part, during the course of second-level education.  Perhaps these suggestions have already been considered and the Minister might deal with this aspect in his reply.</P>
    <P>People may have had fixed attitudes with regard to what they expected by way of further education for their children and what qualifications they expected them to acquire.  This is only right but in the present situation many people are making a reassessment of this matter.  This is where leadership and direction is required and I look to the Minister for Labour, in conjunction with the Minister for Education, to offer that leadership and direction. People are not averse to change. Many people have had change thrust <Col N="290" /> on them and in the present situation it might be opportune to consider how we could move forward.  When things are going well and jobs are available, people do not consider change too readily but that situation does not apply now.  We must consider whether we are turning out balanced people who can adjust to situations.  Perhaps the Minister will consider that suggestion further.  The regional technical colleges have an important function&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that we do not want to enter the realm of education. The Minister has not responsibility for education and the Chair does not want Deputies to stray too far from the Minister's Estimate and the administration of his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. I was endeavouring to set out the point of view of school leavers.  Many of them feel obliged to go further when in fact, what they want to do is to get a job.  CERT plays an important part with AnCO in fitting young people into a walk of life.  However, it is not the situation that a colleague of the Minister is militating against the Department of Labour when we see that tourism and the hotel business are in jeopardy or are hindered by Government proposals?  It is all very well for the Minister for Labour to speak about opportunities for new recruits in the CERT training programme for the hotels and the catering industry, but it may be that he and a colleague are hampering the growth of the industry in the budgetary proposals they put forward.  Such action would appear to be blunting his purpose as set out in this Estimate.  Under the heading of community youth training programme the Minister states:</P>
      <P>The expansion of the CERT training programme for new recruits to the hotels and catering industry, which I have described, is also aimed mainly at school leavers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy is wrong in that regard. Instead of the Minister emphasising to his colleagues in the Cabinet the multiplier job aspect of this industry, it appears that the Minister for Finance <Col N="291" /> is having his way in pruning too much from what should be a growth sector and one that might play a bigger part in the absorption of these young people.  The Minister has a responsibility here to see that this industry flourishes.  If that happens, jobs will be available.</P>
    <P>The community youth training programme sounds wonderful.  The caption is great but will it be a success? It would be ideal if we could use the enthusiasm, drive and ambition of our young people and direct it in a positive way.  What has been mentioned here are tasks of a manual kind.  The Minister referred to repairs to old folks' homes, to community halls, children's playgrounds, centres for handicapped children and premises for travelling people. Should he not have added to the list centres for people to learn to read and write?  There are many people who have not had the opportunity to do this.  Perhaps they are hidden, perhaps they are overshadowed.</P>
    <P>Could some of these school leavers be engaged in this task?  It would be easy to get such a programme under way and it would not require much money but it would bring about a huge improvement socially.  I am aware that in large towns many voluntary groups are active and the Minister should try within the youth training programme to develop the work of such groups so that still more people can learn to read and write. It is possible that in the Minister's constituency there is such a voluntary group engaged in a person to person literacy programme.  It is  possible that in his area teachers and the less fortunate get together for a couple of hours each week so that the less fortunate person can improve socially.  Could that idea be utilised within the youth training programme? In my view it would blend in more with the type and the qualification of the person leaving school.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to think up tasks and programmes which would absorb to best advantage people who have a certain qualification, but the suggestion I have put forward is one way of <Col N="292" /> doing that.  More could also be done for handicapped people.  Helping the handicapped is a fine rewarding task and young people would be happy to do this on an interim basis.  Many of the tasks outlined by the Minister were undertaken by groups of people abroad such as VSO, but a lot remains to be done within our community and with our people.  It is not sufficient to speak in terms of the manual work alone.  We must have an important criterion in mind. If people have been educated in a theoretical fashion for 13 years it would not be socially satisfying for them to be engaged in a manual type of task; it would be more compatible if something akin to their achievments could be arranged for them.</P>
    <P>In reply to question the Minister gave me information with regard to the number of guidance and placement officers in the National Manpower Services and I should like to know if he has considered increasing the number of such officers.  Are there more officers now on the basis of the number of people who need help compared with three years ago?  Is the Minister for labour curtailed by the Minister for the Public Service in the creation of these posts?  Is full use being made of the mobile unit on careers?  Would the Minister consider arranging for officers from the National Manpower Service to visit secondary schools to speak to students who have just obtained their intermediate certificate? Such a visit would help to direct them at a time when it would be most beneficial. It is sad to find people leaving school with the leaving certificate and the feeling that they are not qualified for the job they wish to take on.</P>
    <P>I am aware that I must speak mainly to the Department of Labour Estimate and that many of the aspects I have mentioned are educational but there must be a get-together on such topics.</P>
    <P>Is there any danger that money from the social fund will be channelled into other projects?  I hope that money will not be used to meet any form of current expenditure such as salaries and wages, and I hope the Minister will reassure me on that point.  Is the Minister responsible for moneys which <Col N="293" /> can be used for the input of plant, new machinery and expertise into businesses? I would like to see capital used in this way.  After a difficult spell it often happens that companies are not in a position to reinvest in their own plant or machinery.  Does the Minister offer inducements or aids to such companies lest some of their plants become outdated?</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his speech stated:</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy for 1976 is to give priority to expenditure that would promote growth and sustain and increase employment.</P>
    <P>That is laudable but when one looks at the strategy and the budgetary proposals has growth been stimulated or stifled?  Again, the Minister might question his colleagues in Social Welfare or in Finance as regards the cost now to the employer of the social welfare stamp.  Has he been involved as Minister for Labour in the renegotiation or re-examination of the system which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare told us about whereby originally it was thought by the Government that over five phases the cost of the stamp would be borne completely by the employers and employees and the State would extract itself&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for another Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>But when you see in the Estimate speech a statement of the type which I have read:</P>
      <P>The Government's strategy for 1976 is to give priority to expenditure that would promote growth and sustain and increase employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is relevant.  The function of the Minister for Labour there is to intervene and state that in regard to the creation of new jobs and even in regard to the retention of the present number of employees the tax levy of the stamp at this point in time is very high and if it were to go higher would mean more unemployment.  If a colleague of the Minister is re-examining a policy decision the Minister <Col N="294" /> for Labour should be involved in giving his advice on this aspect of that policy.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister put forward to the Department of Social Welfare the desirability of having a part stamp, a stamp that would meet occupational injuries only?  Perhaps this would boost the number engaging even in part-time work.  At present many workers do not want to engage in part-time work, perhaps in the office cleaning sector, because of the amount taken away for stamps which makes it not worth while.  If we can somehow promote growth and increase employment, boost morale by introducing this limited stamp which would meet the needs of a worker, surely we should do so.  If this review is undertaken I should like to see this occupational injury stamp as the outcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>This investment in jobs, if allowed to work through the economy, will return many now out of work back to productive employment.</P>
    <P>The Government should analyse that themselves.  As I see it their present policy will not allow investment of extra money by the Minister to give a return in jobs.  It looks well and it reads well&mdash;&ldquo;if allowed to work through the economy...&rdquo;.  Is it the function of the Minister to spell this out?  It is left somewhat vague.  How can this be allowed to work through the economy?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify or expand on this later.</P>
    <P>A Deputy on the opposite side said, as I suppose was natural for a Government spokesman, that there are external factors that have brought about the present position.  There was no mention of any culpability on the part of the present Administration but it would be a more honourable and honest approach for that Administration to state that many of their decisions have been wrong and have militated against the provision of jobs. That is what the vast majority of people are saying just now.  For a long time people were fed a diet of promises about many things in respect of <Col N="295" /> which a Parliamentary Secretary later stated it would not be possible to fulfil them no matter how much a Government wished to do so.  That was a case of somebody seeing a little light and the people getting through to him and saying that the Government have helped by their own decisions in many cases to bring about the present malaise.  It is up to the Government to show leadership which will result in the two quotations from the Minister's speech being achieved.  It is all very fine for the Minister to put these things down on paper, but the fact is that the jobs simply have not come. It cannot be socially acceptable to have such huge numbers out of work.</P>
    <P>The register of unemployed is called the live register.  That would indicate that each person on the register is available for work.  I wonder if, medically, every person on that live register is available for work.  Has any effort been made to analyse the register from that point of view?  The Minister may seize on this and come up with a slashed figure of only 20,000 or 22,000 unemployed.  We would all naturally welcome a reduction but not one achieved by that method.</P>
    <P>The more our people are enabled to return to gainful employment the faster the recovery will come in our economy.  There are at present factories and plants around the country whose expensive machines stand idle.</P>
    <P>That is a statement of fact and we are not told what the policy is to get these plants going again.</P>
    <P>The Minister's brief was full of lofty thoughts and verbiage but I cannot find in it any semblance of an action programme, the action programme so badly required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most important Estimate and I am surprised at our having to wrap it up so quickly.  The Estimate needs very careful consideration in an effort to put forward some ideas as to how to get the large number of unemployed back into productive employment. Every Member of this House has experience of people coming to him <Col N="296" /> every day, highly qualified people, who cannot find jobs.  The Minister has indicated what he intends to do to get the economy moving.  He referred to increasing the premium from £12 to £15.  We welcome that but why not give this premium right across the board to anyone who will employ someone?  I am thinking of business people who came to me recently and said that, if this premium were available to them, they might take an extra young person into their employment.  The stamp costs about £6 and so the £12, while, reasonably attractive, was just not good enough. One of the conditions is that the employer must take the employees off the unemployment register.  There are hundreds of young people unemployed who have never been on the register and it is most important that employment should be provided for them.  I was talking to a priest recently and he told me there were two types of young person, the intelligent young person who wants to work and use his brain and the young person who will stay in bed half the day while his father and, perhaps, mother go out to work.  If the intelligent young person cannot get work, then he starts working on something else.  My fear would be that these young people would turn to violence and the most important task the Minister has is providing employment for these young people.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker referred to the educational system and the Chair said it was a matter for another Minister. The Minister for Labour and the Minister for Education will have to get together and consider the vital importance of educating young people into employment in industry rather than into clerical jobs which are just not there.  I am glad the Minister emphasised technical education. AnCO are doing an excellent job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My suggestion about paying the premium right across the board would result in keeping people off social welfare.  That would be an excellent thing for the country.  At the moment we are bogged down on a national pay agreement, which has been agreed by the trade unions, the bodies <Col N="297" /> allegedly representing the lowly paid workers.  They have agreed to an increase of £6 for a man earning £30 a week and £10 for a man earning £100.  At a time when we have so many unemployed how, in the name of goodness, can these bodies look for £10 for a man earning £100 and £6 for a man earning £30?  This just does not make sense and I can tell the Minister the ordinary worker is becoming very well educated in this and is asking who these fellows really represent.  In Britain it is £5 across the board.  Here some people apparently want a special increase for the more privileged.  Talk about justice.  This is miles away from a just society.  I feel very strongly about this.  I remember when I wanted a sliding scale of subsidies to farmers the Minister agreed and said the biggest percentage should go to the smallest people.  Here we have the reverse in this proposed agreement.</P>
    <P>Worker participation was mentioned. I have been advocating that for a long time.  Workers are honest people and eminently reasonable when they understand how a business is running.  As it is, they are not allowed to know anything about profits, directors' fees and so on.  Some years ago when Irish Ropes were in trouble the workers worked three days for nothing.  I believe Irish Ropes would never have got into trouble had the workers been taken into management's confidence.</P>
    <P>Another matter that is mentioned in the Minister's brief is the abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board, because it is desired to put agricultural workers on a par with industrial workers.  I agree, but do not criticise the Agricultural Wages Board.  They set a minimum wage.  Nobody could hire a man for a minimum wage; the rates paid were always above that. One thing I would suggest to the Minister is that the representatives on this new board should understand agriculture. Agricultural workers and industrial workers work under entirely different conditions.  Whether the day is wet or fine the industrial worker goes out in the morning, does his work and goes home.  The agricultural worker gets food from the farmer, and <Col N="298" /> there must be a value put on that. The farmer and the agricultural worker are like brothers.  They eat at the one table.  A Deputy from Kildare was talking about big farmers, and what I am saying might not apply in that part of the country.  The agricultural worker in the part of the country I am talking about is different altogether from the industrial worker. Therefore, I would hope that the people on the new board would know all about agricultural workers' conditions.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to deal with all the matters I want to raise in the short time at my disposal, but I want to raise the question of workers participating in industry.  I am all for that, and, as a member of the co-operative movement, I have always held that there should be workers on the committee.  When workers are told how an industry is run and that it is making a profit, they know everything is all right.  However, I would like to ask the Minister if the unions want it that way.  Do they want to be at both sides of the table?  I would like to see a situation whereby a budget would be brought out every year and that it would be said: &ldquo;We must make X pounds to run this business. We must have a certain amount for the rainy day and any profit over and above that will be given in bonuses to the workers&rdquo;.  If industry was run that way, there would be better industrial relations and there would be no strikes.  The further the worker is kept from the management the more suspicious one gets of the other.</P>
    <P>I understand this debate is to finish at five minutes to seven, so I will make a final point.  I would appeal to the Minister to give the £15 premium to country councils and other local authorities to give employment. Everyone who is taken off the dole is being taken off social welfare. Social welfare must be paid to the unemployed, but surely money should be geared towards employment rather than social welfare.  If it is accepted that more and more people have to live on social welfare because they cannot get employment, the country is going the wrong way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> I am glad to see from the Minister's brief that he intends to channel more money towards employment.  I would give a certain amount of relief, even taxation relief, to people who would invest money in employment so that we could get more people working. There is a feeling of despair among younger people.  I am not here to lacerate anybody, but the Department of Labour must be prepared to spend money and even borrow money to create employment and do it quickly before the young people despair altogether.  It is demoralising for young people to continue writing and writing&mdash;I have even my own doing it&mdash;and only be able to say: &ldquo;I got regrets again this morning&rdquo;.  This £15 should be given to businessmen in order to try to get people back to work.  The vast majority of them want to work.  They certainly do not want to live on social welfare, particularly the young educated people.  I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the question of paying this £15 to anybody who will employ young persons particularly, whether they be on the employment register or not.</P>

We have agreed to give the Estimate on the understanding that the money is urgently required, tomorrow or the next day, in the Minister's Department.  The debate will continue on a token Estimate and on a motion by the Minister on the redundancy payments scheme.  Nobody would expect that this debate would finish after one day in view of the situation in the country at present.</P>

I was endeavouring to indicate that to my knowledge no practical steps had been taken at all to control prices, and since the adjournment I think that the most practical and objective way that I can spell this out in view of the popularity of the shopping basket technique as portrayed on radio and in the Press and otherwise is by putting my shopping <Col N="301" /> basket on behalf of an old age pensioner, man or woman and on behalf of the non-contributory widow on the table of this House.  I have had recourse to official documents and the comparative basket prices that I propose to use are taken from the National Prices Commission reports of March, 1973 and compared with the Monthly Report No. 49 for March, 1976.  I will have to apologise if my allegedly up-to-date figures are in fact behind and lower than they actually are.  I had in mind a male old age pensioner living on his own but it could almost equally apply, with some changes, to an old lady.  The following are the figures:</P>

    <P>The end product is a shopping basket costing that man £10.06 leaving him with 19p change, as against the price in our time at £5.76, making an increase in the cost of his weekly shopping basket of 75 per cent.  When Deputy O'Malley spoke in terms of a two-thirds increase I thought he was being generous and that is why I deliberately set out this shopping basket.  The Parliamentary Secretary may be able to inform the Minister of what was in my shopping basket for the old age pensioner and if there is anything in that which he feels an old age pensioner does not require. The old age pension at the moment is £10.25 and he is spending £10.06 on <Col N="302" /> what I have selected for him.  That does not cover rent or the cost of replacement of bulbs and so on.  He need not worry about the cost of rates or electricity because Fianna Fáil by their legislation when they were in office, gave free electricity to old age pensioners and the write off of the rates.  He has no money for clothes or footwear.  This is exactly the sort of material that the Minister went around the country with before 1973.  We are competing with over-repeated lies and misrepresentation by the Government, but I have put this shopping basket on the records of this House and I challenge the Minister, because I have used his own prices, the prices from the National Prices Commission report, to challenge that shopping basket of £10.06 as against £5.76 when I was there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>We could say that the Opposition have an advantage in the political sense because it is true that there has been a great deal of inflation and prices have risen at very high rates.  Presumably it is true that a political party can capitalise on this in attempting to create the impression among the population at large, that the price increases which have occurred were the responsibility of the Government and that the Government are to blame in some sense for what has happened.  I suppose it is in the context of the forthcoming events in two weeks time that we are discussing this motion this evening.  There are aspects of those prices to which we have to refer.  The Deputy referred to the internal aspect of inflation and the extent to which we can within this country control the rate of inflation, but it is not that simple.  Statistically, one presumes price increases from the agricultural sector are internal in the sense that we are not importing raw materials.  Whilst statistically that may be the case it is quite obvious that since entering the EEC, especially in the line of increased agricultural prices, that is happening because of the external factors of involvement within the EEC and so, of course, there have been substantial increases in the agricultural sector and in food prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> The Government's approach to this is on the record.  Let us look at the percentage price increase we have had in the last two years.  We have a record from February, 1973, until November, 1975.  One of the striking aspects of the documentation concerned with various products here is that the rate of increase on many essential commodities has been greatly below the average percentage increase in the consumer price index, the average increase in prices and the average increase in the rate of inflation.  That is proof of the effect of the subsidies the Government introduced on essential commodities.</P>
    <P>If we look at certain prices tabulated by the Department of Industry and Commerce, making a comparison between February, 1973, and November, 1975, we see that, for example, flour per two kilos was in November 75.26p, an increase of 4½p or 21 per cent; round steak 60p to 69p per lb, an increase of 15 per cent; milk per pint 5p to 6½p, an increase of 30 per cent; bread per loaf 7½p to 10p, an increase of 2½p or 33 per cent; butter from 28p to 40p, an increase of 43 per cent.  Many of those increases are significantly less than the overall price increase as a direct result of Government policy in subsidising essential foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>Of course, we see staggering increases in other areas.  We see an increase in margarines from 9p to 15p, an increase of 67 per cent.  But it is obvious that the answer where margarine is concerned is that one is importing vegetable oil to produce it. Deputy Lalor referred to tea, which is a stock item in the Irish diet and has been discussed politically for many years.  The rate of increase is high, at about 69 per cent.  Of course, the reason simply is that tea is an imported commodity.  Of course it is.  I see Deputy Lalor smiling.  Indeed, some people in the tea business would tell one that they are entitled to higher margins.  Baked beans are an imported commodity.  Cornflakes rose from 13p to 21p, an increase of 62 per cent.  To what extent can an Irish Government control the price of cornflakes, <Col N="304" /> the price of baked beans or of margarine with a base of vegetable oil for the benefit of Irish consumers? Presumably if Irish consumers want to consume substantial quantities of imported commodities in this area, then the price has to be paid for that type of thing by paying a much higher rate of increase than is the case of the essential commodities to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to essential commodities and the movement in prices within the last 12 months.  There have been price reductions in certain important areas in so far as a proportion of a household budget is concerned.  The maximum price for milk on the 1st April, 1975 was 8p; the maximum price on the 24th May, 1976 was 7p, a decrease of 12.5 per cent; butter 47p, in 1975; 48p, plus 2.1 per cent; flour, plain white per kilo, 22½p a year ago, 18½p now, a reduction of 17.8 per cent; bread 21p down to 18p, from 20p to 16p, percentage reductions of 4.3 and 20.  Those are essential foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>If we look at the imported content in prices, in the extent to which the Irish consumer uses those imported prices, and the extent to which some traders are not pushing Irish produce as much as they should, the startling deterioration in the value of sterling &mdash;for which I trust the Opposition do not blame the present Government&mdash; has had a dramatic effect on the cost of imports.  It is in context to mention this question of devaluation and its effect on commodity prices because it relates directly to all imported commodities from areas of strong currencies. We see that in January, 1973, the US dollar versus the £ sterling was 2.349; now it is 1.80, a depreciation in the value of the £ against the dollar of 23 per cent.  The Canadian dollar depreciated at the rate of 24.4 per cent.  The Dutch guilder deteriorated to the extent of 34.9 per cent. The Belgian franc deteriorated to the extent of 31.2 per cent.  The Danish kroner deteriorated to the extent of 32 per cent, 38 per cent against the German mark, 49 per cent against the Swiss franc, 23 per cent against the yen, 29 per cent against the French <Col N="305" /> franc.  Apparently the only currency in the developed world in which we had a satisfactory position is that against the Italian lira which is not something on which we should compliment ourselves at present in the light of the problems facing the Italian economy.</P>
    <P>That gives one an indication of the magnitude of the appalling problems the Government are facing in the prices sector.  They are compounded by the fact that in many cases in the trading community&mdash;and I regret to have to say this&mdash;where Irish products could be sold in Irish shops and bought by Irish people a sufficient effort is not being made to convince Irish people that they should buy Irish products. That is an area in which we could have a much higher level of consciousness as a community, because in many areas the products are there to be purchased if there was more of a sense of patriotism&mdash;to put it basically&mdash; among the public and, additionally, if in the trading sector there was an attempt made to push Irish products to a greater extent than is being done at present.  Indeed, one can notice in some stores in the city the extent to which our merchandise is on offer.</P>
    <P>All of this has an effect when we talk about prices, inflation and price increases. The Government have done what they can do.  The prices commission are there.  Both Government and Opposition subscribe to the view that the prices commission are doing a reasonable job.  They cannot squeeze too much because if they do it would lead to bankruptcies in services and certain manufacturing sectors.  Profitability is needed for development, for investment and for the continuation of employment in those sectors.  The Government have introduced what is called a price line which is further protection for the consumer through which, if there are complaints, they can be telephoned in very quickly, investigated quickly and under which prosecutions have been carried out fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy O'Malley who referred to the Government's policy of wrecking the economy.  It is in context to refer to the recent speech of the <Col N="306" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce who is in the House.  He referred to the fact that despite the gloom in certain circles Irish exports exceeded £1.5 billion per annum for the first time ever in the 12 months ended 30th April, 1976.  The total value of exports reached a record-breaking level of £1,520 million, exceeding the April, 1975 figure of £1,200 million by over £300 million.  This is in excess of the rate of inflation and encouraging to the basic stability of the country.  The achievement represented a 15 per cent increase in the value of our exports in a period of under two years and represents a <i>per capita</i> export figure of about £500.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the startling suggestions of Opposition spokesmen that our economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, that there are severe problems facing us which we cannot control are quite misplaced and at variance with the facts of the situation.  It is true, despite the criticism at present being levelled&mdash;especially regarding economic affairs&mdash;that the incentives which exist here at present are unparalleled in comparison with any other country in the western world, in terms of incentives to industry, in the grant sector, in the taxation sector, in the range of services through the IIRS, through CTT, the IDA and the employment premium operated by the Department of Labour.  Of course, we are not having the level of growth we want and which is necessary for our people.  That is influenced by factors outside these shores.  Firstly, it has been influenced by the fact that it has been difficult to get exports up as quickly as we can where there has not been buoyancy in the market place.  It has been extremely difficult to get investment going here again in circumstances where the world economy was depressed.  But there is a great opportunity at present in that sector&mdash;obviously because of this factor of devaluation which works against us so much where imports are concerned&mdash;which should work tremendously to our advantage in the export field.</P>
    <P>If we refer to consumer subsidies&mdash; because it is important to mention <Col N="307" /> this&mdash;the June, 1975 budget subsidised the price of bread by 5½p per loaf; household flour by 4½p per kilo; the price of butter by 10p per lb; the price of milk by 2p per pint; reduced the price of town gas by 12½p per cent and increased the subsidy to CIE.  The estimated cost of these measures for a full year was approximately £46 million.</P>
    <P>Therefore, putting the budget into perspective and the increase in indirect taxation, for example, in the drinks sector, or in the cigarettes, tobacco or petrol sectors&mdash;if one looks to the development of this country and to some attempt by the Government to keep essential commodities at a certain level which can be afforded by people and, at the same time, having certain other items at a more expensive pitch to pay for those&mdash;that is exactly how the book was balanced in that sector.  I suggest it is a fairly wise method of administration having regard to the difficulties we have experienced.</P>
    <P>Looking at world markets, at the price of commodities and what has been happening to commodities on world markets to put prices into perspective&mdash;because of the extremely high proportion of import content in the purchasing of goods and of household commodities in the country&mdash;the price of copper went up by 100 per cent from January, 1972 to May, 1976.  In the same period the price of tin went up by 191 per cent, aluminium by 77 per cent, nickel by 119 per cent, lead 176 per cent, zinc 160 per cent and wool 175 per cent.  These are the basic commodities which comprise much of the raw materials used in a wide range of articles purchased.</P>
    <P>We see the astronomical increase in prices and we have this staggering devaluation figure as well.  There has been an increase in the price of cotton over the same period of 147 per cent. Rubber per kilo has gone up by 253 per cent, ground nuts by 95 per cent, soft wood 150 per cent, hide and skins 133 per cent and wood pulp by 207 per cent.  Against this background the National Coalition Government are expected to wave a magic wand in <Col N="308" /> isolation to the rest of the world and contain price increases at a level that is completely unrealistic, expected to import articles at prices cheaper than their price and encourage Irish manufacturers to sell goods at less than their cost and Irish wholesalers and retailers to sell at less than adequate margins.  It is an impossible position. I believe the Opposition realise this and also realise the severe limitations there are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was fascinating to listen to Deputy Staunton, even though his time was curtailed, and to remember what he and his colleagues, not least, the Minister for Industry and Commerce who carries the responsibility in this area, were saying when they were in Opposition and in particular what they were saying during the course of the last general election and to compare the statements today with those statements.  The major case made by Deputy Staunton was that so many things are imported, that we cannot control the price of them and that it was quite unfair to suggest that the Government had any responsibility in this area.  He spoke about tea, vegetable oil and margarine.  I must confess the thought occurred to me that perhaps Deputy Staunton believed that up to February, 1973 we grew all our requirements of tea in this country and produced all our requirements of vegetable oil for margarine.  I do not think he really believes that.  It is simply a question of Deputy Staunton valiantly trying to do his best in the face of an impossible situation.</P>
      <P>This motion in the name of Deputy O'Malley basically contains three parts and I propose to deal with each of them.  The first part states: &ldquo;condemns the Government's total failure to honour its own undertaking of February, 1973 to control and stabilise prices&rdquo;.  The second part &ldquo;notes with deep concern the huge increase in the price of virtually every commodity since 1973&rdquo;.  The third part &ldquo;deplores in particular the major contribution which the Government itself has made towards bringing about in Ireland the highest rate of inflation in Europe which is leading to the gradual destruction of our economy&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> With regard to the first part, the total failure of the Government to honour their undertaking of February, 1973, to control and stabilise prices the Parliamentary Secretary spoke in this debate yesterday.  Unfortunately I did not have the pleasure of being here to listen to him but I read reports of his speech.  As far as I can understand it he made a very fine distinction between the aim that was involved and the promise.  He said that what the Coalition were saying to the people in 1973 during the course of the general election was: &ldquo;It is our aim to stabilise prices but we are not promising to stabilise prices&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Is there any Government which would have as their aim to increase prices?  I wonder what the people of Dublin South-West and Donegal NorthEast will think now when it is explained to them, as no doubt it will be by the honest politicians in the Coalition, that they did not really tell them: &ldquo;We are promising to stabilise prices&rdquo; or &ldquo;We are promising to halt the price rises&rdquo;, which the Parliamentary Secretary may remember was a heading of one of the infamous 14 points.  That was not a promise according to the Parliamentary Secretary.  If it was not, it was so heavily disguised that the people believed it was.  I do not believe there is anybody who would disagree with the first portion of this motion which condems the Government's total failure to honour their own undertaking of February, 1973 to control and stabilise prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <P>The only man with a promise to control prices was Joe Stalin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may recall that some such sentiments were expressed prior to the election of 1973 by people who knew what the score was but they did not include the Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister for Industry and Commerce or Deputy Staunton.  I am speaking of the present occupants of those positions. There was a complete romp throughout the country by Deputies opposite pretending they could and would control prices, stabilise prices and halt the price rises, to use their own words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> What has happened?  We find that the latest recorded figure for the consumer price index for mid-February is the second highest ever recorded in our history.  It is certainly one of the highest at 7.3 per cent.  We also find, on the basis of a recent OECD publication, that so far this year we have had the highest inflation rate of any developed country in the world.  Yet, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, judging by his intervention while Deputy Lalor was speaking feels that to refer to this is a by-election gimmick. No doubt he thought in those terms when he was in Opposition.  One would have hoped that by now, with his experience in office of dealing with these problems, he would realise just how serious the consequences are of the promises he made and his failure, in particular, and that of the Government in general, to implement those promises, that there is a great deal more involved in those matters than a by-election gimmick.  I freely confess that as far as I or any member of this Party can bring this about we will endeavour to ensure that the people who will vote in these by-elections will have brought to their attention what was said by the Government in February, 1973, and what has happened since.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor gave a number of examples of prices.  I will not go over them again, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce had not arrived when he gave them, and he might like to have his memory refreshed. Deputy Lalor was working on the basis of figures up to February or March, but I have figures up to May of this year in respect of certain foodstuffs. In February, 1973, bread was 13.1p, now it is 18p; butter was 27.8p and is now 48p; cheese was 26.4p and is now 72p; eggs were 29.6p per dozen and are now 50p; and sugar was 10.6p for two lbs and now 23.5p.  We all know about potatoes.  Incidentally, the increase in the price of potatoes was the major item in the increase in the cost of living in the quarter prior to the general election of 1973.  I thought the Parliamentary Secretary might have to recall that.  I have just given these few examples of what happened to the price of some foodstuffs <Col N="311" /> under this Government which was to control and stabilise prices.</P>
    <P>There are other items besides foodstuffs. I would like to mention some items in which the price between 1973 and 1976 has doubled, or more than doubled and in one case has almost doubled.  The pint went from 19p in 1973 to 38p this year.  Bus fares from Ballyfermot, Inchicore, Bluebell, Drimnagh and Walkinstown into the centre of Dublin in 1973 were 8p, and now they are 16p.  Petrol was then 36p a gallon and is now 88.3p.  Road tax on a ten horsepower car went from £26 to £50.  Gas per therm went from 19p to 38.64p.  Letter postage went from 4p to 9p per letter. Cigarettes went from 29p to 49p for a packet of 20 untipped.  I do not think anybody can dispute the facts referred to in the first part of Deputy O'Malley's motion that there has been a gross failure by the Government to honour their undertaking and there has been an inordinate increase in the price of virtually every commodity.</P>
    <P>We are, of course, concerned with this enormous price rise.  Everybody must be concerned with it, apart from the gross dishonouring of what was probably the major promise by the Coalition in the last general election. This Government is one of the best Governments, if not the best, we have ever had in the field of excuses.  Of all their performers in that field, I do not think anybody could compete with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He has frequently and at considerable length told us about the difficulties involved, but in particular about the difficulties arising from the energy crisis and world recession.</P>
    <P>We are led to believe that there is absolutely nothing this Government can do, or could have done, in regard to the increase in prices.  Indeed, it has been suggested that this Government, by inordinate borrowing, have cushioned us from the worst effects, by way of inflation and unemployment, of the oil crisis and the recession. It is suggested from time to time that if we were in office things would <Col N="312" /> have been much worse because we would not have borrowed so much.  I do not want to develop that theme at great length, but since this is the major defence we hear from the Coalition, we ought to have a closer look at it.</P>
    <P>In this connection there is a most interesting article in the <i>Economic Review</i> of the Confederation of Irish Industry, No. 1 of 1976.  It contains a short article, with tables attached, written by Dr. Brendan Menton, until quite recently one of the senior economic advisers in the Department of Finance.  It is entitled &ldquo;Irish Economic Performance Since the Oil Crisis&rdquo;.  I do not know whether the Minister has had an opportunity to read this article but if he has not I recommend he read it carefully.  I would like to refer to one or two matters that appear in it.</P>
    <P>Some tables were constructed to try to throw some light on the issue of whether all that is required to reverse the situation in which we find ourselves is a satisfactory upturn in world trade.  For this purpose, certain indicators were taken for 20 OECD countries.  Indicators used are, first, the difference between actual GNP growth and average GNP growth during the 1960's; second, the difference between actual inflation and average inflation during the 1960s; third, the change in the foreign balance from 1973 as a percentage of GNP; and fourth, the change in unemployment since 1973 as a percentage of the labour force.</P>
    <P>What emerges is that the rankings of the countries on the four indicators are worked out.  In every case in which the indicator was worked out, of the 20 countries Ireland ranked last in 1975 and 1976, and in the overall performance over the whole period. The only place in which we did not rank last was in 1974; there we ranked second last.  The greatest contributors to this poor showing by Ireland were the disimprovement in inflation and in unemployment since 1973.  I would like to quote from the article on pages 62-63 of the <i>Economic Review</i> of the Confederation of Irish Industry, No. 1 of 1976:</P>

      <Col N="313" /> ...Ireland had the worst economic performance of any of the countries studied despite the fact that it was not one of those countries most open to the adverse effects of the oil crisis (as estimated by the OECD).  Nor is there any suggestion in the results that either the size or dependence of foreign trade of the countries examined made them particularly vulnerable to the crisis.</P>
    <P>The message is clear enough.  Not all the blame for our current economic situation can be ascribed to the oil crisis and the world recession. Poor economic management is the other obvious contributory factor.</P>
    <P>That is an article written by a man who, up to recently, was the senior economic adviser in the Department of Finance.  The figures and tables on which that conclusion is based are contained in that booklet and they make extremely interesting reading. They also demolish the case that has been made time after time by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his colleagues to justify, or attempt to justify, their inept and incompetent performance in the field of prices and inflation and in the field of economic management generally because it is almost impossible to separate economic management from prices and inflation.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the third part of this motion which is the Government's own contribution to this appalling rate of inflation.  The motion described it as the highest in Europe but, as I have said, a recent publication of the OECD shows that it is the highest of any developed country in the world.  I say it brings us to that because the contribution made by the Government to inflation is intimately connected with their unbelievably poor attempts at managing the economy.</P>
    <P>The facts are that in every budget introduced by this Government, except that of June, 1975, about which I will speak in a moment, substantial increases in taxation were imposed. Outside of those budgets very substantial increases in prices were imposed or sanctioned and in the case of petrol a very substantial increased <Col N="314" /> tax was imposed.  In all the areas directly under the control of the Government there have been inordinate increases in prices and I have mentioned some of them.  There were the postal charges, the telephone charges, the increased cost of TV licences, increases in bus fares and the contribution to social welfare by workers and employers.  All of these matters are directly controlled by the Government.  When we look at what has happened there we find that in almost all of the cases the increase involved under this Government has been greater than almost any other increase attributable, say, to the private sector, whether the portion of the private sector involved was affected to a greater or lesser degree by imported inflation.</P>
    <P>Of course, this was a consequence of the Government's whole approach to the management of the economy and to the problems that beset the economy.  The problems are always there but they were considerably aggravated by the energy crisis and the recession in world trade.  No speaker on behalf of Fianna Fáil has ever attempted to suggest that there were not large-scale problems arising from those factors.  What we have said was, first, that before there was any energy crisis things started to go wrong and that almost all the economic indicators showed a down-turn from the middle of 1973. Furthermore, when the energy crisis and the world recession occurred, the performance of the Government in dealing with them was inept and incompetent. Figures given in the article by Dr. Brendan Menton prove that beyond yea or nay.  As compared with any of the other countries with which one would think of comparing our performance, we come out worst. That is not a coincidence.</P>
    <P>In this debate I think it right to concentrate on what the Government did in regard to price increases in relation to their effect on the economy generally.  Here we come to something I have never been able to understand. I have sought explanations from different members of the Government but no rational explanation was forthcoming and I doubt if <Col N="315" /> any rational explanation can be given.  The following is just a limited example and, with more time, it could be expanded considerably.</P>
    <P>In January, 1975, the Government introduced a budget.  By itself the budget was responsible for increasing the cost of living by 4 percentage points. They did this despite the fact that for some months previously we had been urging strongly that instead they should reduce the consumer price index or at least hold down the increase in the index by subsidies and changes in VAT rates.  They did not listen and introduced a budget that increased the cost of living by 4 percentage points.  They did this on the eve of negotiations for a national pay agreement knowing that they were about to take place and the inevitable happened.  By the way, it is not as though all of this were something new to the Government.  We told them at the time that the national pay agreement was coming up and we told them what the effect of what they were doing would have.  The national pay agreement was negotiated on the basis of that additional increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>In June, 1975, the Government introduced a budget in which they did what we advocated.  However, the effect was to bring us back to square one, to bring down the cost of living by 4 percentage points.  If they did it the first time, the overall increase would have been 4 percentage points down instead of which it was 4 percentage points up and this need not have happened.  That was carried right through the national pay agreement, not just for the public service where it was enormous but right through the private sector.  In January, 1976, we got a budget which increased the consumer price index by approximately 5 percentage points, again, just in advance of negotiations on a national pay agreement.  I cannot give a rational explanation for this and I have heard none from any member of the Government.  It is so totally irrational that it defies any explanation but what it adds up to is either gross ignorance or gross incompetence in the handling of our economy and, in particular, in the handling of the effect <Col N="316" /> of price increases on our economy and on pay and incomes.</P>
    <P>If nothing else had happened it alone would be sufficient justification for this motion in the name of Deputy O'Malley which condemns the Government's total failure to honour their own undertakings of February, 1973, and is also deploring the major contribution of the Government to our appalling inflation rate, so much worse than our competitors who have been facing the same problems as we have been facing, some have even greater problems, arising out of the energy crisis and the recession in trade in the world in general.  I believe the amendment in the name of the Parliamentary Secretary is only a joke.  We are being asked to approve the measures taken by the Government to control prices and charges for goods and services.  I believe I could be forgiven for saying in terms of what the Minister for Industry and Commerce was saying in early 1973, what control of prices, what control of the charge for services?  As regards the subsidies on certain essential items we asked the Government to do that long before they did it and they did not do it when they should have done it.  When they brought in the subsidies they were simply bringing back the position to what it was, creating an unnecessary expense for the whole economy.  All of this adds up to ample justification for this House to condemn roundly the incompetence and ineptitude of the Government in their handling of price control and all that goes into that which is very complex.</P>

      <P>It is necessary to start off by setting the record straight in what purports to be a factual statement in Deputy O'Malley's motion. The crucial gravamen of it is that as a result of Government action the rate of inflation is now the highest in Europe and that it is leading to the gradual disruption of our economy. The statement that the rate of inflation is the highest in Europe is capable of verification or of disproof.  If it is true, of course, it is very serious <Col N="317" /> and damaging but if it is not true&mdash; it is put down in the name of the largest political party in this House with, presumably, as many Members as are available to vote for something which is not true and extremely damaging&mdash;that is much more serious. We can try to find out whether the statement is true or not by reference to sources other than Irish sources.  I am not going to give airy references; I am going to quote the publication, the date and the page because this is a serious issue and it deserves to be treated, by election times notwithstanding, in serious terms.</P>
      <P>The place I am referring to to find out about Europe's inflation rate is the publication of the OECD which comes out monthly and is called <i>Main Economic Indicators</i>.  I should like, first, to refer to the most recent such publication available, the issue of May, 1976, which officials of my Department dated 25th May.  I want to make a comparison from that about, firstly, the inflation rate since 1970 in the UK and in Ireland and then I want to give the table of inflation rates which is the most recent one we possess.  I propose then to give it for 1973 and to discuss the change in Ireland's place in the inflationary table since 1973, specifically since February, 1973, because I believe that is relevant.  What emerges is that the inflation rate&mdash;taking 1970 as 100&mdash; in February, 1973, in the UK had gone from 100 to 123 and in Ireland, taking 1970 as the base year, it had gone to 126.  Over that three years Ireland was inflating faster.  We will talk in a moment about the highest inflation rate in Europe in that context. The increase between February, 1973, and February, 1976, which is the most recent time for which we have figures in Ireland, extremely serious as it was here in that period, was an increase of 63.7 per cent while the increase over the same period in the United Kingdom, for identical dates, was 66.6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conclusion from those figures, If I may turn aside for a moment from the statistics and draw a conclusion, is that in the period 1970 to 1973 we were inflating faster than the <Col N="318" /> UK but in the period 1973 to 1976 we were inflating slower than the UK.  We can be more precise than that.  I want to refer now to the <i>Main Economic Indicators</i> for April, 1973, to page 27 of that publication and the table at the bottom of that page for consumer prices.  The most recent column of figures is for February, 1973.  The countries given are the appropriate OECD countries for that time, among which is Ireland.  In the column for February, 1973, there are two countries&mdash;I give this to the Opposition&mdash;inflating faster than Ireland at that time, Iceland, which has a very peculiar economy and always has extraordinary figures, and Turkey, which is not a European country in the ordinary sense.  Of the rest in February, 1973, we were the fastest then at the end of a period of 16 years and the difference between the British rate then and the Irish rate was that the British were 2.1 per cent less than us; they were 7.9 and we were 10 per cent.  They were a lot lower than us. We were the fastest in Europe in February, 1973.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to indicate some other figures for the period since then.  In the period February, 1974, to February, 1976, the increase of all items in Ireland was 43.7 per cent while the increase of all items in the UK was 47.3 per cent.  Again taking another period, going up to the most recent time for which we have figures, UK inflation passed ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke about the league table a minute ago, as to where inflation was fastest in February, 1973.  Let us now take it from the same source, the <i>Main Economic Indicators</i> of May, 1976, the most recent OECD publication we have.  The fastest in Europe is still Iceland but we have dropped from being after Iceland.  We have been overtaken by Portugal at 22.8&mdash;that is for the 12 months rate of change&mdash;by the United Kingdom at 21.2.  New Zealand is not included.  We have <Col N="319" /> been overtaken by Finland at 16.3.  We are down to 16.1.  When we came into office we were 2.1 per cent faster than Britain and the fastest in Europe then.  Now we are 4.1 per cent slower than the UK and we have been overtaken by a number of countries.</P>
    <P>How does one take seriously criticism from people who apparently do not know that?  They do not know that at the end of their period we were the fastest, that we are not now and that our place in the rank has improved. They are foolish enough, in the formulation of a resolution, to attribute to us something that was true in their time and which we inherited and which is not now true.  This is serious. One does not know whether something as foolish as that is due to incompetence or dishonesty and, if one surmises both, it is impossible to work out the mix.  If it were the case in 1973 and is not now the case, how can the second half of the proposition be true? It was true then after 16 years of the Opposition in government and it is not true now: yet, it is alleged to be due to our action.  There was a profound neglect of the inflation situation. I was interested to hear Deputy Lalor refer to his time because, not alone did he not do anything about it, but he did not seem to know about it, did not seem to remember, or, perhaps, he did not know when he was there three years ago.  He certainly did not know now.</P>

      <P>What is so interesting is that having got the facts basically wrong about the relative inflation performance and apparently not knowing or caring to find out what the situation was when the Government changed, we have projections of an extremely damaging kind from Deputy O'Malley.  In the period 1970-1973, and I could give the figure for 1963-1973 if that helps to nail it down more, we were inflating faster than the UK.  In the period since then, due to the actions of this Government which people are so pleased to deride, we have been inflating slower than the UK and the UK is the most important country because it represents half our trade and it is close to us.  With their performance over their period in office and by us in our period, suddenly, to be helpful, Deputy O'Malley decides that the projection for the coming year is that we are going to inflate twice as fast as the UK.  I do not take seriously as being researched&mdash;I think it is trivial&mdash;what he had to say but it is valuable in two ways, as expressing an attitude of mind on the part of the Opposition and as having an effect on the economy.</P>
      <P>The attitude of mind is quite clear: if at extremely difficult times when people are working to the limit of their strength to keep exports going out and to keep investment funds coming in, if the largest party in the country say that the Government have brought about the highest inflation rate in Europe it is extremely damaging although, of course, it is not true. Why would one invent something that is demonstrably untrue?  With regret, I say there is only the classic explanation of the dog in the manger: the Opposition is not now governing and a small number of its irresponsible members, who are unfortunately in important spokesmanships, are apparently determined to do the greatest damage they can in the belief&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pass on to the other part of the sentence, to analyse the results of the attribution of the highest rate of inflation in Europe to us which, says Deputy O'Malley, is leading to the gradual destruction of the economy.  There are two statements there, first, that Ireland has the highest rate of inflation in Europe.  This is not true; it was true a little over three years ago but it is not true now and it is very damaging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> Then he says it is leading to the gradual destruction of the economy and, of course, to have someone with his experience alleging that the economy is being destroyed, is also very damaging.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the bye-election pressures, and leaving aside what the Opposition think of the Government, there are a large number of people involved in keeping the economy going.  I do not want to spend time repeating details of economic performance&mdash;reference has been made to some of them&mdash;but a few days ago we did have the pleasure of referring to the export performance: one-and-a-half billion pounds, 50 per cent increase in under two years, 10 per cent volume increase in the same period, much more per capita exports than the UK, a trend better in Ireland in regard to these exports than in any comparable countries.  The Opposition may hate comparisons with comparable countries, but it is a fair thing to do.  To say, in that context, that there is a gradual destruction of the economy is unfair and damaging to the people doing that.</P>
    <P>It must be obvious at a time like this that there are two things that are supremely important, one is to keep exports moving out and the other is to keep investment at the level it is and, hopefully, going up.  Actions which, for the sake of party political advantage, damage those things are of course foolish and dog-in-the-manger. They are also, I think, profoundly unpatriotic at a difficult time.</P>
    <P>This is a broader motion than simply a question of the consumer price index.  It relates to the management of the economy and in the Dáil comment by Denis Coughlan in today's <i>Irish Times</i> there is a very interesting summing up of almost everything the Opposition say:</P>
    <P>The time hallowed right of the Opposition to change economic horses in mid-stream was availed of by Fianna Fáil in the Dáil yesterday as Deputies complained of the amount of public borrowing while advocating more aids to industry, agriculture and social services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> This is the classic dilemma in the assault of the Opposition which in these difficult times really cuts very little ice because what they say continuously is: &ldquo;Spend more but tax less&rdquo;.  Elastic pounds, smaller when you collect them, bigger when you distribute them.  But pounds are the same size when you collect them and when you distribute them.  You cannot stretch them.  It is not the quality of the pound to be like that.  It is the same size each time.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the list of strictures of Deputy Colley in regard to price increases in those areas the Government control.  He mentioned postal charges, telephone charges, TV licences, bus fares, social welfare contributions. Now the choice there is to subvent more public money to subsidise these things, or to have economic price structures, or a mixture of both.  If you want to keep down price rises you can, of course, dismiss a lot of people.  Is Deputy Colley assaulting the efficiency of all of those structures, CIE, RTE, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, built up over the years when the Opposition were in Government?  Which way do you do it?  Do you want to spend more?</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley said if Fianna Fáil had been in office they would not have borrowed so much.  Why?  If they had not borrowed as much how would they have avoided passing on those price increases?  If you are not going to borrow as much then you cannot subvent and, therefore, you have to let economic prices come through. That is an inescapable dilemma.  If you want to spend more you must tax more or borrow more.  If you are not prepared to tax more or borrow more you cannot spend more and it is the failure to resolve that problem that has made the Opposition's economic attack continuously ridiculous.</P>

      <P>We had nothing but this sort of twiddling around with figures by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and we are very honoured that he came in at all because he has nothing to do with prices; he pushed it over to Deputy Bruton who spoke yesterday.  I took notes of what he had to say last night and you would nearly feel embarrassed referring back to them.  The motion which is proposed to be substituted for the motion which is in my name reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the measures being taken by the Government to control the prices and charges for goods and services, and to subsidise the price of certain essential items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Approves the measures being taken&rdquo;. Since 1973, when Deputy Lalor left the Department of Industry and Commerce, there has not been one line of legislation in relation to this matter.  You would think prices were not a problem at all and that the legislation that was passed back in the sixties and early seventies, when inflation was a minor problem in this country, was quite adequate to deal <Col N="328" /> with the situation today.  For the first time in the three years and two months they are there we were told by the Parliamentary Secretary last night: &ldquo;We are bringing in new legislation.  We are going to have on-the-spot-fines in supermarkets&rdquo;.  Is it the girl at the checkout that is supposed to pay them?  There was another major announcement last night, that the notices in pubs will have to have letters 2.5 centimetres high, an inch high, so that people can read them without putting on their glasses.  These are now, in the words of the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment to this motion, &ldquo;the measures being taken by the Government to control the prices and charges for goods and services&rdquo;&mdash; letters an inch high in pubs and on-the-spot-fines for girls in supermarkets.</P>
    <P>There was no effort by the Parliamentary Secretary to say that he intended to impose price controls on drink, which is in a chaotic situation and where the price of a pint, to my own knowledge, can vary in this country from as low as 35p&mdash; if you will excuse the phrase &ldquo;as low as 35p&rdquo;&mdash;to as high as 49p.  As I pointed out yesterday, prices have now such a low priority in the estimation of this Government that a member of the Government is not even responsible for them any longer and the statutory functions in relation to them have been passed over to the most junior Parliamentary Secretary who is attached to this Government and who has also to deal with a whole lot of educational matters, bus services, and many other matters in the Department of Industry and Commerce as well.  I am not making any personal criticism of him, but if prices were regarded today by the Coalition Government in the same light as they were regarded in February, 1973, when they promised time and time again between then and polling day that there would be no more price rises after the accession to Government of the Coalition, if they were as important now as they were then and as they were believed then, we would not have the situation that even a <Col N="329" /> member of the Government does not bother to have anything to do with prices.</P>
    <P>I set out at some length last night the general views of the National Prices Commission regarding their functions, the limitations on their functions and what was necessary to secure control of prices and inflation. In their November, 1972, report they said:</P>
    <P>Inflation will not be curbed or stopped by deploring its symptoms.</P>
    <P>that is, price increases</P>
    <P>Its pace will be reduced only by attacking its causes in so far as these lie within the control of the Irish community.</P>
    <P>In page 12 of the March, 1973, report they set out the six prime causes of inflation and, consequently, of price rises. I dealt with each of those in detail last night and I dealt with them not just as the prices commission had then dealt with them but in a current context. I showed what could be done and what should have been done over the past few years, and in particular I showed what will be done by the Fianna Fáil Government that will be returned after the next general election. Of those six causes of inflation, far and away the most important over the past three years has been under the heading &ldquo;increases in indirect taxes&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy come back to the highest inflation rate in Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Increases in indirect taxes, as I demonstrated last night and as Deputy Colley demonstrated this evening, led in January, 1975, to a 4 per cent increase in the consumer price index, and immediately after that the national wage agreement had to be concluded, and it was concluded in the light of that unnecessary 4 per cent. Then, after the national wage agreement was concluded, the 4 per cent was taken off by the introduction of subsidies in the June, 1975, budget which we had advocated as far back as October and November, 1974 should be done.  But the harm was done by this appalling increase in indirect taxes, the next heading, number 4, is increases in <Col N="330" /> money incomes, and they were driven up unnecessarily.  They themselves caused a further spiral in the whole inflationary process.  One would have thought that the Government would surely have learned their lesson after the mess they had made of things in 1975.  But what did they do?  On the 28th January, 1976, they introduced a budget which increases the consumer price index by 5 per cent, and then in March a national wage agreement has to be negotiated and, of course, it has to be negotiated in the light of the fact that, apart from any other increases that may take place, the Government deliberately and as a result of their own action on the 28th January, 1976 have forced up the cost of living by 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>How can a Government who act in such a lunatic fashion expect workers and the trade unions to moderate their demands?  How could any trade union or any group of workers be expected to accede to the calls that were made in the early part of this year by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance for a pay pause, a pay freeze?  Because of these deliberate price increases &mdash;5 per cent in itself and perhaps another 4 or 5 per cent from the indirect effect it has on other things, driving up prices still further&mdash;they are driven to looking for much bigger increases in wages than they need have looked for if they had been given proper leadership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there would have been a wide acceptance early this year of a pay pause for a reasonable period if the Government were not, in the very same breath that they were asking for that pay pause, going out of their way to drive up prices and costs and to force workers, whether they wanted to do it or not, to ask for more and more wages.  Without any doubt, the major part of the inflationary spiral in which tragically we find ourselves today is caused by this Government and their policies.  The view of various economists which I quoted last night is that at the moment imported inflation accounts for only 20 per cent of our inflation and that domestic factors, entirely within the control of the Government, account for 80 per cent.  That <Col N="331" /> is not being disputed because it cannot be disputed.</P>
