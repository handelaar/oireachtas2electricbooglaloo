      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach and Minister for Defence</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £100,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1976 for retired pay, pensions, compensation, allowances and gratuities payable under sundry statutes to or in respect of members of the Defence Forces and certain other Military Organisations, etc., and for sundry contributions and expenses in connection therewith; for certain extra-statutory children's allowances and for sundry grants.</P>
      <P>The main Estimate for Army pensions for the financial year ending on 31st instant was for a net sum of £12,305,000.  The supplementary Estimate which I am now introducing is for an additional sum of £100,000. This Supplementary Estimate comprises £226,000 for pensions, allowances, and compensation plus £65,000 for increased grants in respect of free travel, offset by increased appropriations-in-aid of £6,000 and savings of £185,000.</P>
      <P>Under subhead B&mdash;wound and disability pensions and gratuities, and so on&mdash;an additional £126,000 is required to meet the cost of new disability pensions including arrears, of former members of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
      <P>Under subhead D&mdash;Military service pensions&mdash;an additional £71,000 is required.  When the PAYE tax collection system was introduced this year, many pensions which were previously paid quarterly became payable monthly instead.  The changeover means that the October, 1976, and November, 1976, warrants for these pensions will fall for payment this year instead of next year and provision is being made for the additional sum involved.</P>
      <P>Under subhead G&mdash;Compensation for death or personal injuries sustained by members of the Local Defence Force&mdash;an additional £3,000 is required.  This is due to underestimation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> Under subhead H&mdash;Special allowances under the Army Pensions Acts &mdash;an additional £20,000 is required. Accurate estimation of the numbers to be catered for under this heading is not possible.</P>
    <P>Under subhead L&mdash;which provides for special compensation by way of lump sum in respect of members of the Forces whose disability or death is due to service with the United Nations&mdash; only a token sum of £10 was provided in the Vote.  An expenditure of £6,010 is expected.  This would leave a deficit of £6,000.  Amounts payable under this subhead are recoverable from the United Nations.  The £65,000 under subhead M&mdash;free travel, electricity and television licences&mdash;is necessary because of increased cost of bus and rail fares.</P>
    <P>The adjustment in subhead O&mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;represents contributions by officers towards the contributory pensions scheme for widows and children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Estimate because it refers to people who have received payment from the State for disabilities and so on.  Our responsibility does not end on presentation of a paltry sum.  Much more must be done for these people.</P>
      <P>I should like to read a letter which I received this morning in relation to pensions:</P>
      <P>A few years ago the Minister for Defence in a gesture of goodwill authorised the payment of army pensions before Christmas instead of on the 31st December.  This year, as you know, with the price of things it is going to be much harder to manage.  Would you in your capacity as Opposition spokesman try to persuade the Minister to do likewise this year?  I am a pensioner, unable to work, with a wife and two school-going children, and I would appreciate your efforts.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this matter and to make payment of pensions before Christmas, if at all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the estimate, we <Col N="388" /> cannot measure the service given or the lives of these people in terms of pounds and pennies.  We are talking about men whose lives have been disrupted because of disabilities received during service.  We are inclined to write-off their disabilities as occupational hazards.  The major factor is the problems of the families of army personnel.  The men concerned are all of unquestionable loyalty and have played their part to ensure that we can live without fear and intimidation. It is sad to think that their families have been overlooked.  People who receive diability pensions are a special group and require special attention.  I appeal for new thinking in relation to these people.  We should not feel that we have dispensed with them as the barrack gates click behind their heels.  When a person receives a wound or disability he is unable to do much more than to move around the house, and the future of his family must be considered.</P>
    <P>Recently the Fianna Fáil Party produced a discussion document which gave attention to this aspect.  I want to indicate that they had a section to provide that people discharged from service with service-connected disabilities would be compensated in some way and the hardship relieved.</P>
    <P>No one will disagree with this Army pension estimate.  It is sad to think that in many cases the compensation is too small.  We would all like to increase these services.  The after-care service of the individuals concerned and the welfare of their wives and children are vitally important.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to outline some thought that should be given to this problem.  People discharged from service because of service-connected disability of one type or another should get educational assistance after service in order to ensure that they can fit themselves in some way for the life ahead.  It is sad to think that when no opportunity is open to them they can be pushed into a wheelchair or a room.  We must give them hope for the future.  They should have the opportunity of doing continuation courses so that if they want to pursue <Col N="389" /> the educational studies that might have been disrupted by the service disability they should have these courses.  Some responsible employers are taking on people who are disabled, and ex-service men should have assistance from the Department to enable them fit themselves for interviews and for employment.  Educational loan facilities should be available to these people so that they can pursue courses leading to professional and vocational qualifications.  There should be correspondence courses for them if they are unable to participate actively in other courses.  There are many men with service disabilities who would be willing to pursue in some way educational courses which could enable them to relieve the situation they are placed in.</P>
    <P>It is important that the widows or wives of disabled ex-service men can avail of these services.  They have to provide for the children when the father is disabled and cannot do so.  If the wife becomes the breadwinner the Department must ensure that she has the wherewithal and the necessary aids and backups to ensure that the family who may have been deprived of opportunities because of their father's disability may now be provided with the opportunities.  These opportunities must be provided to the wives of ex-servicemen with total or partial disability.</P>
    <P>Finally, for eligible ex-servicemen a system of vocational rehabilitation should be available to those with disabilities who too often are forgotten, but who can be vital to the community. They have knowledge, and there are various sections of Government where this knowledge can be utilised to the benefit of the community as a whole.  Prior to training, suitable vocational counselling should be available.  Suitable tuition and training should be provided to put these people on the right road to rehabilitation. We should not cast these people aside as we have done in the past.  It is sad to see many of them cast aside for so long without reference to their family needs or wants, to see members of their families deprived of opportunities because of <Col N="390" /> the service disability of these men.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that additional thought is given to this most deserving section.</P>
    <P>In relation to the wound and disability section, the period for claiming allowances or pensions is up to two years after service at home and up to seven years after service with the United Nations.  This is an area we should examine.  Many of the diseases stay dormant for years, particularly tropical diseases, and many people who contracted TB during Army service have found it impossible to pin the matter down when released from service.  Men who served with me and with other Members of this House have been deprived of institutional or other service and of consideration by the Department of the claims they have made.  An extension of the period is necessary and desirable. Some diseases may take some years to develop and to become chronic. Establishment of proof is the vital factor and one which we should be concerned with, not determining a date.  These limits are too harsh on occasions.  I ask the Minister to consider an extension of those periods so that justice will be done.</P>
    <P>I impress upon the Minister the need for an examination of military service pensions to members of the Defence Forces.  We know that when a serviceman dies, NCO or man, his widow receives no pension whatsoever. After his lifetime of service to the nation, having moved around the country from station to station, being away on border duties, service abroad, the great loss of social life and the unsocial hours the widow has had to adjust herself too while he was on service.  She gets no compensation. Again she is thrown over to another Department for refuge, the Department of Social Welfare, perhaps, or some health authority.  Some portion at least of the man's pension should be paid to the widow.  I hope that this matter will be considered in order to ensure that this very deserving section, the widows and families of deceased members, would get this necessary attention.</P>
    <P>I would apply the same measures to <Col N="391" /> the widow of an ex-serviceman as I would to the wife of an ex-serviceman in relation to educational facilities which should be available to her in order to ensure that her family would be maintained and have the opportunities they would have had, had their father lived.  Many of these men have laid down their lives.  A man with service of 23 or 24 years is entitled to a pension and if he dies at that stage the pension dies with him.  No one has availed of it and his widow gets nothing.  I hope there will be some examination at an early stage in order to ensure that justice is done.</P>
    <P>Relating to pensions in general, I hope there will be a re-examination of the system to see whether the qualifying period could be reduced from 21 years to a lesser period of 18 years or so.  This is realistic in modern times when the pension is so small and when people have to make their way in the world.  If a person could ease himself out on pension at an earlier stage he would then be in a better position if they want to maintain themselves and their families with any degree of respectability. The qualifying period should be reduced so as to give this opportunity.  It might have many further advantages for the services as a whole in relation to the efficiency of personnel, and men would not have to remain there for the other two, three or four years just because they want to get a pension.  I hope the situation will be examined in the near future and from time to time.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive review of the pensions scheme for NCOs and men should be carried out.  There should be an overall study of the pensions scheme for all ranks with a view to achieving equity and removing anomalies.  When an officer dies, his widow gets up to 50 per cent of his pay at the time of death if she has four children.  The soldier has not the same opportunity of making a contribution as the officer does.  The officer's widow is looked after.  The wife of a private or NCO is just as important.  She has the same responsibilities and problems.  It is hard to think that one section are cared for even though they make a <Col N="392" /> contribution, while others are disregarded. I am quite sure the personnel would be happy to make a contribution to ensure that their families would be protected in the event of their death.</P>
    <P>When a person is promoted to NCO he must have that rank for 12 months before he is entitled to the pension for that rank on retirement.  Once a person is promoted, that promotion should stand to him and he should be entitled to a pension at the higher rate just as he is entitled to pay at the higher rate. I see no difference.  An adjustment must be made in this area as soon as possible to ensure that justice is done. It is sad to think that a person can be promoted and then lose that advantage when he retires.  I hope this matter will get the early attention of the Department.</P>
    <P>The whole question of pensions is complicated and needs to be reviewed. Very few people can discuss army pensions. The whole system is so confused and complicated that one would need to be an expert to discuss it in a rational way.  It is far beyond me and many other people in this House.  On the question of compensation for personnel of the defence forces who are killed or injured, the position seems to be very loose.  There is a reference to the Local Defence Force.  Does the same system apply to the FCA?  Is there a distinction between the FCA and the Local Defence Force as indicated in subhead G?</P>
    <P>What is the position in relation to compensation for injuries sustained by members of the FCA on training or at local parades?  Training parades are weekend parades and local parades are evening parades.  What is the position in relation to treatment?  If a person meets with an accident he may get free hospitalisation in one of the military hospitals, but no pay.  If he has to convalesce for a period he gets no pay. This is serious.  It should be automatic. He should be either on the payroll or not on the payroll.  He should remain on it while he is disabled.  He should not have to go to a solicitor to extract a settlement.  This issue needs to be reexamined with a view to achieving parity with the position of a person in <Col N="393" /> the permanent defence forces who is unfortunate enough to meet with an accident.</P>
    <P>Subhead G deals with a very weak section of society.  It is sad to see how the Department and Governments deal with them.  We were told recently that there are 2,218 people with less than £5 a week.  We were told they are incapable of self-support by reason of age or permanent infirmity and there is a means test.  This is very complicated. It is sad to think these people are sometimes humiliated when they look for their entitlement.  Recently in reply to a question asked by Deputy Meaney the Minister for Defence said:</P>
    <P>Each case is taken on its merits and, therefore, there is no such thing as a fixed upper income.  I could help the Deputy by telling him that in years past there have been very great relaxations.  That means that anyone who is near the stage of being in want will get a special allowance.  We disregard in full increases in the various social welfare benefits since January, 1969.  As from 1st October, 1964, the first £60 of military service pensions, disability pensions and Connaught Rangers pensions have been disregarded in the case of applicants under 70 years of age and the first £30 where the applicant has reached 70 years.  The increases granted in such pensions since August, 1965, are also disregarded.  The value of the labour of children under 18 years of age, the first £50 of gifts in cash from brothers or sisters or from children at home are disregarded. The assessment of the means of children under 18 years of age has been relaxed and all social welfare payments in respect of children are disregarded.  The assessment of the profit from the contributions of members of the family over 18 years of age who are living at home has been relaxed and no profit is assessed on a contribution of £7.70 per week in a rural area or £8.20 per week in an urban area.  That is not really an upper limit, but it is the figure where the income coming into the house is disregarded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> Deputy Brennan said:</P>
    <P>While I agree with the Minister's assessment for special allowance disregarded social welfare payments, Social Welfare do not disregarded his increases.  They will reduce an old man's pension.</P>
    <P>The Minister agreed that they would reduce an old man's pension.</P>

      <P>May I dissuade the Deputy from giving lengthy quotations and from getting into detail on this Supplementary Estimate which would be more appropriate to the Estimate proper when we come to debate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>We might never reach that estimate, and I want to show how complicated the situation is for a man who is regarded as being incapable of self-support by reason of age or permanent infirmity.  He is told that that is the basis on which the assessment is made.  In one respect it is factual but, on the other hand, the Department of Social Welfare come in the back door and take it from him.  I want to show how confused the whole situation is. It should be simplified and a person should be able to know his exact situation in relation to his pension.  It is very sad to think that so many of these men have less than £5 a week.</P>
      <P>The scheme should be updated and it should conform with the rate of inflation.  If the means test were removed, money might be saved on the administrative cost of investigation. A special establishment should be set up to deal with this all-important matter.  Special consideration should be given to people who are incapable of self-support by reason of age or permanent infirmity.  These people served the nation well in the dark and difficult days.  They are very old now and they have suffered considerably.  We should reward them adequately for services rendered to this nation in difficult times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> Special attention should be paid to the special allowance group to ensure that they can live in reasonable comfort at the end of their days without inspector after inspector calling, and problem after problem confronting them as to whether they have rooms or lodgings, whether they were given a gift by a son or daughter or whether they have television.  If these factors are taken into consideration justice will not be done.  I hope we will get some indication from the Taoiseach that positive steps will be taken to deal with the question of special allowances.</P>
    <P>Subhead L deals with special compensation for members of the forces serving with the United Nations.  I am not quite sure what is involved but I expect that the people concerned are entitled to this benefit.  The particular incident in this case is not mentioned. Possibly we will have an opportunity to discuss the matter at a later stage if an Estimate comes before the House.</P>
    <P>Subhead M deals with grants in relation to free travel, electricity and television licences to certain veterans of the War of Independence and to civil servants of the first and second Dáil. This matter should be considered more closely.  The free travel booklet should be interchangeable between husband and wife.  The situation has been that wives cannot avail of free travel unless accompanied by their husbands. Many of the veterans are in hospital and their wives must pay all their travelling expenses when they go to visit them. We should consider abolishing this restriction on free travel.  It is ironic that if the husband dies in hospital the wife can then use the free travel facility because she is a widow.  A sense of realism should be brought into this matter so that justice may be done.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to associate myself with the Taoiseach's remarks with regard to the service personnel.  I hope some of the points I raised will be examined to ensure that recipients of pensions get a fair deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on behalf of military service pensioners.  The pensions given to <Col N="396" /> these people during the years were insignificant&mdash;sometimes they were as low as £5 per annum.  Although there is much lip-service given by different Governments regarding these people they have not done very much to help them during the years.  I know that occasionally an increase is granted but generally it is insignificant.  If they have any other income they must pay tax on their military service pension.  It is time that we treated the remaining survivors of those who fought for independence in a decent manner and gave them a substantial rise every year.</P>
      <P>The same should be done for the widows of the veterans.  They are completely forgotten and no provision has been made for them in any legislation. In Dublin St. Bricin's Hospital is used by pensioners but from what I hear there is only a limited service available. However limited it may be, surely the people in Cork, Waterford and Limerick are entitled to the same service and I would ask the Taoiseach to look into this matter.  The widows and children of the men without whose services we would not be sitting here today have been treated very badly by every Government.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to take an interest in this matter and to provide in a better fashion for the few survivors of our fight for freedom.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach and Minister for Defence</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of matters have been raised and the particular points will be examined in detail.  As Deputy Dowling said, the matter is complex and somewhat involved.  The question of a contributory pension scheme for NCOs and privates of the permanent Defence Forces is at present under examination, but it is not by any means a simple matter.  As the House is aware, soldiers are fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts and on discharge are eligible for the benefits available under those Acts.  Deputy Dowling raised the question of paying certain pensions before Christmas.  He did not identify the cases but if he will supply me with particulars I will have the matter examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as special allowances are concerned, the means test has been progressively <Col N="397" /> relaxed during the years and now it is far from severe.  I note what my friend, Deputy O'Sullivan, said with regard to the veterans.  The service at St. Bricin's Hospital has been availed of on a regular basis and I think it has been satisfactory to those concerned. Cards have been issued to a considerable number who were entitled to avail of the facilities there and I understand they are doing this.  The facilities are available to those who have the cards. This service has proved beneficial and has been generally welcomed by pensioners.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister tell us why the increase in salaries, wages and allowances is required?  In <Col N="398" /> other words, the Estimate did not provide for the sums involved.  Presumably, one of the reasons is that the Estimate for salaries, wages and allowances was based on an assumption which turned out to be erroneous in regard to pay increases but there could also be an element of increased staff involved.  I would appreciate if the Minister would indicate if that is so.</P>
      <P>Travelling and incidental expenses apparently relate to sums required for advertisements and certain office equipment amounting to £55,000. Would the Minister elaborate a little more on what is involved in that? Why is there an additional £24,000 required over and above the estimated sum of £534,000 for the management of prize bonds and external loans? An outline explanation is required from the Minister in relation to that.</P>
      <P>In regard to the National Savings Committee it appears that the sum involved here is required to recoup the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in respect of the salary of staff on loan to the committee.  May I take it that what is involved here is the additional increase in salaries due to those individuals which would be in the same category as the first item of £34,000 under subhead A.1?  I would appreciate if the Minister would indicate if that is so?</P>

It will be dealt with under the heading of Remuneration, Vote 51.  If, as in this case it is necessary to move a separate Supplementary Estimate for a Department that Supplementary Estimate will carry the additional remuneration in respect of that Department. All we are left with in Vote 51 is the residue after Supplementary Estimates for individual Departments, where they arise, have been moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean that where a Supplementary Estimate is needed for some other purpose the opportunity is taken to <Col N="399" /> provide for the increased remuneration and any that do not come into that category are lumped together in the other one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  In the main, we are dealing here with the interim national agreement.  The House will recall that the budget was prepared on the basis of having a pay pause throughout 1976 and, therefore, provision was not made for all the additional remuneration which arose consequent on the implementation of the interim agreement.  That sum has to be made up by individual Supplementary Estimates or the Remuneration Vote.</P>
      <P>There is also an addition in respect of salaries.  Under the costs involved in the introduction of PAYE we estimated it would be necessary to recruit some staff for a short period but in the event, because of additional problems, it was necessary to retain staff for a longer period to do the peak load of work involved in the changeover from one system to another. Some of the staff who were deployed temporarily have since been referred elsewhere and some are still retained. We have, however, been able to effect a saving on the salaries side by the introduction of three computers and the additional sum of £55,000 under travelling and incidental expenses is in a large part attributable to three computers and the accompanying softwear. There has been a saving of nearly £10,000 on travelling so that the main burden of the addition is attributable to the computers, which is a long term economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The addition under subhead D in respect of management of Government stocks arises in the main because of the fall in the value of sterling.  Some of the expenses in relation to the management of Government stocks are payable in Deutschemarks and other hard currencies such as the US dollar. Under national savings, subhead F, the additional £7,000 is due to the necessity to recoup the Post Office for increases in the salaries of staff on loan to the committee.  It is attributable to reasons similar to those I outlined <Col N="400" /> in respect of salaries and is applicable also to Vote 51, Remuneration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for those explanations.  There is one other matter I would like to elaborate on, that is the additional sum of £24,000 in respect of management of Government stocks.  I regret, as I am sure the Minister does, the necessity for the payment of a supplementary sum because of the falling value of the £ and the necessity to pay some of these commitments in harder currencies. Could the Minister indicate why there should be an additional sum required for the management of prize bonds?</P>

If one could be assured that there would be no further closures of the said institution there would be no reason at this stage to consider taking the matter from the Bank of Ireland. One must seriously consider, in view of all that happened in the past, if we should not take steps to avoid that risk recurring in the future.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1976, for certain miscellaneous expenses, and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, I am sure purely coincidentally, something of an irony in the two items involved in this Supplementary Estimate.  The first one relates to legal expenses of the Minister for Local Government arising out of a tribunal of inquiry into certain allegations affecting him.  The second relates to the interim cost of the domestic establishment at Aras an Uachtaráin consequent on the resignation of President Ó Dálaigh.  In my view the Government acted quite wrongly in regard to the allegations made against the Minister for Local Government.  I say quite wrongly because before the motion setting up the tribunal of inquiry referred to here was even moved in the other House, a very full apology had been given by the two Deputies concerned and, in addition, a complete withdrawal and retraction of the allegations made was placed on the record of the House.  We made this point at some length before, when we considered that the Minister for Local Government and/or his colleagues were looking for their pound of flesh. It now appears that it is the taxpayer who will have to furnish that pound of flesh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever view one might take of the case I put forward&mdash;and it is certainly possible to take the view expressed then by the members of the Government that this tribunal was necessary, although I could never see it myself, what has happened subsequently and which is the matter referred to in the second item relating to Aras an Uachtaráin establishes another standard altogether.  We have a totally different standard applied by the Government when it comes to that situation. In that case, while there was an apology, there was not and never has <Col N="402" /> been up to this day, a withdrawal by the then Minister for Defence or by the Taoiseach or, to my knowledge, by any other member of the Government of the allegations made against the then President.  Those allegations were that the President had acted improperly in referring for determination of its constitutionality to the Supreme Court the Emergency Powers Bill and that the then President could not be relied upon to defend the institutions of the State and that the Army would have to be relied upon.  None of these allegations has ever been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Yet when allegations were made against a member of the Government but were withdrawn fully and a full apology made in the House, that was not good enough.  The Government persisted in going ahead with the tribunal of inquiry and now we are asked to agree that the taxpayer should be obliged to pay the sum of £1,800 as legal expenses of the Minister for Local Government involved in that charade of a tribunal.  I believe I am entitled to call it a charade.  I might not have been prior to the incident that led to the second item here, the incident arising out of the statements of the then Minister for Defence in relation to the then President. When one sees the reaction of the Government to that situation and the continued and persistent refusal to withdraw the allegations then made, with all the consequences that have flowed from that, and when one compares that with the attitude adopted in relation to the Minister for Local Government and realises that it is the taxpayer who is being asked to pay for this indulgence in seeking the pound of flesh or of soothing the ego of the Minister for Local Government, one is entitled to cry halt and to say that, if we apply to that incident the standards the Government sought to apply and have applied to the incident related to the Minister for Defence at the time and the President at the time, there is no justification at all for the taxpayers being asked to pay the legal expenses of the Minister for Local Government arising out of a tribunal which was inquiring into allegations which had then been withdrawn and <Col N="403" /> for which a full apology had been made.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour this point unduly, but if it were in order one might be tempted to describe this imposition on the taxpayer of the legal expenses of the Minister for Local Government in defending himself against allegations which had been withdrawn and for which he had received a full apology in the terms used by the then Minister for Defence in relation to the other matter.  I will not do that but I object strenuously to this waste of public money.  Whatever argument might have taken place as to whether or not it was a waste prior to the incident between the then Minister for Defence and the President there can be no room for argument now having regard to how that was handled.  If the members of the Government still feel strongly that in all the circumstances, despite the full apology and the full withdrawal, the Minister for Local Government was entitled to have a tribunal set up to inquire into these allegations, they might have a whip around among themselves and pay the £1,800 involved and not ask the taxpayer to pay for this salving of the ego of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pity that Deputy Colley should have indulged in the outburst that he engaged in this morning.  It does this House and the office of the Presidency no service.  The sad events which caused the establishment of the tribunal of inquiry might best be forgotten, particularly by the Opposition, who were responsible for the establishment of that tribunal by reason of the allegations which were made in the first instance by Deputies Molloy and Crinion and, secondly, by the tardiness on the part of Deputies Molloy and Crinion to give an unreserved withdrawal and apology for having impugned the conduct of the Minister for Local Government in discharge of his ministerial duties.  It is a very serious matter, indeed, to allege that the Minister in discharge of his official duties as a Minister allows personal interest and financial interest to <Col N="404" /> colour his decisions.  When a charge of that kind is made against any officer of the State or any employee of the State, it is proper that the State should defend and, if necessary, bear the cost of defending such a person.  That is what the Government did in this case.  These costs could well have been avoided had Deputy Molloy and Deputy Crinion been men enough to give evidence before the Committee on Procedures and Privileges and make an apology before that Committee, which met on 2nd and 3rd July, 1975.  But Deputy Molloy and Deputy Crinion chose not to do so. On 4th July the Resolution was moved in Dáil Éireann by the Taoiseach as head of the Government, who had the clear obligation in the public interest to have the allegations inquired into and it was only at that stage, when Deputy Molloy and Deputy Crinion saw they could no longer avoid answering for their conduct, either justifying it or being found guilty themselves of misconduct, that they made a belated attempt to wipe the slate clean.  But, even then, there was room to doubt the sincerity and fullness of their withdrawal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister say that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that because Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann were of the same view and felt the withdrawal was less than full and did not establish the total innocence of the Minister for Local Government who had been, not on one occasion but on a number of occasions, despite his own denials, vilified by both Deputy Crinion and Deputy Molloy.  Dáil and Seanad Éireann decided a tribunal should be established and that tribunal vindicated the Minister for Local Government.  It was a proper expense because government in Ireland, leaving aside personalities, was being vilified and government in Ireland has been vindicated as being properly run.  It was essential in the public interest that that should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the second item, the interim cost of the domestic establishment at Aras an Uachtaráin, I <Col N="405" /> would point out that, following the resignation, the presidential salary and allowance were not paid during the interregnum and there is a nett saving to the State.  But nobody would question the propriety and, indeed, the necessity of continuing to engage the domestic establishment at Aras an Uachtaráin during the period in which there was in fact no President. Normally such staff are paid out of the President's allowance but, there being no President, clearly funds had to be made available from some other source and there was, therefore, a need for a bookkeeping exercise, as it were, in regard to a separate item to meet the cost of the domestic staff at Aras an Uachtaráin during the interregnum. As, however, the presidential salary and allowance were not paid the gross cost is not that of £1,500.  I think no useful purpose would be served by my expatiating on the situation but, since Deputy Colley reopened the matter, I propose to pursue his remarks in regard to the resignation of the former President only in so far as to say there are different views held sincerely by many people regarding the action of the former President following the words spoken by the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no denial that an unqualified, unreserved and full apology was made by the Minister for Defence immediately after he had uttered the words and he did not repeat what was not an allegation but an expression of his opinions in regard to the conduct of the President. He did not repeat it, unlike Deputy Molloy and Deputy Crinion, who repeated their allegations of gross misconduct against a Minister of State.  Not only did the Minister for Defence give an unqualified apology but so also did the Taoiseach in the name of the Government and on no occasion has any member of the Government or any supporter of the Government attempted to justify and neither have they repeated the original views expressed by the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley regarded both these <Col N="406" /> items here as ironical.  I do not regard them as ironical.  I regard them as most unfortunate and this the kind of expenditure that should certainly be avoided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister apparently justifies the expenses arising in connection with the tribunal on the basis that there was not a full withdrawal of the allegations against the Minister for Local Government and, since he failed to specify in what way it was not full when invited by me to do so, would the Minister now say at what stage and by whom were the allegations made against the former President withdrawn?</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £950,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1976, for pensions, superannuation, compensation (including workmen's compensation), and additional and other allowances and gratuities under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1963, and sundry other statues; extra-statutory pensions, allowances and gratuities awarded by the Minister for the Public Service; fees to medical referees and occasional fees to doctors; compensation and other payments in respect of personal injuries; etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main Estimate for superannuation and retired allowances for the financial year ending on 31st December, 1976, for a nett sum of £9,100,000. The Supplementary Estimate now being introduced is for an additional sum of £950,000.  The further expenditure arises mainly because of, first, an increase in the number of retirements, especially of persons retiring voluntarily between the ages of 60 and 65; secondly, an increase in the number of married women retiring who are qualified for updated marriage gratuities; thirdly, an increase in the number of retirements under the non-established pension scheme following the announcement in the middle of the year that the retirement age was being reduced from 70 to 67 years; and <Col N="408" /> because, fourthly, no provision was made in the original Estimate to cover expenditure arising from the pay increases on 1st August, 1976, under the interim national pay agreement.  The Estimate was prepared, as the House will understand, at the end of the year 1975, and the 1st August, 1976, increase could not have been foreseen then.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to the marriage allowance is that those becoming entitled to it have up to two years after marriage in which to decide whether to resign and take the marriage gratuity.  The value of the gratuity is based upon their earnings at the time of exercising the option, which means that if there are increases during that two-year period the gratuity they receive is correspondingly greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to refer briefly once again to the situation of the pre-1968 civil service widows.  The Minister is, I know, very familiar with that situation. Could he indicate whether any further consideration has been given to this problem having regard to two things: (1) that the numbers involved, of necessity, have been reduced in the past few years; and (2) that there was a proposition being put to the effect that those who would participate would buy their way into the scheme? I understand that arrangements have been made to enable them to borrow the necessary money from the bank. Could the Minister say whether it would be feasible at this stage to do that and whether their buying their way in, as distinct from simply having the scheme extended to them, and the reduction in numbers would have a worth-while effect from the actuarial point of view on the cost which was estimated originally in the actuarial report which I had commissioned and which the present Minister received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the people concerned are very deserving of the best consideration <Col N="409" /> we can give them.  They have a sense of grievance.  That sense of grievance is heightened by various cases to which they can refer occurring after 1968 in which, in effect, the widow of a civil servant was given an option.  I know there are explanations for this which make the situation different from what it appears in most cases anyway.  Nevertheless, I can see quite clearly that the bulk of these people feel they are being discriminated against and that certain individuals have been fortunate enough to get the kind of rights they have been seeking for quite a number of years.  I believe an effort should be made to devise a way of extending the full pension scheme to the widows in question.  It should be possible, having regard to the diminishing numbers, as I said, and the assessment of the cost of their doing so and buying their way in, to reduce the cost to the Exchequer.  However, in the main, what I want to know is whether further consideration has been given to this whole problem since the matter was last referred to in the House and, if so, with what result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The actuarial survey of the widows' and children's scheme to which Deputy Colley referred was commissioned to ascertain the cost of conceding the claim and also to determine the adequacy of the existing rates of contribution to the scheme.  That report showed that the capital cost as at 31st December, 1972, of bringing existing and future <i>ex gratia</i> pensioners of the civil service alone up to the level of the contributory pension was £7,353,000.  This could have been met by increasing the existing contribution rate from 1½ per cent of pay to 2¾ per cent.  The staff associations were invited to participate in making such a contribution but they refused to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of the current annual rate of expenditure on <i>ex gratia</i> pensions in the public service as a whole, including the civil service, doubling the rate of <i>ex gratia</i> pensions as requested would entail an extra annual charge of £3 million.  In addition, if it were granted it could stimulate claims by other groups for compensatory concessions. <Col N="410" /> For example, members of the contributory scheme might seek a reduction in their contributions or, indeed, the abolition of their contributions because they would see little point in making contributions towards a pension when other people could get equal benefits without making a contribution.  Therefore while one has every sympathy with individuals whose personal family fortunes could be affected by not having as great a pension as others, one has to bear in mind the very serious consequences which would be likely to arise if the <i>ex gratia</i> payments were to be as generous as those to which other people contributed.  Quite clearly no decision can be taken in relation to this matter except in the overall budgetary situation, and therefore it would not be appropriate for me to anticipate what the budget might or might not contain or what future change, if any, might be made in the non-contributory scheme.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £4,134,300 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1976, for Remuneration.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required to meet the cost of pay increases on nine Votes.  The Votes concerned are set out in part 3 of the Supplementary Estimates which cover the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Revenue Commissioners, the State Laboratory, the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests, the National Gallery, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Department of Defence.  The amount sought is required to meet the following increases: the cost of the interim national wage agreement, 3 per cent plus £2 per week, subject to a minimum payment of £3 or a maximum of £5 with effect from 1st August, 1976; the cost of abolishing sex discrimination in the public service, with effect from 1st January, 1976; the cost of increased employer social welfare contributions, effective from 5th April, 1976, and the cost of certain minor special pay increases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1976, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies, grants and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is needed in order to provide additional funds for some of the services operated by my Department or organisations for which I have responsibility and arising from commitments and circumstances which could not have been foreseen when the Estimates <Col N="414" /> were prepared originally.  The details are as follows:</P>
    <P>Consultancy Services&mdash;The sum of £25,000 provided for under this subhead is required to meet the additional cost arising from the employment of consultants in connection with the negotiations in regard to the purchase of shares in the Bula mine.</P>
    <P>Travelling and Subsistence&mdash;The additional £40,000 sought under this heading arises principally from an increase in travelling by the Department's inspectors, mainly on price control duties.  It also reflects the additional costs which arose from increased air fares and subsistence and mileage allowances.</P>
    <P>Institute for Industrial Research and Standards&mdash;The additional grant of £40,000 which I am proposing in this case is for administration and general expenses.  This sum is required to enable the institute to meet the cost of their pay commitments arising from the implementation of the interim national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>Subscription to International Organisations&mdash;In addition to the sum of £50,000 already provided for subscriptions to international organisations, a further £86,000 is required. This additional provision is intended to cover the cost in 1976 of Ireland's subscription to the European Space Agency under an interim agreement which covers the period up to the coming into full operation of the Convention relating to the agency; the convention would become fully operational following ratification by member countries.  The subscription entitles Ireland to participate in the agency's educational documentation and future projects and technical research activities.</P>
    <P>Benefits are expected to be derived in the form of industrial contracts to industry, universities and research institutions as well as providing access for Irish scientists to a broad range of the agency's scientific and technical information and services.  As the House is aware, I dealt with this matter in detail yesterday when seeking approval for Ireland's signing of the interim agreement with this body.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> Córas Tráchtála&mdash;This year's Estimate provided £3.350 million towards the Grant-in-Aid for Córas Tráchtála, who now require an additional £225,000.  Following a very difficult period in which Ireland felt the full effect of the worst economic recession Western Europe has known since the Second World War, there are encouraging signs of a return to growth in our economy.  Exports in the first ten months of 1976 amounted to £1,491 million and on the assumption that this trend will continue they will, by the end of 1976, have reached an estimated £1,790 million, an increase of 24 per cent over 1975 and representing an almost threefold increase in value since our accession to the EEC.  This would be equivalent to a growth rate of about 4 per cent in volume of real terms.</P>
    <P>Overall growth in export earnings in 1975 derived mainly from the agricultural sector while exports of manufactured goods decreased somewhat in volume terms.  In 1976 the main impetus of increasing exports is once more coming from industrial exports, which in the first nine months of this year are estimated to have accounted for about two-thirds of total exports.</P>
    <P>This encouraging position is a reflection of the determination and initiative of Irish industrial exporters, but it has not been effected without extreme pressure on the financial resources of Córas Tráchtála, who, conscious of the limitation on the availability of public funds in present economic circumstances, have curtailed their assistance programme in order to keep their supplementary requirements to a minimum.  Nevertheless, the £225,000 now sought represents the minimum needed to enable Córas Tráchtála to meet the cost of providing an effective service to exporters throughout 1976.  Of the £225,000 now sought, £120,000 is needed to offset the effects on CTT operations of the devaluation of sterling and a further £80,000 is to ensure the maintenance of the existing level of export activities planned for 1976. The balance of £25,000 is to pay the cost of implementing the 1976 Interim National Pay Agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> I am confident that Deputies will agree that there should be no diminution of the assistance and encouragement to be afforded to our exporters.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny Design Workshops&mdash;The estimates for the current financial year provided £300,000 towards the Grant-in-Aid for the Kilkenny Design Workshops Ltd., who now require an additional £9,000.  This additional sum is needed to cover the cost of implementing the interim national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>Industrial Development Authority&mdash; The original allocation to the authority for administration and general expenses was £4,500,000.  An additional £300,000 is required to meet salary increases as a result of the interim national pay agreement&mdash;&mdash;£50,000&mdash;as well as the increased cost of advertising, promotion and marketing, provision of new offices in Europe and promotional literature, incurred mainly overseas as a result of inflation and adverse movements in exchange rates&mdash;£250,000.</P>
    <P>Industrial Housing&mdash;I propose to include a new provision for £600,000 for industrial housing.  This is a provision necessitated by a decision of the Government to transfer to the Industrial Development Authority the responsibility formerly carried by the National Building Agency for the provision and financing of industrial housing for new industry.</P>
    <P>Since sanction has not been given to the authority to use money for this scheme out of their voted capital resources it has been found necessary to introduce a new subhead under which the authority will be given a voted repayable grant for this project.</P>
    <P>Technical Assistance&mdash;From 1st January, 1976, the rate of grant in respect of a consultancy scheme or study visit abroad was reduced from 50 per cent to 33? per cent of the estimated cost of the consultancy scheme or study visit.  Also a limit of £10,000 in respect of any one consultancy project was imposed.  In the light of these alterations in the administration of the technical assistance grants scheme and having regard to the usual period of time which it was expected <Col N="417" /> would elapse between the approval and payment of grants, it was estimated that a sum of £370,000 would be adequate to meet payments under the scheme in 1976.</P>
    <P>However, over the past 11 months the time between approval and payments of grants has shortened with the result that grant payments have arisen, or are expected to arise in 1976 which had not been expected to arise until 1977 at the earliest.  The net effect is that it is estimated that an additional £110,000 on the original estimate of £370,000 will be required to meet payments falling due before 31st December, 1976.</P>
    <P>Shipping Finance Corporation Limited&mdash;This subhead provides for the payment to Shipping Finance Corporation Limited, which is a subsidiary of the Industrial Credit Company Limited, of an interest subsidy of the difference between the rate at which the corporation borrows and the rate at which they finance the construction of vessels at Verolme Cork Dockyard.</P>
    <P>The extra provision of £40,000 is necessary to meet the increased expenditure arising principally from the increase in the Exchequer lending rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent which led to a resultant increase in the interest subsidy on shipbuilding loans.</P>
    <P>Bread and Flour Subsidies&mdash;Consumer subsidies on standard bread and household flour were introduced by the Government in July, 1975.  The subsidisation of these products has resulted in higher consumption than was expected when the scheme was introduced.  The cost of these subsidies, originally estimated at £10,750,000 for bread and £1,750,000 for flour, for the full year 1976, is now likely to amount to £14,000,000 and £2,125,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that in the present difficult economic situation consumption of staple commodities such as bread and flour has tended to increase.  Among other factors consumption of standard bread has been affected by the high price of potatoes and, probably, by a swing <Col N="418" /> from fancy breads, which are unsubsidised, to subsidised standard bread.</P>
    <P>Additional sums of £3,250,000 for bread subsidy and £375,000 for household flour subsidy are required to meet the increased cost of these subsidies during the current year.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the increased expenditure is £5,171,000 but there is an offset of £5,170,990 in savings made up of £2,085,990 on subhead I.2&mdash;Industrial Development Authority; capital expenditure on grants to industries&mdash;£3,000,000 on subhead T &mdash;Investment in mining concerns&mdash; and a surplus of £85,000 from Appropriations in Aid.  I should mention however that the saving on the IDA capital expenditure does not mean any falling off in the authority's level of activity in providing grants for industry but is merely a deferment in the payment of grants for industry because some had not reached payment stage within the year due to technical problems.  The saving of £3 million on investment in mining concerns arises from the fact that the findings of the board of consultants who were employed to assess the value of the Bula mines were not available in time to involve any payments in the current year.  Accordingly, the net amount required is £10.</P>
    <P>I have explained briefly in the case of each subhead the reason for the increased expenditure but I am, of course, prepared to expand on these explanations if Deputies consider this necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has moved a Supplementary Estimate in respect of no fewer than 16 different subheads.  The Supplementary Estimate, which runs to four pages was circulated to Deputies this morning and the House is expected to deal adequately at perhaps one-and-a-half or two hours' notice with these 16 items of enormously varying character. This is just not feasible.  I fear it is another example of the farcical procedure to which we are reduced in this House.  We come in here at the end of a financial year and in a <Col N="419" /> matter of minutes vote vast sums of public money without any proper examination of what is involved.</P>
      <P>To give a brief explanation of the various items involved the Minister had to make a long speech.  He was extremely brief on each of the items.  It is unsatisfactory that I or any other Member of this House should be handed these papers at half-past ten this morning.  The Department must have known that a detailed supplementary estimate would be put forward and they should have communicated with us in advance, indicating the nature of the estimate and the topics to be covered.  I want to register my protest in regard to this situation because there is no supplementary as complicated and detailed as this one. There are 16 different subheads in this Estimate.  We are supposed to discuss these subheads and to satisfy ourselves that this money should be voted.  It is not possible to do it and we might as well face that fact.  We are only going through the motions of complying with constitutional requirements.</P>
      <P>As there are many Estimates for discussion today, I propose to be brief in relation to this one.  The Minister dealt with 15 subheads under which he is looking for money but he omitted to deal with subhead J.3&mdash;Shannon Free Airport Development Company housing subsidy.  We are being asked to vote an additional £71,000 for housing subsidies at Shannon Free Airport. Does the Minister know the position in regard to housing at Shannon airport? There are many empty houses there for which the company cannot get occupants.  They advertised these vacant houses in all the mid-Western newspapers but they have not had many takers.  They have large hoardings on the main roads, advertising the advantages of living at Shannon.  So far, they have not been very successful, and we are now being asked to vote £71,000 towards that situation.  I do not understand why we should be asked to vote for a substantial amount of money for housing at Shannon when there are many empty houses there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are over 800 families on the housing list of Limerick Corporation, which is only 14 miles <Col N="420" /> from Shannon, and many of them will not be housed within the next five years.  They are living in the city in over-crowded and miserable conditions. Many people who live in good houses at Shannon have asked me about the possibility of getting houses in Limerick city, but I have to advise them that their chances of being housed in Limerick city are nil.  When they are asked why they want to leave Shannon they say they would prefer to live in bad conditions in Limerick than in good conditions in Shannon.  The houses at Shannon were provided for workers at the estate, but a lot of them are occupied by people who have no connection with the estate or with the airport.</P>
    <P>This matter needs to be explained. The money for which we are being asked to vote should properly be given to a local authority with a housing problem, such as the Limerick Corporation, which is the nearest major centre to Shannon airport.  As there are so many vacant houses in the area at present I do not know why extra moneys have to be voted.  Perhaps it is to make up for the fact that the houses are empty and that there is no income from them.  For some reason the Minister did not refer to this matter in his speech.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, I have already raised the matter of the advice which was given by this Institute to a firm in County Cavan.  It is now acknowledged that the advice was wrong.  Unfortunately, the firm acted on the advice and suffered hardship as a result.  I would ask the Minister to consider the consequences of the advice given to that firm by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  It seems that the firm is now on the point of closing.  During the last week they have had to let a number of their employees go.  I do not want to create any embarrassment for the IIRS, but the Minister should consider assisting this firm.</P>
    <P>I noted with some interest that the Minister is seeking here a further £3¼ million in respect of bread subsidy for which the original estimate appears to have been very inadequate. <Col N="421" /> It is disturbing to note what the Minister says in relation to the consumption of bread, that it is now increasing. One always was under the impression that as a country's standard of living increased the consumption of bread decreased, and this was so here over the years.  It is so in every other country, and this is an eloquent indication that over the past year or so the standard of living in this country is dropping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">
      <NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
      <P>How about the population increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The population increase is not sufficient to warrant a 33? per cent increase in the subsidy.  I do not think our population increased by 33? per cent since last January.  It may have increased by perhaps 1 per cent.  Most of that 1 per cent are not consuming bread yet.  It is a thing that one would like to go into more fully if time was available, but it is an extraordinary situation that, after a very prolonged drop over a very long period of years in the consumption of bread, for the reasons given by the Minister we now have a reversal of that tendency and a marked increase, apparently, this year in the consumption of bread.</P>
      <P>There is a figure of over £5 million which is not being spent in this year's Estimates.  This relates to IDA capital grants, which is a bit surprising in one sense but I suppose not in another sense.  Possibly the demand for the grants is not there.  The £3 million which was set aside for investment in mining is not being spent at all and apparently no investment is being made.  The Minister has referred to the fact that no investment has been made in this present year in Bula mines.  I suppose one is entitled to discuss the Bula mine operation, but we have had little over an hour's notice of this Supplementary Estimate. I do not have available now the various facts and figures with relation to that, but I could have had them had I got reasonable notice of this Supplementary Estimate and of the fact that the question of the Bula mines was going to arise on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand from my reading <Col N="422" /> of the newspapers, the report of the consultants who were employed to advise the Government in relation to Bula has been available for some time past.  It has been referred to in the newspapers over the past six weeks or two months, I think.  I do not know the exact date when it became available, but one would have thought if the investment was being made it could have been made in this year.  I do not know what the reason for the delay is.  One is entitled to question in general terms the whole approach of the Bula mining company.  The fact that the Government are buying their way into a company who spent absolutely nothing in finding the assets which they now have suggests that there is something wrong there. The moral entitlement, surely, in relation to that whole area is with those who spent the money and took the risk in finding the assets.  It seems extraordinary that the taxpayer in this country now has to buy into something which was basically his own, and to buy it from somebody who has it purely by chance and who did not in fact find it and contributed nothing to finding it.  Perhaps we could consider the wisdom of this method of operating.  The whole Bula case has unfortunately left a bad taste in the mouths of those who might otherwise be exploring for minerals in this country.  Is some future prospector who makes a find of mineral wealth going to find himself in the situation that a quarter or a third or half of whatever it is of what he finds is going to be operated by a private company who are quite independent of him? Is this not one, at least, of the major reasons why the level of exploration for minerals in this country at the moment is way below what it could and should be?</P>
    <P>The only figures that I am aware of and that I have talked about in relation to Bula have been those that appeared in the papers which were, as far as I know, the official figures. I do not think that the Minister has made any official statement in regard to what is proposed or what moneys are going to be paid.  He should avail of this opportunity now to do this and put the House and us fully in the <Col N="423" /> picture so far as the State's proposed investment in this company is concerned.</P>
    <P>He should also tell the House whether it is proposed, for example, as part of the arrangement with Bula to insist that they would take steps in conjunction with the various other interests concerned towards the establishment at the present time in this country of a smelter.  It seems that the Navan mine is going to go into production early in 1977.  Even if it were decided early in 1977 to build a smelter, it seems that it would be four to five years before that smelter would be ready.  The loss to the country in the meantime is enormous.  It also seems that the size of the smelter that is being talked about would take only a comparatively small proportion of the output from the two mines in Navan as it apparently is going to be, one of them being Tara and the other Bula.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if the Minister could deal with these questions.  I know, unfortunately, it is in appropriate to deal with them now because there is a whole string of other Estimates waiting to come on which are just as important as this.  If he could briefly indicate the position in regard to these matters, it would be appreciated.  There is too little official information and too much speculation and leaking, and so on. One might be foolish to try to base any assessment on that of the future of these mines.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with two or three or perhaps four of the 16 subheads dealt with here.  I cannot deal with any more because it would take too long.  I got an hour's notice of this huge and complex Supplementary Estimate, which I think is wrong from the point of view of this House, and from the point of view of the voting of public money.  This system will have to be changed in some way.  I know this Supplementary Estimate is for £10 only but because of the non-expenditure of a very large amount, the actual money being looked for is around £5,000,000.  It has to be dealt with in a way which is slipshod and unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> The same applies to the other Estimates, except that they are not as complicated.  In the main they deal with one or two subheads and this has 16.  There are about 12 other items I should like to deal with, such as Coras Tráchtála which should be debated in this House, and industrial development policy generally which I would welcome an opportunity to debate.  I would very much like to debate the Kilkenny Design Centre and a whole long series of other things.  I cannot deal with them because of the circumstances and in fairness to the House and my colleagues.  I will conclude by saying I should like the Minister, however briefly, to deal with the various points I have raised.</P>

      <P>Although it may not be totally in order, a Cheann Comhairle&mdash;and you will guide me on this&mdash; I should like at least to respond to what Deputy O'Malley has said about the method in which we do our business here in regard to these Estimates. First, I can tell the Deputy from my side that it is no particular source of joy or pride for me to be debating these things in this brief way.  Secondly we have an agreement between the Whips.  That is what I understand.  I may be wrong about it.  I responded at very short notice to a wish to debate this today.  We have done bundles of Estimates near to the legal limit.  We did them in the last week of the Dáil previously, and this is a week ahead. I am sorry.  I think genuinely it is not fair to Deputies on any side of the House.  I have not had more warning and I was trying to facilitate people also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say this in reply to Deputy O'Malley.  In the fairly recent past in this House, I have heard things which seemed to me repetitive and timewasting. We are seeing a continuing and inescapably increasing burden of Dáil work.  We have tried to get some of it off into committees.  It needs the goodwill of all sides of the House to see the work is done expeditiously and to see that time is not lost on things which might be moved quite quickly and which are not of enormous importance. When the Deputy says this is unsatisfactory and that we should not <Col N="425" /> go on in this way, I can only say I agree.  That is a perfectly correct observation.  I feel the same way about it.  The responsibility is not entirely on one side of the House.</P>
    <P>I will take up some of the points made by the Deputy in the order in which I made notes.  First on the matter of SFADCo houses.  I do not want to indicate that any major mistake has been made.  I am not making that criticism.  There was a difficulty because many of these houses existed for some considerable time and, indeed, before I had any Ministerial responsibility for them.  There were projections about the growth of Shannon which were optimistic because people did not foresee&mdash;and there was no reason why they should&mdash;the downturn coming in the world economy and in overseas investment.</P>
    <P>When you are building something new, as distinct from an existing town with hundreds of years of history of development, it is possible, when you have major changes in economic circumstances, that the provision of houses and the provision of jobs do not match up and they have got out of line.  This £71,000 extra is accounted for in a number of ways. It is not creating anything new.  These are subsidies on houses which exist. There is a certain minimum subsidy which is, in fact, the difference between the economic rent, as calculated on the basis of the total cost of the provision of the house, and the rent payable.  In addition, there is a hardship subsidy which can arise in cases of loss of employment or bereavement. There is a graded rent subsidy, and there is also a vacancy subsidy.  This arises in the context where houses are built and not filled.</P>
    <P>The position was estimated in October before ten-month figures were available.  Even then the company thought £290,000 for the full year would be the amount.  The amount is now based on ten-month actual figures and two-month estimates, and that is the £321,209 which I mentioned.  Apart from the range of subsidies I talked about, there are £10,000 worth of bad debts for 1976. This is a matter for concern.  Perhaps it is easy with hindsight to see that <Col N="426" /> errors of judgment were made, but perhaps it was hard for people having to make decisions about the rate of the provision of houses in balance with the rate of the provision of jobs. That got out of line.  Perhaps it is easier to criticise that with hindsight than to have been able to intervene to prevent it at the time.  While I regret an increase in the amount of subsidy required, we have no option in the existing circumstances but to do this.</P>
    <P>With regard to the IIRS, Deputy O'Malley referred to a particular firm. He has asked me at least one Parliamentary Question about that in the past, and Question No. 16 on today's Order Paper relates to it and we will be dealing with it at Question Time. We will have a serious discussion on it then.  I can only say I do not agree with the formulations he used in connection with it.  I want to put that on the record.  We will talk about it at Question Time.</P>
    <P>In regard to the bread subsidy, again if an estimate is wrong by that magnitude, if you estimate for 12 odd and you need another three that, of course, is a serious estimating error. There are two things Deputy O'Malley did not mention which are very relevant in this context.  Of course there is an element in what he said.  Of course there is an element of hardship for people in a recession if real wages do not grow.  That is certainly part of the reason why bread consumption was higher than expected.</P>
    <P>There is another major reason which I think, on reflection, he will see is a serious one.  Due to drought and due to some speculation on a European scale, there has been a very large rise in the price of potatoes.  In calory intake we are the biggest eaters in the world.  We have always had a good deal of starch. Traditionally we have eaten potatoes. This year they were relatively much dearer than in the past, and relatively dearer in relation to bread and, in some circumstances, actually scarce.  That caused a switch to bread which is reflected here.  In fairness to the people who made the estimate, that was not foreseeable at the time they did it.  The other point is that the subsidy is for the standard loaf, not for fancy bread. There is a switch in bread consumption <Col N="427" /> away from fancy bread into standard bread which exaggerates the increase.  If one were to think that the increase in the Estimate was a reflection in strictly proportional terms of the increase in bread consumption&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Fancy bread is consumed to a lesser extent now because it is not subsidised whereas the standard loaf is subsidised.</P>
      <P>The IDA are managing tens of millions of pounds each year and their efficiency is generally testified to.  Firms want to be paid quickly on completion but it is not possible to dole it out beforehand.  There is always the question of matching completions.  Firms are paid along the road as the jobs are done.  There is one particular case&mdash;just one site&mdash;which amounts to £2 million out of the £5 million where they will not be ready in 1976 for technical reasons and they will have it in 1977. There is a very welcome increase in the demand for IDA money, and the pipeline is filling up again in a very welcome way.  There were technical reasons why the companies were not able legally and validly to claim the money in 1976 and it is carried over into 1977.</P>
      <P>With regard to the £3 million for mining, the same circumstances apply. This had to be available this year if necessary.  We have received the report to which Deputy O'Malley refers.  This is a large expenditure and it is receiving careful and thorough scrutiny but the question of payment will not arise during this financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to Tara and Bula.  I inherited a scene of great confusion and chaos which I think fundamentally existed for the legal reason that some of the minerals in Ireland are clearly in the hands of the State and some are in private hands.  I did not wish for, design or manoeuvre the break-up of a single ore body.  I am sorry it happened that way.  I faced a situation that was extremely complex from the legal point of view, where the highest court in the land decided that this portion of the total ore body was <Col N="428" /> in private ownership.  I have had people working very hard on a very complex situation.  I would regard it as unthinkable that this House would give us power retrospectively to take something away from people if when they bought it it was <i>bona fide</i> in private ownership.  It is unthinkable that retrospectively we should expropriate them when they bought them, very cleverly but nonetheless with the understanding that these were private minerals, and where the courts subsequently validated them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are not buying into something that was our own.  It could not have been made our own by any kind of legal process that either side of this House would endorse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly something I do not feel pleased about.  I am sorry it happened in that way but I had to unravel something that was in a desperate mess.  Of the private minerals, the Bula minerals, we received onequarter for nothing and it is well to make that point.  The purchase which is contemplated is for a further portion. It was not something that was our own, unlike the publicly owned minerals of the Tara mines.  That is the essential difference, and it is well to remember it.  It does leave a bad taste, and there was a piece of very considerable financial manipulation and cleverness involved, but one must make the distinction between minerals in public and in private hands.  We must recognise that we could not take it away retrospectively once the courts had held as they had done.  It was necessary to get production going.  All of us want to see the show on the road and production coming out.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley asked that this be debated more fully, and I would be very happy to do so. It was a complex situation but I think we are coming out of it in a way that will see production.  It is not a perfect way because it was a very messy situation but in my view it was the best possible solution and I would be very happy to have it scrutinised by the House and to defend in detail every step we took.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Supplementary Estimate.  It arises because no action was taken in the current year and there has not been any expenditure. All the normal mechanisms are available to the House for debating any of these matters.  The Deputy knows that during the period of office of this Government the opportunity has been given to the Opposition to debate matters at much greater length than was ever available to me when I was on that side of the House. It is widely utilised and that is as it should be.  We have a freer discussion of matters at greater length with much more opportunity for the Opposition to raise them and to have them answered than existed when the Opposition were on these benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the smelter, exactly the same observations apply as I made about Bula.  Some 12 months of detailed work is necessary in matters of such complexity, but I have indicated to the House that this period will end towards the beginning of the new year and I will be in a position to make some statements.  The lead time on projects like this is enormous and the expenditure in terms of jobs created is absolutely horrendous.  One <Col N="430" /> can spend 20 times as much on a smelter job as on a new industrial project.  If one does not match up the subsequent use of the smelter product with the smelter metal one could put a huge amount of money into something where the return on jobs is quite small.  I would beg people not to believe that a smelter <i>per se</i> without the downstream development is a bonanza.  It is not.  It can gobble up money and energy for a quite small return.  It is part of a complex development.</P>
    <P>To suggest that we should have undertaken hard financial commitments before we were clear about the legal position as to when mining would start would be to commit money wrongly.  To suggest that we can produce this instantly when long lead times are known to be the norm is to suggest something impossible. Further, to suggest that there are heavy losses because we do not smelt and because we export the concentrate is not an accurate reflection of the economics of our production.  When I am in a position to make firm decisions I will inform the House and I will be happy if the House avails itself of the normal procedures for discussion, more generous now than heretofore.  I will answer all questions as fully and as carefully as I can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1976, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education (including Institutions of Science and Art), for certain miscellaneous educational and cultural services and for payment of sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimates are required in the following Votes:</P>
      <P>Vote 29&mdash;Office of the Minister for Education,</P>
      <P>Vote 30&mdash;Primary Education,</P>
      <P>Vote 31&mdash;Secondary Education,</P>
      <P>Vote 34&mdash;Higher Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of two of the four Votes, only token Supplementary Estimates are involved.  These are Vote 29&mdash; Office of the Minister for Education and Vote 30&mdash;Primary Education. The necessity for the Supplementary <Col N="432" /> Estimates in the case of Vote 29 arises from the need to obtain parliamentary approval for an increase in the provision in Grant-In-Aid subhead A4 for Bord an Choláiste Náisiúnta Ealáine is Deartha.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the token Supplementary Estimate for Vote 30&mdash; Primary Education&mdash;is in connection with the opening of an additional subhead C9&mdash;Grants towards the cost of painting of schools.  The additional amounts required for the relevant subheads in Votes 29 and 30 are fully matched by savings in other subheads of the Votes.</P>
    <P>The additional amount of £11,000 for subhead A4 of Vote 29 is required to meet the increase in cost in 1976 for Bord an Choláiste Ealáine is Deartha in respect of the Interim National Wage Agreement with effect from 1st August, 1976, and increased employers' contribution under the Social Welfare Acts as from 5th April, 1976.</P>
    <P>The opening of a new subhead C9 is required in Vote 30&mdash;Primary Education&mdash;to enable recoupment to be made of certain expenditure on the painting of schools in the period 1st January to 31st March, 1975.  The new scheme of capitation grants for National Schools came into effect as from 1st January, 1975, and incorporated the special scheme for recoupment of costs in respect of the painting of schools as well as other schemes of grants.</P>
    <P>A circular issued to school managers in relation to the financial year 1974-75 had, however, referred to 31st March, 1975, as the latest date by which certain painting projects should be completed for the purpose of recoupment of the cost under the scheme.  Some school managers have claimed that under the terms of this circular they should be allowed recoupment of expenses incurred by them in the period 1st January to 31st March, 1975, in respect of the painting of their schools.  It has been decided, as an exceptional matter, to make provision for such recoupment by way of this Supplementary Estimate through the opening of a new subhead C9 for £30,000 in Vote 30.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" /> A Supplementary Estimate for a nett amount of £473,000 is requested in the case of Vote 31&mdash;Secondary Education.  An excess of £3,100,000 in subhead B&mdash;Incremental Salary Grant &mdash;is reduced by savings of £2,277,000 in other subheads of the Vote and an increase of £350,000 in Appropriations-in-Aid. The savings in other subheads include £700,000 on subhead H2&mdash;Secondary, Comprehensive and Community Schools&mdash;Building Grants and Capital Costs.</P>
    <P>The excess in subhead B is mainly attributable to the following factors&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the interim national wage agreement;</P>
    <P>(ii)  transfer of married women from the single to the married salary scale;</P>
    <P>(iii)  recommendations from the Teachers' Conciliation Council formally accepted by the Ministers subsequent to 1st January, 1976;</P>
    <P>(iv)  a greater than anticipated increase in the number of teachers in receipt of incremental salary and of allowances in respect of posts of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The cost of implementation of the national wage agreement is estimated at £815,000.</P>
    <P>Women teachers on marriage have been transferred to the married salary scale with effect from 1st January, 1976.  The cost in 1976 of this amendment of the rules for the payment of incremental salary to secondary teachers is estimated at £440,000.</P>
    <P>The recommendations already referred to from the Teachers' Conciliation Council are estimated to cost £800,000 in 1976.  They are as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  An amendment of the provisions for the calculation of the points rating for the purpose of the scheme of posts of responsibility;</P>
    <P>(b)  Revised placing on the incremental salary scale in respect of secondary school teachers appointed on probation prior to 1st July, 1968.</P>
    <P>The greater than anticipated increases in the number of teachers in receipt of incremental salary and allowances <Col N="434" /> in respect of posts of responsibility would have resulted from a combination of factors, which include a continuing growth in the number of pupils in the schools, the introduction of more comprehensive curricula in many schools, and fall in the average number of hours per week of teaching service by individual teachers, with a consequent increase in the number of teachers employed.</P>
    <P>The total excess of £3,100,000 in subhead B is reduced by £2,277,000 representing savings on other subheads of the Vote.  These savings are mainly in the subheads&mdash;</P>
    <P>A1&mdash;Capitation Grants,</P>
    <P>A2&mdash;Supplemental Grants in lieu of fees to Secondary Schools,</P>
    <P>H2&mdash;Secondary, Comprehensive and Community Schools&mdash;Building Grants and Capital Costs.</P>
    <P>Provision for an increase in the capitation grants and in the supplemental grant in lieu of tuition fees had been tentatively made in subheads A1 and A2.  In the light of the overall financial situation, including the additional cost of salaries, it was subsequently not found feasible to introduce such increases in the grants.</P>
    <P>In relation to the saving in subhead H2, it should be explained that this saving does not reflect a cut back on the building of community or secondary schools and that, in fact, an expanded programme of community school building is planned to commence next year, providing for a total of 10,000 new places.  Of the total saving, approximately £500,000 represents the cost of sites selected for community schools where the legal formalities for the transfer of the site to the Minister will not have been completed before the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the saving results from delays in completing the various planning procedures for some schools, i.e. working drawings, bills of quantities, tender documents, contractors' performance bond.  Because of the time factor of approximately three years involved between the commencement of planning of a school and its final <Col N="435" /> completion it is difficult to make accurate annual financial estimates.</P>
    <P>The additional amounts required for subheads A1 and A2 of Vote 34 are mainly for the purpose of meeting the additional costs arising from the Interim National Wage Agreement and the increase in the Social Welfare employers' contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The first thing I have to do, which is a pleasant duty, is to welcome the new Minister.  I look forward to co-operating with him and criticising his actions, when necessary, hopefully for the benefit of education. It is <i>ave</i> and with every <i>ave</i> there is a <i>vale.</i> I must also, on this first public occasion in the Dáil, bid farewell to the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Burke, who is now a European Commissioner with nine countries, in some field at least, the object of his care.</P>
      <P>I regret that since 1973 there has only been one full Estimate debate on Education.  I also regret that White Papers, Green Papers and prelegislative documents on education were promised and that we have not seen any White Paper, Green Paper or pre-legislative document yet.  With regard to the <i>minutiae</i> of the Supplementary Estimates I would like to say that when the Estimates proper came before the House I asked for the technicality of a token Estimate so that any debate would be on the broadest possible lines.  However, these are actually termed Supplementary Estimates and this imposes certain restrictions on debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has experience of business and commercial life, because this will help him in dealing with the hard-faced men of the Department of Finance, whose interference is visible in the Supplementary Estimates before us.  With regard to Vote 29, I want to refer to the question of capital expenditure for Bord an Choláiste Náisiúnta Ealáine <Col N="436" /> is Deartha.  Perhaps the Minister might be able to refer to it in his reply.  There was some trouble a few years ago in this regard.  I want to know whether the money allotted some time ago for capital service in the National College of Art and Design has been spent.</P>
    <P>In relation to Vote 30, as far as I can make out the document is a fraud.  What we have is the transfer of £30,000 to a new subhead, C9, to cover those cases where school managers were caught for expenses incurred in the painting of schools just at the changeover from the old system to the new system of funding, and this is proper.  In the document we have before us it says that subhead C9 was set up and £30,000 allotted.  Underneath that it says: &ldquo;Less the saving on subhead C5.&rdquo;  Subhead C5 is the subhead which provides for the new system, that is the £6 per pupil to be supplemented by £1.50 per pupil by the local community.  We voted for that under subhead C5, £3,800,000.</P>
    <P>I understand that £3,800,000 minus £29,990 will not be spent and I want to know if I am right in that deduction. If all of that money is not being spent, this document is misleading. The document appears to say that £3,800,000 will be spent on the operating costs of national schools except for £29,990 which is the saving mentioned in this document.  I want to know if this is true.  Am I right in thinking that almost another £500,000 is being taken off that sum?  Obviously the Minister for Education, knowing that we are in an inflationary situation, felt that £6 in 1975 should be increased for 1976, because there were two burdens of inflation, roughly 20 per cent and 18 per cent.  If the grants were increased <i>per capita</i> by £1, which would be roughly 16 per cent, it would bring the 1975 figure roughly up to the figure that we passed in the Estimate earlier this year.</P>
    <P>I think the cold, clammy hands of the Department of Finance got at that subhead.  This is why I am hopeful that the Minister will set his stern face against this type of thing, because the people who are heating, <Col N="437" /> painting and maintaining schools have to live with inflation.  If this subhead is being raided not merely for the £30,000 under the new subhead C9 but by £500,000, I would oppose this and even make the House vote on it. Everybody knows that that type of operating cost&mdash;fuel, painting, and so on&mdash;is increasing.  Everybody knows that inflation this year is 18 per cent and last year was about 20 per cent. I would like to compliment the forward budgeting of the Department of Education.  I regret that, if money had to be got from the Education Estimate, this fund had to be raided.  I submit that this page here does not show the truth and that the facts are not here.</P>
    <P>Another possible use rather than an all-round £1 per pupil increase would be a positive discrimination in favour of the smaller schools, which are finding it very difficult to cope on the grant.  I get letters and every rural Deputy gets letters about the difficulty of small schools who got £6 or £240 altogether, plus £1.50 or £60, to do this kind of job properly.  There could be discrimination in favour of these schools to make it possible for the management to keep them adequately. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comment on that.  I think I am right in my interpretation of it.  If I am right, it is a disgrace.  Robbing Peter to pay Paul is not an exercise that should commend itself to any Department, least of all to the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>On Vote 31, Secondary Education, the Minister said there has been a saving on capitation grants of £762,000 and a saving of £470,000 on grants in lieu of fees.  I cannot understand this.  Secondary schools financing is difficult at the moment and parents are asked to help because State finances are inadequate.  It strikes me it would not require an unnecessarily high level of ingenuity on the part of the Department to be able to spend on the schools the savings of £762,000 and £470,000 respectively. They know perfectly well that money is needed.  If they have children going to school they know that the schools, not for the sake of <Col N="438" /> just gathering in money, are asking parents to make voluntary contributions.</P>
    <P>There is a saving of £60,000 on science grants.  The activities of the savers are more than sinister.  Here one would have thought that it would not take any great ingenuity again to be able to dispense this money to the schools to improve the subjects covered by these grants.</P>
    <P>I come now to something that I mentioned before.  It is yet another saving under subhead A.4&mdash;Grant for Irish and Bilingual Schools.  The original estimate was for £110,000. The saving is £75,000.  I am very angry about this one.  It is a nitpicking operation.  I would hope there is not, although there are people who are very suspicious about this, any anti-Irish trend developing.  I ask the Minister to be sensitive on that point when he is administering his new office.  I ask him to squash any such trend if he finds it.  The schools in question saw the original estimate and they spent the money thinking they would get the amount specified because of their special status.  They are now in a parlous position.  When the Department of Finance came down, as it obviously did, like a ton of bricks on education the Department should have told them, in certain aspects anyway, to go to hell, that they were maintaining the original estimate.  This one should certainly have been maintained. These schools have their own difficulties.  I know because I worked in one of them.  They have difficulties about textbooks and varying standards in the pupils.  Sometimes they have to pay more money to bring pupils up to the required standard.  It is nothing short of a disgrace that this particular estimate was tampered with, substantially tampered with, and there is a grave moral obligation on the Minister and his Department to see to it that the cut is restored with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>Tá ceist ar an gClár agam mar gheall air seo agus is dócha go mbeidh an tAire ag caint tamall fada ar an gceist sin ag Tráth na gCeist inniu.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh freagra sásúil aige don Teach agus dúinn go léir ar an gceist sin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> Subhead D deals with the publication of Irish textbooks.  Here, again, there is a saving of £30,000.  I raised here before the question of an Irish publication of high quality and considerable magnitude for which I think the Department has a certain moral responsibility because the person who was publishing it was led to believe there would be Department of Education support for it.  He spent a good deal of money on the venture.  He employed secretarial staff and so on. I mention this because I am slightly suspicious when something gets the hammer in an area in which there is a particular interest in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>We had a considerable quarrel here about the drop in courses for teachers and I am glad to see the money was increased.  I regret to say there is a slight reduction in it again now.  It is called a saving.  It is reminiscent of the loss of an organ in an operation. The whole operation is the Department of Finance giving orders to the Department of Education and, as a result of those orders, the Department of Education has to cut off vital limbs from its own service.</P>
    <P>Subheads H.1 and H.2 deal with comprehensive and community schools.  I am glad the Minister said there was no thought or conviction on his part that these schools should not be built and developed but there is a serious so-called saving on subhead H.2 of £700,000.  The saving under subhead H.1 is £35,000.  I am reluctant to use the word &ldquo;saving&rdquo; because it is not necessarily a saving. It is something taken away which would not be taken away because it was necessary and needed where it was.  On subhead H.2 there is a saving of £700,000.  The Minister referred to this.  This whole business of saving on capital costs should be examined on a broader level.</P>
    <P>I am confined to my brief here.  In the most recent Central Bank report it was pointed out in regard to capital expenditure&mdash;and that is what we are dealing with here&mdash;that the Minister for Finance envisaged a 24.4 per cent increase for 1976, and at the end of <Col N="440" /> September it was 1.2.  There seemed to have been a conscious Government decision to cut capital expenditure, and we have been all the time in this House demanding the kind of expenditure that was creative.  In a situation where unemployment is so high and the employment content here is so high, in the building of schools and so on, it is nothing short of a tragedy that this cutting of capital services should take place in the Department of Education, apart altogether from capital expenditure which is actually needed, and needed as a bare minimum for the running of a school.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example to the House, and it is relevant to subhead H.2 here.  There is a comprehensive school in Cootehill in my own constituency. There has been a refusal to replace staff.  Tiles in the roof of the gymnasium or assembly hall&mdash;it is one of these multi-purpose halls which can be used for physical education, drama and so on&mdash;were removed because, being flimsy, they were damaged. They have not been replaced.  There are huge unprotected lamps hanging dangerously out of the ceiling.  Furthermore, there is no adequate playing pitch at this school.  Two basketball courts were promised and they have not been provided.  A plot of land is required for the adequate teaching of agricultural science, again capital expenditure which is necessary for the proper running of the school.  Equipment for the biology laboratory is necessary.  There was an additional room which was supposed to have a partition which would enable the people organising the classes to conduct two classes or one class when it suited.  The partition was not provided. The school is looking for these things. The parents have contacted me about these things.  There should be no question of snooping around looking for a place to cut off a few pounds when essentials like that are required for a school.  I could go on and on, but I want to indicate that there has been an attack made on education and it will have to be repulsed; otherwise education will become very much the poor relation in Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>I referred in passing to the employment <Col N="441" /> content.  There are many people looking for jobs.  Here are areas where jobs could be provided, where services would be supplied to schools and people could be earning money providing the roofs, pitches, basketball courts and so on.</P>
    <P>There is no mention at all of vocational education, and I am very sorry that there is not.  I have had letters recently from the students in Bolton Street who say their classes have had to be suspended there because teachers have not been appointed.  All the metalwork teachers who were trained last year have not yet got jobs, although there have been vacancies in schools for metalwork teachers that have not been sanctioned.  Again this is a serious position for education.</P>
    <P>On Vote 34 which is mainly concerned with An t-Udarás um Ard Oideachas, I would like to hear something from the Minister about what he conceives to be the role and function of the Higher Education Authority. I have no up-to-date information &mdash;I am not blaming the Minister necessarily for this&mdash;about what is going on in education from reports by the Department.  This problem will have to be faced and faced fairly soon, because always the reports were very late coming out.  There will have to be adequate staff so that reports can be got quickly from the Department.</P>
    <P>What set me musing about that was that some people were puzzled about what the Minister conceives the role and function of the Higher Education Authority to be.  The 1971 Act set that out very carefully.  During the summer the Minister for Education set up a committee which had representation from the Higher Education Authority to do a job that I would have thought was proper to the Higher Education Authority itself.  The Higher Education Authority issued a number of very useful and well researched reports, and I am hoping it has not been downgraded.  Again I am only surmising from what is happening; I do not know whether the fact that the Minister set up a different committee to help to draft the new Higher Education Authority legislation and that the Higher Education Authority <Col N="442" /> did not get that job to do means the Minister is losing confidence in the authority.  I am wondering whether they were consulted as such.  I know they had representatives on this new committee while it was deliberating. I am just wondering if they will be consulted as the authority with the role and function outlined in the Act of 1971 and if they will be consulted before the Bill is circulated.</P>

      <P>The new purported Conference of Irish Universities and its relationship with the Higher Education Authority will also come into question, but perhaps some time in a white or green paper or a pre-legislative document we may be able to debate that further.  In regard to savings&mdash;each time I refer to it I would like to be an actor to be able to say it properly&mdash;I want to put inverted commas around the word.  Under subhead B.1 there is a saving of £120,000 in the funding of the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick.  It is current expenditure. Again, it is difficult to see how, without interfering with the services provided, in an inflationary situation one can save £120,000 on a Vote for the National Institute for Higher Education.  The Minister may know how that can be done without damaging the services.  There is also a saving of £20,000 on the Dublin Institute and I understand that the governing body of the Institute has to meet soon. Again, there seems to be penny-pinching in all these fields.  I am sure that the Minister will see to it that the Department of Finance is repulsed <Col N="443" /> heavily the next time they come with their Midas eyes on the money voted for education.</P>
      <P>Under the heading, Dublin Dental Hospital, there is a &ldquo;saving&rdquo; of £233,000.  I visited the dental college as did Deputies O'Malley and Haughey, and there is no doubt that this House, and the country, have let the dedicated and able teaching staff of that college down over the years. The problems are not easy and I do not pretend they are, but the building is totally inadequate.  The qualifications and dedication&mdash;both are important&mdash;of the staff are admirable. In my view if £233,000 was voted to the dental college they could use it. It is a disgrace that such a figure should be entered here as a &ldquo;saving&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should now like to deal with grant-in-aid fund for capital building costs and planning expenses of third level institutions not funded by An t-Údarás Um Árd-Oideachais.  In passing I should like to refer to the declaration by the Government that 13 extra institutions were to be designated as institutions in accordance with the 1971 Act for funding from the HEA.  I find it hard to understand why they have not been so designated. Under that subhead there is a &ldquo;saving&rdquo; £97,000.  The remarks I have made already about this kind of a &ldquo;saving&rdquo; obtain here also.  The prime need is for a development in Dublin, the Ballymun development.  That is a major capital programme.  Any &ldquo;saving&rdquo; on the capital programme seems not merely to let down the Department of Education but does not take the opportunity of providing employment while at the same time improving the educational structures here. The imposition of strictures on the Department of Education, the forcing of the Department to rob Peter to pay Paul, is deleterious to education.  I know the Minister for Finance will ask us if we have not heard about the world recession and so on but, in accordance with the belief that education is the top social service here, the Department of Education and its expenditure on what are necessities, should be left alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> I commenced by welcoming the Minister and I added that I was glad he had experience in business and commerce.  In my view this will equip him well to repel the rapacious &ldquo;savers&rdquo; of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to offer my congratulations to the Minister for Education.  It is a grave responsibility because it is his duty to guide the minds of our young people during his term of office.  As a rural Deputy I am primarily concerned with the task of helping to relate our educational system to the needs of a rural community.  We have made great progress in relating our educational system to the needs of our society even though we started off with the great handicap that our system was imposed upon us by the British.  It was not a system that evolved out of our own needs, ideals or aspirations and it was an agency often used to help make us fit in with the aims of British colonial policy.  In so far as this imposed system was anti-national we have made great strides in changing and improving it, but in so far as it was geared to help the material needs of our people we have not made progress to the same extent in changing and improving it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We took a major stride forward when the late Donough O'Malley brought post-primary education within reach of every Irish child, but we cannot afford to rest there.  We must try to tailor our educational system to the capacity and the needs of each child.  We must tailor it, in particular, to the needs of our rural community. In his anxiety to get his idea of an educational system off the ground the late Donough O'Malley was forced to set up many pre-fab buildings. Those buildings have a limited lifespan and there is a danger that we might expect them to last longer than they will.  There is need to make provision for more permanent school buildings.  In those cases where teachers and pupils are handicapped by shortcomings in existing buildings there is a need to get moving quickly. The idea of a massive school building campaign was mooted some time ago <Col N="445" /> as a means for stimulating employment throughout the country.  Such a campaign needs to be undertaken in areas where the existing school buildings are not up to standard, and there are quite a number of those buildings in County Galway.  I should like to see them being phased out as soon as possible and replaced by solid structures.</P>
    <P>The school bus is also an essential part of the educational system in rural Ireland, and it is only right to thank the drivers for the care and consideration they have always shown to children under their care.  They have a very responsible task.  Many a young mother is frightened at the thought of her first-born being whisked away in a strange vehicle to a new school often many miles away, but the drivers have been very considerate and are to be congratulated on their efforts.  However, there is need to have greater regard to the wishes of local people in setting out schools bus routes, and care must always be taken not to infringe on the traditional catchment area, because that leads generally to dissension and even strikes which are detrimental to the children's interests.  It must be avoided at all costs.  Recently, there seems to have been a change for the worse in many school bus routes.  I do not want to mention individual cases now, but it has been brought to my notice that many schools now have problems because of limitations imposed on school transport.  This is regrettable because it means that children who, up to now, had been getting free transport are dprived of it.  I shall not dwell on that as I want to be brief so as to give others an opportunity to speak also.</P>
    <P>Topping the list of my order of priorities is the need to tailor our post-primary system of education to the needs of the community.  We hear a great deal about community development, about the need to create a greater sense of community and the need to strengthen the framework of the community.  The first essential for community is people, and the needs and hopes of these people should determine the type of post-primary education available to their children. Since the foundation of the State for <Col N="446" /> a long time the children fortunate enough to get post-primary education went to schools where the emphasis was on preparing them for the church, the professions or the civil service.  This suited the needs of those able to avail of post-primary education at the time. It was unusual for children destined to carry on the family farm or business to get post-primary education.  Many parents considered that there was no need for such education for children destined to stay at home, in the shop, workshop or on the farm.  This system of education catered for the child destined to leave the community rather than for the child destined to remain in it.  Our priorities were wrong and it is only now we are beginning to realise how wrong they were and still are.</P>
    <P>I represent a rural constituency which, by Dutch standards, is very thinly populated.  If we had in East Galway the population density of Holland our towns would be cities with up to 60,000 in some of them. We have natural resources, particularly in land for agriculture, to build up our community.  It should be the main objective to post-primary education to help our people to make the fullest use of these natural resources in order to build up the community. The system should cater for those destined to remain in the community as well as for those destined to leave it.  With things as they are, we should be leaning over backwards to cater for those destined to remain in our community. I do not want to belittle efforts at present being made in this direction. Post-primary schools and bodies such as AnCO are doing excellent work but there is much more to be done if we want to cater fully for the needs of a developing community. These needs have been set out again and again.  I have been present at parents' meetings and I have attended at the Department of Education on deputations from my own constituency and I have heard the parents spell out exactly what they want in our educational system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall just quote one instance to illustrate the point I was trying to make.  In early summer 1975, I was a member of a deputation of parents and teachers from Ballygar in my constituency to the Department asking for facilities to be provided for children at a local secondary school.  There was a certain urgency about the request because many children were being forced to leave the catchment area in order to study certain subjects which were not on the school curriculum in the local post-primary school and also because Bord na Móna were about to start a development programme in that area and it was felt that it would be necessary for the children to have metalwork training and secretarial courses provided at the secondary school.  They gave their reasons in the Department. So far those facilities have not been provided, but I understand they are being planned or prepared and are being submitted to the Department. I trust the Department will not delay them because it is important that there should be the least possible delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One reason given for the delay was that post-primary schools must have a certain quota of pupil enrolment before the full range of subjects can be provided.  We were told that it would be uneconomic to provide the full range where the enrolment did not warrant it.  If population density were the same in County Galway as in County Dublin there would be grounds for such an approach, but we must face facts, and the density of population in County Galway is far lower than in County Dublin.  As <Col N="448" /> a result, children in Galway and in other more thinly populated areas do not have the same range of educational facilities at post-primary level as the Dublin children have.  I do not think that is right.  Where possible those facilities should be provided in schools in rural Ireland even though the average may not be up to the desired level.  We talk about building up our communities yet when an obvious opportunity offers in an area where community co-operation is strong, we are very slow to co-operate with those people.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a strange reluctance to provide facilities for vocational subjects.  This again is to be deplored.  The trend still continues to favour academic subjects.  We are not doing enough to correct this imbalance. We need to generate more interest in vocational and technical subjects and to set a lead in getting away from the idea that brain power is necessary only for liberal studies, and that all a farmer needs is a strong back.  The day has come when we should place more emphasis on vocational education.</P>

      <P>Galway Vocational Educational Committee have submitted plans for the erection of a new vocational school at Tuam.

I asked the Minister to pursue this matter and to try to give sanction for the purchase of this site as soon as possible because it is not every day a suitable site comes on the market and it would be a pity to miss this opportunity, particularly in a thriving town like Tuam where there is such a need for vocational education.</P>

Tá súil agam, agus dóchas agam chomh maith, gur fearrde an Roinn é bheith leo; gur fearrde cúrsaí oideachais é bheith leo agus gur fearrde an tír go h-iomlán é bheith ina Aire Oideachais.</P>

Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé liomsa ba cheart go bhféadfaí rud ar bith a dhéanamh chun na scoileanna sin a choinneáil ar siúl gan ag an am gcéanna ualach ró-mhór a chur ar na daoine atá gníomhach ins na scoileanna agus atá ag iarraidh an seirbhís atá agus a bhéas riachtanach don tír seo a chur ar fáil.  Tuigim nach gceadaítear dom níos mó b'fhéidir a rá ar an bpointe sin agus fágfaidh mé mar sin é go fóillín.</P>
      <P>The only other matter to which I would like to refer was referred to by the Minister when he spoke about the opening of an additional subhead C.9 in respect of grants towards the cost of painting schools.  That, as you know, in the main refers to primary schools.  Later he referred to recoupment in respect of grants to schools in this regard.  One of the most retrograde steps in this country was the introduction of a scheme where it was necessary for local parents, or people operating on their behalf, to provide what I continue to call a fee for primary education.  The £1.50 fee per student is the most unsocialistic step that any Government, or part of a Government that claimed the seventies would be socialist, ever introduced. Never before was there any condition that the maintenance, heating or general hygiene in schools would be related to the ability or the preparedness of students attending primary schools to pay £1.50 per annum.  There is no justification whatsoever for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We occasionally hear sentimental references to the time when our forebears <Col N="450" /> brought the sod of turf to school.  We remember our days in national schools when we helped towards cleaning the school.  If we look at the constitutional position we see there is an obligation on the State to provide that each child attending a primary school will attend one which is structurally sound, well heated and providing the normal comforts one would expect.  The idea of a local committee&mdash;usually consisting of the manager, the principal and the parents' representatives&mdash;at their wits' ends to raise funds so that these services can be provided, is most retrogressive.  I cannot understand it.</P>
    <P>Most of us are family men.  I have a daughter attending primary school. A fee of £1.50 must be paid for her. Nobody comes to me and says &ldquo;You must pay £1.50 for Orla&rdquo;.  On the other hand, I know it must be collected because of the new regime.  I respond to requests for money, whether they are church collections or outside, raffle tickets or anything else, and pay.  I have two sons in third level education. I do not get any requests for a contribution to keep them warm in UCD or in Kevin Street College of Technology nor do I get any requests for funds to paint those two establishments. Are we introducing a system whereby the higher the IQ and the services provided the less demand there will be for heating and painting the premises?</P>
    <P>I am asking the new Minister for Education to have a look at this scheme.  I do not know the total amount realised but if we have 500,000 primary pupils the amount would be something less than £1 million. We talk about free education, which is a fallacy.  Education is not free in any of its stages.  The Constitution requires that the State shall provide education and there should be no question of the State not maintaining and heating buildings.</P>
    <P>I agree the State cannot provide for all the needs and requests that are made, but the amount of money being voted now for heating and painting schools has no relationship to the educational needs of the children.  I could understand the possibility that <Col N="451" /> there would be collections from parents for the provision of better audio-visual aids and for additional teachers, if parents so decide, in subjects like music and drama, as ancillary services to the normal curriculum, but it is entirely wrong to suggest that local management committees should go around with cans collecting pennies so that the schools can be painted, cleaned and maintained in a hygienic condition.  That sort of scheme should be suspended immediately and I ask the Minister to do so.</P>
    <P>In education generally we should be highlighting our priorities and the two I have referred to, the Irish language and primary education, are to me the two highest considerations.  I do not want to develop the point in respect of primary education but at the moment passage through primary schools and a year or two in some post-primary institution is as far as the majority of our children achieve in the field of education.  Therefore, I do not think it is too much to ask that during their years in primary schools children should enjoy all the facilities and the comforts given to those in third level institutions.  Parents should not be asked to pay more than their fair share of general taxation for this constitutional right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Tunney that these collections for painting and cleaning schools are terribly wrong.  Although I congratulate the new Minister and wish him well, I would remind him that his predecessor promised to reconsider the question of collections and the system of grants, particularly the fee-per-pupil element.  Because of depopulation in rural Ireland where there were fourteacher schools there are now three-teacher schools and it is unfair that less money should be given towards their upkeep&mdash;the buildings still have to be maintained even though they have a smaller number of pupils and therefore the grants should be kept up.  Apart from anything else, it is socially humiliating to be going around collecting this money from local sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> There was reference to higher education. To my mind the system at the moment is orientated towards the passing of examinations with consequent sacrifice of general knowledge.  Secondary students are given a certain number of subjects but they have not got the necessary general knowledge because of the requirement to pass examinations.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Hussey that the subjects taught in rural schools should be aimed at keeping the students at home rather than towards further depopulation.  There is also a need to direct the educational system towards preparing people for jobs in industry instead of, as in the old tradition, educating them for clerical jobs which do not exist.  The entire system of education will have to be considered from the point of view of equipping our young people for employment.</P>
    <P>The question of degrees from technical colleges has been discussed frequently recently, particularly the matter which arose in Galway.  There is the fear in this country that if one receives technological training it is not as good as an academic one acquired in a university.</P>
    <P>I put those few points to the new Minister for Education for consideration when he is reviewing the whole of education, with emphasis on the type of education being afforded young people.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may be allowed to make one point relating to my constituency and which is causing grave concern at present.  I wish the Minister well in his new post.  Perhaps he would apply himself to the solution of the problem&mdash;related to the Beech Hill Complex in Monaghan. Approval has been given for the sector for the vocational committee but approval has not yet been given for the balance.  It is very important that both sectors be advocated simultaneously. If the Department took an in-depth look at it they would decide it was bad economy to proceed with the portion already approved and then the other at a later stage.  They are committed to providing facilities in that other sector of the school.  Taking <Col N="453" /> into account the shortage of space, the number of structures, teachers and pupils involved perhaps he would give it priority.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might start rather appropriately from where Deputy Wilson left off because, in my previous responsibilities, he was the spokesman for tourism.  I know the problem about which he was speaking &mdash;not in detail&mdash;and it is being considered at the very highest level.  I hope there will be some result from those considerations very shortly.</P>
      <P>I hope Deputies will bear with me. I should like to thank all Deputies for their welcome in my new Department. Deputy Wilson said a number of times that I was a man with much business background and he hoped I would bring those qualities to bear in the Department of Education and resist the marauding hands of the Department of Finance.

      <P>In A flat minor. I hope the House will bear with me if I do not answer in as much detail as would some Minister who had been immersed in the Department for a number of years.  I have been in the Department less than a week. Some Deputies present are teachers themselves and will know from their life's work the detail and complexity of all educational matters.  All of the Deputies who spoke advocated the spending of more money.  There is no doubt but that such would satisfy a lot of people interested in education and, I think it is fair to say also, a lot of the ills.  There was a predecessor of all of us in this House who used to say that he preferred golden teachers and wooden schools to wooden teachers and golden schools. But, in this day and age, we cannot ignore conditions in which teachers and pupils have to work.  There is a necessity for new schools, for refurbishing of old ones, for capital investments of all kinds, all competing for the same limited amount of money.  Therefore, inevitably there will be delays.  The setting of priorities in a formalised way will be difficult in this regard.  I think the Department of Lands do this in regard to land drainage so that applicants know their position on a list and when the drainage in their areas will come up, but it would be very difficult to do that in regard to education.  Every demand must be looked at individually and efforts made to meet the very legitimate aspirations of local communities, of teachers and pupils.  The money I am requesting here today perhaps highlights that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wilson was critical of the Department for having savings made. Without reflecting on any one of the savings made&mdash;I say this broadly&mdash;it is the duty of every Minister and accounting officer in every Department to run that Department as cheaply as possible because ultimately the money can be got only from the <Col N="455" /> taxpayers and that is all of us.  Therefore, we have a duty to ensure that the money this House votes to a particular Minister is spent as wisely as possible in the public interest.  Savings made under individual subheads of this Vote, to some extent at least, will pay increases in salaries under a wage agreement.</P>
    <P>I think there would be unanimous agreement in this House that we must pay our teachers well.  We must train them well and pay them well if we are to reap the best value in the overall educational sense from our investment in education.  However long I am here the investment that will be made through me, as Minister, in education will never be as high as I think it should be.  Perhaps no predecessor of mine ever thought so either, nor indeed will any of my successors.  It never was and never will be as high as we would like.  There will always be extremely good schemes that should be gone ahead with that will have to be postponed for a period of time because funds are not available.  We shall always face that situation.  We must do the best we can for all levels of education competing for the funds available.  I do not want to say anything now that will send forth the word that I have a certain philosophy or ideal about education.  I am not even committing myself to any course of action.  For that reason I shall not comment on the role of the HEA, as Deputy Wilson asked, because I feel I should talk to the people involved, find out the various points of view held and then come to a considered decision rather than one, perhaps not flippant but with not as much thought as should be given to this subject, here today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson said it is&mdash;I think he said&mdash;three years since there was a full debate in this House on education. I would hope we would have one during the coming financial year, when I would have had more time to immerse myself in the problems of my new Department and attempt to reach solutions.  We could have that debate on a token Estimate or by way of whatever would be the appropriate machinery but if I had a preference <Col N="456" /> in regard to education I would accept what Deputy Tunney has said, that is, to form legs on which education must be structured.  I refer to primary education and to the Irish language.  Táim cosúil le roint mhaith daoine ar fud na tíre.  Tá an teanga agam ach níl sí chomh láidir is chomh flúirseach agus ba mhaith liom í a bheith.  Act tá suim agam sa teanga, ach mar adúirt chara liom uair amháin: &ldquo;Theip ar an dteanga because it is surrounded by a bog of goodwill&rdquo;&mdash;daoine cosúil liom féin, go bhfuil an teanga acu.  Múineadh an teanga dom sa bhunscoil agus sa mheánscoil.  Do labhramar roint di lasmuigh den scoil.  Nuair do bhíomar san FCA, níos mó bliana ó shin anois ná mar is maith liom smaoineamh air, níor labhramar ach Gaeilge.  Ach ní bhíonn an taithí agam agus sin í chúis gur chailleamar an líofacht.</P>
    <P>That is a matter to which I would wish to address myself.  We must ask whether there is anything we can do in this regard.  Most people acknowledge that we have failed in regard to Irish.  Conscious of my own sins in this regard, I am convinced nevertheless that if the language is lost my generation must accept the blame because we were educated when Irish was available, at a time when the language was encouraged in schools.  Perhaps the failure rests with the many people like myself who, while expressing goodwill for, and defending the people's right to use, the language, do not use it ourselves. This problem is one that has occupied the minds of Ministers, teachers and Departments since the foundation of the State but no solution has been found.  During the short time I am in the Department&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;short&rdquo; in the sense of the period of the history of the language&mdash;I doubt if a solution to the problem will be found but I can assure the House that I will not do anything to damage in any way the position of the language in our lives.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Wilson's question in relation to the NCAD, the position in relation to the past was that a capital provision of £50,000 was made in 1975.  This was intended for preliminary works on a new building on <Col N="457" /> another site as well as for some work on the existing site.  However, the problem arose in regard to payment for work on the existing site, works which had not been authorised fully.  Some of the provision remained unspent at the end of 1975.  The problem has been overcome and payment to meet expenses of the order of £20,000 in respect of building works on the existing site have been authorised in 1976 out of the grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson raised, too, the saving of £29,990 under subhead C9. I understand that this refers to the convention on technique procedure adopted for the purpose of the presentation of the token Supplementary Estimate of £10 which we are now debating.  In respect of subhead C5, the exact saving, as the Deputy said, was between £400,000 and £500,000.  This relates to the £6 capitation grant.  An allowance was made this time last year when the Estimates for 1976 were being compiled in the hope of increasing the figure.  However, it was not found possible to increase it in the circumstances prevailing half way through this year.  The problem is the one raised also by Deputy Callanan&mdash;that of one-and two-teacher schools.  There has been an adjustment in calculation to the effect that the amount of grant payable in the case of any individual school will be subject to a minimum of £250 per year or to a minimum of £125 for schools maintained by the State and in respect of which capitation grants are lowered.  A circular to this effect will be issued to the schools at an early date.  The cost of this amendment to the scheme is estimated at about £60,000 per year.  Therefore, regardless of size, any school will receive £250 per year although they might not have the minimum 40 pupils.</P>
    <P>To go back for a moment to the question of the Irish language; I have noted in the past couple of years that there is more interest being expressed in the language by young people, that there is more appreciation of it, not as a subject imposed on them at school, but as a means of communication. That is a desirable trend.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, there was an <Col N="458" /> increase last year in the capitation grants for schools.  This grant was increased from £20 to £30 but all the time the A and B schools had 25 per cent more than the base capitation rate so that when the capitation rate was £20 they had £25 and when the rate increased by £10, the A and B schools got an increase of £12.50 by reason of their having the £5 advantage.</P>
    <P>Regarding an Irish publication mentioned by Deputy Wilson, I can only tell him at this stage that there are legalities involved.  The point he made about the school at Cootehill illustrates the size of the problem.  Every Deputy could list schools in his constituency, all levels of schools on which capital money could be spent to advantage.  We will allocate our limited funds as fairly and as wisely as possible, but we must recognise that there is not a bottomless well of money for education or for any other Department.  Recognising the importance of the Department of Education, the Government will allocate as much money as possible to education.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The report is based on a study which <Col N="461" /> was commissioned by the Advisory Committee on Energy Conservation established by my predecessor in October, 1974.  The purpose of the study was to prepare outline proposals to enable the advisory committee to report to the Minister for Transport and Power on energy conservation in Ireland up to 1985.</P>
      <P>The report sets out recent volumes and patterns of energy flows in Ireland and attempts to forecast gross energy demands for the period 1976-1985. It reviews conservation measures undertaken to date and makes recommendations as to further measures that might be adopted, the estimated cost of such measures and the potential savings that might be achieved.  A number of the recommendations have already been implemented and others are at present being examined in my Department in consultation with the advisory committee and other interested bodies.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise that energy conservation depends for its success to a very great extent on the co-operation of the general public and the various sectors of commerce, industry, and so on.

      <P>The meeting provided energy Ministers with an opportunity of considering the Community's growing dependence on imported energy and of making known their positions and anxieties on a wide range of topics, including energy savings, security of imported supplies and the protection and development of the Community's energy resources.  In this connection, my predecessor recorded his concern at the slow rate of progress made towards a Community energy policy since the energy crisis of 1973-74 and stressed the urgent need to adopt measures which would help to protect member states and the Community as a whole should difficulties arise.</P>
      <P>The council agreed that the commission's communication constituted a good basic guide for the council's future deliberations, and a tentative work programme was drawn up for the period to 31st December, 1977. Preparations are in hand for the holding of a further energy council at an early date for the purpose of taking decisions on measures which are near to agreement.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that these conferences since the energy crisis have achieved absolutely nothing?  Would he agree that they have not succeeded in lowering our dependence or the dependence of member countries on imported energy or oil in this case?  Is it just talking shop, in other words?  Is it achieving anything for the member countries?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I would not agree with Deputy Barrett that these conferences have produced exactly nothing.  They have not produced as much as one would have liked.  As I have said, my predecessor, who has been at a number of them&mdash;<Col N="464" /> I have not been at any yet&mdash;was disappointed with the progress that was being achieved, and he so stated at the last conference.  The conference meeting about which Deputy Barrett spoke was called to deal with that problem, to exchange views and to set a time-table, and a time-table has been set for taking decisions up to the end of 1977.  When I have attended a few of these meetings I will be in a better position to express a personal view.</P>

      <P>The Minister's visit to the Soviet Union, which takes place from 14th to 20th December, 1976, is in response to an invitation extended to him by the Soviet Foreign Minister Mr. Andrei Gromyko.  The general purpose of the visit is to develop further, on a basis of mutual benefit, the existing relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The Minister envisages that he will have an opportunity in the course of his visit for an exchange of views with the Soviet Foreign Minister on a range of current international issues such as implementation of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, problems of arms control and disarmament and other similar questions of international concern.</P>
      <P>He also hopes to have talks with the Soviet Foreign Minister and his colleagues on such bilateral matters as the development of trade between Ireland and the USSR in a balanced way and to avail of the occasion of the visit to sign an agreement on the development of economic, industrial, scientific and technological co-operation which was recently negotiated between Ireland and the Soviet Union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, I agree that the Minister will have ample scope to do something about the trade between the two countries. Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="465" /> will the Minister raise such matters as the poaching in Irish waters by Russian trawlers, and the reason why the Soviet authorities in Dublin have now three separate establishments for the diplomatic service in three different suburbs when no other country, I say offhand, has more than two in the city?  The Russians are building a huge complex at Rathgar.  Will the Minister ask the Russian government why they need such a huge complex of buildings in this city of ours?  Will the Minister be allowed to march through Georgia from which they have banned him at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>These are all separate questions, but the short answer to the first two is no.  The Minister's view would be that the Russians in Soviet fishing boats have been made quite well aware by the action of our naval service and of the courts of our attitude towards the protection of territorial waters.</P>
      <P>In regard to the establishments to which the Deputy has referred, the Minister is satisfied that these establishments qualify with what was agreed and that what was agreed corresponded with the Minister's views on what was reasonable.  The Deputy will not ask me in the context of a question about the Minister's visit to Russia to defend that in detail I hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>A further question. Will the Minister inquire before he goes to ascertain if the Soviet authorities are in breach of the Vienna Convention on the purchase of lands in any country for diplomatic buildings? There is a convention which covers what a foreign embassy may do in any one country as regards buying land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a separate question, but my understanding of the Minister's intentions in this regard is that he has no complaints about Soviet behaviour with their establishments here, and consequently I see no reason why he should raise it.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if I heard him right in saying that the Minister will not be <Col N="466" /> lodging a protest with the Russian authorities during the course of his visit in regard to the poaching which they have indulged in off our coast, one case of which has been brought to court?  There is ample local information from fishermen that they have continued this practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will realise that there have been in recent years several hundred infringements of territorial waters by foreign trawlers.  The Deputy will not expect a formal diplomatic protest to be lodged in each case.  The authorities of the countries concerned are made aware the hard way what our view is when these ships are arrested and their skippers subsequently fined and their gear confiscated.  A protest over and above that would not achieve anything like the same effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the plans that are in hand to correct the serious social problem indicated recently in a report (details supplied) of a survey carried out by Ballyfermot Community Association.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as social problems can be tackled within the context of the educational system the position in Ballyfermot has been receiving the joint attention of educational authorities for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> The advisory council on post-primary accommodation in the greater Dublin area which was set up in 1966 gave special consideration to Ballyfermot area from the beginning of its operations. The City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee appointed a special sub-committee in February 1973 with the objectives of:</P>
    <P>1.  To develop the concept of vocational education in a way relevant and meaningful to the Ballyfermot community.</P>
    <P>2.  To involve the Ballyfermot community in wider and more responsible participation in its own education.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee is representative of the Ballyfermot Community Association, AnCO, the Federated Union of Employers and the trade unions as well as the primary and post-primary schools in the area.  It was agreed in 1975 that a senior cycle college for 500 pupils be provided in Ballyfermot to be operated by a board of management representative of the vocational education committee and the Ballyfermot Community Association as well as the authorities of the existing secondary schools in the area who were prepared to co-ordinate their courses with those of the new senior cycle college.  Schedules of accommodation for the new building have been completed and the remaining stages of the planning and building process are being expedited as much as possible.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate from what I have already said, considerable progress has been made in bringing the local community association into co-operative activity with the existing educational authorities with a view to the development of facilities and courses suited to the needs of the area.  It does not appear to me that it would be desirable at this stage to interrupt the flow of this fruitful co-operation by making a declaration of an educational priority area and providing a special local educational authority as recommended in the survey carried out by the community association.</P>

Is he aware that as a result of the social problem mentioned in the question, of the 79 per cent who left school before the age of 16 years, 23 per cent are unemployed?  In addition 24 per cent of their fathers are unemployed and 40 per cent have left the area.  This is the situation in Ballyfermot.</P>

      <P>The special educational needs of Ballyfermot have been recognised for a long time, as I read out in my reply to the question.  A committee was set up to develop the concept of vocational education in a way relevant and meaningful to the Ballyfermot community and to involve the Ballyfermot community in wider and more responsible participation in its own education.  It is regrettable that the siting of the senior cycle school has taken so long.  The Deputy is probably more familiar from local knowledge that I am with the problems involved in regard to sites.  That has been resolved and it is hoped that as early as possible in the new year the project will go out for tender.

      <P>Funds are not allocated to the Industrial Development Authority for industrial development in a particular area.  Expenditure from IDA funds on such development in any area depends on the success of the authority's promotional efforts there.</P>
      <P>In regard to County Mayo the Deputy may wish to know, however, that since March 31st, 1973, the IDA has entered into grant commitments of over £12 million in respect of projects located there.  Actual expenditure to date has totalled £4,475,900. Part of this money was paid to companies by way of grant assistance and a further portion was used to acquire sites and build factories for industrial development.</P>
      <P>The main achievement by the authority in the area has been the conclusion of negotiations with four overseas companies which will provide employment in the county for about 2,500 people when their plants reach full production.  These plants are now either under construction or in production.</P>

      <P>Exceptional steps have been taken over the past few years to help this firm to overcome various difficulties.

I understand, however, that the firm is exploring the possibility of associating with another group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this company's difficulties stem primarily from advice they received from the IIRS in relation to the type of motor which should be used in their operation, that they purchased a large number of these motors on the basis of that advice and subsequently found them to be useless and cannot now dispose of them, and are, accordingly, in a serious financial situation primarily arising out of that, and in view of that, will the Minister now take steps to see that some special assistance is given to them to prevent the closure of a factory which is using a very valuable new technology?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the version of reported facts as presented by the Deputy.  The company was originally set up to manufacture tools, precision instruments and dies, and the concept of developing a chain saw operated tractor hydraulic unit was subsequent to the establishment of the company.  The company received advice from the IIRS but to say that the source of the difficulties is primarily because of that advice is to me a travesty of the facts, facts with which I have taken care to acquaint myself.  In terms of public money&mdash;I am not trying to quantify the value of the IIRS work or the time of public servants&mdash;the company has received in direct subventions £57,608 and to that one may add, perhaps, another £20,000 and that is to a firm employing not more than 20 people.  It has had advice from the IDA, the NPC and the IIRS and every other State agency to which it has applied and the time has come now, I think, when <Col N="477" /> it is not possible from the point of view of prudence to offer the company more public money.  I wish the company success in their efforts to find a partner and I do not want to say anything that would damage them, but the scale of both effort and financing, which I outlined, given to the company, a company at present employing 17 or 18 people, has been absolutely prodigious and I am convinced further effort on our part is not warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the IIRS advised the use of a particular motor and did so without making any contact with the manufacturers of that motor and those manufacturers have since stated to the IDA and to the Department that, had they been asked, they would have said the motor on which this company has spent a large amount of money was useless for the purpose for which the IIRS recommended it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is presenting some facts but he is presenting them with bias.  Initially, I understand, the company intended to develop their own hydraulic motor, which was a very major undertaking, and they were advised there was an alternative on the market.  My understanding is that they were not advised that that alternative&mdash;I think it is now pertinent to mention that it is the Lamborghini motor made by the Italian company&mdash; would be automatically usable in a new context without development work.  The suggestion here is that, because the IIRS indicated that such a hydraulic motor was in mass manufacture and available at a reasonable price, the failure to do the development work to make that motor completely reliably in the projected chain saw was the fault of the IIRS.  That is the inference I think unwarranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are two motors of this type, the 136 and the 148, and the IIRS told the firm to use the 136 and Lamborghini, when they discovered it was being used in connection with the hydraulic saw, said it was totally unsuitable and that the only motor that <Col N="478" /> would work was the other one and this company are now left with a large stock of 136 motors on their hands which Lamborghini will not take back and nobody else will buy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage it is probably relevant for me to put on the record of the House that the company refused to sign, and never signed, a normal service contract with the IIRS. They only took the advice which suited them from the institute.  Following one instance of selective use of advice, when adjustment was suggested by the institute but was not carried out by the company, the IIRS decided to withdraw.  The point at issue here is that when one goes to a State body and receives professional advice that does not exonerate one from the inferred need to do the normal research and development on a new project.  It does not exonerate one from ordinary commercial prudence in committing oneself to a large purchase before the R and D is done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is now standing over the actions of a semi-State body which are leading to the demise of this firm and I do not think the Minister should put himself in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a statement and not a question.  Deputy O'Malley asked a previous question about this and since then I have been very much in touch with the situation.  I wish the demise of that firm as little as the Deputy or anybody else.  I am satisfied that the whole gambit of State aid was given unstintingly and to the extent of more than £3,000 per worker <i>in toto</i> to that firm.  I cannot accept the innuendo or the statement that its demise is the responsibility of the IIRS.  I reject it and I do so as a result of having looked carefully into the matter.  I hope I am convincible that if a State body were in error I would pursue them as vigorously as anybody else.  In this instance I have looked at the situation and I am not so satisfied.</P>

I am not aware of any current proposals. If there are investigations at the level of preliminary inquiries, I am not so aware but I can find out.  In existing circumstances I would be surprised if there were any inquiries because people will either await the outcome of our drilling programme, particularly next year and the years to come, before committing themselves.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that shopkeepers in County Donegal, particularly those near the Border, are embarrassed by having to charge considerably more for goods of Irish manufacture, such as biscuits, than the same goods are costing in retail shops on the other side of the Border; and if he will make a statement on this anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that certain Irish manufactured goods such as biscuits are cheaper in Northern Ireland than in Donegal.  The UK is a net importer of agricultural goods and traditionally has operated a policy aimed at keeping prices for agricultural goods as low as possible.  The corollary is that manufacturers of foodstuffs such as biscuits in the UK have cheaper raw materials available to them and their output can accordingly be produced and sold more cheaply than comparable products here.  When Irish manufacturers compete in the Northern Ireland market with such goods they can do so only because of the benefit of export rebates, including EEC compensatory amounts which are not available to them in respect of home market sales. In the specific case of biscuit prices mentioned by the Deputy, a further relevant factor is the difference between indirect taxation here and in the UK and Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have instituted inquiries by the National Prices Commission in general in relation to different movements in the consumer price index in Ireland by comparison with the retail price index in Britain.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation here is one of comparison between the price of biscuits in Northern Ireland and the price of biscuits here and there are special circumstances at work there.  Firstly, there is the position in relation to the rate of indirect taxation applied to biscuits in the Republic as against the rate of indirect taxation applied to biscuits in Northern Ireland. There is also the fact that biscuits exported from the Republic to Northern Ireland attract in respect of income derived therefrom export tax relief.  In addition, there is further the arrangement in relation to accession compensatory amounts which are payable on exports of biscuits to Northern Ireland from which biscuits produced here and marketed on the Irish market do not benefit.  These are identifiable factors which are not related to specifically inflationary matters but rather to fiscal policy here and in the Community at large.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of the details and in view of the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary refused to give me the detailed information I sought in the previous question will he agree that this is a device used to permit the importation of foreign manufactured goods at a time when we are exhorting our people to buy Irish made products?  Would the Minister not have these adjusted in cases where there are ample supplies of home manufactured goods available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that in the case of most of these quotas they are aligned in practice to EEC requirements in regard to trade with third countries. We are not a free agent in the matter of setting quotas in relation to these goods.  As regards the Deputy not getting the information he is seeking, that information is extremely detailed because of the separate quotas in respect of each trading country in respect of each item of produce imported. The information sought by the Deputy would be extremely detailed. If he would like information in regard to a particular product from a particular country I can arrange to supply it to him, but it would probably be better that we should have a discussion on the matter so that I would know exactly what he wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot entirely accept the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation.  These quotas originally came into effect when the home <Col N="485" /> market was unable adequately to supply particular products and a <i>quantum</i> restriction was imposed on imports.  This situation no longer obtains, and at a time when it is so necessary to encourage Irish manufacture would the Parliamentary Secretary have a serious look at the whole matter of imports under quota?  He is well aware that this is a bonanza in some cases for the importers.  I should have liked to get specific information in regard to assembled motor cars which come in here in some cases a few thousand pounds cheaper than those assembled here and are sold at the same price as cars assembled here.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will make a statement on reports of a proposed further increase of 2p per gallon in the price of petrol in addition to the recent increase of 6p; whether he has received a formal application for this further increase; and the steps he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen Press reports about a proposed further increase in the price of petrol in Britain. No application has been received by me for increases in the current price of petroleum products in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the assumption that this application will be made shortly, would the Parliamentary Secretary consider asking the petrol companies concerned to bear the cost of this 2p per gallon out of the vast profits which each of them make annually?  Alternatively, would he consider asking the Minister for Finance to bear the 2p out of the 15p which was put on the price of petrol in December, 1974, for the purpose of ensuring that it would not be cheaper than in Britain and in Northern Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in relation to indirect taxation is a matter for the Minister for Finance and has to be considered in the context of overall budgetary policy.  It is not a matter on which I could comment on this occasion.  In regard to the price <Col N="486" /> of petrol products, the Deputy will be aware that a price must be available to the oil companies here which will make it sufficiently profitable for them to supply this market.  Obviously, in practice, if we want to wave the big stick and say that we will not grant the increase, we must bear in mind the necessity of maintaining regularity of supplies.  We must keep that very much in the forefront of our minds and balance it against other factors.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that the National Prices Commission will scrutinise very carefully any application when it comes to us and further that, under existing arrangements the increase which will be applicable if those arrangements are maintained, will have been scrutinised in very great detail by the Prices Commission in Britain which have greater resources to engage in that sort of scrutiny than we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the action he proposes to take to protect consumers against the sale of dangerous and shoddy toys and games, especially during the Christmas season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the publication in the Press of a notice calling the attention of manufacturers and traders to the terms of the compulsory Irish standard specification relating to toxicity and cellulosic content of toys, inspectors from my Department commenced a countrywide inspection in mid-November, to check that toys complied with the requirements of the standard.  A number of the toys purchased are at present being tested by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  Persons found to contravene the order imposing the standard will be liable to prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no legislation dealing specially with shoddy as distinct from dangerous toys and games.  The consumer legislation which I am promoting will give consumers protection against goods being represented as having quality they do not have, but I <Col N="488" /> do not think it would be wise or practicable to attempt to ban articles from the market on grounds of quality alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that the question concerns substantial imports and is he satisfied with the present position realising that Christmas is a time when shoddy articles could be off-loaded to customers when probably they would not be as critical as they would normally be?  Are the restrictions severe enough?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that there is a higher rate of purchase of toys around Christmas and for that reason I have asked that a countrywide inspection of toys available on the market be carried out by inspectors of my Department.  This inspection commenced on 15th November and already a number of toys have been purchased for further testing to see if they conform with the safety requirements which have been referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question last week so far as I recall was in the context of vigilante groups.  It was never proposed that there should be vigilante groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We should cut out the semantics.  Certainly, I used the words &ldquo;vigilante groups&rdquo;.  I put two questions to the Minister.  The Minister then denied that the Taoiseach ever made such a suggestion.  Then I said &ldquo;an assistant police organisation&rdquo; and again the Minister denied <Col N="489" /> that there was any such suggestion. Does the Minister say that he did not understand the question I was asking last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anxious that there should be no misunderstanding in the public mind because the Deputy asked questions about vigilantes in the context of questions put by another Deputy relating specifically to vigilante groups and it was important that the idea of vigilante groups should not be confused with this particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that he was deliberately evasive because of the embarrassment that the Taoiseach's off-the-cuff suggestion made in 1974 was not implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that there was no embarrassment on my part as regards this.  It was just, as I say, that it was extremely important to distinguish between the two concepts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pursue this even though I know I have just gone over the time.  It is not my fault that the question was reached just before 3.30 p.m.  Will the Minister agree that in June, 1974, in a debate on the Northern Ireland situation the Taoiseach said it was decided to set up in each city and town a security service unit based in local Garda stations who would report on any suspicious activities to the gardaí?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that that proposal was suggested at that time.  As I indicated to Deputy Andrews last year it was proposed in a different context, and, hopefully, the distressing context which gave rise to that proposal will not recur.  This is not a subject we like to talk about because of the serious implications.  The proposal the Deputy referred to was made in a different context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not only a proposal, it was a decision conveyed to the House.  Obviously, it was a decision which must have been examined, because in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 15th November, <Col N="490" /> 1974, the Minister said he was not in a position then to make a statement on it.  In reply to a question on 23rd January, 1975, he said that detailed arrangements for the setting up of such a force had been drawn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That was so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in the context of the situation obtaining in 1974-75.  Is the Minister aware that since then the Government have decided&mdash;I say that deliberately&mdash;that we are living in a state of national emergency?  Have conditions so improved between 1974-75 and the declaration of the state of national emergency which still persists, as not to warrant the setting up of a force which was thought to be justified at that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads the full reply to the question on 23rd January, 1975, he will see that I said that detailed arrangements for the setting up of such a force had been drawn up but the question of proceeding with the proposal is one that would have to be reviewed in the light of all the circumstances since the idea was first mooted.  A review of the idea since it was first mooted has led us to the conclusion that, for the moment, it is not necessary to proceed further with it.  There is nothing inconsistent with that decision and the necessity for declaring a state of emergency. The reasons for the declaration of the state of emergency were gone into in great detail in the course of the emergency debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <P>I think I dealt with most of the questions raised before Question Time.  There is one matter to which I would like to refer briefly and that is the question of the £1.50 Deputy Tunney raised.  This is a contribution towards the maintenance of primary schools.  I would like to emphasise that this is in no sense a fee, as Deputy Tunney suggested.</P>
      <P>It is a formalising of a very important feature of our national school system, namely, the local ownership and local control of these primary schools.  It is in no way an innovation to have a local contribution towards the maintenance of a school.  In this regard I will quote an extract from a recent circular about this matter.</P>
      <P>The sum required to meet the local contribution shall be provided by the parish community or other appropriate analogous community or body from general funds at the disposal of such community or body and there shall be no levy on parents of children attending the school. A local contribution was formalised by agreement at the £1.50 level when the State's contribution was trebled to a level of £6 per pupil.</P>
      <P>The total expenditure was raised from about £1 million to £3 million annually.  Even with my limited acquaintance with the situation I think the remarks made in this regard were unwarranted.</P>

        <i>Cavan):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £133,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1976, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power, including certain services administered by that Office and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The subvention provided for CIE in the 1976 Estimates was £28 million, and it is now estimated that this provision will be inadequate to the extent of £3.9 million to meet CIE's net deficit in the current financial year.</P>
      <P>The main reason for the increase in the board's losses is the 1976 interim wage agreement which will cost CIE an additional £2.4 million in respect of subventible activities in 1976.  The balance of the excess is due largely to a reduction in railway traffic.  There has been a serious decline in rail passenger traffice due to the general economic recession combined with customer resistance to the fares increases introduced in March, 1976. The economic recession is also responsible for a substantial decrease in rail freight carryings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total short-fall in CIE's anticipated revenue for 1976 amounts to £2 million approximately and, in <Col N="495" /> addition, there have been increases totalling about £500,000 in social insurance costs and fuel costs.  The effects of the increased costs and the short-fall in revenue have however been partially offset by increases in productivity.</P>
    <P>The provision of £3.9 million in the Supplementary Estimate will bring CIE's total subvention for 1976 to £31.9 million, i.e., an increase of £5.4 million on the provision for 1975.  The sum of £31.9 million includes approximately £24.18 million for railway operations, £6.09 million for Dublin City bus services and £1.26 million for provincial bus services.  The balance is for the canals and Galway/Aran ferry services.  No subvention is provided for the board's road freight services, which must be operated on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>The increasing deficits on CIE's operations are a continuing cause for grave concern.  I am aware that the board of CIE share this concern and are making a determined effort to arrest the escalating deficits through the implementation of productivity and cost reduction schemes.  It is essential that these efforts be continued, and I will be impressing on the board the need to pursue vigorously all practicable measures to improve efficiency and to secure economies in operation.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the increased expenditure is £3.9 million but there is an offset of £3.767 million in saving made up of £2.387 million on other subheads and a surplus of £1.380 million from Appropriations-in-Aid. Accordingly the net amount required is £133,000.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, the main reason for the Supplementary Estimate is the financial state of CIE.  Every year we come in and vote ever increasing subsidies for CIE and we have supported the present Government in these votes.  It seems this will go on and on despite whatever reductions CIE are attempting to enforce.  I appreciate that the Minister <Col N="496" /> has been only seven days in his new office and that he would not have had time to look into the affairs of all the semi-State bodies with which he has to deal.  I think there are 12 such bodies but, of course, some are more important than others as far as the national economy is concerned, and CIE have special importance.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to examine in a complete fashion the activities of CIE not only from the point of view of the economic structure involved but also the social structure &mdash;the social contribution CIE are obliged to make to this country. Nowhere in the world is there a railway system which is anyway near to paying its way.  Even in a country like West Germany, where there is a large amount of through traffic to other countries, they are losing heavily, and proportionately speaking they are losing more heavily than we are.</P>
      <P>It appears to many people that CIE have set a definite course in curtailing services all over the country.  We have had the instance of the passenger line from Limerick to Claremorris which was debated at length in this House. CIE went ahead and discontinued that service and the Minister's predecessor told us that it was a matter for the board of CIE.  I do not think that these decisions can be left to the board of CIE if we are to concern ourselves about the public good.  A number of parcel delivery services in the West of Ireland, Kerry, Clare and other counties have been cut off and discontinued during the past 12 months on economic grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present we are told that CIE are to discontinue the service between Rosslare, Wexford and Limerick Junction. I would ask the Minister to take a hard look at this proposal.  Apart from the fact that it is losing more than £100,000, it must be taken into account that this line is the main feeder service for Thurles beet factory. One factor must be weighed against the other.  I disagree with the proposal to discontinue this service because although CIE would save a sum in the region of £130,000, they would cause a very serious upset and definitely threaten the livelihoods of people in <Col N="497" /> places such as Thurles beet factory. The amount of money that would be saved is insignificant in comparison with losses in other services operated by CIE.</P>
    <P>The Dublin bus service is losing £6.09 million.  Most people in this city who use the buses will agree that CIE are doing a very poor and sloppy job at present.  Apart from the present goslow, they operate very badly in normal conditions, and I am sure the Minister will find that his Department receive very many complaints about this service.</P>
    <P>The Dublin bus service is losing more than £6 million and yet CIE want to interfere with the goods service between Wexford and Limerick Junction which is of such great importance in maintaining the supply of beet to the factory at Thurles which provides jobs for many people in the Thurles area.  They cannot justify that proposed action.  There is another ferry service between this country and Britain and they propose getting out of the business altogether. This one, in the first half of this year, made a profit of £35,000.  They propose discontinuing that service despite the fact that it is allegedly making a profit.  Also they are threatening to discontinue the goods service from Wexford to Limerick Junction, through Thurles, because it is losing £135,000.  There would appear to be grave inconsistencies in the reasons they put forward for the discontinuance of services.</P>
    <P>The railway system has a social role to play in this and every country.  The continued closure of lines interferes with the industrial infrastructure and the facilities that should be available in any country hoping to set up more industry, as is the case in rural Ireland. Even though costly it is necessary that the railway system be maintained. It is particularly important for people who come here with a view to setting up industry.  It is something they must take into consideration and, if they ascertain that we have not got a proper transport system, particularly in regard to the railways, they will not be tempted to set up industries here.</P>
    <P>CIE are seeking a further £3,900,000.  The total Supplementary <Col N="498" /> Estimate is for £133,000.  Certain savings have been effected under the different subheads, as set out in the Supplementary Estimate, some of which have been worthy and about which nobody will quibble.  But there are a few on which we should like more information, such as that under subhead E which represents a saving of £610,000.  It is a saving on the original Estimate for Grants for Harbours which amounted to £719,000.  As far as I am aware, the original Estimate included something in the region of £500,000 for the development of Cork harbour.  As far as I am aware there was an announcement made to that effect.  There was a further announcement made recently at a press conference before the Minister's predecessor left office, held in Cork, at which it was said that £2,500,000 more was being made available for Cork harbour in 1977. One wonders what was the purpose of a press conference to announce something like that if it is a fact that the previous amount allocated for the development of Cork harbour has not been paid and nothing has happened. The money has been saved and set off against CIE losses.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate somewhat on this matter if what I say is correct in regard to the £500,000 supposed to be allocated for the development of Cork harbour.</P>
    <P>There was another saving of £380,000 under the subhead &ldquo;Constructional works at airports including furnishing of buildings&rdquo;.  I should imagine the main portion of that saving took place on constructional works.  Surely that is something that should not have happened at this time because such works provide much needed employment in that industry. The implementation of such works would certainly lead to fewer people drawing the dole.  Therefore I do not agree with that saving.</P>
    <P>There is a further subhead, X &ldquo;town gas subsidy&rdquo; in respect of which there was a saving of part of the subsidy of £70,000.  As was mentioned during Question Time today the report on naphtha said there was no information available on its price.  The report says that no information is available <Col N="499" /> in regard to naphtha.  We all know what naphtha is costing.  For small gas companies, such as Limerick Gas Company, it has gone up now to approximately £90.  A very large percentage of gas users are old people in this city, in Limerick and, I presume, in Cork as well.  Surely this money could be utilised to lessen the burden of providing heating and cooking facilities for many of those people.  I question the wisdom of not disbursing the amount of money voted originally in the annual estimate.</P>
    <P>We should like to know why these things have happened particularly with regard to the question of grants for harbours.  Such work would have provided badly-needed employment as well as implementing what the Government undertook to do during the past 12 months.  In the light of the press conference of two weeks ago at which it was announced that an extra £2,500,000 would be given to Cork harbour in the coming year, it will be extremely difficult for anybody to believe that that will happen if they did not provide the money they said they would in the current year.  I believe also that the saving effected on gas should have been utilised to the full in assisting people so dependent on it in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>The amount of money is small but it would be of some help to those people, particularly older people, who are dependent on gas.  Speaking of energy in general, we are facing an increase in cost of possibly something in the region of 10 to 17 per cent during January.  The OPEC conference is scheduled for 15th December and it seems that prices will escalate.  This situation raises further difficulties for us.  The Minister has before him at present a report on the conservation of energy, including gas.  I would be very critical in regard to that report because it is incomplete and from what I have read of it so far it is not worth the money spent on it&mdash;about £5,000.  We should be tackling the base of the energy problem. In other words, we should be endeavouring to ensure supplies and also to put ourselves in the position of <Col N="500" /> being able to do something about the cost factor.  One of the first steps in this direction would be to set up the further refining capacity that is badly needed.  In this regard the Minister for Finance can take immediate action by reducing the taxation content on energy to industry, road users and to all those who use the various forms of energy, particularly oil.  The extra taxation that has been imposed in this area during the past three years has added considerably to the problem created by the OPEC countries in increasing costs.</P>
    <P>I note that CIE are offering most of their hotels for sale.  I do not think they are free to sell these establishments without the matter coming first before this House but perhaps the Minister will confirm whether I am right.  So far as I know there is legislation preventing them from taking any such action.  The company have tried in the past to dispose of their hotels but the plan did not go ahead. However, I would ask the Minister to ensure that they are not sold without our getting the opportunity of discussing the pros and cons of the situation. Undoubtedly the situation in regard to these hotels is bad because of the failure of the tourist industry to come up to expectations.  However, we can look forward to the day when that industry will pick up again.  We all know the reasons for its decline.  CIE should consider retaining these hotels in which employment is being provided for a large number of people. There is no guarantee that those who would purchase them would continue to employ the same number of people. That is why I suggest that CIE have a duty to consider the various factors involved before proceeding with their plan in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first, to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the Department of Transport and Power and to wish him well in his new office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister told us that the increasing deficits in respect of CIE's operations are a cause of grave concern, that the board share this concern and are making a determined effort to arrest the escalating deficits by way of the implementation <Col N="501" /> of productivity and cost-production schemes.  One wonders whether the plan to dispose of the company's hotels is part of that scheme.  It is a pity that notice of the company's intention in this regard was not given to us at the time we were discussing a Private Members' motion last week on the question of tourism. Had this information been available to us then we could have discussed this whole question.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any information as to whether CIE have discussed this proposed sale with Bord Fáilte?  I wonder whether they have considered fully the implications of what they are doing for the future of the tourist trade.  A week ago we drew the attention of the Minister to the problems facing that industry.  During the year we suggested remedies which in our opinion would save the industry but our advice was not taken.  We have the sad situation now of a big fall-off in the number of tourists coming here from Britain.  It is important that this decline be arrested because that market is our most immediate and most lucrative.  The fall-off was in the region of 47,000.</P>
    <P>During the debate last week the Minister told us that he foresaw a bright future for the industry.  CIE are very much involved in tourism, but it would seem to be an admission of failure on their part to sell off five of their hotels.  It was reported in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> that CIE intend selling the hotels individually and not as a chain and that they considered that these establishments could be operated best by the private sector.</P>
    <P>As our spokesman on Transport and Power has indicated, it is probable that the company have not the right to dispose of these premises without the matter coming first before this House.  It is my hope that the matter will be debated here before permission is granted for the sale of the hotels, because this would give us an opportunity of discussing in detail the implications of the move for the tourist industry.  If it should transpire that because CIE are unable to secure purchasers for these premises they must be closed, there would be a total <Col N="502" /> loss of 289 beds&mdash;57 in Kenmare, 71 in Mulrany, 58 in Sligo and 103 in Bundoran.  It was also mentioned that they proposed to dispose of the Russell Court Hotel in Belfast, which has 300 bedrooms.  During last week's debate we expressed concern about the number of hotel closures that have taken place since the Government came into office.  We stated that 112 hotels had closed with a loss of 3,500 bedrooms, which is 15 per cent of the total rooms available.  We estimated that there would be a loss of 2,500 jobs.</P>

      <P>However, I do not think the people in Board Fáilte who are responsible for standards in the industry would weep over all the hotels that closed.  It was unfortunate that some of them closed but others had outlived their usefulness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>They have responsibility for the hotels.  I hope we will have another opportunity to discuss this matter.  The Estimate lists some of CIE's substantial losses for which subventions are required.  The Estimate does not provide for a subvention for the road freight service, which has to be operated on a commercial basis.  We have received many complaints about the reduction in freight services in many areas.  While we realise that the freight service must pay its way, it is important that all areas should be properly catered for. At the time of the closures we were told that there would be no loss of traffic and that people would not suffer in regard to deliveries.  There has been a curtailment in deliveries during the last few years.  I must admit that CIE's area managers, particularly <Col N="503" /> in the north-eastern region, are making commendable efforts to keep the service going, even where it is creating problems for them.  Passenger and freight services should not be curtailed to the extent that hardships are created.  CIE should have equipped themselves before now for the transportation of goods on pallets.  For years CIE monopolised the transportation of fertilisers and grain.  I believe that they should have developed a more efficient service at that time and equipped themselves for the change to pallets.  Had they been better equipped they would have been able to compete.</P>
      <P>The Minister should make an in-depth study of the sale of the hotels. They should not proceed with the sale of the hotels until they have discussed the matter with Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the losses referred to in the Minister's brief relate to CIE.  Everybody agrees that CIE must continue their operations because of the social aspect of their business.  I wonder if CIE have been inefficient because they know that they must continue at all costs. Deputy Leonard said that they monopolised transport for quite a long time and that they did not try to hold on to this part of their operations.  Are CIE not doing what a private company would do in similar circumstances? Are CIE top heavy?  They have redundancies at the bottom of the scale but none at the top.  CIE may have too many officers and not enough soldiers.  We are the people who vote for the allocation of moneys to CIE and we should investigate the staffing of CIE.</P>
      <P>It has been said that owner/managers would do better, but this is an admission by a State company that the private sector can do better.  I am disappointed with that admission.  We talk about CIE as a social and transport service, but surely the hotels are not a social service.  It is extraordinary that CIE are now proposing to sell their hotels.  They are valuable premises, and there is no doubt that they will have to be sold at a loss.  I agree with Deputies Barrett and Leonard that this matter should be brought before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> CIE closed the rail line between Castlebar and Ennis without providing some alternative means of transport. The Ennistymon-Loughrea service was discontinued.  Everyone who has any experience, such as I have, of Loughrea, knows what has happened. The service is nothing like what it should be.  The reason why CIE are not competitive at present is that they do not put on all the services.  One reason why we must see that the rail service is preserved is that our roads are deteriorating all over the country. We have not got the roads in those backward places.  There is the road from Castlebar to Ennis.  The road from Tuam to Athenry is the crookedest in Ireland.  You could not possibly put an efficient service on it.</P>
    <P>We should try to make CIE attractive. With the present price of petrol this is the wrong time for CIE to close down.  CIE should have the go-ahead now to provide a better service.  With some extra money they would attract a great number of people who are going by road in their own cars, if the service is provided. I did not take part in the debate on this matter here but I heard a person state that if people wanted to travel, with the service available it would be better for them to take their cars and go to Athenry instead of boarding public transport in Tuam because the connections and the time-table were so bad.  This came up in every discussion we had with CIE, that those lines would close down if they did not make a genuine attempt to facilitate the public.  We on this side of the House know that CIE must be subsidised and kept in existence, but we should see that they run their business more efficiently than they do.</P>

However, there is no point in spending time on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="505" /> I am disappointed at the manner in which the new Minister for Transport and Power introduced this Supplementary Estimate on an occasion when he had an opportunity of being able to say much more.  He was limited in what he could say in relation to this Estimate, but I am surprised and disappointed that the whole content of his speech related to the additional £3.9 million required in this Estimate for CIE, even though in fact what the House is being asked to vote is only £133,000.  I say &ldquo;only&rdquo; with tongue in cheek.  There was a great deal the Minister might have said across a wide section of the responsibility of his own Department arising from these savings amounting to £2.3 million that took place which enables the estimate of his requirements to be reduced to £133,000.  I would like to address my remarks in that direction.  I take it that I am at liberty to talk about the items covered under the subheads in the savings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does appreciate that the Chair <Col N="506" /> is just&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I appreciate that the Chair is helpless in that regard, but I can certainly comment on a situation whereby we are presented here with a bill for £3.9 million and basically we are talking about only £133,000 of that bill.  This is where I find it very inhibiting.  However, we can deal with that.</P>
      <P>The situation is that I am still, despite that, disappointed with the approach of the new Minister for Transport and Power.  I had hoped that he would comment more in his introductory remarks on the possible proposals that the board of CIE had in relation to economies.  He did say that he was aware that the board of CIE were his concern and were making a determined effort to arrest the escalating deficits through the implementation of productivity and cost reduction schemes.  The members of this House and the general public, particularly the public in Dublin city, must be very much aware of the fact that the board's determined efforts are not meeting with the success that the Minister and the board would wish. He goes on to say that it is essential that these efforts should be continued and that he as Minister would be pressing the board to pursue vigorously more practical measures to improve efficiency and secure economies in operation.  I am not going to say that his predecessor did not say it, but the situation as far as CIE are concerned is such that we have reached the point when the Minister should spell out what he thinks of the measures being taken by CIE in relation to increased productivity or, if you like, making the operation less costly and more economic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened recently to a radio interview in which a trade union official working in the CIE establishment categorically stated that the bus timetables issued by CIE in relation to the Dublin city bus service operation were fictitious, imaginary and false, in that with the number of buses in service and the capacity that CIE had it was impossible to imagine the service that CIE promised in relation to a given bus route.  The fleet that CIE had at their disposal could not possibly <Col N="507" /> arrange to leave the starting points or termini, whichever one likes to call them, on the city edge at 11.04, again at 11.13 and again at 11.56.  It just was not on.  There were not as many buses operating on that route as there could be even if we did not have a man on the radio between 8 o'clock and 9 o'clock in the morning and between 5 o'clock and 6.30 p.m. in the evening, explaining there was a blockage in O'Connell Street, or that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs by courtesy of Dublin Corporation had taken up the South Circular Road to lay cables and, because of this, the buses could not run and there were diversions.</P>
    <P>We have not had an opportunity to discuss this Estimate for some time. The Minister is now looking for £31.9 million under subhead D.1. to enable CIE to meet their commitments.  He should have been able to give us more than a re-statement of Ministerial policy that he will continue to impress on CIE the necessity to tighten things up.  We cannot blame the present Minister for anything that happened before.  He has not had time to adjust himself.  I hope he will soon state clearly and categorically what he feels is wrong with the overall operations of CIE.  The people of this country, and particularly the people of the city, are very frustrated and, to use the old cliché, something must be done.  I hope the section of the Department dealing with CIE, in conjunction with the board of CIE, will do something positive about it.</P>
    <P>The grants to CIE come under several headings.  There is the grant in respect of rail passenger services under the EEC regulation, and the grant in respect of public service obligations not covered by the EEC regulation, railway infrastructure costs and residual deficits, as permitted by the EEC regulation.  The spending of money by CIE to improve their railheads must be considered in that context. If there is a disimprovement by reason of the shedding of what is traditionally regarded as CIE accommodation in CIE hotels that must also come under the heading of subhead D.1.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> A wave of annoyance is spreading across the middle and southern part of the country because of the treatment being meted out to workers and farmers all the way from Limerick to Rosslare Harbour by CIE.  This is an example of the efforts by the board of CIE going haywire.  The Minister said there was a substantial decrease in rail freight carryings.  That was one of the two major facts responsible for this increased Estimate.  I have to accept that the wage agreement has a serious bearing on the matter, but I wonder whether the additional CIE wage bill of £2.4 million is built into that to let the workers take the rap for almost two-thirds of this increase, whereas the balance of £1.5 million is due largely to a reduction in railway traffic.</P>
    <P>In Christmas week next year, will the Minister come to the House looking for another £3 million or £4 million and blame it on the serious decline in the rail passenger traffic, due to the general economic recession? We had a debate earlier this year about the Limerick-Claremorris line.  If the Rosslare-Limerick Junction line is closed there must be a fall-off in income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Net income, I imagine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister drew attention to that.  The Minister was very conscious of my remark about income.  In his statement he made no reference to net income. When supplementary estimates are brought into this House at this time, there is an assumption that they will be rushed through quickly.  Of necessity they have to be let through.  We are trying to facilitate the Government as much as possible.  It is rather significant that net income does not seem to have entered the Minister's mind when he was preparing his speech.  A few moments ago I said something more needs to be done than that the Minister should make the pious observation that he will impress on the board of CIE the need to pursue vigorously all practicable measures to improve efficiency and to secure economies in operation, without spelling out where he thought that could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> He will probably say that is a matter for the board of CIE, but the board could do with a bit of nudging from the Minister.  From the reports I have received, Ministers of the Government, without making a particular reference to the Minister for Transport and Power, do quite an amount of nudging of boards in various directions. In his speech when the Minister had the opportunity of giving us some idea of the direction in which he would like the board to steer he dodged again.  Earlier on he told us that the effect of the increase in costs and the short-fall in revenue have been partially offset by an increase in productivity.  Could he tell us in what way this partial improvement in productivity has been brought about? We know about the present difficulties in Dublin in regard to the cutting down of services.  The board apparently believe services will be just as good with fewer buses.  On the other hand, the union decided that cutting down should not be implemented until after Christmas because people could not do without extra buses during this period and we finished up with no buses at all for a while.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a great advantage at the moment and I am sure he knows it.  He has the advantage in replying to this debate of giving us some of his own ideas without consultation with either CIE or his own officials. He is new to the job and I am sure he must have a number of ideas of his own.  When I was on that side of the House the Minister had the capacity to speak eloquently on a diversity of matters.  His brief was never confined. He was expert on local government. He could turn his hand to many subjects, and I am sure he now has ideas of his own as to how the operations of CIE could be improved and I hope he will give us the benefit of some of those ideas without any research because, when a subject is researched, a Minister becomes inhibited.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate we do not have an opportunity of saying all the things we would like to say in connection with the saving in travelling expenses, redundancy, harbours and rural electrification. The saving on rural electrification amazes me.  Another saving <Col N="510" /> arises through the non-spending of money on airport development.  Now recently we had a very interesting television programme about a town gas supply in a certain area, and it is extraordinary that we should have saved money on rural electrification and yet cannot discuss a subject the country is very anxious should be discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, rather late in the day and late in the year, but I wish him every success in his new appointment.  If he had had in the Department of Lands the amount of money being voted here to CIE I am sure he would have made a great job of Lands.  He did reasonably well, but he could have done a hell of a lot better if he had had this money. I claim to have more experience of CIE, the Dublin buses and public transport than the Minister, some of it not all that happy.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> But the Deputy survived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I survived, and damn lucky I was to survive, and I hope when it comes to the end of this year or, possibly, the end of next year CIE will have a few quid to pay my expenses. However, that is beside the point.  There is an extra £4 million in this Estimate for CIE and that prompts me to deal with a matter near and dear to the hearts of the people of Wexford and to the hearts of Deputies and Senators in four other constituencies.  We have here an additional £4 million bringing the total up to £31 million odd.  CIE propose &mdash;I would not be surprised to learn it is a firm decision&mdash;to close down one of the most important rail links, the stretch from Rosslare Harbour to Limerick Junction, and the idea, according to CIE, is to save a certain sum of money.  It is very difficult for the ordinary Deputy to find out how much they propose to save.  We have heard various figures&mdash;£150,000 to £500,000 has been mentioned.  I trust the Minister will give us some realistic figure.  With CIE getting a bonus of £4 million here it is difficult to understand why they should propose to close down this most important rail <Col N="511" /> link in order to save £150,000 or £500,000.</P>
      <P>I am grievously disappointed with CIE on one score.  On 26th August last I brought a very strong deputation of Wexford county councillors, beet growers, members of the committee of agriculture, parents of children attending school in Waterford and representatives of employees working in Waterford to meet the general manager of CIE, Mr. Higgins, and his top brass in Heuston Station. That discussion lasted something under 15 minutes, less time than I have in which to speak here this evening. The reason it only lasted 15 minutes, and I want to put this on record here as I and that deputation have put it on record elsewhere&mdash;is because on that day the general manager of CIE gave a firm commitment, a solemn undertaking, to that deputation that that rail link between Rosslare and Waterford&mdash;we were interested more in that line than the whole line in question&mdash;would not be closed until there was a suitable road alternative from the south east of Wexford into Kilkenny and then to Waterford.  Now, just a few months later, he tells us that that line will be closed down.  Had the Minister told us when we met him that it was not economic to keep the line open we would have argued with him and given him the reasons why it should be kept open, but we did not do so because of the undertaking he gave us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The saving suggested is something in the region of £500,000, or possibly £250,000, and when one bears in mind that the Dublin bus service will this year lose £6 million it is hard to understand why CIE are closing down a line that is so important to the south east. Rosslare Harbour is possibly the most important port in Ireland.  Thousands of visitors use that port annually, but if this line is closed that port will be downgraded.  It should be remembered that an additional service to the continent from Rosslare will be introduced next year.  The alternative to the rail link is so fantastic that it is like a Christmas story or a fairy tale. <Col N="512" /> They are away up in the clouds when they suggest that the Barrow viaduct could be converted into a bridge to take the road traffic from that part of the country.  I do not think there is any hope that that could happen.  Any board set up by the planning authority who would uphold the decisions that will come from Wexford and Kilkenny county councils on that application would be stone mad.  It is a railway bridge and nothing else, and no matter what effort is made to convert it it could not be used for heavy traffic. Only one vehicle at a time could cross it and the approach roads to it are non-existent.  It would be impossible to convert it.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that a well-known company are prepared to provide a toll bridge over the Barrow, but Wexford County Council estimate that it would cost between £1 million and £2 million to provide approach roads to the bridge.  If any of the juggernauts that come from the continent broke down in the tunnel at that bridge they could be there for six months and block the bridge to other traffic.  We should also bear in mind the school children who travel from south Wexford to Waterford to school.  The closing of this line would mean a great hardship to them.  It would also be a hardship on the workers in that area who travel to Waterford.  The proposed bus service to replace the rail link from Rosslare Harbour through New Ross and on to Waterford would mean an additional 30 miles or one hour's travelling per day for these people.</P>
    <P>Another important matter to bear in mind is the fact that south Wexford provides in the region of 50 per cent of the beet used in the Thurles sugar factory.  It would not be possible to transport that beet if the rail link was closed.  If the rail link is closed the Thurles factory will close for want of raw material and the farmers of Wexford will go out of production of beet.</P>
