      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he has received a report from Bord Fáilte regarding the effects of the budget on tourism; and, if so, if he will state the recommendations it contains.</P>

      <P>I receive submissions from, and have discussions with Bord Fáilte on a continuing basis on all aspects of tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that in dealings with all the State-sponsored bodies associated with my Department there is a constant flow, back and forth, of discussion, correspondence and reportage.  These exchanges would not be of any value unless they were quite free and uninhibited and those essential qualities can be assured only on the basis that the content of the exchanges is not normally made public.  The only exception which is usual but not, indeed, inevitable, occurs where these activities <Col N="2" /> lead to the announcement of policy decisions either by myself or the body concerned and even then details of the prior debate would not usually be released.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if, in view of the fact that due to higher capital and running costs the road haulage sector now find that they cannot compete with UK hauliers, he intends taking any action in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Competition between Irish and UK hauliers arises only in the international haulage field as UK hauliers are not entitled to engage in point to point transport within the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main international activity of the Irish road haulage sector in so far as roll-on/roll-off traffic is concerned is related to the export of meat.  This is one of our most important exports and, as the Deputy will no doubt <Col N="3" /> agree, it is vital for the economy that there should be no hold up in the export of this commodity.  In order, therefore, to ensure adequacy of transport, it has been the policy for a number of years to grant licences freely to UK and other foreign hauliers for the temporary importation of vehicles into the State for the purpose of exporting Irish meat.  Likewise, merchandise licences are freely granted to Irish hauliers who wish to participate or increase their participation in the movement of this important traffic.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a substantial increase in the number of Irish hauliers involved in the export of meat and I am glad to be able to tell the Deputy that Irish hauliers have succeeded in increasing their share of this traffic travelling on roll-on/roll-off ferry services from 23 per cent in 1973 to 50 per cent in 1975.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I do not accept that the Irish road haulage sector cannot compete in this area with UK hauliers.</P>
    <P>I freely acknowledge, however, that Irish hauliers are subject to a number of competitive disadvantages <i>vis-á-vis</i> UK hauliers due, <i>inter alia,</i> to the fact that the capital and running costs which the Irish haulier has to bear are, for a number of reasons, higher than in the UK for the same type of vehicle.</P>
    <P>In the interest of building up an efficient international haulage industry, I myself am very anxious that Irish hauliers should be given every opportunity to compete with foreign hauliers.</P>
    <P>The only way open to me as Minister for Transport and Power to take effective action to promote the development of the Irish road haulage industry is by an appropriate amendment of road transport legislation which I foreshadowed some time ago. The text of the relevant Bill should, in fact, be in the hands of Deputies in a day or so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister had regard to the fact that trade in <Col N="4" /> the haulage of meat is likely to diminish in the coming year or two because of the drop in the slaughterings from the factories?  Further, is he aware that there are Irish trucking firms based in close proximity to Irish meat plants who have had to cease operations recently while United Kingdom truckers are doing the haulage work from Irish meat factories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware with regard to the second point made by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister it is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy gives me the names I will look into the matter.  I do not know anything about it.  I do not see the relevance of the first part of the Deputy's supplementary question.  Is he saying that the fall-off in the amount of meat going through the factories will mean a smaller demand for haulage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish proportion of the trade has grown so much, they are on the spot and I think they will continue to get the bulk of the carriage of this trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that Irish firms who have gone into the refrigerated haulage business in the last few years can expect to get a sufficiency of work to remain in business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  Of course, sufficiency of work is dependent on the through-put in the factories&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the major haulage contracts that have been given out for a considerable time now, from the North of Ireland with regard to the transportation of pipes?  There have been as many as 15 trucks each day travelling between the North of Ireland and Cork and I would say almost every haulier in the North has been employed.  Will the Minister state if CIE or any of the private hauliers here were asked to <Col N="5" /> tender for this work or were given the opportunity of transporting the pipes? If the Minister does not have this information, will he investigate the position? I am sure he knows about the scheme I am talking about; it is a major contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know who awarded the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the contract was awarded by the people who sent the pipes from Northern Ireland and I expect that is where the responsibility for the transportation really lies.  In view of the large amount of business involved and the fact that the Irish haulage trade could do with it at the moment, would it be possible to find out if some of the business could be given to Irish firms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a private contract given by a company in the North of Ireland they would give it to whoever they liked provided the price was right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the merchandise being carried are pipes for a local authority project in Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be referring to a special matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the local authority made it a condition that Irish hauliers be employed to transport the pipes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE are an organisation under the jurisdiction of the Minister.  Surely it is a matter of concern for them to see this huge amount of haulage work being carried out while they are not given an opportunity to tender for it, if they were not given that opportunity.  I am not sure on that point&mdash;perhaps they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is not sure of his facts, it would be better for him to establish what is the position before we have a discussion on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>About two months ago the Deputy came in here and made a big play about a semi-State body who were giving contracts for haulage work to some other industry.  I asked the Deputy for details but I have heard nothing since then.  I presume this is something of the same nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not even reply to that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point.  I asked for information but I did not get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the question whether CIE were asked to tender, and if there was some reason why some of the business could not be given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that there were a number of reasons why hauliers are disadvantaged; would he like to mention some of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that there is some protection for the assemblers of motor vehicles here&mdash;there is a duty on the assembled vehicle coming in which does not apply in England&mdash; makes it somewhat more expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is fuel more expensive also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not necessarily.  If they are engaged in international haulage, they buy the fuel outside the country.  They would purchase the bulk of their fuel outside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases where everything else is equal, price and quality of service coming from Irish firms, would the Minister use his good offices, especially with Irish meat plants to recommend that Irish haulage firms be engaged?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will ensure through Fóir Teoranta that a firm in County Cavan (name supplied) is maintained as a viable industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the company in question is now in receivership.</P>
      <P>Decisions regarding the future of the company are a matter in the first instance for the Receiver.  I understand however, that it is the intention of the Receiver in the short-term to continue manufacturing and maintain employment; in the longer term to seek to dispose of the company as a going concern.  I am certainly very anxious that employment in the company's factories should be maintained and put on a sound basis.</P>
      <P>So far as Fóir Teoranta is concerned the provision of assistance in any particular case is a matter to be decided on by the board of Fóir in the light of the statutory criteria governing such applications. In this case, I have no doubt that Fóir will be prepared to consider sympathetically any worthwhile proposition for assistance aimed at enabling the operation of the company to continue on a permanent basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that this firm has full order books at present?  I am satisfied, from an examination of the criteria statutorily laid down for Fóir Teoranta, that this branch of the firm in Kings-court satisfied that criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The firm is now in receivership and the application for that move came from another creditor, not Fóir.  I understand that Fóir is in close contact with the firm and has made careful assessment of what is necessary.  Of course, Fóir make their own decisions in the light of the statutory criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary saying that when the firm is in receivership Fóir Teoranta is inhibited from making an offer which would prolong the life of the industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="8" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The management of the firm in that situation is the responsibility, in the first instance, of the Receiver.  He is the person to decide whether he wishes to avail of a particular credit source.  I can tell the Deputy that the Receiver in this instance has placed advertisements in a number of newspapers recently seeking people to take over this firm as a going concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if Fóir Teoranta is inhibited by the fact that the firm is in receivership&mdash;not at the request of Fóir Teoranta&mdash;does it stop Fóir Teoranta from offering at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say definitely that it would stop them or otherwise but the decision to apply for the loan from Fóir is the first prerequisite and that decision rests now with the Receiver.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if article 135 of the Treaty of Accession of Ireland to the EEC permits unilateral action to be taken by the Irish Government with regard to import controls; and, if so, if the Government has considered invoking this article to protect those Irish industries which are in immediate and severe danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 135 of the Act of Accession to the EEC does not permit unilateral action to be taken by the Irish Government with regard to import controls.  It provides that a new member State may apply to the EEC Commission for authority to take protective measures to deal with economic difficulties in particular sectors of industry during the period to 31st December, 1977.  It is for the Commission to determine the measures which may be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have successfully invoked Article 135 on behalf of the Irish footwear industry.  In July, 1975, the EEC Commission authorised certain protective measures for this industry and in December, 1975, following a second application by the Government, the Commission <Col N="9" /> authorised further protective measures covering the six-months' period to 30th June, 1976.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that, whenever circumstances so warrant, the Government will take the action open to it under Article 135 of the Act of Accession.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that when speaking on a Private Members' motion, submitted by Fianna Fáil, in June, 1975, he, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, stated that not only would the Government not move on this article but that even if they could it would be undesirable to do so?  By the end of that month the Government changed their mind and decided to invoke Article 135.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government must balance carefully their decision in applying under Article 135.  If the Deputy reads that article he will find that the fourth subarticle states that in the same circumstances and according to the same procedures, any original member state may apply for authorisation to take protective measures in regard to one or more new member states.  There is a question of reciprocity here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary agree that it is an extraordinary situation to have two Government spokesmen in June stating that they would not invoke this article and, by the end of June, following pressure from this side of the House, a decision was taken to invoke the article?  In fact, we advocated that the Government should have resorted to this article in January, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell asked if unilateral action could be taken by the Government under this article but this is not the case.  Any action taken by the Government must be agreed to by the Commission and, therefore, the case must be well based.</P>

      <P>Has it not been the practice in the past, as in the case of the Italian deposit scheme in 1974, and the action taken by the French government in the matter of Italian wine last year, for individual governments to take unilateral action pending the decision of the Commission under Article 135?  Could the Irish Government not take action similar to that taken by the Italian and French governments?</P>

      <P>As I have previously explained, it is the intention to prepare four Bills dealing with different aspects of consumer protection.  Much greater difficulties and complexities were encountered in preparing this legislation than had been expected, but I have now completed proposals for the first of these Bills and, as I indicated in reply to a question on 13th March last, I hope to circulate the Bill before the summer recess.  I have also made considerable progress with the preparation of the second Bill, but it is now unlikely that it can be circulated until after the summer recess.</P>

However, in the case of insurance companies the Minister has a special responsibility as a supervisory authority under the Insurance Acts to ensure the solvency of the companies and the Minister will obviously be concerned to ensure in the negotiations here that the solvency of both companies is preserved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the 14 boys to whom the Deputy is referring are pupils of Coláiste Einde, Galway.  The position in these cases is as follows: Ten are being paid reduced grants because annual parental income is in excess of the stipulated limit.  Three are being paid reduced grants pending receipt of further information regarding parental income. One has not been awarded a grant because his place of residence is within the range of the transport services operating to a suitable day centre providing free secondary education.</P>

      <P>Policy in this matter has been indicated in a statement which was issued on 12th February 1976 in the following terms:</P>
      <P>Because of the diffculties experienced in the operation of school transport services in the Annagry parish, the Minister for Education. Mr. Richard Burke, TD, has decided to withdraw all school transport services in the parish with effect on and from Monday, 16th February, 1976. These services will not be restored unless and until some accommodation has been arrived at locally, sufficient to ensure to the satisfaction of the Minister and no further disruption of services will occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the protracted negotiations that have taken place at local level and can he explain why, in spite of all appeals, he has refused to send a representative down to discuss with the aggrieved parties this problem which is becoming <Col N="19" /> aggravated by its continuation and which is engendering a good deal of acrimony which can only result in making the position more and more difficult as time goes on?  Is he aware the Minister himself is not free of blame?  He has promised transport and withdrawn it, at times curtailed it and at other times taken action in one case and no action in another case, and all this has exacerbated a serious situation and the school is now closed because of a strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true that departmental officials have not tried to solve this.  They have tried very hard both by visiting the area and receiving deputations.  With regard to the point about my personally exacerbating the situation, I would have thought the suggestions made in 1973 should have solved the problem and I regret very much the fact that they did not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that a Government Department finding a difficult problem and running away from it is a very weak-kneed approach to the whole business, and would he not consider, seeing that Rann na Feirsde has a particularly strong claim on the type of philosophy which he enunciated in regard to another area of the country, he should take steps at once to provide the pupils with school transport?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bit of a simplification to suggest that the children from the Mullaghduff area are not involved.

If I got any indication from the two boards of management or from any reputable sector of that population that a local solution had been worked out to the satisfaction of both schools, then I would be delighted to send a representative to hear the outcome of the discussions.</P>

      <P>Although the provisional crime figures for 1975 show an increase on the 1974 figures and the level now obtaining is certainly a cause of concern, I think it is seriously overstating it to say that crime is getting out of hand.  The fact is that the position here is considerably better than that in very many other countries.  I say that to put the matter in perspective, not to minimise the problem.</P>
      <P>The financial allocation for police services amounts to £57.8 million this year and the Garda authorities are always conscious of the need to make the best possible use of the available resources.  To assist them further in this, management consultants have been engaged to carry out an examination of the systems of review and control of Garda strength with a view to ensuring the most efficient deployment of the force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal are not prohibited from sitting at a provincial centre but its members were selected because of their professional experience, and in particular their experience, of jury awards, so it has to be borne in mind that, as busy practitioners, they could not reasonably be expected to absent themselves from their own professional practice for long periods.  Accordingly, while I think it is possible that they might decide occasionally to sit at a provincial centre, it is not a matter in which I would feel justified in making any suggestion to the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> As regards expenses, the scheme provides that the tribunal may at their discretion pay the necessary and reasonable expenses of witnesses.  However, it is to be borne in mind also that the procedure of the tribunal is an informal one and many if not most of the cases are dealt with without requiring the personal attendance either of the applicant or of any other witness since the tribunal accept appropriate written statements and other documentary evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph 35 of the scheme provides that a decision by the tribunal on a claim may be taken in the first instance by a duly authorised officer of the tribunal where the amount involved does not exceed £250.  Where a claim is for a sum greater than that or where the claimant is not satisfied with the decision of the officer concerned&mdash;the decision will normally be taken by one member of the tribunal&mdash;the case is usually decided on foot of the completed application form and other documentation submitted by the claimant.  His appearance before the tribunal is unnecessary. However, the tribunal have discretion to hear any claim at a hearing before three of their members and a person who is dissatisfied with a decision given by one member may have his claim so heard also.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained to the Deputy in reply to a similar question on 13th March, 1975, Official Report, Volume 279, columns 596 to 599, all proposals of this nature have to be considered in the first place by the National Rehabilitation Board to ensure that they are in conformity with the national scheme recommended in the report of a special working party some time ago.  The board have found it necessary first to secure additional technical <Col N="37" /> advice to assist them in assessing the various proposals being put forward but I understand that they expect in the early future to be in a position to give their views on the Ballindine proposal. I think I should again point out to the Deputy, as I did on the previous occasion, that there are features of this proposal which are unlikely to make it acceptable for support from public funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this association have had sufficient initiative and enterprise to go ahead and find a rehabilitation centre, thereby avoiding the necessity of the utilisation of public funds for this purpose, would the Minister not consider it only fair that a substantial grant be made available now to them particularly since the centre is now in being as distinct from many other plans and proposals whcih are still very much in the air?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The centre is partially in being.  Regarding the initial information from the organisation to the Department, I explained the whole situation to the Deputy some time ago.  I do not consider it correct that any organisation should go ahead and build an institution without reference either to the Department or, as it was in this instance, to the National Rehabilitation Board and merely to present a bill afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a question of going ahead and then presenting a bill.  This association have made very commendable efforts to provide this centre.  Does the Minister not agree that that type of effort by voluntary organisations is the sort of thing we want?  Even at this stage would be or his Parliamentary Secretary not be prepared to inspect this centre with a view to seeing whether or not it merits support from the Department?  I suggest to him that if either he or his Parliamentary Secretary were to do that they would have no hesitation in making an advance available because it is just the sort of voluntary effort we need in these areas.</P>

I see from the published Bill that a section provides for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to send for papers, persons and things of that nature and in default of the person complying with the request for attendance or to submit the documents to the committee there is a penalty on conviction of £300 and/or six months' imprisonment.

      <P>It is true that the matter which Deputy Lynch mentioned was not adverted to but the advice which the Government acted on was that in the passage of this Bill it was as well to include this section as well.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion when this matter was before the House I was dealing with the employment contributions and I described them as a tax on employment.  I was about to put on the record of the House, in relation to the new rates and the present rates, the huge increases that will have to be paid by the employer and the employee.  As we know, the present rate for a man is £2.47 for the employer and £1.64 for the employee, giving a total of £4.11.  The proposed new rate for the employer is £3.50 and for the employee £2.14, giving a total of £5.64.  The differential for women is, present rate, employer £2.45, employee £1.58, giving a total of £4.03.  The proposed new rate for a woman is, employer, £3.48, employee, £2.08, giving a total of £5.56. The differential between the employment contribution for a man as against a woman is £5.64, as against £5.56, a difference of eight pence.  I assume the Parliamentary Secretary is considering the possibility of abandoning that difference at some time having regard to the often stated views of many Members of this House on the whole question of equal pay.  If people are to be given equal money for work of equal value then I expect the insurance contribution rates will be the same and we will abandon the difference between the two rates.  The difference is tiny at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the one hand we have employment premiums.  Employers are being given money to take on employees. On the other hand they are now being asked to pay the savage increases in employment tax.  They are massive increases.  This tax on employment is a disincentive.  It is one of the most discouraging aspects of the Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary said there is an average 10 per cent increase in <Col N="56" /> rates of payment, apart from certain other things.  We have to look at the spiralling price increases in the area of food in particular.  As I understand and appreciate the whole concept of social welfare, one of the great features of it is that the less well off should be subvented by the State and given sufficient money to live on. Unfortunately at the moment we cannot give them enough.  We have to set a standard and give them money to enable them to subsist.  These are people who are most hurt by price increases.  We read in the newspapers last week that there was a 7.1 per cent rise in prices for the three months to February of this year.  This suggests an annual rate of 28 per cent in price increases.</P>
    <P>It is a sorry feature of the Social Welfare Bill that the Parliamentary Secretary can give only a 10 per cent increase to those most in need.  It is unfortunate, and it reflects the Government's incapacity to deal with our whole economic structure.  There is another feature of this Bill which I have no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will deal with in his reply.  On the last occasion I spoke for an hour on this Bill.  I have said what I wished to say.  I do not want to take up the time of the House unnecessarily. Others may wish to make contributions. The Bill has to go to the Seanad and the Parliamentary Secretary is anxious to get it through both Houses as quickly as possible.  We will not stand in his way in that respect.  I assume the shorter the contributions the better.</P>
    <P>There is a matter which I have a public duty to raise, that is, the question of confidentiality in the area of social welfare benefits.  How confidentail is confidential in the hands of the Department of Social Welfare?  It is a matter of grave concern that on Saturday last when I was in Ross's Hotel at my usual citizens' advice bureau, I received a telephone call from a journalist from a Sunday newspaper indicating that Government documents giving intimate personal details of the lives of many people were found in a Dublin street. I appreciate that this matter is not <Col N="57" /> strictly relevant to the Social Welfare Bill and I would appreciate it if you, Sir, would give me a little latitude on it.  I understand that I may possibly be bending the rules somewhat.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not discuss the matter. On several occasions the Chair has drawn the attention of the Deputy to this matter.  I have allowed him latitude far beyond what should have been allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the latitude I have been allowed.  It is a latitude that I think can only go towards the continued co-operation between me and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I have always found the Leas-Cheann Comhairle an extremely fair chairman and well able to carry the burden of the dignity of the House, as it was described by his colleague.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has done that well.</P>
      <P>I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary as a matter of urgency to tell us how his poverty campaign is going ahead.  Some time ago he announced he would look into this whole matter and, in a general fashion, it was more or less decided that poverty was not specifically related to the lack of finance, that poverty extended in other ways.  It could be the lack of education, the lack of awareness of a person's entitlement, lack of direction and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is another aspect and it has been mentioned by the Leader of our party, namely, that the Government have been looking for wage restraint and a pay pause in the recent past.  Over the weekend the Minister for Finance has been calling for such restraint and for a <Col N="62" /> pay pause but, at the same time, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has allowed huge increases in the price of butter and gas.  It is very difficult to relate those two points. Fianna Fáil in opposition have been responsible and we have urged that there should be restraint at all time but, at the same time, it is very difficult to look for such restraint when those who ask for it cannot restrain themselves.  To say the least, the Government have been lacking in restraint.  They have done nothing to help the urban dweller to survive. Day in and day out the middle income group in particular&mdash;and the lower income group&mdash;are being hammered out of existence by continual price increases, in addition to the huge burden of income tax, ESB charges and so on.  The Government appear to be doing nothing to help or to encourage them.</P>
    <P>The National Prices Commission to some extent have done good work. They have held prices down in certain areas but they do not appear to be fulfilling their task completely.  We would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to urge his Government to mount an attack on prices generally. People who come within the terms of this Social Welfare Bill are being told they will be given a 10 per cent increase in their rates of payment but, at the same time, they have to pay these dreadful price increases.</P>
    <P>I wish the Parliamentary Secretary well and I thank the officials for their co-operation.  I can assure him and his officials that my raising of the matter of confidential documents that were found on the streets of Dublin was not intended to be a witch-hunt against them&mdash;quite the contrary.</P>

      <P>There is a general feeling that we are giving too many hand-outs to people in receipt of benefits.  It is necessary to dispel this notion.  Despite what people may allege, the unemployed do not want to remain unemployed.  They find it demoralising and degrading to continue receiving social welfare benefits and would prefer to have employment. They are crying out for employment and do not want to continue to be a burden on the State. I say that unequivocally.  I have come in close contact with these people. They do not want handouts.  It is necessary for us to dispel the notion which is too prevalent among the middle and upper classes that these people are drones or parasites in our community.  If anybody feels that this is the case and wishes to make such an allegation, I ask him to visit the employment exchanges and talk to recipients of this benefit.  They feel ashamed collecting the benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>A recent document issued by the Confederation of Irish Industry, a body not noted for its over-concern for the under-privileged in our community, pointed to the fact that there has been a 50 per cent drop in living standards of those on social welfare benefits.  It is important to bear this in mind when talking about the people who are alleged to be the drones and parasites in our community.  This gives rise to considerable poverty and poverty is experienced at this level.  I recognise <Col N="64" /> the limits and the constraints on the Parliamentary Secretary and I know there is a limit to the size of the national cake and to what he can give out, but I wonder if the 10 per cent increase in social welfare benefits proposed here is intended to cover the entire year.  Will there be a further review in July, having regard to the increases in the cost of living that will take place between now and then?  Already this year we have experienced a massive increase in prices which are devastating to these people.  People can talk glibly about money problems but pennies mean a lot to the people I am referring to. We are not talking about a price rise that will only be considered in terms of a statistic; we are talking about the fact that the livelihood of those people is affected.  Many of them are living below subsistence level.</P>
      <P>I welcome the extension of the pay-related benefit.  Do we understand what happens when a man's stamps run out?  That man has to go on unemployment assistance and, if he is not careful, he may find that that assistance will not take effect for some time because the investigation is a protracted one.  He may find himself seeking home assistance for his family and himself for a number of weeks while waiting for unemployment assistance.  We also find that single people who cannot obtain employment do not get unemployment assistance because they are living at home.  I know of hundreds of people who are receiving no money because they are living at home. After their stamps expire they find that because there is a wage earner in their house they are not entitled to any unemployment assistance.  Last week I highlighted the case of a school leaver but in many other cases skilled craftsmen are affected.  Many of these school leavers who, because they did not have enough points were unable to gain admission to the university, are on the slag heap, are demoralised and have lost confidence. They apply for benefit but are in an extraordinary situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I referred to the case of an 18-year-old who received 10p per <Col N="65" /> week.  It took more than six weeks to determine whether or not he was entitled to unemployment assistance. At the end of that investigation the Department found that he was only entitled to 10p per week by virtue of the fact that he was living at home. His father was in receipt of the princely wage of £37 per week. On investigation I found that the Department of Social Welfare allowed £25 of that man's wages for himself and his wife and £4 per week rent. The Department estimated the needs of the son in that household as £8.10 which meant that he was entitled to an allowance of 10p per week.  That youth was paid 66p back money and he is asked to collect his 10p allowance once per week.  It costs him 16p to travel by bus to the exchange and 16p to go home; 32p to collect 10p per week.</P>
    <P>It is time we looked at this whole question of unemployment assistance especially with regard to those who are in need.  They are not drones or parasites; these people are losing their respect and their dignity.  Because they live at home they are offered a paltry sum of 10p per week or nothing at all.  The mother of the youth I have referred to told me she found it humiliating to have him travel to collect 10p per week.  She would prefer if he got nothing.  Her son is now demoralised.  I had a letter from the Mayor of Wexford who informed me that he knows of a number of cases where unemployment assistance of 10p is being paid to people.</P>
    <P>It is time we realised that there are people in our midst who are genuinely poor and who find themselves unable to obtain employment.  There is an obligation on the State to provide for these people.  I know the system is subject to abuse but it is important that we do not consign these people to the situation where we offer them 10p per week to provide for themselves. The alternative for these people is to move out of their own home and seek accommodation in a hostel.  I have learned that it is not possible to get accommodation in a hostel for less than £7 per week; in some cases it costs £8 per week. Therefore, we have this ironic situation: <Col N="66" /> if a young person leaves home he will qualify for assistance at the rate of £8.10 per week but it will cost at least £7 per week for bed and breakfast in a hostel and if he stays at home he gets nothing.</P>
    <P>I should also like to raise the question of girls in our society.  In my view there is gross discrimination operated by the Department of Social Welfare against women by not permitting girls to claim unemployment assistance. This is a serious matter.  A different principle is applied in such cases by the Department.  If they have no stamps, they cannot claim unemployment assistance.  There is a lot of talk about eliminating certain areas of discrimination but in my opinion this is blatant discrimination and the sooner something is done about it the better. I realise the financial problems in our society but the onus is on the Minister for Social Welfare, and his Parliamentary Secretary, to make a commitment to phase this out as soon as possible.  We had heartening words from the Taoiseach that we are on the way up, that the good times are coming and for this reason we should get such a commitment from the Parliamentary Secretary.  We should get a commitment that this discrimination against girls should stop.  It is long overdue.  It was carried on by our predecessors with impunity but the time has come to end it.  It would be a great example of a reforming Government if they took action in this area.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the whole question of confidentiality about applications for unemployment benefit or assistance or for disability benefits. We are living in an age when the State intrudes more and more in our lives.  We are asked to provide more and more personal and confidential information, information about jobs, information as to why a man left a job or why he did not return to work, why he is out sick and what his complaint is.  We are asked to provide this information to junior officials.  I have always felt very strongly about this and as a Parliament we will have to debate this matter and decide what information must be provided.  We will have to decide to whom this <Col N="67" /> information should be given and what guarantees are provided to protect confidentiality.  Junior officials may not always appreciate the importance of confidentiality and this information is available to junior officials.  We are living in a very small country and the matter is a serious one.  On one occasion I had to go to the Secretary of the Department of Social Welfare. He was most courteous and gave me permission to put wrong information on a social welfare certificate.  Had I put the true nature of the illness the individual involved could have been stigmatised.  That is something we should always remember.  Information goes the rounds of the Department and guarantees will have to be given for the protection of those concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the incident.  I am talking about the overall policy of the Department. I will not labour the point.  There is growing annoyance because employees are being asked to contribute more and more by way of social welfare contribution.  When in Opposition I always believed the employee was making too big a contribution.  I believed the State was not contributing enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every time social welfare benefits improve there is an increase in the stamp.  Deputy Andrews said employers are screaming to high heaven about this and it is a matter to which the Minister for Finance referred. <Col N="68" /> Employers here are paying less than their counterparts in Europe and the State is paying more than its share. It is only natural that the Minister should say that the State's contribution would be phased out and the employers' contribution gradually increased to bring it into line with Europe.  That is only right.  All these contributions are tax deductible as part of expenses and so it is only fair that employers should make some contribution towards their employees. An employee is no longer a disposable asset who, if he falls ill, can be replaced. We have to look at things in a more enlightened way now and I cannot see any reason for disquiet on the part of employers in regard to contributions.</P>
    <P>There are employers who still refuse to stamp cards.  We know that the employee will be compensated because the State will make good the contributions.  I believe harsher penalties should be imposed on employers who fail to stamp cards.  They are really guilty of false pretences which is a serious crime.  I think, too, when the Department is made aware that an employee's card has not been stamped the employer should be visited by an inspector to ensure that other employees' cards are being stamped.  It should not be a piecemeal operation.  The employer should be made correct the situation for all employees. Dealing with cases one at a time only makes for more work.</P>
    <P>Employees should be notified at the end of each year that their cards are being stamped.  Employers receive money from their employees to stamp their cards and, if they do not do so, it is a question of false pretences. Some employers regard the cards as the least important part of their business. It is time this situation was put right.  I realise this may put an added burden on the Department, a Department which is in closer contact with the public than any other Department of State.  I am sure the Department receive very many letters each day.</P>
    <P>They could arrange for Deputies to visit the Department of Social Welfare to see exactly what is happening inside, to let us know and, perhaps, <Col N="69" /> appreciate some of their problems.  In order to allay the employee's fears as to whether or not his cards are being stamped&mdash;in many cases he has no way of knowing&mdash;maybe at the end of the year when the Department of Social Welfare ask for the return of the cards, the employee's signature could be put on this card.  This would assure him that the card was fully stamped for the year.</P>
    <P>Some of the Department's inspectors are very sympathetic, being good human beings, and when they go out to an employer who has not stamped the cards they will say: &ldquo;I will call back again and see what you can do&rdquo;. That is a soft approach.  I recognise that some small firms have perennial problems with finance and liquidity. However, I do not think they should use the employee's contributions to fund their firm.  Though the attitude of the inspectors of the Department of Social Welfare is very humane, one wonders if it is warranted in view of the seriousness of this offence.  There have been numerous occasions when the Department have been notified that an employer is in default or is a frequent offender in this regard.  I do not think that such an offence should be allowed to continue.  We should make an example once and for all.  It is very laudable to ensure that employees are recompensed for the cards not being stamped, but many employees do not realise they can be recompensed for the fact that their cards are not stamped.  This should be publicised.</P>
    <P>Many people who are ill and send in two certificates do not hear for quite a long time.  These are people who are most in need both in regard to their home commitments and their medicines.  Sometimes these people do not sign the certificates properly. They do not address them to the right place.  Again, a little education of these people is necessary on how to send in the certificate.  This would be helpful and would probably expedite the whole system.</P>
    <P>I would once more commend the Parliamentary Secretary on making at least some attempt to cushion the under-privileged section of the community against inflation, and I would <Col N="70" /> hope that he will give us some indication, with the inflationary spiral continuing, that the situation will be reviewed by July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In their early years this Government had little to complain of in relation to the publicity they got through their performance in the field of social welfare, and it is interesting to note that the brilliance attributed so liberally to the Government, which was at that stage known as the Government of all the talents, has now lost its lustre.  The most recent casualty has been the Minister for the Gaeltacht since his somersault on Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>It is not a matter of questioning the personal commitment of the Parliamentary Secretary to those who are in need; nor is it a matter of questioning his desire to overcome the very difficult problems involved.  However, in my view, to be effective a personal commitment must have the support of the Government and particularly financial support to make the changes which are so necessary if we are to provide as we would wish for those who are unfortunate enough to be in need of social welfare benefit.</P>
      <P>Looking at the work done in relation to the Department of Social Welfare over the past three years, I cannot say that any really worthwhile progress has been made.  The flowery speeches of the Coalition Ministers on this subject, added to the lavish praise up to recently from the media, are not sufficient any more to hide this fact.  The Coalition, before the election in 1973 and for some time afterwards, promised that there would be an in depth study of the whole question of social welfare.  They proclaimed that the system as it was could not cope with the problems involved and that radical changes were necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were given to understand that from the study would evolve a complete new system conforming fully to the needs of those who had the misfortune, for one reason or another, to be dependent on social welfare. Nothing of the sort has happened.  A committee was set up to do an in depth investigation into poverty, a committee which I welcomed at the time <Col N="71" /> because I believed it would be helpful in giving us a full appreciation of the various types of poverty, how they impinged on the individual, and that with this clearer understanding of the problem in all its various facets we would know how to deal effectively with the problem.</P>
    <P>I did express at the time a fear that the Government might use committees of this kind to slow up developments which were needed and which could very obviously be made, without any particular investigation.  Little has been heard from this committee since then. Knowing the sense of commitment which permeated the individual members of the committee, I have no doubt that they are proceeding with their task with a will, but I cannot but suspect that the Government are by no means anxious to have the report submitted by the committee because of the build-up there would be to have the report implemented.  In my view it should not be necessary for us to wait until the report of the committee is finalised.  If the committee come up with worthwhile proposals on how certain types of poverty can be eliminated, they should be made public.  The Parliamentary Secretary and the Department, having got this report, should consider what should be done to overcome the problems involved.</P>
    <P>There have been no worthwhile basic changes made in our social welfare system in the past three years apart from a few minor adjustments and new schemes which were on a par with those introduced by us&mdash; assistance to prisoners' wives and single women.  The Government, when they speak of their achievements in social welfare are, in my view, relying entirely on purely technical changes, such as, financial increases in existing benefits, pensions and assistance schemes.  This point must be emphasised. As I said, nothing of fundamental value has been done in the field of social welfare.  The increases granted to social welfare beneficiaries, particularly those in the lower income groups, have not succeeded in cushioning them from the raging rate of inflation we are experiencing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> It is very easy to boast about the amounts paid now as compared with those paid in 1972-73, but unless these amounts are related to the frightening inflation increases, and unless each type of social welfare payment is isolated and examined on its own, these percentages and amounts mean very little.  This Government got a very good start with the £30 million saved on agricultural subsidies because of our entry to the EEC.  This money was used, as all parties in the general election said it would be used, for social welfare purposes.  Since then increases were granted each year, but as I pointed out on many occasions, they were not sufficient to meet increases in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I remember when the rate of inflation was 18 per cent that the Government tried to make us believe that if they gave an increase of 18 per cent to social welfare beneficiaries they were compensating them for the increase in the cost of living.  As I pointed out then, this was far from being the case.  From the moment the increase was granted the cost of living kept increasing week after week making it more difficult for the poorer sections to buy even the bare necessaries. It has been proved conclusively that the poorer people must buy in smaller quantities and, therefore, at greater cost, and that their diet is hit most by inflation and therefore, they have a much higher cost of living than the average person.  I am not happy about the progress in social welfare.  The main claim can be related to the technical financial increases which look reasonably large until they are compared with the real inflation rate and then they are quickly cut down to size.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary when he says that those in need must be cushioned against the effects of the economic recession for which the Government must take a share of the responsibility.  I was amazed when he stated that the rate of increase being given this year is designed to maintain the real value of the payments operated by his Department.  Surely he is not serious?  If he had said that due to shortage of money he regretted that <Col N="73" /> he was unable to cushion the social welfare beneficiaries, but was doing his best, we would be dealing with this Bill in a realistic way.  But to state as the Parliamentary Secretary did in his speech that an increase of 10 per cent is cushioning social welfare beneficiaries against the shocking inflation and price increases we are experiencing, is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>Before the budget was introduced it was reckoned that the rate of inflation for the coming year would be between 15 and 16 per cent.  Since the introduction of the budget it is estimated that the inflation rate will increase by a further 5½ per cent.  Therefore, the rate of inflation for the coming year is likely to be in the region of 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>How can the Parliamentary Secretary suggest that he is cushioning the poorer sections from the 20 per cent increase in the cost of living by granting them a 10 per cent all round increase? The fact is that the poor will become very much poorer and this says very little for our social conscience. If we feel that percentages are not the best way of dealing with this matter, let us take instead the actual increases. The actual increase in benefits at the personal level is about £1 a week.  In 1971-72 the previous Government granted an increase of £1 a week to old age pensioners.  It is worthwhile noting the vast change which has taken place in the purchasing power of the pound since that time.  It is only by considering the increase in that context that one can appreciate how miserly the allowances being given in this Bill are.</P>
    <P>Try to visualise the value of a pound a week at the present time taking into account the increases in coal, electricity, gas, the recent exceptional food increases, culminating with the 5½p increase in the price of butter, and increases in other commodities.  Taken together, they constitute a crushing burden on social welfare beneficiaries. Is it any wonder that many of our people who are dependent on the social welfare payments are physically frightened of the future?  People in these circumstances dread falling into debt because they realise that once this <Col N="74" /> happens there is little hope they will ever get out of it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we must show much more concern for those who are on the lower rungs of the social welfare system.  Let us take, for instance, the position of a person who is dependent solely on social assistance.  When the increases provided for in this Bill are taken into consideration he will be receiving £8.90 per week if he lives in an urban area and £8.55 per week if he is in a rural area.  Out of this income he must pay rent, rates, fuel and electricity, food and other miscellaneous bills.  At present day prices it is not possible for a person to meet his commitments on an income of that nature. If we consider the cost of even the main course meal in the Dáil restaurant, we can put an income of £8.55 per week into its proper perspective.</P>
    <P>A man with a wife and three children and whose benefit had been exhausted was getting about £19 per week before the increases provided for here.  Surely this is not a situation that any Government could be proud of. Admittedly, there may be some who fare out reasonably well on social welfare but these are emphasised by the Government, whereas those receiving puny amounts are left to struggle as best they can.  We must show more concern for those who, through no fault of their own, have lost their employment and whose benefit has been exhausted.  We know that some misdemeanours and frauds are perpetrated in regard to social welfare payments and it is important that the possibilities in this regard be eradicated.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us what steps are being taken to deal with the problem.  It must be remembered that the obtaining of money by fraud in this way reduces the amount which should be available to those who are really in need.  I support strongly the Parliamentary Secretary in his contention that those who wish to live on social welfare benefits are few in number. I would tend to agree that those who are most critical in this regard are those in steady jobs and who have never known the indignity, the depression, and the sadness associated with unemployment.  Those of us in public life have had far too much experience <Col N="75" /> in recent times of the traumatic effects experienced by those who, having worked for years in what they considered &ldquo;safe&rdquo; employment found themselves suddenly out of work and, consequently joining the queue at the employment exchange.  I wonder if the critics could appreciate the frame of mind of a man in my constituency, who, finding himself out of a job, left home every morning at the usual hour for five weeks afterwards so that his children would not be aware that he was no longer employed.  It might be worthwhile trying to visualise the loss of morale and the nerve-racking fear of a man in that position.  Without any hesitation, therefore, let us seek out the person who is defrauding in relation to public money but let us also display Christian charity for the vast majority of social welfare recipients whose one hope and ambition is to get back to work.</P>
    <P>Another serious and depressing aspect of our present economic situation is that so many of our young people are unable to find employment.  While appreciating that this is not the direct responsibility of the Parliamentary Secretary. I should have thought that he would have made some reference to it in his speech, outlining plans for the future in this regard.  I expected, too, to hear him refer to the discrimination which has been adverted to already by a number of Deputies.  I refer to the situation whereby his Department are refusing unemployment assistance to girls in a certain age group while boys in the same age group are getting this assistance.  In this age of equality one would not have expected the Parliamentary Secretary or the Government to contribute to inequality.</P>
    <P>Another serious aspect of the situation in regard to these young people is the psychological effect of not being employed but of being in receipt of unemployment benefit at this early age. The problem may arise that in some instances they may tend not to work later with unfortunate consequences not only for themselves but for the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I note that the unemployment assistance scheme for smallholders in <Col N="76" /> specific areas has been changed, that the national multiplier has been increased in some cases from £20 to £30 and in other cases from £20 to £40.  I was interested in this change but I do not propose to go into the merits or the demerits of it.  However, I consider myself justified in recollecting the speeches of Coalition Deputies and Senators in rural Mayo at the time of the West-Mayo by-election campaign when they claimed credit for the benefits of this scheme and went out of their way in an effort to frighten voters into not voting for Fianna Fáil by asserting that if Fianna Fáil were to be returned to office, smallholders would lose these benefits.  One wonders what are the sentiments of these smallholders now and whether they can ever again have any credence in what is being said by politicians.  I wonder, too, how the Coalition Deputies from that constituency are explaining the statements made during the campaign.  One must ask whether the electors are likely ever to believe in these people again.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary repeats his defence of the extension of the pay-related benefit scheme.  I do not see any reason for such defence because we are in favour of the extension. The unemployment situation is frightening but it is obvious that the Government have neither the courage nor the leadership required to take the very difficult decisions that are necessary if we are to overcome this problem.  Indeed, I would not expect such decisions from them any longer. Instead, as has been mentioned already during this debate, there is the ridiculous situation of Ministers calling on somebody or other to produce an economic plan while Coalition Senators and backbenchers, too, are calling for economic plans and asking that we break with sterling.  It is my opinion that the principal reason for so much publicity being given to the question of a break with sterling is that it affords a badly-needed opportunity on the part of the Coalition to blame Britain for our economic ills. The whole situation is disastrous but the unemployed must be looked after. The pay-related benefit scheme introduced <Col N="77" /> by Fianna Fáil is very worth while.  It was intended to help those unfortunate enough to become unemployed to overcome the difficulties of that situation.</P>
    <P>I was interested in hearing again the Parliamentary Secretary's defence, particularly when it was followed by a decision to restrict the total amount of benefits payable to wholly unemployed persons to 85 per cent of current earnings.  In the course of his speech he gave us an example of a case where the decision produced no change.  Perhaps in his reply he will give us an example of where a change will result from the decision, the estimated number of cases where a change will take place and the amount of money it is estimated will be saved as a result of the decision.</P>
    <P>A problem which seems to be very much more acute in recent times is the question of the payment of unemployment benefit to married women.  I am sure the same thing applies to all constituencies but I have had numerous complaints form married women who claim they are being refused unemployment benefit on the basis that they are unavailable for employment.  No matter what type of case they make, no matter how genuine the case, no matter how they are able to prove that their families are looked after, they are simply turned down for unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to have another look at this.  I accept that, perhaps, some of the cases made may not be genuine but certainly many of them are.  It would be worth while having a look at this to see, especially in cases where it is essential that the wife, because of economic necessity, must go out to work, that she is paid unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the increase in the cost of the stamp and the transferring of Exchequer responsibility to the worker and the employer.  Deputy O'Connell referred to this change and pointed out that in comparision with other EEC countries the contribution by the employer here was lower and the contribution from the Exchequer here was higher.  In any circumstances where a decision is made to transfer <Col N="78" /> the responsibility from the Exchequer to the worker and the employer it should be done only at a time when things are stable.  I believe that in present circumstances it is not conductive to the development of industry and to the provision of jobs to transfer responsibility from the Exchequer to the employer and the worker.  The Government ought to slow up this transfer.</P>
    <P>The increase in the cost of the stamp, so far as the worker is concerned, is a penal tax.  Generally speaking, in the EEC countries the social welfare payment by the workers is recognised as a tax.  I have no doubt, as Deputy Andrews has already said, that the Government will have some difficulty in getting agreement for wage restraint when they have increased the cost of the stamp to such an exceptional degree.  The cost of the stamp for many years was relatively small.  The total cost to the worker and to the employer until recent years was rarely regarded as a tax.  While workers certainly demand an increase in their wages and salaries because of an increase in income tax they rarely concern themselves about the cost of the stamp. Now that its cost constitutes a tax, I have no doubt that in future it will be so regarded by workers and will be included in their calculation when they endeavour to work out the increase in their wages and salaries which they believe necessary in relation to rising costs.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious matter to have increased the cost of the stamp at this stage because it is not simply the matter of an individual employer paying his share of the cost of the stamp. It is a question in many instances of a company struggling to exist and provide employment being able to continue in existence.  Any changes of this kind which are made to the detriment of a company can have a very serious effect on that industry.  In my constituency a number of industries have already closed down.  Some industries are struggling to exist in order to safeguard the employment of their workers. When this very considerable increase in the cost of the insurance stamp is related to a large number of workers it <Col N="79" /> can be the last straw that breaks the camel's back.</P>
    <P>I impress on the Parliamentary Secretary the seriousness of the situation. I am convinced in present circumstances where industry, which is so vital in relation to employment prospects, is in the difficult situation we find it in today, the Exchequer should continue to bear its share of the cost of the stamp irrespective of what the conditions are in the other EEC countries. It is time enough to make the changes initiated last year and continued this year whereby the Exchequer is unloading its responsibility on to the worker and the employer.  Our whole attitude at the moment must be geared towards not only safeguarding employment but increasing it.  We should be extremely careful at this time about the added burden we put on industry, which is so important for the provision of employment.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider what is being done in relation to that aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on introducing this Bill.  When we are asking for restraint it is encouraging that the Government are prepared to grant the benefits mentioned in this Bill to people in the lower income groups and people who, for various reasons, are unable to provide for themselves.</P>
      <P>The principal thing I like about the Bill is the extension of the benefit period.  This extension is very necessary, and also an extension of the pay-related benefit is necessary because of our continued unemployment situation. The extension of the ordinary benefit is very important.  Usually a person who becomes disqualified is sick and unable to work.  If he is sick for a period his stamps may run out.  He is unable to return to work and he is in a very awkward position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speed with which payments are made is very important, particularly to people who are sick and who are awaiting payment to enable them to keep themselves and their families. <Col N="80" /> They depend on getting payment regularly.  In certain areas there is no local social welfare office available to people who are sending in certificates. When a person sends in his first certificate and notifies the Department of his illness, his record should be available quickly enough to ensure that on the sending in of the second certificate he gets payment immediately.  I understand that under the regulations the first three days are not paid for. It is important that the person should get money during the second week.</P>
    <P>Recently there have been improvements in this field but sometimes there can be delays of as long as three or four weeks.  This can be very hard on a family who are depending on these benefits.  Under the new Act rationalising the home assistance situation, they can now get other benefits, but very often people are hoping to get their benefit in the post and they do not apply for these other benefits. When they realise they are not getting their ordinary benefit it is too late to avail of the other areas to which they can appeal.  Something further should be done to regularise and streamline these payments.  A fair effort is being made this year to keep up the good work done by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government in various budgets by the increases not only in payments but also in the number of people who qualify for these payments.</P>
    <P>It is particularly gratifying to note that, in the three years of the life of this Government, the pension rate has been doubled.  Listening to some speakers here, one would think the rates were not improved at all.  It must be obvious to anyone that this Government have been committed to helping people in the lower income groups and people who depend on social welfare payments.  There can be no doubt in anyone's mind that the Government have continued to care for these people.  I, for one, am prepared to give every support to the Parliamentary Secretary.  He has proved that he is concerned about the less privileged and less well off in our society.  The extension of these benefits for three months is important in <Col N="81" /> very many cases.  The increase to the worker of 50p in his weekly contribution is well worth while when he considers the rate of increases being provided and the extension of the time for which they will be paid.</P>
    <P>In regard to the abuse of the social welfare system, we have heard a great deal of talk about people preferring to draw social welfare benefit than to work.  I have yet to meet the person who wants to live and rear his family on social welfare if work is available for him, and if he is able to work. In many cases people receiving unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance are not able to work in the real sense.  They might do certain types of jobs if they were available, but they are not able to do hard work. The kind of people I am talking about are not able to work.  They remain on unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit as the case may be.  They are not physically or, perhaps, mentally able to perform normal work as we know it.</P>
    <P>There has been mention of increasing the penalties for fraud under the social welfare code, and that is a good thing.  The numbers who are doing that are very small.  Most people want to work if work can be provided for them.  Some few people work as well as drawing social welfare.  The penalties should be increased in regard to the employer who employs these people and the people themselves. The employer is the worst offender if he employs people without stamping their card or asking them to produce their insurance card for stamping.  He must know if they are drawing social welfare benefit as well as being in his employment.  I do not want to make a point about this because I believe it is grossly exaggerated.  As I said earlier, I believe most people want to work if work is available for them.</P>
    <P>There is a change in certain areas in the system of giving dole to farmers&mdash;what has become known as the farmers' dole.  This is a good thing. I am not from those areas but I accept that help may be needed in many cases in order to keep people on the land and to protect them from <Col N="82" /> real hardship.  However, it appears to me that many of the people would not be available for work and when help is required it should come from a Department other than the Department of Social Welfare.  It should be a matter for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries or for the Department of Lands if a subsidy for farmers is necessary in order to keep people on the land.  It should not be paid as a social welfare benefit.  I accept that help is necessary in many cases but it should not come under the auspices of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints about reluctance to pay unemployment benefit to married women.  Many women do not intend to seek work after they are married and I accept that it is necessary for them to prove they are available for work when they make a claim for benefit.  Women who have attempted to get employment and who have made a claim for unemployment benefit have eventually won their case even though it may have taken some time.</P>
    <P>I consider I should give support to the Parliamentary Secretary because he is carrying out the promises that were made by the Government, even in this year of economic hardship when people are being asked for restraint. Even though the increases in social welfare benefits are not as great as he and many other Members would like, at least he has made an honest attempt to keep up the standards set by the Government for those people who are in receipt of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>It is said that the Government have done nothing to help but since the National Coalition Government came to power many categories have been included for the purpose of benefits; in this connection I would mention unmarried mothers and deserted wives. Quite properly, all of these people are getting increased payments.  The Parliamentary Secretary is to be congratulated for providing these extra benefits at a time when other sections are being asked to restrain their demands. He is ensuring that social welfare recipients will not fall behind, that they will keep in line with what they have been receiving in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary's heart is in the right place but I do not think it achieves very much to quote the amount of social welfare benefits received today as against those obtaining four or five years ago.  Deputy O'Connell referred to a 50 per cent reduction in living standards and there is no doubt that people's living standards have declined. I am a small farmer and I have many dealings with people in small towns who are in receipt of social welfare benefits.  The amount of such benefits do not keep pace with the rate of inflation and it is useless for Members here to quote how much was given by way of benefits four or five years ago.  What we must consider is what is relevant today. I have no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary is doing his best to keep the payments to such a level that the recipients will not suffer because of inflation but he is not succeeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The worker is being asked to contribute too much towards social welfare. I agree with Deputy O'Connell that very few unemployed people want to remain out of work and it is ridiculous to say otherwise.  Most people would prefer to work.  However, the worker who has to bear the cost of the increase in the price of the stamp and many other costs must be considered. It will not be as hard on the Dublin worker as on the man in the rural area who has to travel 30 miles to work each day and where it is essential for him to run a car.  With the best will in the world, such a man will not be too enthusiastic about travelling perhaps 30 miles to Galway to work each day when he has to pay additional costs for petrol, taxes and so on.  He may find he would be nearly as well off to stay at home.  I do not know where we might get the money to help the unemployed but it is my view the worker should not have to contribute as much as he does at present.  The situation is totally different as between the worker in Dublin city and the man in the country.  There is no necessity to use a car in the city but it is an essential for the man in my constituency who must travel to the industrial estate in Galway for work.  I would <Col N="84" /> mention the case of a man who came to me recently.  He was the foreman in a factory that closed down. Apparently he was to get a six-weeks notice payment plus 16 weeks redundancy payment.  He was one of the lucky ones.  He had been earning £49 per week and he got a job at £40 per week about two weeks after he became unemployed.  He was paid the redundancy money but has not been paid the notice payment, which works at about £400.  If that man did not look for work for six weeks he would qualify for the notice payment.  He could have gone on a good holiday with his wife with the £400 by asking the man to hold over the new job for six weeks.  If that is the case there was no incentive for that man to take the job he was offered.  I should also like to mention that this man has to travel almost eight miles by car to his work.</P>
    <P>Workers are getting sour because they are being asked to contribute too much.  They have sympathy with the unemployed and I do not wish to say anything against the unemployed. While I would prefer to see people working I am aware that those who are paid social welfare benefits spend their money that week.  I have no objection to social welfare payments but workers are being scourged, particularly those who live in rural areas and must travel to towns to work, in the amount they are asked to pay in social welfare.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes a change with regard to the payment of social welfare benefit to small farmers.  In my view the change will not do away with the abuses in the system.  This will not be possible because of the way of assessing incomes of small farmers, on a valuation basis.  In one end of County Galway one could find a holding of 100 acres with a valuation of less than £20 and 60 or 70 cows being fed on it while in another part of that county, which is flooded for almost six months, the valuation is 30/- per statute acre. I accept that those with a valuation under £20 can abuse the system but the circumstances of many of those with a valuation between £25 and £30 are bad.  They have now been excluded from benefit.</P>
    <P>There has been no proper investigation <Col N="85" /> into the income of farmers other than on a valuation basis, a most unjust way of assessing anybody's income. It is outdated.  With regard to old age pensions a person's income is assessed in every way and in conjunction with the valuation.  Small farmers, however, are included or excluded on the question of valuation.  I would have no objection to excluding these small farmers if the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries presented an incentive scheme to increase production and thereby replace what is being taken from the small farmers.  A big amount of money has been swept from the farming community and they have not been given anything in return.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this is not the responsibility of the Parliamentary Secretary but I should like to point out to him the injustice of taking money away from the small farmers without providing an incentive scheme.  On paper the income of the small farmers has been doubled for the purposes of social welfare with the result that they cannot be included for benefit.  While the Government pay unemployment benefit they have failed to introduce a policy to get them back to work.  I would not object to borrowing money to get people back to work.  Money is being taken off the small farmers but they should be given money if they increase production on the farms.  We all recognise that agricultural exports are of vital importance to us and for that reason money spent as I have suggested would be an advantage.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with the question of free electricity for old age pensioners.  In my area people who were getting free electricity are now getting bills.  Has there been a change of policy in that regard?  Some attempt must be made to curb inflation and there is not much point in quoting statistics on this issue. It would annoy me if I was told that I was getting £1,000 this year compared with the £500 I got last year knowing that the £500 I received last year was better to me than the £1,000 this year. It is what the housewife whose husband is in receipt of social welfare benefits pays for her food basket that counts.  We <Col N="86" /> have been told that the benefits will increase by 10 per cent but we know that 10 per cent will not keep up with inflation.  While I give credit to the Parliamentary Secretary for his concern I must point out that he has not the resources and that the Government have not made an attempt to curb inflation. Taxing the workers more is not the answer.  It is wrong that a young person, who is unemployed but is living with his father who is earning a wage should be given a benefit of only 10p or 15p per week.  It is also wrong that girls are not paid unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I should also like to raise the question of married women who were entitled to unemployment benefit.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to cut out the delay when transferring people from unemployment benefit to unemployment assistance.  From my own experience I know it must be a hell of a job to keep up but there is an inordinate delay between the time one inquires and the time the transfer is made.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants to be unemployed except the very few.  Only this morning I was talking to a man who wanted to apply for unemployment assistance. He told me his wife had been working but was now out of employment.  He had six children and he said that he had always hoped he would never come to this.  He did not want to go on unemployment assistance.  All this talk about people not wanting to work is just not true and the unfortunate people who are unemployed should not be criticised.  These people are being scourged and they are becoming soured. It is time we adopted a more enlightened attitude.</P>

      <P>I come from a constituency where social welfare benefits are quite extensive.  I compliment the Government on the benefits they have poured into the western counties.  I can remember as a young lad hearing the wailing and crying at the railway station because parents were seeing their children off to earn their living in some other land.  Sometimes they never saw those children again.  Today because of social welfare benefits there is very little emigration.  I compliment <Col N="87" /> the Government on that situation.  The small farmer no longer has to go to England to earn a living, having to keep himself and send a few pounds home.  Now he can stay at home and rear his family.  With the aid of social welfare the small farmer is actually able to develop his land and to increase its productivity.  Social welfare benefits have been a boon to business people.  Were it not for these benefits many of these people would not be in business today.</P>
      <P>The only solution to unemployment in the west is a policy of industrialisation. We have 23,000 small farmers in the western counties who would be available for employment.  When that employment is provided there will no longer be dole queues.  I am not too happy about taking away unemployment assistance from the man with the £15 valuation.</P>

      <P>The Government did not go into this properly.  Had they done so the approach would have been different. Had I and other Deputies been approached we would have advised differently.

The advice of public representatives should have been sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Government on their achievements in the last three years.  There have been difficulties.  This Government have faced perhaps the most difficult economic situation this country has ever had to face.  The people realise that.  They cannot be fooled.  As far as social welfare benefits are concerned the Government have done their duty and they are to be complimented on their handling <Col N="88" /> of things.  But I would sound this note of warning.  It is not a good thing to give an unemployed man almost as much as he could earn if he was working. This should be examined.  Money should be given to the underprivileged, the people who need it.  When the Parliamentary Secretary is reviewing the situation next January I would ask him to consider this question of valuations. To my mind it is completely unjust that one man with 45 to 50 acres can qualify for dole, while another man with only 17 to 20 acres and with a valuation from £15 to £20 cannot qualify.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Every Social Welfare Bill that has gone through this House giving increases has been welcomed, but I cannot find it in my heart to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary or any member of the Government on bringing in a Bill like this.  There are certain parts of the Bill we all welcome but the increases in benefits for unemployed people are not the answer to the problem.  That is not what the people who are queuing up at the labour exchange want for their future. They expect something better from the Government.  Of course, it is necessary to give assistance to people if they are to exist at all.  The Parliamentary Secretary and the Government had no choice but to give increases this year. We are talking here of a figure of £25 million, which is not considerable when we see what is being spent in the total budget this year and the amount provided for social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the duty of the Government to look after the weaker sections of the community just as it is the duty of the individual in his own household to look after his aged mother or father or some invalid within his household. However, the increase of 10 per cent given here will not match inflation and the increases in prices which have taken place over the past 12 months and particularly within the past month. Compare that increase of 10 per cent with the massive taxation that has taken place.  We must consider not alone the taxation in the budget, which is only part of the increase which taxpayers have had to endure over the past <Col N="89" /> three to four months.  The cycle started off in December, and it is only in the past fortnight we have seen the heavy burden which has been placed on the Irish citizen.  There is the increase in bus fares and the increase in all types of food; only the other day butter was increased.  Having regard to the massive taxation on beer, spirits, cars and so on, the average citizen is not deceived by the increase being given by the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is against this background that we must look at the increases given here.</P>
    <P>The person who retires after 40 or 50 years working has leisure hours in which he might like a drink in the afternoon or evening.  This is something to which he is entitled after a long dreary day and weary years of work. People know well that what they are receiving in this Bill is not sufficient to cope with these increases which have taken place.  It is interesting, looking back over the past two or three budgets to compare the stand taken then by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Tánaiste and the stand taken on this occasion.  In previous budgets the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Health saw fit to take space, at public expense, in the press to bring to the notice of the people the huge increases which were given in social welfare. There was also a well-orohestrated television interview in which the Parliamentary Secretary explained how generous these increases were.</P>
    <P>Contrast that with the performance after the budget this year.  Where was the massive publicity or the type of influence we were used to for the previous three years?  The Parliamentary Secretary could not genuinely go on television and say he had given the people something substantial, 10 per cent, having regard to the way prices are rocketing day in and day out. Inflation last year was in the region of 22 per cent.  Prices this year are reckoned to go to at least 15 and, perhaps, to 20 per cent.  If the Parliamentary Secretary thinks he will fool the people with a new index that is being brought in he is mistaken. Taxation is to be separated from other cost of living items, as if taxation, which was increased in the <Col N="90" /> recent budget, was not part of the cost of living.  It might be one way of trying to confuse the public, but I doubt very much if it will confuse the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  A favourable index could be created in that way.  Apparently it is the only type of improvements old age pensioners, widows and orphans and such people can expect from this Government. No matter what social welfare increase you may give to a married or single man it will never replace a job. You could give pay-related benefit for five years, but it will never replace the dignity of a man's going out in the morning, earning a decent day's salary and coming home to his wife and family in the evening.  That is what the Government should be trying to restore to the people of this country, especially those in the wage earning bracket.  There is no point in making a song and dance about this Bill, as if Santa Claus was giving the people something for nothing.  We do not need to thank the Government for this Bill.  The people we should thank are those who are contributing&mdash;the workers and the employers who have to make up the money needed.</P>
    <P>During the past three months the cost of living has risen by about 7 per cent.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that this would be reviewed. I sincerely hope it will, but first he will have to review the economy in a few months' time to see if he will be able to do it.  I noted this morning that there was a slight decline in the unemployment figures.  I would like to know whether this decline means that extra people are employed, or people are emigrating. It will be interesting to see the number of insurable workers.  It is possible that the people are getting frustrated and are moving out.  It is very easy to bring down unemployment figures that way.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> We cannot talk about the increases in this Bill without discussing the people who will have to pay for them.  That is very important.</P>
      <P>Inflation has eaten every rise that has been given over the past three or four years, especially since the Government came into power because they failed to control it by taking proper measures.  They have tried to confuse the people.  The Parliamentary Secretary produced figures which gave the impression that he was giving very large increases, but the reverse was true.  These increases have not contributed anything to the standard of living of those people and they know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These increases are bound to have a detrimental effect on industry.  If there was ever a year when the contribution from the Central Fund should be reduced it was not at this time.  I am surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary accepted this at a time when industry is struggling and employers are trying to maintain the numbers in employment. The Government made this decision although they were warned time and time again of the burden this contribution was placing on the unit <Col N="92" /> costs.  To move it at this time when industry is most vulnerable was a betrayal of the confidence the people have in the Government.  To move £8 million into the private sector and ask the employers and employees to carry this burden is not logical, especially when we are trying to expand industry and generate more employment.</P>
    <P>I know workers who got no increase in 1975.  Now a 22 to 24 per cent increase is due to them in respect of 1975.  It is bad enough to have to forego that increase and tolerate the massive increases which have taken place over the last 8 to 10 months but what is being done now?  They are moving £8 million from the Central Fund to the employer and employees and a portion of that money will be paid by those employees who did not get their increase last year.  Do the Government expect them to tolerate that? I realise that £8 million is only part of the cost of the stamp, but examine the situation of the employee who did not get his increase last year and who is now being asked to pay this contribution.</P>
    <P>Last year certain companies pleaded their inability to pay.  There were genuine reasons why the Labour Court conceded that.  This increased contribution will bankrupt such companies. Where will the money come from in a company which employs 100 to 150 people?  One of two things can happen.  The company will be in financial trouble, and it will cause dissension among the employees who did not get their increases last year. Yet, these are the people we are asking to accept a pay pause.  In my view, that is unjust.  The Exchequer could have carried this burden this year and until such time as we get out of this economic mess.  I am not so much concerned about this Government as I am about the country which is far more important.</P>
    <P>I remember being in this House some years ago when the Parliamentary Secretary, the Tánaiste and other members of the Labour Party, were sitting on the Opposition benches. They always advocated that more of the stamp should come from the Central Fund.  Why the change of heart?  I have not the time to go to <Col N="93" /> the Dáil Library, but I can remember what was said four or five years ago. The policy of the Labour Party then was that the biggest proportion of the contribution should come from the Central Fund but there is now a change of heart.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us when this change came about.  The contributions to this fund will place a heavy burden on the whole private sector.  Anyone reading the annual financial reports of public companies realises where the profit element has gone.  Every effort should be made to help companies expand and to maintain them in business. We must not introduce measures which will result in people becoming unemployed after, perhaps, 20 years in the same job.  At this time of crisis and when it is impossible to control unit costs the Government are not helping by this measure to maintain employment.  We are losing markets abroad and at home there is keen competition in regard to imports.</P>
    <P>For a considerable time past I have been asking the Parliamentary Secretary some questions regarding the pay-related fund but the answers I have received have not been satisfactory. It has been said from the beginning that the contributions, both from employers and employees, are too high.  Unfortunately, I have not got up to date figures but 12 months ago I tabled a question asking for some indication of the total amount of money collected up to then and also the total amount paid out from the time of the Acts coming into being.</P>
    <P>I was informed by the Parliamentary Secretary that up to December, 1974 the income to the fund was estimated at £8,317,000 and that the amount paid out came to £2,943,000.  These figures were for a nine month period only but they show a surplus of £5,374,000 which would be the equivalent of about £7 million in a 12 month period.  I have not figures for 1975 but I am concerned as to the amount of money in the fund.  It is a fund that is not associated with the social welfare fund as such and it was never intended that the contributions would become part and parcel of the social welfare fund.  When the scheme was being debated here at <Col N="94" /> the time of its introduction there was concern as to what the figures should be in respect of the contributions from employers and employees.  Nobody knew then what would be required so figures of 2 and 1 per cent respectively were taken out of the air, as it were. However, considering that during 1975 wages increased by between 22 to 25 per cent, the surplus for 1975 should be in the region of £9 million.  I do not claim that my figures are accurate but I hope to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply as to the exact amount of the surplus.  I reckon that, taking into account the increases in salaries generally in the private sector there is now a surplus of between £14 million and £15 million in the fund. There is no reference to this money in the Book of Estimates.  If I am right in my assertion that there is a surplus, the fund should be reviewed and what better time to review it than now when excessive charges are being put on to the employer and the employee in respect of the social welfare stamp?  This fund was designed specifically by employers and employees to help tide over in the short term those who were unfortunate enough to lose their employment but we never envisaged the recession of today.  Neither did we envisage the Government failing to live up to their obligations to provide employment with the result that there are many who have been unemployed for a long time.  These are people who are genuinely concerned to find work so as they will not have to depend on these handouts from the Government. Of course, the payments are welcome but most of the people concerned would prefer to be back at work.  If the pay-related fund is being used in any way other than that for which it was designed and if there is fiddling in any way in the Department, we should object strongly.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Is this fund to be reviewed? A contribution of 3 per cent every week comes to a substantial amount. If there is a surplus, we must be told what is happening to it.  I accept the Parliamentary Secretary's word if he says that this sum is available but if it is being spent by any other section in the Department I certainly object to it. The Congress of Trade Unions and the Confederation of Irish Industry should be informed if that is the case because it was never designed for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear all types of complaints from time to time about the operations of the Department of Social Welfare.  We hear of people not getting their insurance payments every week and other matters like that.  We should all realise that the people who are awaiting those benefits are in great need and they have no money to fall back on.  It is vitally important to have an efficiently run Department of Social Welfare.  I cannot criticise any of the personnel in the Department of Social Welfare. Any time I had to get in touch with them about particular matters they were courteous and very helpful.  We hear complaints about social welfare benefits being abused.  The Minister <Col N="96" /> would have more information on this than any Member on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I believe this abuse is exaggerated out of all proportion.  I am quite convinced that if those abuses are taking place to any widespread degree the Parliamentary Secretary would have taken steps about the matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that a survey was carried out in relation to pay-related benefits.  The best way to clear the matter up would be if he would let everybody know the result of this survey.  The public would then know the extent of the abuse.</P>
    <P>I was rather interested to hear Deputy Callanan.  I have no great knowledge of farming or of the number of farmers who will go on or off the dole. The only time I meet them is during a by-election when we hear their problems. It was very noticeable that the Parliamentary Secretary said nothing about those matters during the Mayo by-election.  I was interested to hear Deputy Callanan speak about the notional figures, multipliers and other matters like that.  This brings me back to a Finance Bill some years ago when Deputy Finn spoke about assessing means.  This Finance Bill I refer to was at the time when farmers were being assessed for income tax.  We had a long debate in the House with regard to assessment, notional figures and multipliers and whether or not they were realistic.  I know nothing about how the scheme operates in the country.  It is the principle I am talking about.</P>
    <P>I do not want to bring up the matter of income tax on this Bill but I consider that what I am talking about is relevant.  Farmers with a valuation of £100 were subject to income tax.  There were two ways you could assess a man's income, on the notional figure or on the accounts.  The notional figure was £40 and from that you were allowed to deduct your expenses.  The other way you could be assessed was by submitting your accounts to the Revenue Commissioners.  If a farmer was not satisfied in relation to the notional figure, which worked out at £4,000 for a 100 acre farm, he could opt to submit his accounts to the Revenue Commissioners.  In this Bill we are <Col N="97" /> dealing with a valuation of £40.  Different systems seem to be employed by the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Welfare.  The Department of Finance allowed the farmer, out of the £40, to deduct for his plant, the cost of fertilisers and other matters and allowed him 10 per cent over a 10-year period for farm houses and general buildings.  That is what happened when a multiplier of £40 was used.</P>
    <P>In this Bill a multiplier of £40 is used for both a small farmer and a large farmer.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to contradict me on this if I am wrong.  The small farmer is allowed no deduction from that £40.  It is net in relation to him but in relation to the larger farmer it is gross.  There seems to be some anomaly there.  I am not sure exactly how the system operates but I am concerned how under one system deductions are allowed for expenses but under the other system the small farmer is not allowed expenses in relation to the multiplier of £40.  This may be a small point but I am sure it is one in which small farmers are interested.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary can explain this but certainly the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Welfare seem to be operating on two different levels.  I will not delay the House any longer.  Those are the points I wanted to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this Bill must be very limited in that the Bill itself is limited.  The increases contained in the Bill are meagre.  The increase of 10 per cent across the board will be eroded before this Bill becomes law and before the increases become due on 1st April.  It would be more appropriate for the Parliamentary Secretary to withdraw the Bill and bring in a Bill containing increases which would, in some way, keep in line with inflation and the cost of living of people who, whether by right or by misfortune, are in receipt of welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who are in receipt of payments by misfortune are able-bodied and physically able people who find themselves jobless and without any real <Col N="98" /> prospect of work.  For them, an increase of 10 per cent is not much good.  They must suffer the ignominy week after week of going to collect pay-related benefit.  Do we stop to ponder for long enough on what this must do to a person psychologically?  It must be extremely demoralising.  It must sap a person's enthusiasm to have to sign on to draw money.</P>
    <P>I suppose we give this Bill a very qualified welcome.  I should like to see a decent Social Welfare Bill coming before the House but, regrettably, we will not be able to have such a Bill until we have a greater percentage of our people in gainful employment.  Through their efforts the community at large would be able to offer good increases, increases which would be seen to be effective and genuine, to the aged, the young and the less privileged and less fortunate members of our community.</P>
    <P>Social Welfare Bills tend to be holding operations.  This Bill continues the period of entitlement for a further short period.  It is very much a holding operation.  It does not go to the root of the problem.  Social Welfare Bills should pertain to the young, the aged and the infirm.  It is most regrettable that they must pertain and extend to so many people who are willing to work and who want to work, to people we as a country should be ashamed to have idle.</P>
    <P>Talking to some of those people really brings home to a person how difficult it must be to continue living, not living in the material sense alone, but living in the social sense.  Think of the stress it must put on a home to have a man in it rather than out earning so that he could pay his way.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you may think I am straying from the Bill but I will make my remarks relevant.  If he were working, he would be contributing to looking after the aged and the young. That is one point.  What must that be really like for a person?  What effect must it have on his marriage, on his status, on his social position in the community?  Do we ponder these things often enough?  We talk about them but we do not act strongly and speedily enough to remedy them.  We will not be able to give real increases to the <Col N="99" /> sections of the community who ought to be covered by welfare until such time as we have a huge cutback in the number of able-bodied people who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>I wonder is every person listed on the employment register physically and mentally capable of work.  I regret that the Parliamentary Secretary is not here. He might be able to give me an answer to some of the points I am raising. I know his advisers and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health will willingly pass them on to him.  If a person is on the live register for up to a year, or longer, is he in a position mentally to adjust to a job?  If he were fortunate enough after a year to discover there was a job and he could start immediately, this would be extremely hopeful and good news for him, but would he be in a position to go to work and work effectively?  How long would it take him to be able to re-enter the work force?</P>
    <P>This Bill is very limited.  There are really no extensions in it as regards categories of people who should be included.  I will deal with one category. On 22nd May, 1975 I asked the Parliamentary Secretary by way of a Dáil question if there were any plans&mdash;this is paraphrasing the question; it is not a direct quotation&mdash;within the Department to reduce the age qualification for receipt of a blind pension from 21 years to 18 years.  The answer I received was that the Department were not contemplating any reduction in the age at that time.  I wonder if any contemplation has taken place in the interim.  I had hoped that, in a Social Welfare Bill introduced within 12 months of that question being asked, these people would be included.</P>
    <P>A blind person receives children's allowance up to the age of 16 years and, if in full-time education or something similar to that, that allowance can be continued until he is 18 years.  However, at 18 years the children's allowance will be discontinued and the person must apply under the Health Acts for a disabled person's maintenance allowance from the Department of Health.  The Minister should have changed the legislation <Col N="100" /> to entitle such people to qualify for a blind pension at 18 years, if not 16 years.  The numbers involved must be very small and the strain put on the Exchequer would be negligible.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to tell us why he was not able to bring in this amendment. He may be able to justify not bringing it in because of the numbers involved, although I am convinced the numbers are few and the amount of money involved is paltry.  Nevertheless, the individuals concerned would be given some consolation and they would not have to look elsewhere for help.  Blind people must be catered for and there is no reason to have the gap of three years which I have mentioned. It is regrettable that the Bill does not make this provision.  It is out of date even now.</P>
    <P>Many of the nuns and sisters in convents throughout the country should be included in the category that makes provision for an allowance to single women of limited means who are aged 65.  Many of these women may not have been engaged directly in teaching but they were engaged in the maintenance and the staffing of the convents.  Why is the allowance not given to such people?  Even though in many cases their contributions are masked and veiled by the walls of the convents, they are doing worthwhile tasks and we have a responsibility towards them.</P>
    <P>Many of the teaching orders are under great financial pressure.  We know they are taking various steps to protect themselves and good luck to them.  I do not think there is any valid reason to exclude people who have worked so industriously in convents throughout the country.  We are told that people living in communities are classified as being on a par with those in convalescent homes or geriatric centres but I do not think we can accept that.  We know that people in convalescent homes or geriatric centres may be in receipt, either directly or indirectly, of social welfare payments or payments made by the health boards and this is quite right.  We cannot justify excluding nuns or sisters of 65 years from the <Col N="101" /> benefit.  These people lose out both ways because, as they are not blood relatives of the wage earners in the religious community they cannot be classified for tax relief.</P>
    <P>The Government have a responsibility in this area and they must accept it.  This Bill is outdated because the 10 per cent increase has been eroded before it has been granted.  We will not have a proper social welfare code until the Government accept their responsibilities and priorities, so that able-bodied people will be able to work and feel that they should contribute as citizens to those who are less fortunate.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has returned to the House and perhaps I might be permitted to repeat my point regarding the age qualification for blind pensions.  I raised this matter by way of a parliamentary question on 22nd May.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will deal with these matters in his reply.  The social welfare code is complex and involved.  Is it possible for a person to obtain an occupational injury stamp only?  The social welfare stamp is extremely costly and the people I am referring to are those who would take on part-time work, contract cleaning work and the like, and who would not be interested in building up a number of stamps in order to qualify for benefit.  The Parliamentary Secretary should consider devising a scheme whereby they need only pay an amount which would cover them for occupational injury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice, with regret, that a large number of employed people are complaining about the huge cost of the stamp.  The cost of the stamp is increasing and it will continue to increase as long as the Government follow a policy of disengaging the State directly from these contributions.  Employees believe <Col N="102" /> the stamp is too costly and this leads them to think of those who are idle but not idle by choice.  Until such time as there is work available there will not be happiness within the community.  At the best of times we have people who are dissatisfied but it is possible to have a constructive dissatisfaction and I do not think the form of dissatisfaction which is being aired is constructive.</P>
    <P>The burden on small businesses, on an employer with five or six employees, in the weekly payment of his contribution to a stamp has now become sizeable.  In the circumstances the Government ought to take a look at the course they are following and reconsider, or defer, the three further stages.  They should defer them for a while, bring about a pause, a breathing period.  The legislation about equal pay was rushed and it proved very embarrassing for the Government and I believe that if there is not a pause and a few years' grace given the same thing will happen in regard to social welfare.  The Bill is extremely limited.  The increase is meagre and I recommend to the Parliamentary Secretary that he take it back; the increase has already been eroded.  He should come back to the House with a suitable Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a lot recently about plans.  Everybody appears to have a plan but when it comes to social welfare we are presented with this type of a plan, one which is not enough to keep in line with the heavy increases imposed on the people.  This reminds me of a needlework class, a patchwork quilt. We need a comprehensive plan for social welfare.  We were promised this many years ago but it has not materialised. The Parliamentary Secretary should introduce this plan at the earliest possible opportunity.  The increase of 10 per cent does not give the weaker section of the community enough to meet the increases that have accumulated to date.  According to an EEC report, the Commission forecast changes in consumer prices in the coming year of the order of 16 per cent and to this must be added the increases already sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> It is deplorable that a Government who have indicated so often to the people that a plan was in the offing and that they would keep abreast with social welfare payments elsewhere have failed in their responsibility. They have reneged on the solemn promises given.  The people were promised that there would be a reduction in the qualifying age for the old age pension annually but the Government reneged on this also.  It would take too much time to go through the litany I have before me but I have my records intact; they did not blow away.  It is not the same speech I made before; that speech blew away the other day.  I hope an effort will be made with regard to this matter. There is no doubt that the Government are concerned about pensions but they are ministerial pensions and pensions for the Parliamentary Secretaries. Now that they are entitled to those pensions they should think of the old age pensioners and ensure that they have enough to live on.</P>
    <P>We must keep abreast of the times. We need progressive legislation in this regard.  Legislation must be updated. No government can claim credit for updating legislation because it is their duty to update social legislation and ensure that we keep abreast of other European countries.  I hope the next Bill will be a comprehensive one which will give us an insight into the social thinking of the Government. We have not had that so far from the Government.  Some Ministers tell us things are good while others tell us we never had it so bad.  They have plans for themselves but, unfortunately, no plans for the people who require assistance.</P>
    <P>The Government have shown their irresponsibility in dealing with social welfare matters, and social welfare is a hobby-horse one can ride fairly effectively, but, on this occasion, taking into consideration the statements that have been made, I am saddened by the fact that after three years we have not got a comprehensive measure which we could examine in depth to find out what is lacking in a proper understanding of social problems and social needs. <Col N="104" /> Instead we have this stop-gap method of dealing with great social problems. No doubt throughout the Minister's brief there was a confetti like approach to the problems of social welfare.  I will not deal with the pay-related benefits scheme or the Minister's comments on that scheme.  We all know there have been abuses recently.  Some Ministers admit there have been abuses.  We hope these abuses will be stopped and that those who are entitled to increases will get what they deserve instead of this paltry increase at this particular stage.</P>
    <P>The burden has now been placed on the shoulders of those who are in employment. The few have to carry the burden passed on to them from the Exchequer.  This particular step should not have been taken without a comprehensive look at the whole matter.  I do not know why the step was taken.  I hope that before long we will be able to deal in a more comprehensive way with this patchwork that has been presented to us here.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary is anxious to conclude. I am sorry I did not have more time to deal with the pressing and important problems affecting the weaker sections of our community. Those sections are insulted by this measure.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to thank Deputy Dowling for allowing me to get in.  He appreciates the need to conclude this debate and bring the Bill to the Seanad so that its provisions may become effective at the appropriate date. I know there is a great deal he would have wished to say but he restrained himself and I thank him for his forbearance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although this has been a relatively short debate, I found it a very interesting and constructive debate.  One of the things that emerged from the Fianna Fáil contributions was the marked contrast between some of the contributions.  As usual, Deputy Callanan's contribution was of a very high standard and very constructive, obviously coming from a man who knew his constituents and their problems and who was able to articulate their aspirations and their needs. <Col N="105" /> Deputy Murphy's contribution was also quite constructive, though he is a much younger man than Deputy Callanan. Deputy Callanan spoke with the authentic voice of Fianna Fáil in the 1930s and the 1940s.  In contrast with that we had Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick who represents the new image and the new aspirations of Fianna Fáil, their new aims and goals for those for whom they wish to cater.</P>
    <P>For me, Deputy Callanan represented the great national party that Fianna Fáil was and Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick and some others represented the party that it now is.  The contrast was interesting.  It shows the direction in which Fianna Fáil have been going and, as far as most of the Deputies opposite are concerned, they are hell bent on continuing that course, the course of catering for the more privileged in our society.</P>
    <P>Looking back on the days when Fianna Fáil were in Government, one finds that they just did not initiate things.  It is a little difficult, though not for the experienced observer, to know what they now represent.  When difficulties arose they pushed them aside.  The true face of Fianna Fáil and the true voice of Fianna Fáil have been shown and heard very clearly since they went into Opposition.  They have vigorously opposed every progressive measure introduced by this Government.  Think of the time they spent opposing the wealth tax, the capital acquisitions tax and all the other forms of taxation designed to hit only the more privileged members of our society.  Contrast that with their attitude towards social welfare.  A Fianna Fáil spokesman in the public Press called for a cutback in expenditure on social welfare to the extent of £20 million to £30 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the Government's continued failure to provide adequate funds towards the implementation of the Cork Harbour Development Plan.</P>
      <P>In moving this motion, which is also in the names of Deputies Brosnan, Cronin, Gene Fitzgerald, French, Healy, Jack Lynch and Meaney, I am glad to be addressing my remarks to a fellow Cork Deputy, the Minister for Transport and Power.  I hope he will accept my contribution to this debate as constructive and will appreciate my anxiety regarding the whole development of the Cork Harbour area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the present appalling condition of our economy it is of vital importance that the Government would invest money where the greatest potential for employment arises.  Therefore, if the Government are serious about devising a policy to create employment, the Cork Harbour area must be a top priority. <Col N="107" /> Cork Harbour must be considered as a regional development area where the greatest potential now exists, especially with the advent of gas and oil. The Government are gambling that all our economic ills will be remedied in this region, but to date they have not provided the necessary finance for its development.</P>
    <P>The Cork Harbour Commissioners, together with the Cork County Council, the Cork Corporation, the Cork Chamber of Commerce and many other interested bodies are convinced that the harbour's greatest potential lies in its particular ability to attract major capital, kernel-type industries and, in doing so, stimulating the economy and providing a high level of new job opportunities, and I am sure the Minister will agree with me that this is essential now in view of rising unemployment.  It would also create job opportunities for university and technological college graduates from the whole region of south Munster.</P>
    <P>The basis of the plan is to improve the industrial infrastructure, thus making Cork Harbour more attractive for port-related industries such as petroleum refining, petro-chemicals, steel, primary metal production, and a wide range of organic and other chemical plants, for instance, shipbuilding, fertilisers, car reassembly and so on.  There is tremendous competition among all European countries in attracting port-related industry, and if Ireland is to be successful it is essential to provide the basic infrastructure in advance of this demand. I do not have to inform the Minister that port-related industries are the fastest growing industrial sectors in the world.  Surely then it should be the concern of the Government to attract those industries.  There is little point in Irish Ministers going around the world trying to attract industries which are port-related unless we ourselves provide the facilities for them.</P>
    <P>The credibility of the Cork Harbour area as a location suitable for heavy industry is now beginning to suffer because of the long delays in giving <Col N="108" /> sanction to the plan and now I think, the refusal to sanction it.  There have been so many promises from the Government that the plan would be sanctioned that foreign industrialists will now become sceptical that deep water facilities will ever be provided in Cork Harbour.  We are seeing evidence of this at present in Cork.  The Government therefore should be seen to be committed to the provision of these facilities rather than be waiting for industries to come to the harbour area.  Cork Harbour has the largest single concentration of heavy industry in the State.  It has a distinctive geographical location, as it adjoins the main bulk commodity lines into Europe.  It has always been said that Cork Harbour is the gateway to Europe.  It has the advantage of being a natural deep water harbour together with all the necessary services which Cork can offer.</P>
    <P>Cork Harbour, through its industries and associate services, gives direct employment to over 7,000 people.  I have no doubt that the Minister is also aware that if the harbour plan is not put in motion now, there is the risk that this employment will be placed in jeopardy.  In my contribution to the budget debate I said that Cork Harbour was dying because we were restricted to vessels of about 12,000 tons and could not accept vessels of over 15,000 tons, while the more ambitious shipping companies of the world have bulk carriers of up to 150,000 tons.</P>
    <P>The port is at a very critical stage in its development now.  Unless immediate comprehensive dredging is carried out in Cork Harbour to accommodate the larger bulk carriers, the loss to the harbour will be gigantic.  The Minister is one of the Deputies representing Cork in this House.  He must be aware of the mounting unemployment in Cork city and county at the moment.  He knows, too, that in the initial stages of this development at least 200 men will be employed, with a very definite assurance of much more employment for our people as time progresses.  It is estimated&mdash;and I do not think we are exaggerating&mdash;that this development will create something in the <Col N="109" /> region of 20,000 new jobs by 1990, and this is the kind of development the Government must be looking at. The Taoiseach has already mentioned the fact that we shall have to plan ahead to ensure full employment.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable public investment running into millions of pounds, notably the acquisition of 600 acres of land at Ringaskiddy, and a commitment by Cork County Council with the Cork Corporation for two major water supply schemes to service the area.  This kind of development demands water and sewerage for housing, factories and other community needs of the area. Delay in implementing the marine works means that the investment in land and the water supply is lying fallow and is the cause of further delay, due to inability to attract the type of industry most suitable to the area.  These industries will be lost to the country if this plan is not proceeded with or if we cannot get a commitment from the Government now.</P>
    <P>The policy of only providing facilities if a major multi-national decides to come is ludicrous.  This had been mentioned on a number of occasions when deputations were received by the Minister.  Industrialists will only come when all necessary facilities are available.  These are proper business tactics and demands.  It is important that we be in a position to dictate our terms to the multi-nationals, rather than <i>vice versa</i>.  A Government spokesman admitted on many occasions that now is the time to mobilise all our resources and prepare for new industries in order to anticipate improving economic conditions in European markets over the next few years.  The Taoiseach and the Minister said this also.</P>
    <P>The plan having been endorsed and the strategy accepted, the money involved is modest in relation to the overall investment it will attract.  It will have the advantage that once provided, the investments will be immediately recoverable.  This is true. There is a need at this stage for the Government to invest and look back on the era of the late Seán Lemass, <Col N="110" /> the leader of a Government which was always prepared to invest to bring about more employment for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of initiative people expect from the Government.  It is frightening to look at the country at the moment and see thousands of men lining up at the labour exchanges and costing the State millions of pounds. Here is Cork Harbour, an area ready and prepared to bring about this kind of incentive by providing the necessary employment and restoring confidence in our people.  This is the logic of the Cork Harbour Regional Development Plan.  We have spelled this out often to the Minister and his officials. I must question the sincerity of the Government in making such statements and not implementing them.</P>
    <P>The Cork Harbour Regional Development Plan&mdash;I emphasise the word &ldquo;regional&rdquo;&mdash;will be of benefit to all port users and to the community as a whole.  Importers and exporters will benefit from reduced transport costs, which are so essential, and which will result from the proposed new modern facilities.  The ability to receive deep vessels will open up many new trade opportunities.  For EEC countries, Japan and other distant markets, the proposed development will make the harbour an extremely attractive location for port industries and will reduce development costs.  It will permit a greater number of industries to be established and will give a greater return on both public and private investment.  This will result in greatly increased employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years we have had spectacular developments of our mineral, off-shore oil and gas resources. The proposed development of Cork Harbour is very much related to providing the ideal base for the processing of our mineral and off-shore resources.  This applies also to agriculture. A very large proportion of foodstuffs and agricultural produce are processed through the port.  The economies in transport costs can be achieved by using large ships to assist the agricultural community.  It would take me some time to mention the <Col N="111" /> number of industrial commodities and so forth that could move through our port.</P>
    <P>The increased industrial development in the harbour area will be of particular benefit to the national and regional economies.  The plan will preserve the amenities of the harbour by concentrating development and will also facilitate monetary control and treatment of pollution.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment to the motion is somewhat confusing.  He notes a sum of £500,000 towards the cost of certain harbour development work included in the Cork Harbour Development Plan.  We are talking here about a minor development of the overall plan.  We are also informed in the Minister's amendment that this amount of money is the largest sum provided for any harbour authority in any one year.  He must take into account the inflationary impact at present on this money.  The motion ends by requesting the Government in due course to consider what further funds may be provided for the Cork Harbour Development Plan.  I am sure the Minister will explain this more fully to me in his reply because here the Government are appealing to themselves and I find the whole point confusing.</P>
    <P>People are talking about devising a policy of development while in Cork we have an area with all the potential necessary for this kind of development. It would be worth reading into the record some comments of a delegation to the EEC and the European Investment Bank on 11th and 12th March this year.  The delegation consists of Mr. Peard, chairman, Cork Harbour Commissioners, Mr. A.J. Thornton, president, Cork Chamber of Commerce, Mr. L.A. French, general manager, Mr. F.A. Cunnane, finance controller, and Mr. J.B. O'Sullivan, planning and development manager, Cork Harbour Commissioners. At a meeting yesterday they submitted their comments to us.  For the record I shall read the document they presented.  I quote:</P>
    <P>1.  EEC officials discussed in a general manner the Regional <Col N="112" /> Development Fund which presently covered the years 1975, 1976 and 1977.  Ireland's allocation for those years had already been decided on and all grants were paid directly to the Irish Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The document continues:</P>
      <P>2.  It was presumed that there would be a Fund for the period following 1977 but there was no certainty about this or, indeed, of the likely size of Fund if there was to be one.</P>
      <P>3.  The Directorate General for Regional Policy are apparently anxious that the Fund be seen to be clearly identified in respect of specific projects and are anxious to have at least one major industrial infrastructural development project included in respect of the Regional Development Fund grants for Ireland.</P>
      <P>4.  Both EEC and European Investment Bank officials were aware in some detail of the Cork Harbour Plan.  The delegation informed EEC officials and EIB officials of recent developments in attempts to progress the Plan and also pointed out in some detail that the Plan was not just a narrow port development plan but a strategy for the development of the overall subregion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.  Mr. Wells confirmed that the Plan was of a type which would qualify for a grant and was also the type of large industrial infrastructural development which they <Col N="113" /> were seeking to encourage.  However, both he and Dr. Solima stressed that all proposals from Ireland must be processed through the Department of Finance in Dublin and that Brussels could not officially comment on any proposals unless they were submitted through this channel.  They stressed that only the Irish Government could decide which projects are put forward for consideration by Brussels and also that only the Irish Government can decide on how the Fund is to be shared out amongst projects put forward by Dublin.</P>
    <P>6.  The European Investment Bank confirmed that the Plan was of a type which was likely to qualify for a bank loan and they requested additional financial information both in relation to harbour accounts and the Plan itself.</P>
    <P>That last paragraph is very interesting. The Minister will recall that before Christmas I tabled a question to him asking when a decision would be made regarding the development plan for the harbour but the reply I was given did not enlighten me in any way.  I asked the Minister subsequently if the Government had submitted to the EEC, as a regional development project, the Cork development plan.  His reply was that the plan was submitted to the Department of Finance. When pressed further as to whether he had any information from the Minister for Finance regarding the submission of the plan to Brussels, the Minister said he was not so aware. At the time I attacked the Government for their lack of collective responsibility in this matter.  One would have thought that in such a case a Minister would know what his fellow Minister was doing.</P>
    <P>The document I have read proves that the plan is worth while and all the experts consulted in regard to this type of development claim that the project would be a worth-while investment.  For how much longer are we in Cork and in Munster generally to have to continue impressing on the Government the importance of this development and for how much longer are we to continue to be told that as soon as an <Col N="114" /> industry comes to the area the development of the harbour will be considered?</P>
    <P>I recall meeting a delegation from Japan last year and at a luncheon I was asked by the group's leader what we were doing in regard to developing the harbour.  As a Corkman, I had no option but to make a case which gave the impression that there was a development plan for it but he followed that up by asking the reason for the delay.  While I cannot say that it was due to the non-development of the harbour, I learned later that this group had three industries in mind but that they decided not to set up in Cork. However, it is reasonable to assume that these industries were lost to us because of the failure to develop the harbour.  As a member of Cork Harbour Commissioners, I recall receiving a number of inquiries some three or four years ago regarding the establishment of industries in the area but there are no longer such inquiries. It is very regrettable that we are not facing up to our responsibilities in regard to the development of the harbour because when we talk about employment, about facing the challenge of the EEC, we have the greatest potential for this kind of development. I applaud the Taoiseach's visit to America when he appealed to the Americans to set up industries here but what have we to offer them?  I recall going to Aberdeen last year to see what was happening in relation to oil and gas and the tremendous development there.  When I look at this country and Cork Harbour in relation to gas and oil what have we to offer?  We are told that the big oil companies come in and say: &ldquo;We want this&rdquo; or &ldquo;We want that immediately&rdquo;.  One cannot say to them that they will get what they are looking for in a week or two. It is now they want what they are looking for.  If we do not develop our resources now and the boom comes some time it will be a terrible thing if multi-nationals are able to dictate terms to us and we are not ready with the proper facilities and in a position to dictate our terms to them.</P>
    <P>It is a sad thing to see Irish Ministers going around the world with <Col N="115" /> their hats in their hands begging for money to pay our unemployed.  We should be creating incentives for our people, developing our own resources and providing the necessary facilities to attract industry.  We should be in a position at all times to dictate the terms of the Irish people to those wishing to set up industries in Ireland. I believe I know the Minister's views on this.  He is like many more of us who have been or are members of local authorities in that area.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister can do to bring pressure to bear on the Government in relation to this matter.  If the IDA can invest millions of pounds in acquiring land which is now lying dead surely we could receive this small sum?  The £500,000 given to us is only a very small proportion of the overall plan.  When the matter was first submitted it was estimated to be £9 million.  I estimate it is now between £11 and £12 million. We can borrow hundreds of millions of pounds from the Arabs, the Germans and many others and the best part of that money is being invested in something which is non-productive. What is a sum of £10 million or £12 million invested in something that we know will be repaid one hundredfold in comparison with the total amount of money the Government have borrowed?</P>
    <P>It cost us something in the region of £50,000 to erect a building to have Irishmen lining up for hand-outs. Cork Harbour is an area where money could be well invested.  The Minister must impress on the Government the necessity to do something about this. The Taoiseach was in Cork and was taken around the harbour.  I understand he was convinced that there was great potential here.  When the Minister speaks tonight or tomorrow night I ask him in the name of Cork people, in the name of the thousands of people who are unemployed, to give his full commitment to this development. If he does that he will have done a good day's work not for the region of Munster but for the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to move <Col N="116" /> the following amendment on behalf of the Minister for Transport and Power:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes that a sum of £500,000 towards the cost of certain harbour improvement works included in the Cork Harbour Development Plan has been provided in the harbour grants subhead of the Estimate for Transport and Power for 1976 which is the largest sum ever provided for any harbour authority in one year and requests the Government in due course to consider what further funds may be provided for the Cork Harbour Development Plan&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would like to compliment the previous speaker on his interest in Cork Harbour.  We are from the harbour area but at the same time I am confident that the Minister in taking the steps he did has acted wisely because the harbour plan as initially moved involved a massive development in the whole Ringaskiddy area.  This was hinged around Du Pont, with their ancillary companies coming to Cork. Between 400 and 600 acres were involved in this development.  The harbour plan was introduced in the knowledge that Du Pont was on.  However, due primarily to the world economic decline in the use of tetarium dioxide Du Pont have totally abandoned their plans for the Ringaskiddy development <i>pro tem</i>.  Since that time no industrialist has come forward with an industry of similar magnitude in relation to tonnage to the port or employment to warrant such an approval.</P>
      <P>The only suggestion, which came from the commissioners, was the reallocation of certain industries presently based in the city area.  In a revised plan an effort was made to identify certain industries.  It is true to say that no worth-while industry emerged to justify this expenditure other than to syphon them away from other parts of the harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this moment we must contain our spending to the primary industries and not to relocating any secondary ones.  In all the Ringaskiddy area we <Col N="117" /> have nearly 2,000 acres zoned for industry. There is nothing to suggest the Government will release this land to other than port related industries. As no industrialists have put forward plans to locate industries in that area, with an employment content or a tonnage throughput to warrant massive capital investment from central funds to the order of £10 million, I cannot see the Minister or the Government involving themselves in that type of enterprise just now.  With an improved economic situation, if Du Pont, or somebody like that, at a later stage, decide to come forward and interest themselves on scales as originally envisaged, the Government and the Minister will not be found wanting.</P>
    <P>While the harbour plan satisfies all the criteria of the Government and the EEC regional development rules, the argument for its implementation is rather sterile when it can do no more than provide a series of dock facilities without the commitment of one single industry to support it.  The Minister has allocated the sum of £500,000 which will be most usefully spent on dredging and on removing the outer bar at Roches Point, which will enable us to improve the depth of water from the present 35 feet, low water, spring tide, to 48 feet.  In the inner harbour at the spit bank it will enable us to bring in boats drawing 35 feet of water instead of the present 27 feet, thus helping to cater for the present massive tonnages.  For instance, the Whitegate Refinery will be able to take tankers with a capacity of 200,000 tons as against the present 35,000 tons limitation.</P>
    <P>As well, this dredging operation will enable us to open up the whole area at Aghada where real development is taking place at present At the moment there is the construction of the new ESB station at Aghada and a new Nitrigin Éireann factory at Marino Point which will provide employment for up to 1,700 people, or more, at peak production, with a weekly payroll of up to £150,000, most of which will be spent in the Cork area.  In his wisdom, the Minister has allocated the funds he had at his disposal to the development of natural gas <Col N="118" /> fields, bringing in this very valuable asset which is so necessary at the moment for employment, and for ensuring that we will have an adequate supply of energy, and that we will have fertilisers at the right price.</P>
    <P>The Kinsale gas field will have a flow rate of 125 million cubic feet of gas per day for 20 years or more. If we are serious when we talk about jobs, this is what jobs are all about, here and now.  There is no point in speculating when funds are tight and, in the teeth of a world economic recession, there is no point in building fancy bridges which carry us nowhere. We have to look at the reality of the situation.  We have to look to areas where sound solid jobs can be provided, where money to the tune of £75 million per annum will be brought in to help our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>This is where the real wisdom of the Minister is shown in this development. The ESB will use their allocation of gas to generate electricity at Aghada and at their station at Marino.  Nitrigin Éireann will use their allocation as a feed stock for the production of ammonia and urea, ammonia to the tune of 1,350 tons per day, and urea to the tune of 1,000 tons per day.  Look at the jobs that would be involved in this.  Suppose Gouldings get involved, and other fertiliser manufacturers and if we really start compounding in a big way and with this new exciting development of Gouldings having at their disposal fertilisers from Florida instead of the very tight Moroccan phosphate fields, just imagine what development this will mean and the necessity for having at their disposal nitrogenous fertilisers.</P>
    <P>This is why I feel very strongly that the Minister is acting wisely in spending his money where he will get jobs.  There is no speculation: just the hard reality of providing work for the people of the Cork area in huge numbers.  For instance, the Cork Gas Company will receive a supply of gas to satisfy 27,000 domestic consumers and the use of the Kinsale gas for the electricity generating stations and fertiliser <Col N="119" /> production will improve our balance of payments to the tune of about £75 million and will help towards achieving self-sufficiency in energy and fertilisers.</P>
    <P>When the ESB plant at Aghada and the Nitrigin Éireann plant at Marino are in full production, there will be a total of 600 fulltime, permanent jobs. This is a real achievement by the Minister for Transport and Power. What amazes me about all this is that we hear a lot of talk from the Opposition saying we must do this and we must do that.  What were they doing in all the years they were in power? Why did they not think of developing the harbour and preparing for the boom that was to come with the EEC? This could have been done at a fraction of the present cost, when economies generally were in a boom situation. Yet nothing was done.  In the teeth of an economic recession, we are expected to spend millions in a speculative enterprise at Ringaskiddy. We have no foundation for saying that industries will or will not come. In recent months our experience has been to the contrary.</P>
    <P>The ESB station at Aghada will cost about £40 or £50 million.  That is a real investment by the Minister for Transport and Power.  This investment will justify itself.  The gas pipeline itself will cost £12 million.  The Nitrigin Éireann factory will cost a further £60 million.  These are all facts and this is the type of money the Cork Minister for Transport and Power is spending in his own county.  He is as interested as we are in providing jobs and he is going about it in a very wise fashion.  For instance, the supply of gas from the Kinsale field will be the equivalent of more than one million tons of oil per annum.  In other words, when the Kinsale gas field is in full production there will be a considerable saving on imports of oil from the Middle East and elsewhere. When the Aghada station is in full operation there will be an additional electrical generating capacity of 270 megawatts and when the new Nitrigin factory is in full production it will produce 2,350 tons of fertilisers per day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> Reference has been made to the dredging operation.  As I pointed out already, this will open up a completely new area in the lower harbour where there will be an oil refinery with 1,200 acres zoned for development.  In Aghada we will be able to service the semi-submersible oil drilling rigs which have a minimum draft of 25 feet.  This could not be done up to now.  I should like to make a comparison with Norway where this operation is carried out in Stavanger.  It has been found that this servicing has created substantial employment and it has built up the area as a prime service port for the North Sea gas and oil.  We can visualise what an exciting development that will be for the lower harbour, where it will give considerable employment for skilled and unskilled men.  We want this type of exciting new enterprise, the building of modules and being able to float them from the dockyard, as well as the building of offshore rigs and being able to carry them out.  In the past we had this insuperable bar stretching from Roches Point to the other side, preventing any type of substantial shipping entering the port of Cork. With this dredging operation that will be taken care of and ships will be able to move freely in and out of the harbour.  It will provide the much needed jobs.</P>
    <P>There will also be the jetty at Marino Point where there is a new factory.  This will be able to cater with maximum safety for ships of 35,000 tons.  I do not have to point out the importance of being able to use the jetty to the maximum.  The decision to dump the dredging material at sea was criticised but research has shown that this is the cheapest and most effective way of disposing of it.  It will not cause any silting up at a future date.</P>
    <P>The Minister has responsibility to provide as many jobs as possible with the limited finance at his disposal, and he is doing this.  He has wisely decided to spend the money on the development of our natural gas resources, on building the gas-fired ESB stations and on the manufacture of fertilisers.  In view of our present unemployment problems, to deploy State funds to hazy speculative developments would be economic <Col N="121" /> suicide.  The gas line to which the Minister has given top priority will provide more than 1,700 jobs, it will help our balance of payments and it will provide much needed fertiliser.</P>
    <P>If Du Pont and other firms come back, we will be ready for them with open arms and we will provide whatever jetties or services they require. However, until they appear with concrete proposals it would be suicide to spend money that is so badly needed for the production of gas and oil, to provide fertilisers and to ensure the most important supply of water that will be necessary for these industries. The provision of an adequate water supply for the Cork Harbour area is vital for the development of the area. The planning of a major water supply scheme to serve the harbour area, Cork city and its environs is well advanced and is partly in construction.  The work is being undertaken jointly by the Cork County Council and the Cork Corporation and it is referred to as a joint scheme.  It is an important scheme and in the present year the Minister for Local Government has provided loans amounting to £11.169 million towards the financing of the three contracts.</P>
    <P>All of us know that finance is tight and that Britain, Europe and the world are going through a severe economic crisis.  We are finding difficulty in marketing and in getting realistic prices for our top quality agricultural products.  The Minister was wise to consider areas that would give a quick return and that would provide many jobs in a short time There is no point in providing jobs if there is not a spin-off. We must provide productive jobs, especially at a time of crisis.  There is no point in developing docks or other facilities if there are no industries to use them.  It is much better to spend the money in areas where there will be a spin-off.  Places such as Whitegate, Marino Point and Aghada are areas where money should be and is being spent.  It will be spent in even greater amounts if the need arises.  The gas and oil industry is only in its infancy.  We will have the further development with regard to oil.  It is wise on the part of the Minister to be looking at the lower harbour, even from the point of view <Col N="122" /> of car ferries.  That might be the place to have the jetties of the future.  It might pay us better to go a little further downstream where the deep water is.  This might be the logical approach if we want to get our produce out at the right price.</P>
    <P>That might be a thought for the future rather than attempting to do the impossible and spending a lot of money on it.  Why not go a few miles downstream where the water is deep?  After the present work has been completed that area will be capable of dealing with any tonnage in the foreseeable future.  I compliment the Minister on what he has done for the Cork area.  In office he got things moving.  I commend him on his wisdom to date.  I hope he will not be swayed by any pressures and will continue to do what I consider to be correct economically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the presence of so many Deputies from the area this is a matter which might appear to be of local importance only, but in my view it is a national matter. If it is the Government's policy fully to exploit our natural resources for the benefit of the nation we should be made aware of those resources.  It is also proper that Deputies from the region should highlight any neglect they feel the Government may be guilty of.  If Tara Mines, or Navan Mines, are considered national resources surely the advantages of Cork Harbour, one of the 12 greatest harbours in the world, can be considered as being of national importance.  That harbour is important for the national economy and the life of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the mid-1950s one of the first bodies to recognise the industrial potential of the area concerned was Cork County Council.  They went to considerable expense and engaged the services of experts to get the three statutory bodies mainly concerned with the development of the whole area together.  Cork Corporation and Cork Harbour Commissioners were included.  These bodies had plans prepared for any development that might occur.  We had just experienced a depressing period and were looking forward to the future with a certain <Col N="123" /> amount of confidence.  We all know that it is not enough to offer industrialists land if there is not an adequate water supply available and for this reason a good deal of work went into the preparation of the development plan.  In conjunction with Cork Corporation, and Cork Harbour Commissioners, a plan was submitted for the development of the harbour area in 1972.  In my view it was a bit of a misnomer to call it the &ldquo;Cork Harbour Development Plan&rdquo; because the plan went much further.  It included the southern region of Cork county and Cork city and any benefit accruing to those areas would be to the advantage of the entire county. In my view it should have been called the Southern Regional Development Plan.  That plan was well researched and documented and was based on successful European experience.  It involved the taking into public ownership of 2,000 acres of land in the harbour area.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the county council it meant the laying of mains to carry an enormous amount of fresh water, a tremendous undertaking. The whole thing was an enlightened approach to the future prosperity of the area.  When international concerns are approached to set up industries they seek information on the facilities and amenities available and they are hard headed enough to go to the area that suits them best. For that reason we do not gain much by not having as many advantages as possible to add to our natural resources. That requires a lot of planning, heartbreak, expense and confidence in the future.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach returned from his visit to the United States we heard a lot about the industries that will be established here as a result of that visit but, in spite of the undertakings given to him, those industrialists will expect to find certain facilities and amenities.  If they do not get them they will go to the country where they will get better treatment.  I hope the enterprises mentioned by the Taoiseach will materialise and that we will see the benefit of them in years to <Col N="124" /> come.  During the period I was referring to Cork Harbour was recognised as a development area with tremendous potential.  A previous speaker said that when we lost Du Pont the bottom fell out of the plans envisaged for that area.  There is little substance in such argument because Du Pont is not the only industry that could be attracted.  I was pleased to know that Galway and other places are being considered for new enterprises and I hope those industries will bring material prosperity to those areas but that should not take from the advantages of Cork Harbour and its hinterland. That harbour is a national asset as great as Tynagh Mines or any other area of hidden wealth we may have. Cork Harbour and the hinterland adjacent to it are tremendous national assets and they should now be developed and made ready for any international concern wishing to start an industry here, especially a harbour-oriented industry.</P>
    <P>We know that the plan, which was well researched by the three bodies concerned, involved the taking into public ownership of some 2,000 acres in the area.  Everything was planned for potential development.  Du Pont felt that because of world conditions the time was not right for them and they withdrew, whereupon everything seized up.  This is the time we should be preparing for industrial enterprises. There is no reason why when things improve Du Pont should not go back to their first intention.  Now is the time to go ahead and not later on when they may decide somewhere else is more advantageous because better developed.</P>
    <P>Part of the plan has been implemented. The IDA have acquired 650 acres.  There has been complete co-operation between Cork County Council, Cork Corporation and Cork Harbour Board.  Their experts have drawn up the plans.  Everything is there except for Government assistance. Government assistance does not mean that the local bodies and the local people will not pay their fair share.  Locally there will be no more prosperity out of this development than there is from any other development <Col N="125" /> in any other part of the country. Industrial development in that particular area would be of advantage to the economy of the whole country. Everyone understands that.  A great deal of money has been spent on bringing matters to the stage at which they are now and there is no reason why the area should not be developed. There is not one dissentient voice against the investing of money in the development of Cork Harbour.</P>
    <P>We realise the Minister may have difficulty in persuading his colleagues to give him the necessary money. Funds may be scarce and he may not be in a position to give the kind of sum anticipated earlier.  Times have changed but that does not mean policy must change completely.  This would be a worthwhile investment. According to today's papers the Taoiseach's American visit has been a great success.  We will be getting certain industries.  We should be preparing now for them and surely we could not have a better investment than the development of this area which would be so valuable to the economy as a whole.  It could be a very valuable asset.  We wanted millions but they are not there.  Looking back over the records of the last three or four years, millions have been spent on other things which were not, perhaps, such valuable assets.  An investment in this development would be a good investment.</P>
    <P>The Government should underwrite the future by preparing for this development. That does not mean spending £5 million or £6 million this year and the same sum next year.  All we would ask is £1½ million this year to see how things will go.  The original plan laid down a term of five years. I will not mind if it takes ten years so long as it is done progressively and intelligently.  The £500,000 is merely a gesture and that is all.  Another £1 million would have made a great difference in laying the proper foundation for major development of the whole area for the future.  The sum required to run the country is truly astronomical as compared with what it cost ten years ago.  Surely out of that astronomical sum the Government <Col N="126" /> could spare £1½ million or £2 million to start a major enterprise like this which would attract industries from all over the world.  We have one of the finest harbours and hinterlands. Employment would be provided.</P>
    <P>I make no personal reflection on the Minister.  He is handicapped by the resources placed at his disposal.  The Taoiseach, the Minister and other Members of the Government have all praised this idea at various times.  The scheme was acceptable with, perhaps, some minor alternations and it was admitted to be something that would be a great asset to the future development of the whole country.  When you are speaking in this House and there are mostly only Cork men listening you are speaking to the converted. Although we know it is the finest asset the country has for the future, it may be very hard to convince others of that.  Nevertheless, it would be a very uninitiated Irishman who would not realise the potential of the development of Cork Harbour and the surrounding area.</P>
    <P>The county council deserve great credit for their work in initiating gigantic, or what would be gigantic to us, water schemes to provide for industries which they hoped would come and take advantage of them. However, now they find themselves in very serious difficulty.  Having had at least verbal encouragement and praise from Ministers of past Governments and this Government and from various public figures, they went along very enterprisingly and made plans for the welfare of the community.  They now find the carpet has been withdrawn from under their feet.  Because one industry dropped out and conditions are difficult, they are left suspended like Mahomet's coffin.  They are being ill-repaid for the intelligence and enterprise with which they engaged on these major works for the future benefit of the country.  As I say, the council deserve great credit for what they did, and let me say in passing that that was after I left the council: I do not want to take any credit for what they did there.</P>
    <P>Naturally, the Harbour Commissioners are anxious to initiate <Col N="127" /> harbour activity.  The IDA have 650 acres down there which are moribund at the moment.  It would be a tragedy if this asset was not used for some harbour orientated purpose, with industry exporting and importing through the harbour and using the harbour for the purpose for which the Lord gave it to us.  One would think the Government would regard it as a priority to provide money for the development of the Cork Harbour area.  It is all very fine to be talking about mines and gas and oil off the shore, but here we have an asset that any other country in the world would regard as more valuable than a gold mine.  Instead of neglecting that asset we should capitalise on it.  Site land is valuable anywhere, but it is more valuable when, as in the case of Cork, it is used for the production of goods and material which need harbour facilities.  As an island country, we depend on exports and imports, and the value of Cork Harbour is inestimable.</P>
    <P>I should like the Government to make a statement endorsing what we know as the Cork Harbour plan but which is really a southern regional plan.  If the Government said: &ldquo;In the present circumstances we cannot commit ourselves to paying a fixed sum every year, but we will commit ourselves to seeing the plan implemented as far as we can, taking into consideration all our other commitments,&rdquo; the various bodies concerned would have little difficulty in raising the money in the interim and would certainly feel relieved of a great burden in developing the whole area.  Again, I must come back to the fact that the various, I will not say promises but half promises, made by the Taoiseach and the Government to implement the Cork Harbour Development Plan have in large measure been unfulfilled. The local authorities went to great expense in the matter of research and so on, and now there is even talk that the plan might be shelved and somewhere else selected.</P>
    <P>That is a very poor return to the <Col N="128" /> three statutory bodies who have done tremendous work over the past number of years and who, before this financial crisis arose and world inflation started raging, had done an excellent job for this country.  I must blame the Government for their indecision over the past three years. The Taoiseach had made a speech in Cork and we understood that in a very short time something definite would be done.  I can say something similar about the Minister.  I am sure he regrets now that he half committed himself, to say the least of it, about the Cork Harbour Development Plan. Circumstances have caught up with him, and I am not blaming either the Minister or the Taoiseach for that. At the same time, some explanation and some commitment are due.  The Government, through the Minister, could commit themselves for the future.  The plan need not be implemented next year or the year after. It would be a guarantee and we could go ahead from there.  I cannot understand why we cannot have a yes or no about it.  Why was the £500,000 we are getting this year not put in the overall plan and made part of it?  I understand the Government's difficulty in getting money and I do not want anyone to think that Cork is looking for all the money that is available, but to ask for £1,500,000 as an instalment for the future of Cork Harbour is surely not too much out of a budget of thousands of millions of pounds. I would not go so far as to say we want £1,500,000 the following year as well.  All we want is the first instalment towards the plan so that the Government will be committed to the plan.  At the moment there is uncertainty. The county council are committed more than they would like to be, as are the harbour commissioners. There is an air of indecision about the whole matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 12 on today's Order Paper relates to a row <Col N="129" /> that has taken place between two schools.  This is the type of problem with which we have become familiar since the amalgamation of schools took place.  The difference in this case is that it is not a question of one school trying to press a decision on the Minister or trying to get their way in relation to a specific problem. This is a row between two schools. I would like to approach this subject as compassionately and dispassionately as possible without further aggravating what is already growing into a quarrel which is likely to leave a lasting scar on community relations in that district.  Nobody would like to contribute to growing antagonism. In this case, the trouble is of such dimensions that with each passing day, month or year, the situation is becoming worse and the likelihood of a settlement is becoming more difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to amalgamate Rannafast school with Annagry school led to a demand by the people of Rannafast for the retention of their school.  The Minister at the time in his wisdom decided to leave the Rannafast school and give it the necessary number of teachers to make it viable.  For a time it appeared that the problem was solved.  The difficulty then arose that there was no clearly defined catchment area for either school and some of the pupils who might ordinarily be expected to attend the Rannafast school opted to attend the Annagry school and used the transport provided. This led to a certain antagonism, feelings escalated and eventually led to the physical interference of people in the transport service.  From there, trouble developed between the two schools.  Over 200 children attend at Annagry and 60 plus at Rannafast. There is no reason why both schools could not carry on as viable units and give satisfaction by providing facilities for a good education at primary level in the area.  We would all like to revert to that position and get over the present trouble.  I do not want to go into details of all that happened since the decision was taken to allow Rannafast to retain its primary school facilities.  Those facts are well known <Col N="130" /> to the Minister and, unfortunately, to all of us as well.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer now to a related point.  The Mullaghduff school was also closed and amalgamated with Annagry.  As is the rule, the children were provided with transport.  In any event, they are entitled to transport but they have none at the moment. They have become the innocent victims of the dispute.  This gives a third dimension to the problem.</P>
    <P>My reason for raising this matter on the Adjournment is to bring home to the Minister in as calm a manner as possible how this problem has escalated and developed into a serious community row.  Many side issues are being brought in, one group is scoring petty points over another, with the result that a great deal of enmity is being engendered which, as I have already said, is likely to have lasting effects on community relations in the area.  The longer this goes on the worse the situation becomes.</P>
    <P>It is all right to say that the Minister should meet one section or the other but that will not solve the problem. It will not solve the problem for any local TDs to try to bring both sides together because we can only make suggestions.  Ultimately, they must be considered by the Department and the Minister and these, in turn, may only exacerbate what is already a rather serious position.  I can only see one remedy and that is for the Minister's representative to attend in the area to meet all sides in the dispute, point out that it is not right for either side to score points over the other, but to come to an amicable solution which, in my view, should not be difficult at this stage because the parents of the children concerned will be glad to see a settlement reached.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking the attitude to leave them alone and let them stew in their own juice until they come to an agreement he can accept.  This is not likely to happen in the foreseeable future.  The difficulty here is that the longer the dispute goes on the worse the position gets.  Now they have decided to go on strike and the school is closed.  There is no transport to <Col N="131" /> either school.  If the Minister had to provide more than the usual transport regulations permit, it would be worth while to bring an end to this hateful situation.  It is not difficult to appreciate how many people get in on rows of this kind and sometimes irrelevancies are introduced.  Issues which are not connected with the strike tend to be magnified.  The general feeling in the area at the moment is electrified with hatred and efforts at one-upmanship.  A feeling one could not have seen at the outset has developed.  I do not want to apportion the blame or to say what should have been done here or what might have been done there.  But a nasty situation has developed and it is likely to become worse unless a solution is found. The only way out of the dilemma is for the Minister or somebody representing him to go to the area and talk with representatives of those concerned in an effort to ascertain what would be the best attitude to adopt. Both schools may remain open but the question is one of transport.  Perhaps in this context it may be necessary to define clearly catchment areas or it may be necessary to give the children concerned the option for the time being of attending either school, but it is imperative that the outlying district of Mullaghduff would have transport facilities for the children who, in the first instance, were not a party to this vendetta.  They are entitled to have restored to them the transport facilities which they enjoyed up to the time of this dispute.  In this way, too, the Department will be tackling the root of the problem.</P>
    <P>It has not helped the situation of already seriously strained relations to have some of the delinquents brought to court and sentenced particularly when in the first instance no prosecutions were brought for the interference with the transport.  Matters such as this can only exacerbate the situation with the result that relations between the areas concerned are becoming worse daily.  I do not think the Minister realises fully how nasty is the situation that is developing.  There is no point in his endeavouring to wash <Col N="132" /> his hands of the trouble or in saying that it will resolve itself and that the Department can then operate transport as they consider fit.  It is a case which requires consultation between people in authority and the people of the area.  This is the only way in which a solution can be found.  That is why I did not consider the Minister's answer today to be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had some experience of differences in other places. The success of a small group in another area in having their school retained has encouraged the people I am talking of here to press their case strongly.  People are always ready to take advantage of established precedents. The people of Rannafast, with the larger number of children concerned, consider that they have a much better case than the people of Dún Caoin and they expect to be accorded the same facilities as applied in the other case.</P>
    <P>Therefore, those of us who are elected representatives for the area cannot wash our hands of responsibility in the matter and merely tell the people to settle the matter among themselves.  We must make an effort to bring about reconciliation and an end to the conflict that can destroy the otherwise good relations in the area.  For that reason I would impress on the Minister the seriousness of the situation.  He must tackle this problem without further delay.  If the Minister or somebody representing him arranges to meet representatives of the people concerned he will find that they are very reasonable people but in the present situation actions are being undertaken which are fraying tempers.  It is because the situation has reached this serious point that I am raising the matter on the Adjournment this evening.  I appeal to the Minister not to let any more time pass without dealing with the matter as I have suggested.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis the children are the sufferers in this sort of situation. Any of us can appeal to the parents to settle their differences but any moves on our part must have the ratification of the Minister and must be acceptable to the Departments <Col N="133" /> otherwise any solution would be only of a temporary nature.  The Minister must begin to arbitrate now.  It is not my intention to apportion blame. Already there have been enough recriminations and to apportion blame would only result in a worsening of the serious community division that has occurred in that otherwise close-knit community in The Rosses.  The Minister must agree, therefore, that it is wrong to adopt the attitude which he indicated in his reply today&mdash;that the people should settle their own differences and reach some agreement before he decides on what transport is to be provided.  I am not here to endeavour in any way to score political points but to impress on the Minister the seriousness of the situation and to exhort him to move in quickly.  I shall conclude now as other Deputies from the area may wish to say something on the matter.</P>

      <P>First of all, I thank the Minister for letting me in on this.  I, too, am an elected representative for this area and I am very concerned with the very serious problem which is developing.  It is fair to say that the history of this case goes back to the amalgamation of Meenaleck school, Mullaghduff school and Carrickfin school with the Annagry school at that time.  The Rannafast school was also amalgamated with Annagry.  The problem which has arisen is that when the Rannafast school was reopened some of the people in the Rannafast area were asked to transfer back from Annagry to Rannafast school.  The parents of seven of those children sent their children to the Annagry <Col N="134" /> school.  This is the kernel of the whole problem.</P>

The only sensible answer to this problem at present is to make this area an open catchment area for those seven children only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Richard Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The two Deputies who represent the area have given some of the history of this matter.  I want to say that I appreciate the manner in which they have approached this very difficult question. Let me say that when I came into the Department of Education I inherited this problem.  It was as follows. In May, 1973 I visited the area and a private service passing by the Rannafast school existed at that time.  I decided to establish an official service to Annagry national school for the pupils concerned.  This service also passed by Rannafast school.  The running of this bus was obstructed by a number of local people who objected to the conveyance of pupils from the Rannafast and Derrynamansher districts to Annagry national school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August, 1973, an arrangement was arrived at whereby the service from the Meenaleck area to Annagry would in future operate along the main road as far as the Irish College at Rannafast and back again.  This arrangement was authorised on the understanding that it was acceptable to both the Rannafast and Annagry parents.  However, it was later ascertained that the Annagry viewpoint <Col N="135" /> was not fully represented at the meeting at which the arrangement was discussed.  The objection from the Annagry side was that it left the Derrynamansher road unserved, so that some children would have to make their way to meet the Annagry service at Jackstown Cross on the Crolly-Annagry road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>How far was that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>These children absented themselves from school in protest.  A senior inspector of the Department visited the area at the end of 1973 to try to find a solution but the Rannafast parents would not accept any further extension of the service to Annagry school.  When no improvement in the Annagry service was forthcoming a number of parents from the Annagry area blocked the Rannafast transport service at Jackstown Cross and they sought an extension of the Annagry service along the Derrynamansher road.  It was represented to the Department at this stage that the Rannafast people would not object to such an extension, and in May, 1974 the Department authorised its introduction.</P>
      <P>However, it transpired that, in fact, the Rannafast parents committee were unhappy about the extension which they viewed as a further incursion into their school area. Following a further visit by a Department inspector to the area, the Department made a new arrangement in September, 1974 whereby the Annagry service would operate along both roads leading to Rannafast, but would only travel as far as a certain point on the road.  Only the households in the Rannafast area which already had children attending Annagry national school would avail of the Annagry service and the children would make their own way to those points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new arrangement brought further protests from the Annagry interests, particularly with regard to the standard of service available to children living near the school at Rannafast, but the revised services <Col N="136" /> continued to run without hindrance until September, 1975, when pickets were placed by Annagry parents on the Rannafast service at Jackstown Cross.  The Department decided that on days on which the Rannafast service could not get through because of picketing, the service to Annagry school from the same area should not operate.  A picket was subsequently placed on the Department by the same group and their representatives were met by officials of my Department for a discussion of the problem. These officials made it clear that no further progress could be made unless the bus services to the Annagry and Rannafast schools were allowed to operate without hindrance.  A promise to that effect was not forthcoming. Subsequently a delegation from the Rannafast area at a meeting in the Department indicated that Rannafast parents might disrupt the other services to Annagry national school from Mullaghduff and Carrickfin. When I authorised a one week extension recently I got a telegram which said: &ldquo;Picéidí ag dul ar minibus&rdquo;, which goes to show that in fact the delegation not being able to give the undertaking was borne out by the subsequent events.</P>

      <P>The Department wrote on 11th November, 1975, to the chairman of the Annagry and Rannafast school boards of management requesting that the two boards get together and work out a solution and stating that in the meantime services would be restored.  It was stated, however, that should further stoppage of buses occur the services might have to be withdrawn again.  The services were, in fact, restored on 2nd December, 1975.  The boards of management failed to reach an agreed solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Annagry committee continued to picket the bus at Jackstown Cross and as a result the transport services to both schools from the Meenaleck district could not operate on many occasions.  The Department felt obliged to announce that if the pickets <Col N="137" /> continued to be placed, all of the services to Annagry national school would have to be withdrawn.  Since the disruptions continued, the Department decided to withdraw all school transport services to the Annagry and Rannafast schools on 22nd December, 1975.</P>
    <P>Representations were made for the restoration of the services after the Christmas vacation, and this was acceded to, on condition that the services would not be blocked in future, and that the boards of management would again try to find a solution. However, pickets were placed on the bus once again when the new school term commenced and on 12th February, 1976, I instructed that all the transport services to both schools be withdrawn as and from 16th February. The services to Annagry national school from Carrickfin and Mullaghduff were later restored on a trial basis for one week, against my better judgement, in the hope that local agreement would be reached.  As this did not materialise, I again decided that all services should be withdrawn as from 8th March, 1976.</P>
    <P>I regret that it was necessary to suspend all of the services to these schools, but I cannot accept that parents from any district whose children attend the schools have not a responsibility to make every effort to resolve the problem.  While I feel that the solution to this problem is primarily a matter for the local people, I would be prepared to send representatives of the Department, as I have done on numerous occasions previously, to a meeting of the boards of management of the two schools if there was any indication that such a step would result in a successful outcome. I must repeat that there can be no question of talking about restoring the services until I am guaranteed that no disruption of the services will occur.</P>
    <P>In reply to the Deputy today I even said that if I got any indication from the boards of management, or from any reputable section of that population, that a solution had been worked out to the satisfaction of both schools <Col N="138" /> I would be delighted to send a representative.  I must emphasise that it is not I who should have to take the blame for the suspension of the services from the Carrickfin and Mullaghduff areas but rather those who are disrupting, and who sent me telegrams indicating that they would disrupt, the services. The local authorities must be brought to realise that the solution must emanate from their willingness to come together and reach agreement. God knows it is not beyond the bounds of possibility for mature people to do that in 1976.</P>
    <P>I must place on the record of this House that I treat all schools equally in the matter of providing school transport.  I appeal to the Deputies or anybody in authority to influence people up there to get the message home that if a solution is to be found to this problem it must be found locally.  The moment it is found I will not waste any time in sending an official down to put the seal of the Department's approval on the local solution which is arrived at.</P>

When the claimant complained of non-receipt of benefit for this period inquiries were made and these disclosed that the four cheques were cashed through a local trader who stated that he knew the claimant who is a customer.  As however the claimant denies receiving or cashing the cheques further inquiries are being made regarding their encashment.  Meanwhile a cheque for the amount of benefit due for the period in question has been issued to the claimant.</P>

      <P>To requalify for unemployment benefit after exhaustion of his right thereto on 4th February, 1974, the person concerned needed to have at least 13 contributions paid since 20th April, 1973.  The records of this Department showed only five contributions had been so paid.  Subsequent investigation of the case, however, resulted in the grant of credit in respect of 11 contributions due but not yet paid by the employers during 1973, thus bringing about requalification.  All arrears of benefit due, less the amount of unemployment assistance he has already received over the period in question, is now being paid to the person concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power why two persons (details supplied) in County Cork are being charged enormous terms for ESB connections when seven neighbours availing of the same scheme are not being charged; and if he will consider recommending a reduction in both cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that nine applicants in the Ballingeary rural area have been quoted terms for supply under the final phase of the subsidised rural electrification scheme in that area.</P>
      <P>Seven applicants are in one group and all were quoted interdependent terms which did not involve payment of capital contributions.  All of these applicants have accepted the terms quoted.</P>
      <P>The other two applicants' houses are located separately.  In one case an individual high tension extension of 600 metres and a five kVA transformer would be required and, in the other case, an individual high tension extension of 800 metres and a five kVA transformer would be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms quoted were based on the cost involved in making supply available.  Due to the high individual cost of extending supply to the two applicants, capital contributions of £285 and £442.50 respectively were required.  The capital contributions <Col N="52" /> quoted represent in each case a buying out of part of the special service charges.</P>
    <P>As I have explained in reply to recent questions of a similar nature, I have under consideration the possibility of assisting those householders who were quoted capital contributions for connection to the electricity supply under the final phase of the subsidised rural electrification scheme but who were, because of the high capital costs involved, unable to accept the terms.</P>
