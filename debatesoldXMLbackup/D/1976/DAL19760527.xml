      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved the adjournment of the debate on Tuesday last I had made the major part of my contribution.  One of the interesting aspects of the Bill is that it gives great encouragement to the creation of joint tenancy of family homes between spouses, which means one or other of them will not have to incur stamp duty, land registration fees, registry of deeds fee or courts fees.  That is enshrined in section 13 of the Bill.  This is an excellent, constructive approach which should be encouraged.  When the notice of existence of marriage is registered, again no stamp duty, registration of deeds fee or land registration fee shall be payable, which is very desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one reservation about the Bill to which the Minister might refer in his reply.  It is this.  The Bill <Col N="334" /> comes basically under the jurisdiction of the High Court but in certain cases the Circuit Court shall have jurisdiction.  In relation to the question of household chattels the District Court shall have jurisdiction up to a value of £1,000.  A spouse going before the High Court, or the Circuit Court especially, will undoubtedly incur substantial legal expenses.  I wonder if there is any method by which free legal aid can be granted to spouses who have to resort to the courts for protection under this Bill. Quite often marriages affected by the legislation will be in the lower or middle income bracket.  A spouse, especially the wife, may not have the funds necessary to pay solicitors or lawyers for their services.  In those circumstances, and because this Bill is really of a social welfare type, the question of free legal aid should now be considered.</P>
    <P>It was obvious from the Minister's introduction to the Bill&mdash;which was obviously well researched&mdash;that he is tackling the area of protection of the family home, the spouses and family. I wonder what thought he may have given to the establishment of family guidance centres around the country. For example, does he feel there is a need for such centres where expert advice could be given on the legal position in relation to marriages and, indeed, where counselling of marriages in general might be undertaken?</P>
    <P>Another excellent feature of the Bill which struck me very forcibly was that enshrined in sections 6, 7 and 8 with regard to repayment of mortgages and so on by a wife where her husband defaults.  If a wife discharges the husband's liability, then that discharge is a legal one and must be recognised.  Certainly it is an advancement on the present position.</P>
    <P>I see this Bill as a continuation of attitude of Government rather than as a piece of legislation.  The Government have been very constructive, progressive and generous in their approach to the whole question of social security and the protection of the under-privileged or those not so well off in our society.  In their short time in office they have introduced a <Col N="335" /> number of wide-ranging schemes, to which this is an addition.  For instance, there have been the pay-related benefit scheme, the reduction of the old age pension from 70 years to 67 years, with the means test eased, a new allowance for old age pensioners' dependants; the status of women has been substantially improved and new benefits have been introduced for deserted wives.  We introduced new allowances for unmarried mothers and an allowance for a single woman over 58 years of age who satisfies a means test.  We also introduced an allowance for prisoners' wives whose husbands are serving sentences of six months or more.  We have opened information centres where citizens rights are explained. We have set up research schemes with the aid of EEC funds concerning the question of combating poverty in our society.  We have amended the payment of the children's allowance to ensure that a mother may get the allowance if necessary.  We have also introduced the Social Welfare (Supplementary Allowances) Act which to me as a member of a local authority as well as a Member of Dáil Éireann is a very significant Act because it replaces the home assistance service with a new national scheme of assistance provided as of right to persons in need. In other words, a person in need will as of right be entitled to assistance under this scheme.</P>
    <P>I mention those in passing because this Bill is an extension of an attitude of Government which I feel was needed and was not implemented as it should have been in the sixties by the present Opposition party but which will stand to the credit of this Government. They will be seen as a Government very conscious of the needs of society and prepared, admittedly at considerable expense to the Exchequer, to ensure that the deprived and the lonely in our society are not thrown by the wayside, as was the tendency before we came into office. The problems of those people were tackled successfully.  Not only must the Minister for Justice be complimented <Col N="336" /> on the introduction of a number of Bills in that area but also the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare who has made such a solid impact on the whole question of social security.</P>
    <P>I notice in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 26th May that the spokesman on behalf of the Opposition is quoted as saying that they were worried in relation to the legislation before the House that it might cause more problems than it sought to solve.  He also unreservedly welcomed the legislation.  I am just picking him up on this particular point because, having read the Bill, I believe it will tackle the problems. As the Minister admits quite freely, there is a whole field of problems in relation to families such as ownership in community, which is practised in Belgium especially.  This does not arise here.  The Bill tackles the question of the protection, especially of a wife and family, in relation to the sale of the house and chattels without the spouse's consent.  I believe that the Bill is not flabby as the spokesman for the Opposition stated last Tuesday.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Bill is clear and simple in terms.  The problems are stated and the recourses are set out quite clearly.  I welcome the Bill.  I believe it is needed very much in our present day society.  I again ask the Minister to consider the question of free legal aid for people in need who have to have recourses to the Circuit Court and the High Court.</P>

      <P>Before I touch on the Bill I should remark on Deputy Collins' contribution and his anxiety to bring out certain things in aid of his political predicament.  I can only describe his speech in that connection as pathetic.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with him sitting behind a Government who have got themselves into the position they have, clutching at straws.  It remains to be seen how effective in practice this social programme the Deputy spoke about will be.  It is pathetic and I will leave it at that.</P>

      <P>Let us get to the Bill which the Deputy did not even deal with.  We had a lot of platitudes and compliments.  I appreciate the trouble the Minister has taken in the presentation of this Bill.  I also see something in the structure of the Bill which is businesslike and I am glad to say that.  I am also glad to say that there is opposite to me a Minister who has some practical experience and knows the practicalities of this kind of problem.  I trust that it is in that spirit that we can approach the discussion of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the Succession Act which emanated from the Minister's Department many years ago under a Fianna Fáil Government when I was on the other side of the House.  As originally introduced, that measure was so defective that considerable adjustment was necessary.  I need not go into the details of the adjustment as it is here.  One of the comments I want to make to the Minister, which I believe he will probably appreciate, is the danger of academic approaches.  There has been in this Department a tendency in this type of legislation to overwed what one might call the academic approach to this kind of legislation as against the practical.  I am confident that the Minister will be able to give a counter balance in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should beware of the hard cases that make bad law aggravated by theoretical and academic approaches to a legal problem and the attempt to find the solution in novel ways that do not fit into the practical world.  They may look all right in an administrative office but they are very different matters in the world and also in the court, as the Minister realises.  It is a long time since I have been in a court but I am very glad to see that the Minister has placed himself as in the court in this matter. <Col N="338" /> A large part, but by no means the whole, of this measure is a Committee Stage Bill.  At this stage some comments, which although properly for debate in detail on the sections, can be made now.  I am indebted to the Minister for the detail with which this matter has been presented.  If the Minister will not take offence, some of the authorities quoted are, in a sense, irrelevant because we are dealing with a very practical problem.  We should look at it as a practical everyday problem and try to seek solutions in the light of practicalities and not in the light of reports of commissions, reading text-books and so on.</P>
    <P>There are cases&mdash;I do not know how many&mdash;where vindictive spouses are involved. As the Minister rightly says the primary purpose of the Bill is to protect the members of a family of a vindictive spouse from having their homes sold or otherwise disposed of by him over their heads.  In the Minister's primary purpose there can be not only agreement all round but an active desire to co-operate in dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>Legislation of this nature has to go right across the board to be effective. We had to make this type of point in recent Finance Bills more than once. Very often when a problem arises, to get a solution that cannot be evaded, you have to go over a very wide area. In a case like this, one question must be asked: how important is the problem statistically&mdash;that is, in proportion of numbers&mdash;and socially in relation to the normality of families who will be affected, constrained and restricted by a measure of this nature?  In modern times there has naturally been a great deal of investigation and sympathy for the problems of particular groups where hardships emerge&mdash;groups which suffer special disabilities or have to face hardships. The classic cases are unmarried mothers or deserted spouses.  These have naturally attracted attention and rightly so.  They have been studied in detail because they are difficult problems and solutions have had to be found.  It should always be remembered in approaching problems of this nature that there is a large area of <Col N="339" /> normality where people are behaving properly and normally.</P>
    <P>One is often put to the very difficult and distasteful task of choosing between letting the hardship continue or penalising the normal element of the community for the purpose of alleviating the hardship.  I have used the word &ldquo;penalising&rdquo; here because I have no objection to asking for the community to co-operate and contribute to the solution of these problems and the alleviation of the hardship.  The community should be prepared to contribute, even at some cost, to the solution of such problems. But that is different from saying that we should bring in legislation that is in effect, a penalty on the greater element in the community.  This is one of the problems the Minister has had to face.  He has faced it and given it considerable thought.  That is the first question we have to ask before we come to specifics as regards the impact of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The talk of vindictive spouses is similar to what we hear about divorce, deserted wives and so on. Look around you.  These problems do exist.  Unless I am under a very great illusion, in all sectors of society, natural healthy relations prevail and families are, by and large, living in harmony, that is, harmony judged from the average practicality of life. Nobody is in Heaven but the greatest number of people are certainly not damned.  We must keep in mind the very large number of husbands and wives who are living in harmony and co-operating for their mutual support and welfare, and particularly for the benefit of their families.  This legislation will potentially restrict these people very much.  For this reason a very careful look must be had at it, apart from the fact that the thought put into it by the Minister and his Department deserve such attention in this House.</P>
    <P>I have no idea about statistics but if I appear to be severe in references to academic and administrative approaches to such problems, it is because of our experience on the Succession Act, as the records of the <Col N="340" /> House will show.  I refer specifically to speeches made from both sides of the House, particularly those made by one of our most eminent lawyers to whom I referred at the time, although I was on the opposite side of the House, and one of the most distinguished Members of this House who later became Taoiseach, the late Deputy J.A. Costello.  If one sees the principles through that debate one can see the traps that are here.  The traps are that it can be looked at in the rarefied atmospheres I have mentioned and it can go to reports, commissions and investigations.  It is very easy to lose a sense of proportion regarding the problems that exist as against the cases of the great majority of people and families who are to be affected by legislation of this nature.</P>
    <P>The next question is whether we can achieve the Minister's primary purpose, to use his own phrase, without restricting the freedom of the normal family to do the best for themselves, without the freedom of restricting the spouse or spouses to provide for the family.  That is the ideal.  If we cannot do that because of the interlocking of problems, then at least we must try to preserve the counterpart for the normality.</P>
    <P>Here I come specifically to the basis of the whole business&mdash;the family home.  What the Bill proposes to do is to give two spouses a joint interest in the family home, where one spouse can stop the other by going to a court.  Incidentally, if the Minister had to make a choice I am glad he chose that remedy, rather than some of the wildcat things that were suggested on other occasions for dealing with problems of this nature. There is provision in the Bill that a spouse who owns or has an interest in the family home may not sell or otherwise dispose of it without the consent of the other spouse and that it is impossible to get out of that tie without applying to the court.  If this is the Minister's answer let us look at the consequences.</P>
    <P>At this point may I say in parenthesis that I greatly appreciate the Minister's analysis of the registration <Col N="341" /> procedure as against the procedure he has favoured in the Bill.  For me and for others it has clarified some ideas and I say quite freely and frankly that I might have suggested the other if I were not convinced by the Minister's argument in this regard.  I accept that defects are there and that to a certain degree the matter could be nugatory.  However, it does not get away from the fact that the Minister is conveying a joint interest to both spouses in the family home.  Let us consider what might be the consequences.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing about the case of a vindictive spouse; it is the hard case that makes the bad law.  I am considering the case of the normal family. The Minister has used the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; but for convenience and clarity he dealt with the more ordinary case referring to husband and wife and I do not fault him on that.  When this Bill is passed it appears that this House will be effecting a legal conveyance to the joint ownership of the husband and wife, at least in so far as life tenancy is concerned.  I might put it in that way if I wished to get technical. I am sure there is no better man than the Minister to join issue with me if it came to legal technicalities; quite frankly I am seeking to avoid that.  If I have misread the Bill, if I am talking under a complete misapprehension, I invite the Minister to pull me up and tell me I am wrong. I will freely concede it and sit down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy is not using the phrase &ldquo;joint ownership&rdquo; in a technical sense.  I am waiting for him to tell us what he sees are the consequences for ordinary couples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. I am not using the term in a technical sense.  The Minister may have noticed that I corrected myself even to a life interest to avoid the <Col N="342" /> implication that was in it.  We can talk in a technical sense on the section involved. There are very many cases where a husband and father owns a house in which he, his wife and family are living and where he may be solicitous and anxious to do the best he can for the family.  However, circumstances may arise in that family; for instance, it might be his transfer from one area to another in the course of his employment or something affecting a child.  There would be no question of vindictiveness in such a case, there would be no question other than taking an action as a parent and husband for the benefit of his family and himself.  The point I wish to make is that this is a matter of judgment in the last analysis.  Problems of this nature are not ones that can be set down as a mathematical sum and come to a mathematical answer.</P>
      <P>Supposing a wife takes a different view, and she too may be influenced by the most worthy motives, what will happen?  We all know that even in the best ordered circles, even in political parties who make it their business to appear with absolute unanimity, certainly to have unanimity of feet when they enter the division lobby&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reality over here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the reality everywhere.  When there are differences like that people are inclined to hold to their views and an impasse of a sort can be reached.  Unless there is some overall compulsion in a certain direction the impasse will remain.  I mentioned about the harmony of feet in the division lobbies but in that case the Whips are able to get their Members in but in the case of a husband and wife who <i>bona fide</i> have opposite views the result may be to the detriment of all.  I should like to give a simple example.  An ordinary decent man who owns his house and wants to dispose of it will probably consult his wife&mdash;the minor children may not be consulted because it would be for their good.  The husband and wife may be able to agree to sell the house.  It may be possible to reach that agreement because firstly the man has the <Col N="343" /> power of decision and he takes action beneficial to all but if the two have equal voting rights a new situation arises.  It may mean that a husband wants to do a certain thing to solve a situation while his wife, now having the power to say no does not agree, and an impasse will result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but the law as it stands enables the husband to disregard his wife and we are now saying that in the event of disagreement we are introducing an objective third party, the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and I appreciate the Minister's problem and his way of thinking on this.  I am dealing with the approach to the problem in the first instance, before we get down to the solution.  If that situation arises, the answer will be, &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo;, the answer will be the dead hand, and everybody will suffer.  I should like to take the case of a husband who is working on the north side and changes to a job on the south side. There are certain conveniences for him in moving house to the south side. There may also be financial advantage to the family in the move and the husband may be obtaining promotion in his job.  Let us assume that there is positive advantage to the family in the move.  They can have comparable accommodation, more remuneration and approximately equal environmental conditions.  On the other hand, his wife may say that she wants the children to continue to attend their old school. She may say that the shopping centre in the area where she lives is better than the one in the area on the south side.  She may not want to leave her neighbours and this is a real consideration for a married woman, particularly as the family grow up.  Married women who are not working become associated with others like them in their area and friendships grow up.  There is an element of hardship for a wife in breaking such friendships.  That wife may decide not to agree to the move even though there are practical advantages involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supposing a wife is working on the north side and the new proposal for <Col N="344" /> her husband is on the south side of the city, there is an equality of conflict. If she moves she will have a problem and if her husband does not move he has a problem.  If one were to investigate this one would find many such cases; they do not appear in reports, in statistics or in books because problems like this heretofore have been ironed out in a human co-operative way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Common sense prevailed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  The Minister is banking on that.  Common sense prevails very often when somebody has the power of decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When a husband has the big stick to enforce it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Or a wife.  I do not underestimate the Minister and I hope he will take that as a compliment. He has said that common sense will prevail but I am sure he has often settled a case out of court.  I am sure he will agree that common sense prevails in the end when the common sense of one side has a considerable weight over the common sense of the other.  It can occur in the balanced case, there are two circumstances, but in either case common sense prevails either because the weight is all on one side or because the consequences are so doubtful that it is just as well to compromise.  I know the Minister is invoking the last psychological factor in support of this and I concede him what is in it.  I want to make this a constructive debate but this is what I feel about that approach to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, for the purposes of his brief and in order to be clear, specifically refers to the case of vindictive husbands and victim wives but it can be the case of an unfortunate husband and an impossible wife, something that is not unknown.  It may be something on the side of either spouse, a stronger character exercising benevolent protection over the other weaker character who needs the support and the affection of the stronger character.  One of the signs of weakness is seizing on any little strength one has and in this case I do <Col N="345" /> not fear the strong, dominant spouse who would refuse to co-operate but rather the weak spouse who would have the inner compulsion that all weak people have to assert themselves when they feel they have the strength to do it.  We must not leave out of the count the further practical human complication that the world abounds in mischievous counsellors, whether in the family itself, in the environmental family, brothers or sisters of spouses or neighbours.  When one has the type of problem posed in the normal case I have mentioned, what is more natural than for one of the spouses to speak to a near relation? How often have the consequences of that been a disaster where testamentary dispositions are concerned, perhaps not so much where matrimonial relations are concerned?</P>
    <P>These are facts that will not be in the report and if I seem to be a little hard on the study of reports, conditioning the approach to it by authorities and so on, I want it to be understood that I intend no reflection on anyone but I am concerned with the danger of a particular approach.  The world abounds in mischievous counsels and if the provisions of the Bill are introduced a fertile field is created for these counsellors.  Let me go back to the man on the north side of the city who owns his house and is living happily with his wife and family.  He has a chance of promotion and being nearer his job and can get comparable accommodation.  He can benefit his family financially and practically by moving to the south side.  His wife for other reasons&mdash; some valid, not trivial; the friendship of neighbours and company for a wife or employment, if she is working, are not trivial factors&mdash;will not agree.  The first reaction is that nothing is done when the conflict arises.  The second consequence is the building of a barrier between the husband and wife. The husband cannot but feel that he has been thwarted in his efforts to do his best for his family and he will at least be discouraged.  One can imagine the psychological effect on himself and the family.  The wife will take no pleasure in his victory; she will sense the cost of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> You are not only tending to build an estrangement but you may very well convert that normal marriage into a marriage where there is a vindictive spouse.  I am dealing with psychology and raising the question of judgment about this Bill: it is a question of judgment.  I do not minimise the Minister's problems nor do I want to discourage him; indeed, I want to join with him as far as possible in facing them but I also want to protect, if possible, the normal case, particularly when I see the danger that the operation of a right of this nature so conferred may tend to convert many cases of happy families into families in conflict.  I think I have made the first point very clear.  I am grateful to the Minister for accepting that if I have used what appeared to be technical terms, they were not.  I appreciate the way this Bill has been presented.</P>
    <P>I am not and never was an academic lawyer.  I am not even a lawyer now.  I am approaching this from the point of view of the ordinary Deputy with a little experience of the practicalities of the law.  I did not claim my own authority but I would commend in this context many of the sentiments expressed in the whole debate on the Succession Act from beginning to end in, I think, 1964 by the former Taoiseach, the late Deputy John A. Costello, as he was then, one of the most eminent, if not the most eminent, lawyer practising in this State almost from its foundation. His comments on that occasion are worthy of note.</P>
    <P>I am pleased, if I may say so, that when I was sitting on that side of the House and we were debating the Succession Bill, and he was sitting here, I was able to say and to urge on the House that what he had said should not be listened to lightly.  I would like to repeat that remark of mine at that time, but I will not delay the House by tracing the very long debate that took place then.  Neither, however, am I decrying nor in any way belittling the studious approach and the administrative approach to this.  Both have to be taken together.  The staff work and integration of logic that study <Col N="347" /> gives is necessary but one has to be sure that, in doing that staff work and effecting that integration, one is taking into account the whole human area involved and nothing else is involved in this debate and on this Bill than the status of the family and the position of the family.  So much for my first broad contention.</P>
    <P>Let us look now at it from the point of view of where we are going with certain legislation.  The tendency nowadays is very much towards the equality of men and women.  For too long we have had the subjugation of women.  We are very familiar now with the movement for the emancipation of women right from the days when separate property was first provided for to today when we are discussing equal pay.  Whatever about the discussions and the rights, the fact is that the role of women in our society is becoming more potent in decision making.  It is common now for women, married or otherwise, to be in employment. It is common now for women to have their separate property.  In the latest Finance Bill we made further provision for the separation of the spouses in regard to taxation accounting. Altogether the trend is to set the man and woman on an equal basis and to regard marriage as a partnership as, indeed, it should be.  As I have already pointed out, by the mere force of natural affection, natural impulses and remembering the way the Lord created men and women in the beginning, by and large the institution of marriage and the family works out. I have already adverted to the decision making problem where judgment is involved.  Someone must make the decisions.  Committees make decisions by a majority.  In other cases decisions are made by delegating power to one person.  How does one provide for the making of decisions where you have two votes and no chairman, a committee of two and no chairman?  That is what you have in marriage.</P>
    <P>How do you resolve the problem of judgment here?  Up to this we have looked at it from the point of view of the man and his property.  I have come to certain conclusions, already <Col N="348" /> on the record, but let us look at this now from the point of view of the woman who has her separate property, and rightly so.  How many cases are there of prudent wives with not so prudent husbands?</P>
    <P>Normally wives exercise their maternal care not only on their children but also on the big boys to whom they are married.  Humanity does not change.  A husband may be a good fellow, earning the bread, but he may want a bit of assistance.  How many husbands are strengthened by the support of their spouses.  I have come across cases where the wife with an understanding maternal element in her approach to her husband has supported him, has&mdash;at the risk of creating a pun&mdash;husbanded his resources, has saved, has, perhaps, acquired the house in which they live. She may be the owner of the house and she may be the person whose judgment is involved.  It may very well be that it is she who should have the disposal of the house.  Here we are introducing the situation as it existed in reverse where the woman is concerned.</P>
    <P>Let us take not only the facts now but also the trends in other legislation. In the Succession Act and elsewhere it was necessary to protect the wife by ensuring her separate property. This House deemed it necessary to protect her by that Act.  If she has prudently acquired assets in the form, for instance, of a family home she may have done that to guard against a weak or indolent spouse.  That spouse may be feckless and he may be truculent.  Being a man, he will know he has got rights.  Now there is a certain aggression in all of us that tends to make us exercise those rights and, as I said earlier, the weaker the character the more dangerous where rights are concerned and the less hope there is that there will be long-sighted forbearance.</P>
    <P>What position is that woman in? The husband may have run into debt or something like that.  There may be a situation where the change of environment might be the most beneficial step to make, and he can come in and say: &ldquo;No. You do not.&rdquo;<Col N="349" /> Again it is a block.  Woman are extra-ordinarily tolerant and devoted, as we know, in the normality of cases, in spite of all the things one reads about the abnormalities.  However, if he ties her to a place known to her to be not the best thing for her family, the fact that she is prevented from doing what she wants to do&mdash;because that is the result in this case of a committee of two without a chairman&mdash;to say the least of it, in that case there is going to be a very hurt woman, and, in all our practicalities here, we should not overlook the psychological factor. Indeed, it is the psychological factor that brings out the vindictiveness at which this Bill is aimed.</P>
    <P>These are very real problems that have to be faced by this House in passing the Bill.  I am not offering them as a reason why this Bill should not be passed, though if I were convinced that one had to choose between the lesser of two evils, I am afraid I would have to make that choice, whatever the answer might be.  I certainly do not think that in order to solve the lesser evil we should bring in a greater evil.  I have outlined the problems that will arise both for the man and for the woman.  Any woman who has, for instance, saved up, bought the house and, in prudence, kept it in her own name would like to have the disposal of it.  She would be as tied as the man.  I know the Minister did not intend to mislead when he said: &ldquo;I propose for convenience to refer in my remarks to `the wife' and `the husband' in cases where it is more likely that one or the other would be involved.&rdquo; The impression seems to have gone abroad that it is more likely to be the vindictive husband that is involved and that is probably true.  It should be realised, nevertheless, that the consequences impinge on the wife as much as on the husband.  Therefore, my case, taking it from both sides, with the attempt to give an example, boils down to this: the power conferred by this Bill will, in very many cases, result in inaction and that inaction may very well be to the detriment of both spouses and the family as a whole. That is the first point.</P>
    <P>The second point is that, that situation <Col N="350" /> having been developed, and particularly if there has been a difference of opinion between the two spouses as to what should have been done and that neither will give, the second disastrous possible consequence will be the changing of the relationship between the spouses, the initiation of the process that can very easily lead to the vindictiveness that this Bill is aimed at.  If that situation should arise, there would be a direct contribution to marriage difficulties&mdash;I will not say the breaking up of a marriage&mdash;and psychological difficulties within the family, and these quite apart from other material consequences.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will say two things, and rightly so, and I can see two things.  He will say: &ldquo;They can go to court and get a third person to arbitrate.&rdquo; Again, I will take the ordinary husband and wife.  Do they want to go to a third party?  Heretofore the solution in all of these cases would have been practically automatic, because the power of decision lay between the two of them and after due process it was worked out.  They did not want to go to another party; a solution was found.  Even in cases where the move was made with the disapproval of the other spouse, it could very easily happen that, if the judgment of the spouse making the decision was right, later the second spouse would be only too glad to acknowledge it and that, instead of being a cause of disruption, it would be a cause of unity and of benefit to the family.</P>
    <P>If two spouses are forced to go before anybody, you are on your way to matrimonial trouble.  I have handled a few matrimonial cases in my time at the Bar, and anybody who has handled them knows that if the solicitor whose advice they seek in the beginning cannot throw them back on themselves with the plea to settle the matter between them, and they cannot get a solution that way, these cases offer very grim hope, indeed, of a solution that will bring happiness or even material benefit to the spouses concerned.</P>
    <P>I would venture to say that in all the agitation for divorce and so on that <Col N="351" /> one hears, in 90 per cent of these cases both spouses are left, when separated, with a lasting regret, no matter what the animosity, no matter what the causes behind the separation were.  Here, by the very fact that we force people in the intimate relationship of a husband and wife to go to a third party, we are introducing the psychological element which is conductive to disruption.  We should think twice before we do this kind of thing, and reflect that the vast majority of husbands, wives and families in the community&mdash;and I believe in all communities&mdash;have happy relationships. I am not saying that anyone is in paradise.  Is what we are doing justified when one considers the impact on the larger area of normality?  I concede that it is justified and desirable in the cases envisaged by the sponsors of this legislation.  I agree with the Minister that the proper thing to do is to have resort to the normal processes of law.  I am very suspicious of arbitrations and councils where there are tried mechanisms. What will the effect on normality be if all this goes to a court of law, even if the court is like an income tax hearing, completely in camera?  On what basis will the court exercise its jurisdiction? What will the psychological impact be on the family thereafter? Take the case of the man with a wife on the north side who can move to the south side on promotion and who comes to the conclusion that he should part with the dwelling on the north side and acquire a dwelling on the south side.  The wife is opposing this for certain reasons.  When the case comes before a judge what can the judge say?</P>
    <P>From the material point of view the judge might decide that the wife's objection is unreasonable, that the man has to work, that the physical hardship on him in commuting across the city would introduce an undue risk, and that there are better prospects for the family on the south side.  From the woman's point of view she has friends and neighbours and she might feel that there are better educational facilities for the children, and there might be a shopping centre quite near. <Col N="352" /> The woman might think all these things more important than the monetary prospects of the new position. In a case such as this the husband might very quickly dispose of the argument and put the case before a judge.  Is that fair to the woman? Is it conducive to good marital relationships thereafter?  Is it not hardship on the woman to be deprived of social and marketing amenities?  In these circumstances not only might the woman cool off towards her husband but she might feel deprived of the opportunity of discharging her household duties properly.  This may all seem very far fetched but it is very much reality.  I would urge the Minister to take this point of view into consideration.  My remarks are aimed at being helpful rather than in a destructive way.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a very well thought out and efficiently presented measure. However, in section 1 &ldquo;family home&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it in section 2.  Section 2 says :</P>
    <P>(1)  In this Act &ldquo;family home&rdquo; means, primarily, a dwelling in which a married couple ordinarily reside.  The expression comprises, in addition, a dwelling in which a spouse whose protection is in issue ordinarily resides or, if that spouse has with just cause left the other spouse, ordinarily resided before so leaving.</P>
    <P>(2)  In subsection (1) &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; means&mdash;(a)  any building, or (b)  any structure, vehicle or vessel (whether mobile or not), or part thereof, occupied as a separate dwelling and includes any garden or portion of ground attached to and usually occupied with the dwelling or otherwise required for the amenity or convenience of the dwelling.</P>
    <P>The generality of that definition is staggering to say the least.</P>
    <P>First of all, there is the spouse whose protection is at issue who ordinarily resides or has, with just cause, left the other spouse.  Before one can interpret this section at all so far as this case is concerned, one has to answer the question: is there or is there not just cause?  One is opening <Col N="353" /> up the whole area of matrimonial law with just two words.  I am not casting any aspersions on the drafting of the Bill, which has been carefully done, but I do emphasise this to show the difficulties against which we, the draftsmen and originators of the Bill, are up against when it comes to the practicalities.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) (b) says:</P>
    <P>... any garden or portion of ground attached to and usually occupied with the dwelling or otherwise required for the amenity or convenience of the dwelling.</P>
    <P>At least in our Capital Acts and so on there was a definition of the amount of ground that went with the dwelling. Here the question arises as to whether a portion of the ground adjacent to the dwelling could be disposed of by the husband, if he owned it, particularly if there was a substantial plot around it.  Substantial plots are visualised in other legislation which could be captured by the phrase &ldquo;any garden or portion of ground attached to and usually occupied with the dwelling or otherwise required for the amenity or convenience of the dwelling&rdquo;.  Let us look at those words &ldquo;attached to and usually occupied with&rdquo;.  Look at the generality of those words.  Look also at the generality of the words &ldquo;amenity or convenience&rdquo;.  The restrictive nature on the rights there are so great as to cause, in time, very serious perturbations in the ownership and disposal of property and so on.</P>
    <P>I could go on for quite some time on this.  Perhaps I should leave details of this nature to Committee Stage.  But I do want to point out that the generality of that has implications that can go very far indeed.  There are very many more things I could properly say on Second Stage but I shall conclude with this summary: first, that in weighing the impact on the normal majority are the provisions of this Bill sound or justified?  Secondly, are the blatant dangers to the institution of the family and of marriage in this so great that some further positive measures are needed for protection?  I raise that as a very serious issue.  I am afraid I would not be going too far if I say that <Col N="354" /> this Bill could be regarded as an inducement to people to live without the institution of marriage.  Already the Minister has found the trap where engagement is concerned.  But, in this modern world where the institution of marriage as we know it has been changed and modified&mdash;there is an evolving situation.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach will perhaps get my reference when I refer to Roman law&mdash;the various types of marriage that developed in Roman jurisprudence&mdash;and I do not presume to offer any comment in the face of his authority on such matters but I think he will concede that I may have a point in making that reference.</P>
    <P>Are we not bringing about a position where formal marriage may be a thing to be avoided and where, if there is enough of informal marriage, we are back to a common law position? That seems a desperately exaggerated thing to do.  But, as far as I can see, all the provisions of this Bill can be avoided in the case of two people living together and bringing up a family&mdash;a thing not unknown in modern times&mdash;because they are not spouses or else one has to bring in the definition of &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; to include them.  If it is the first case, then there is a direct incentive to destroy the formal relationship of marriage.  If the second thing is done, there is straight away a statutory recognition of the institution of what I will call common law marriage.  One is caught either way.  That is something that cannot be lightly thrown aside.  I say it as forthrightly as I can, very conscious of the fact that when one says something badly and forthrightly like that, without qualification, one may be exaggerating.</P>
    <P>In law, we must watch the potential of what we legislate.  The probability of it is important also but the potential is there.  I say that, under modern conditions, with the agitations current every day and the changing of customary approach to the relations of men and women, this Bill tends to do one of two things: if the unmarried spouses&mdash;that, is, the irregular liaison&mdash;are outside it, then this very fact encourages that.  If the irregular <Col N="355" /> liaison is within it, then this recognises the irregular liaison.  I may seem old fashioned but, in either case, an institution in our structure&mdash;which all societies in some form or another have recognised and evolved as an necessity of nature, a part of nature&mdash;is, to some extent, endangered.  It is a hard thing to say but it is better to recognise what we are doing.</P>
    <P>The Minister's explanatory memorandum demonstrates it where, in the space of less than a page he summarises the provisions and purposes and then has to continue for pages with sections hedging in the legislation. The Bill, while not dealing at all with the difficulties I mentioned, contains no fewer than 15 sections, some of them substantial.  That, in itself, is an indication of the difficulties of this problem, the dangers of the approaches to it, and justifies an earnest debate in this House in which I hope I have tried constructively to take part.  As an earnest of that intention, I have no hesitation whatever in recognising the ability, competence and thought that went into the preparation of the measure.  Recognising the personal competence, experience and expertise of the Minister who presented it, being at one with him in a desire to cope with this problem, I gladly acknowledge all of that.  But I should like the broader aspects I have urged to be remembered.  I urged them at some length because I feel it is inevitable that, when one focuses on problems such as these&mdash;whether in committee, commissions, in the administrative office, or merely from the point of view of the problem itself&mdash; one may be somewhat myopic in view and fail to recognise that the impact of the whole of what is attempted here may be so wide and the repercussions so great that a second look should be taken at it.</P>

I listened carefully to this bit and what he is really telling us is that these liaisons will be encouraged by the provisions of this Bill because an irregular liaison will be one to which the provisions of the Bill will not apply.</P>
      <P>I ask the House to consider a fine summer evening, two young people in a later stage of engagement going for a stroll on Killiney Beach and the male half of the pair looks a bit down-cast. &ldquo;What is troubling you, darling?&rdquo; says his fiancée.  &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;it is only, darling, that the Family Home Protection Bill, 1976, came into force this evening.  You know what that means?&rdquo; he adds heavily.  &ldquo;Oh, does that mean, darling, that it is all off between us?&rdquo; says his fiancée.  &ldquo;Well, not necessarily,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;provided you are willing to dispense with the Church ceremony.&rdquo; Surely to God, that is as near the outer edge of craziness as anything ever uttered in this House.</P>

      <Col N="357" /> I am sorry to say that to Deputy de Valera who I know is a man almost devoid of party spirit.  I hope I am not damaging him in his own party by saying that but he has got an objective mind and if he does not mind my saying that to him he does his best in legislation.  There is no question about that but I really cannot be expected, and nobody here could possibly be expected, to take seriously the suggestion which we heard him make here, which we could barely credit our ears hearing him make, ten minutes ago.  I am glad to see Deputy Andrews over there opening envelopes because I have a few things to say about his contribution on Tuesday which I followed up since then.</P>

I have been watching the other side ever since I became conscious of law and politics and I never could conceive a Government which showed less practical interest in law reform in the area particularly dealing with the family.

      <P>I hope it will not send any of the gentlemen opposite into orbit if I say in one short sentence that whatever the departmental decisions which preceded the enactment of this measure it was, in fact, the Minister beside me who presided over the enactment of the measure which regularised that particular point in a sense acceptable to human considerations. The law of maintenance in regard to the maintenance of a wife and her children by a husband who has absconded is something which I know a bit about because I tried when in the Seanad to introduce a Private Members' Bill there which, of course, was shot down, not even on a Second Reading&mdash;I was not even allowed that distance by Senator Ó Maoláin&mdash;by Fianna Fáil at its First Reading.  It aimed at taking away the ceiling of £4 a week which was the maximum the District Court could award a deserted wife against her absconding husband.  It may come as a surprise to people that I am a thorn in the side of women's liberation or anything of that kind.  My Bill was aimed at lifting that ceiling, removing it altogether and permitting the court to make what order in regard to the maintenance of wife and children it thought just, having regard to the husband's needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Bill did not even get as far as a Second Reading in the Seanad. The then Government would not even make time for it.  The reason they gave was that a Bill for doing this very thing was under consideration and would be introduced in due course.  On our side we prodded the Fianna Fáil Government and eventually <Col N="360" /> a Bill appeared which contained a section which increased the level of maintenance payments to £7.50p a week.  That was in 1972.  I realise that most legislation then and, perhaps, even some now is copied slavishly from British legislation.  With that in mind, I went back to the British legislation and had a look.  On my solemn oath I found that the English had passed a Bill 11 years previously which had set as a maximum in 1961 for such maintenance awards what they called in their legislation 150s a week, in other words £7 10s or £7.50.  The Fianna Fáil Government were not even able to adapt the thing having regard to inflation and the fall in the value of money.  They slavishly copied in 1972 from a 1961 British Statute the ceiling for what a magistrate's court could award a deserted wife against her absconding husband.</P>
    <P>After I showed them that disgrace that section was withdrawn.  I have to admit they had enough grace to withdraw it and a section was then put in which, in fact, removed entirely the ceiling on such awards.  That was the result of pressure from the Opposition and absolutely in no sense whatsoever a credit to the Government who were shamed into doing it.</P>
    <P>In regard to death duties, we all know the situation that existed here in 1972 when, particularly with the rise in the value of agricultural land, an unexpected and premature death of a father left a family with crushing financial obligations which frequently necessitated the sale of a home or farm or the fragmentation of a farm or business, at a time when the family was emotionally stricken and in the worst possible condition to provide sensibly for their future economic existence.  We were laughed at during the 1973 election when we proposed to do away with death duties.  It could not be done.  It was pie in the sky. It has been done and the party that laughed at us are now quoting their Leader's speeches made a couple of months ago at the Napper Tandy Cumann, or some such establishment, urging family law reform.  That is one subject that could never be heard from those benches.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera mentioned the Succession Act a few times. That too is something about which it would well behove the Opposition to pipe down.  The Bill for that Act when first produced caused an uproar through the length and breadth of this country that I cannot remember the like of, except for ex-Deputy Moran's Criminal Justice Bill.  The then Minister for Justice, Deputy Haughey, was publicly invited by people who very seldom surfaced in a political context or took any part in a debate, to read the Bill carefully because they had reason to think he had never read it properly.  That Bill virtually took away the right to bequeath property the way a testator wished.  It was only after the whole country was shouting at the then Government that the Bill was radically altered and the Succession Act which was eventually passed was acceptable.  In its original form, nothing could have been less conducive to the maintenance and solidarity of the family and, above all, to the avoidance of the very thing Deputy de Valera was talking about, family squabbling, which is never more vindictive and full of hatred as when it is about family property and its descent.</P>
      <P>If I may finish this little list of instances.  To this day we still do not know the attitude, if any, of the Fianna Fáil Party on contraception, the McGee judgment, whether the Bill which we tried to pass here two years ago, had it been produced in any other setting than one in which they thought they might have the cheap and intransient success of seeing the Government beaten, would or would not have been acceptable to them.  They proposed no amendment to it.  Their only comments were of a childish nature which nobody could take seriously, that it should be administered by a health board, as though it were purely a health matter.</P>

      <P>The events of the middle of July, 1974, in this House, which are very strongly relevant to family law reform and the dignity and privacy of the person in that sphere of life, are a very substantial and positive milestone.  I have said that before, I am willing to say it again and I do not care who thinks it is funny. It was the first time, north or south, in which so substantial a number of public representatives, directly elected <Col N="365" /> by the people, showed their minds on a topic on which there were strong religiously-conditioned feelings which might have been expected to get them voting the other way.  That had never happened in this Parliament or the Northern Parliament before.  I am proud to have taken part in that.</P>
      <P>I have no fanatical feelings about contraception one way or the other. I would not join a society for the promotion or rejection of such a measure.  My attitude towards it was very simple.  It is, and ought to be, a private sphere of life and the State ought not to bring the criminal law into that sphere.  That is the simple point of view on which my own vote and my work as Whip was based. It was a point of view shared by dozens of Deputies on this side, every one of whom is a practising Catholic, and none of whom has any interest of a personal kind in the passage of this Bill.</P>
      <P>These Deputies, out of an objective conviction&mdash;they do not expect others to share that conviction&mdash;that the State ought not to interfere to the extent to which it had been interfering, walked through the &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; part of the Lobby.  The Bill was not passed because there were seven or eight Deputies on this side whose conscience told them otherwise.  They were perfectly right to vote otherwise, if their conscience told them to do so.  They would have been wrong to do anything else.  Although that Bill did not pass, that effort is a milestone and no amount of laughter or cheap sneering from a party whose point of view on this subject is not even known, will wash that milestone away.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite apart from measures of a social welfare nature that were never even thought of; I mention help for unmarried mothers, for families of handicapped children and for prisoners' wives.  These matters have been attended to in the last three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not have opened and continued on this political note were it not for the complacent references in <Col N="366" /> Deputy Andrews' speech.  It was quite a good speech and I hope the Deputy does not mind my saying so; he dislikes being praised because he thinks he is being condescended to.  Were it not for the Deputy's invitation to us to look at the record of the party to whose leader he so obsequiously referred, I would not have opened and continued on this note.  That is sufficient about the <i>bona fides</i> and the record of the Opposition in this regard and about what we have achieved.</P>
    <P>It is rather surprising to find that the basic purpose of the Bill is still unfulfilled after nearly 40 years of our Constitution.  I can well imagine that a wife who found her home being sold over her head by her husband could have gone to the High Court&mdash; certainly in the more enlightened days from 1963 onwards, and could have sought an injunction restraining her husband from completing a conveyance or continuing negotiations to sell the family home vindictively, relying on the guarantees in Articles 41 and 42.  That might not have been possible in the 1940s or 1950s when judges were not so adventurous in interpreting the Constitution.  It seems to me that the main purpose of this Bill might have been effected through the courts rather than through the Legislature if a suitable occasion had arisen.</P>
    <P>While I hope such cases are not too common, of course they occur.  It is only a matter of six months since I had two visitors to my own political clinic.  They were a married woman and her sister and they had literally sneaked out of their home because otherwise they would have got a beating from the woman's brutal husband. They wanted advice about where they might get a solicitor.  I presume that such cases are not by any means isolated and obviously the Department of Justice have notice of a substantial number, thus justifying a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>The object of the Bill might easily have been achieved via a court and it seems to me only accidental that it has not happened.  Since the object is now being achieved by legislation, it is well that the legislation should be <Col N="367" /> orderly and sensible.  I noticed that Deputy Andrews used this criteria and, in applying that criteria, he took a very dim view of the Bill and wanted it sent back for redrafting.  I think a couple of his points are without much substance.  I do not think that the Bill is likely to be wrecked by the application of Article 43 which deals with private property.  That article contains very heavy qualifications on the right to have private property and where there is a social purpose on a limitation of the right of private property that social purpose has usually been upheld.  Socially inspired restraints on private property have a very long history, far ante-dating the Constitution.  They go back to the Rent Restrictions Acts after the first world war; probably they go back to the 19th century if one pursued the matter.  As Mr. Justice Hanna said in the case of the Pigs Marketing Board against Donnelly &ldquo;it is too late in the day to try to assert the doctrines of <i>laissez-faire</i> in this kind of setting as though thought had not moved on&rdquo;. My own feeling is that this Bill is perfectly safe from challenge on the grounds of Article 43.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that.  I raised the matter with a view to ensuring that the people whom the Bill seeks to protect would look at it from that angle.  It was not by way of criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  The Deputy also referred to the litigation which the Bill envisaged and he was anxious that it would not be prohibitive from the financial sense.  I share his anxiety about that.  I would be very glad if any litigation which the Bill envisages could be socially supported in some way in a case of need; I will not use the expression &ldquo;legal aid&rdquo;.  That is no more true of this Bill that it is of a large number of other cases where litigation is, unfortunately, necessary between husband and wife or in a family setting.  I do not take the Deputy to mean that only this Bill should be one where litigation is cheap or free.  I am sure he would consider it desirable <Col N="368" /> if we could afford it progressively to extend social assistance in some form to other kinds of civil litigation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made a couple of points that deserve attention.  I was interested about his point regarding compulsory acquisition and the fact that the Bill does not seem to offer the same threat to a compulsory acquisition as it does to a private conveyance.  An answer to that is that on compulsory acquisition the law requires full compensation. Compulsory acquisition of a building which is used as a dwelling could not be done under our law without compensation representing the full market value, thus presumably offering the family the possibility of replacing the dwelling with another. At the same time, the point is one of interest and I hope the Minister will note it in his reply.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews also referred to the problem where the consent may be obtained by fraud or by duress. In other words, he was referring to the position of a wife who was beaten or tricked into signing a consent to the alienation of the family home but who did not wish it to be alienated.  The buyer is protected in that situation by the Bill if he is not guilty of any neglect; if he is a <i>bona fide</i> buyer, paying full value and having made the necessary inquiries he is protected.  The fact that the consent may have been defective does not affect him, although I agree that it is no help to the spouse who has been beaten or deceived into signing a consent. Here it may be that the problem is beyond the reach of a Bill like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large part of the arguments we heard from Deputy de Valera ran along the lines that this Bill was faulty in that it did not do ten times as much as it set out to do.  He would like a great deal more.  That is a weak line to take on a Bill like this.  Of course, it cannot close off every possibility of wrongdoing or injury.  It may be that the case Deputy Andrews mentioned yesterday was one of these.  In the context of wives who are ill-treated physically by their husbands, it is a point that was worth mentioning.  The <Col N="369" /> other point of substance which Deputy Andrews made was&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is having a very good main course of my speech; what would he like for afters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Andrews has interrupted me so often that I do not think I will be short of material.  The Deputy made a point in regard to the problem which this Bill might represent for landlords or mortgages but I do not think there is the same substance as in the previous two.  It is fair enough to say that even a landlord or a mortgagee, unpopular and filled with hostility evoking overtones that these expressions are, have rights.  If they wished they can devote their money to something other than house property or mortgages and if they are going to be frightened off because the law will not protect them, there will be a social loss.  The Deputy is correct in saying that they have rights but somebody who chooses to put his money into houses or mortgages, an individual or an institution, must recognise that they are putting it into a socially sensitive asset.  They must expect to be, to some extent, at risk.  I hope it will not be an excessive risk in an orderly society where to disturb settled expectations and settled rights too radically or without notice or unfairly is a wrong thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When they put their money into bricks and mortar and tiles they must understand that what is going to be making use of that is not just somebody else making money but a complex human organism which we recognise to be the foundation stone of society, namely, the family.  They cannot expect to be immune from whatever social regulation society chooses to apply in defence of the family.  I do not want to wag the finger at mortgagees or landlords, on the contrary, landlords have been unfairly frightened off this form of investment because the regulation to which they are subject has not been rational.  On the one hand there is not enough control of pirate landlords who provide very poor accommodation, terrorise tenants, who interfere with electricity meters, who <Col N="370" /> do not observe the requisite standards of hygiene, privacy or anything else.</P>
    <P>There should be more control of such landlords but to leave a situation where a man with money to invest will keep away from housing altogether because he is afraid he will never get a tenant out, that he may be stuck in an inflationary decade and ten years later still with the same amount of rent as he got at the beginning is wrong.  That kind of possibility frightens people away from what is a perfectly lawful investment. I agree with Deputy Andrews that all the rights are not on one side.  This is something that should be looked at comprehensively; tenants' ordinary human rights and contractual rights ought to be more strongly defended by the State but, equally, the State should be a little less heavy handed in its operation <i>vis-á-vis</i> potential landlords which tends to put off this form of social investment.  The result is that the pressure on the State and local authorities to provide housing is intensified. I would like to see more regulation on both sides and for the benefit of both sides.  I do not think that the landlord in the setting of this Bill will be at any special disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should like to refer to a letter I read in a newspaper recently which was written by a member of the law faculty of which I am a member.  That person took the view that the Bill does not go far enough because instead of merely empowering a spouse to object if the other spouse is trying to sell a house or get rid of a dwelling that what this Bill ought to do, according to the writer of that letter, is to go the logical step further and vest a dwelling jointly in both spouses so as to give them from the word go a joint interest in a matrimonial dwelling.  The writer felt that that would protect a deserted spouse better.  The deserted spouse could not be put out of the dwelling and she would be protected better than under this Bill.  Under this Bill she can stay in the dwelling provided she takes on the obligations of mortgage repayments, or rent repayments, which her absconding husband has failed to honour.  It is true that <Col N="371" /> most wives might find it extremely difficult to meet mortgage repayments or to pay rent if their husband had run off and that provision such as suggested by the writer of this letter would at least put them into the situation of being an irremovable tenant but that will only intensify the problem which married couples have in trying to find accommodation in the first place.</P>
    <P>Many landlords are unreasonably strict in regard to taking married couples with children into their premises but a landlord would not take them in at all if such a law existed. In that case he would have to know a great deal about their marital situation and would have to be able to assure himself that if one of them ran off and did not meet the rent obligations the other would be able to meet the rent obligations.  The landlord would find himself making inquiries from the bank not only about the financial solvency and solidity of a husband but of a wife also.  He would have to satisfy himself that in the event of a desertion, a wife, if she was the deserted party remaining behind would be able out of her means to pay the rent.  How many couples looking for rented accommodation would be in a position where the husband and the wife could satisfy the landlord accordingly?  I would think not more than one couple in 50.  Accordingly, while I recognise the good intent behind the suggestion it is impracticable in so far as a landlord and tenant relationship is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not too clear by what procedural means the capacity of the other spouse referred to in section 7 will come before the court's notice.  This is the provision whereby proceedings can be adjourned where a mortgagee or lessor is bringing an action for possession if the court is satisfied that the other spouse if left in possession would be able to discharge the obligations. I am not too clear by what procedural means the other spouse will get a chance to satisfy the court that that is the case because the other spouse is not a party to the proceedings, will not have the proceedings served on her and <Col N="372" /> would have to intervene in some shape or form.  I will be glad to hear from the Minister on that point rather than reading about it in the newspapers later.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be commended for the provision in section 10, that proceedings in the jurisdiction created by section 10 will be held otherwise than in public.  There is a fair list of proceedings which can under our law be held otherwise than in public but I do not think that list is enough.  I am all in favour of justice in cases of public importance being conducted in public so that people can see what kind of justice is being administered but where a family squabble is on the same case cannot be made.  It is intensely painful and humiliating to the parties, their relations and, in particular, to their children.  Deputies have noticed from time to time hurtful and humiliating actions for criminal conversation and the like being brought in our courts in which every word of the evidence is faithfully reported in the newspapers.  There is no point in blaming the newspapers for that but the innocent parties affected by such actions, particularly children who are very sensitive about what happens to their families, are cruelly hurt.  I would like to see a Bill introduced on the publicity of court proceedings in which the list which exists at present under the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, and the other scattered provisions to that effect extended and in particular generalised for the benefit of children who are in no way to blame for what is going on over their heads but who are cruelly, perhaps irreparably hurt by it.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on taking yet another step forward in the field of family law reform in which he has already shown so much interest and in which the Government have been so strongly behind him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to compliment the Minister.  We have seen him in many roles here in the last few months.  It is difficult to imagine that the same Minister could be concerned with the area of what one may call fundamental security not only within the State but to a certain exabl <Col N="373" /> tent outside it, such as we had in the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, and with this fundamental area of social family reform.  But that is how it is. My first point then is that there is a great anomaly in the fact that a Minister who is concerned with such fundamental social reform as this and previous legislation which he introduced should also be charged with the fundamental security of the State.  The Parliamentary Secretary is leaving and I hope that I can keep my remarks on an objective basis and that there will not be any partisan swopping of compliments or criticism. I also hope not to incur the wrath of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle as I did in the case of the Ceann Comhairle when he was here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us may have been to some extent impatient with what has not been achieved in the past but if we acknowledge the importance of this area, the whole area of family law and women's rights which has always been a fundamental issue in public morality but is becoming even more important now, we must be consistent and acknowledge that this trend demands a separate concern by a separate Department and a separate Minister. I believe the Minister now present is happier with this type of legislation than the other type which we so firmly opposed and which we would again oppose if it were introduced.  To an extent, that explains the kind of thing the Parliamentary Secretary was criticising.  He spoke of lack of progress. Who is to say that great progress was made or is being made now, even if some is being made?  Is there not some explanation in the fact that the Minister and the Department concerned&mdash;we know the realities of this in the last ten years particularly&mdash; from time to time when they might have wished to turn their attention to matters of social implication were prevented from doing so and even now to a considerable extent are being prevented from doing so I do not think either the Minister or his advisers would deny this&mdash;by the pressing obligations of national security which are vitally important but hardly seem to be in any way related to this very important area. <Col N="374" /> Here I hope I may be excused for being slightly partisan.  I remember when the Taoiseach made his first speech in the House when the new Government came in.  They were a new Government as distinct from a Government that had been in office for 16 years and a Government that had created in the public mind an expectation that they would be reforming government in the widest sense.  Had the Fianna Fáil Government stayed in power one of the areas that I believe they would have examined is the whole structure of Government. In his first speech the Taoiseach gave us to understand that he was looking at that and more than three years later we find that not even one thing has been done to bring the structures of Government up to date to cater for modern and very pressing present needs.</P>
    <P>I preface my remarks on this Bill by saying that because&mdash;I think the Minister will be the first to acknowledge this; to his credit he has shown concern and has proved it in this and in the Family Law Act&mdash; this type of legislation will not end now: it will be a continuing programme. We are not merely concerned with establishing rights and protections such as these two measures are concerned with.  There is a whole range of matters relating to property and educational programmes&mdash;and I have mentioned something about the fundamental meaning of the family&mdash;that have been excluded from these measures but which I believe would not be excluded if we had a separate Department concerned with this area because they would have had the time, the opportunity and the constant commitment to ensure their inclusion.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that when Fianna Fáil come back to Government they will change the structures of government to cater for the pressing social needs of the moment so that these structures will be more properly related to the needs.  I am sometimes surprised that this Government seem to defend with more zeal the structures they inherited from a Government that had been <Col N="375" /> there for 16 years than the Fianna Fáil Government would have shown in their defence had they remained in office.  I think the Minister would be the first to recognise this.  There is a contradiction in the responsibility placed on his shoulders.  I hope now we can have at least the beginning of some thought of changing that situation. Do I need to start underlining the other responsibilities the Minister has and which even the most superficial observation must recognise as being absolutely contradictory?  That is the first point.</P>
    <P>The second point arises from it. There may have been a slow rate of change and lack of adequate finance but if any point has been made consistently by most speakers in this debate it is that the proceedings that will become necessary under this Bill may be desirable but where will the money come from?  Who will guarantee that the wife who is being deprived of her family home will be able to take proceedings and that the legal costs will be secured for her?  That question has been asked over and over again not only in regard to this but in regard to all types of family and marital litigation.</P>
    <P>It might as well be known that from the point of view of lawyers&mdash; and I speak as a practising lawyer&mdash; they feel a social obligation to undertake cases of this kind at very considerable loss and expense.  It is only fair to say that for that reason solicitors and barristers show less enthusiasm for acting in matters where there is a social obligation, in areas of separation or civil nullities or whatever else than they will evince in other cases where they can earn normal fees.  What is there to encourage them to act since there is no fee available in many cases?  Like others, I have been involved in some such cases.</P>
    <P>If the State is introducing reform in this and other related areas then the State must ensure that the costs and fees to guarantee that those rights will be implemented or protected will be made available.  If there was a Department <Col N="376" /> of Family Law and a Minister of Family Law, or whatever they might be called, then because there was a Minister in his own separate right in that section, or a Minister of State or a Parliamentary Secretary, I believe that action could be taken in that regard.  I use the term &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; because that is the expression the Taoiseach used at least three-and-a-half years ago but there has not been a budge or a whisper from the Taoiseach since although he mentioned this when he came into office.</P>
    <P>If you have a separate Department with a separate responsibility I believe the political head of that Department would be in a much stronger position than the present Minister for Justice is in guaranteeing the necessary finances to implement programmes.  The Minister is not in that position at the moment because there are conflicting demands and naturally the security of the State will win if there is a question of competition as between it and legal aid.  I say this in ease of the Minister's position because I know there has been delay.  There was delay when we were in Government too.  Not alone is there budgetary competition between Departments but there is competition within Departments and areas such as free legal aid will have to play a very poor second fiddle to the more urgent demands of the fundamental security of the State, for example, and I believe that is the reason, partly at any rate, why the necessary financial provision has not been made, not just in the lifetime of this Government but in the lifetime of the previous Government as well.  I have to acknowledge that.  We all know of cases where, because of lack of finance, wives have not even begun to seek their rights.  If we support this Bill, as I and my party are supporting it, then we must ensure that the funds are there for those who are going to rely on this measure.</P>
    <P>The resolution of the problem is not, of course, a matter for the Minister. He is torn between various contradictory demands.  The resolution of the problem is a matter for the Government, which held out some hope <Col N="377" /> three-and-a-half years ago, but who is to say what is going on in the Taoiseach's mind at the moment?  If anything I have said now by way of introduction helps to resolve the contradiction and solve the Minister's problem then I may have made a useful contribution.</P>
    <P>We all know the Parliamentary Secretary's style&mdash;that is, the last speaker, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  He came in immediately after Deputy de Valera whose speech was marked with nothing but concern for the fundamental family unit, with that and only that, and its social significance. There was nothing partisan and it is regrettable that the Parliamentary Secretary should come in immediately afterwards and try to involve us in a party political issue on such a fundamental matter.  At one stage he said we had no right to speak on family law reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is and the record will show it.  That is why I asked him should we leave the House.  I shall not dwell on it.  We support the Minister, and I think he will acknowledge this, in what he is doing and the question then is where do we go from here?  It is not a question of who failed in the past.  I have not had an opportunity of reading the speech made by Deputy Andrews but from the reports I have seen of it was certainly an objective analysis of the Bill.  I do not think he raised any political issue which would justify the Parliamentary Secretary coming in here to tell us about the record of the Government on contraception, and so on, by comparison with our record. As I say, I found the whole thing laughable.  If the Parliamentary Secretary as Government Chief Whip is concerned for the ordinary business of the House he should keep partisan, petty politics out of legislation like this, legislation in which we are all vitally concerned.  I do not think the Minister will expect me to go back over the record of Fianna Fáil much less the record of the present Government. Let us leave it at that.  Let us look now at where we are going to <Col N="378" /> see what we can achieve in this area.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's speech there is a very active concern, a concern shared by all of us, to protect the wife who has been exploited or abused by a vindictive husband.  A good deal of legislation has been introduced to cope with these situations.  There has been a big change from the time when a woman was regarded as a chattel.  I am quite sure we will go further than we are going now, but in this legislation there is the right on the part of the woman to a share in the family home and to all that is involved in it. In protecting the wife we must be concerned not to injure others who may not be involved in the family circumstances at all.  I am thinking of the <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value. Normally a married couple decide to sell and move somewhere else.  Invariably they sell to another couple, possibly less well off than the sellers who are moving to a bigger house. The married couple coming in have to be considered.  I think Deputy Andrews made reference to this matter. Section 3 (1) provides:</P>
      <P>Where a spouse, without the prior consent in writing of the other spouse, purports to convey any interest in the family home to any person except the other spouse, then, subject to section 4, the purported conveyance shall be void.</P>
      <P>Therefore there cannot be an alienation of the interest in the family home without the consent of the spouse.  Subsection (3) provides:</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) shall not apply as against a person if he is a purchaser in good faith for full value and if all such steps, inquiries and inspections as ought reasonably to have been taken and made for the purpose of ascertaining whether a consent was necessary under that subsection or, if necessary, was obtained were taken and made by him or on his behalf; and if a question arises in any proceedings whether the conditions specifield in this subsection were fulfilled, the burden of proving this shall be on that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is meant by &ldquo;such steps, inquiries <Col N="379" /> and inspections as ought reasonably to have been taken&rdquo; and so on?  If it should transpire that the consent of a wife was not really given you are making a judgment subsequently on a decision which at the time was perfectly natural and normal.  You get from the solicitor the <i>bona fide</i> title of the husband and that is an end of it.  You do not go a step further.  Why should you?  How can that discharge the onus which this Bill places on that young couple who are buying the house?  They must prove that &ldquo;all steps, inquiries and inspections&rdquo; as are reasonable to have been taken are taken.  What is meant by &ldquo;all steps, inquiries and inspections&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>If my wife and I are buying another house from a married couple, the only step I can reasonably take is to find out if the wife is joined with her husband in selling.  If it transpires subsequently that someone misinformed me, I would hope that I as the purchaser, being a married man with responsibilities to my wife and family, will not be penalised because I was not able to show <i>ex post facto</i> that I took all these steps.  I know what the Minister intends to do but the standards being applied in trying to ensure justice, which I know is the purpose of this Bill, are a little unrealistic.  The phraseology there goes much too far.  I do not know where it derives from.  I have a feeling it may be a precedent from some other source, but it does not make very much sense to me.</P>
    <P>There are other examples to which Deputy Andrews referred in relation to mortgages and so on with which we can deal on Committee Stage.  However, one has to be careful that in ensuring the protection of a wife or husband, as the case may be, within family unit A, you do not injure family unit B, which can happen under provisions of this nature.  The Minister will say&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;that this is unlikely, but in so far as this onus is being imposed here, it is an unreasonably heavy onus to place on the purchaser under those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make is <Col N="380" /> in relation to the definition of &ldquo;family home&rdquo;, and this again may be an indication of how our thinking is limited by the current fashion and pattern.  There is at the moment a great awareness of the rights of a married woman in many respects, maybe an awareness that was not there to the same extent ten years ago, but are the wife and child, and the husband for that matter, the only people concerned in the family as such?  Are there not grandparents living in family homes?  Do they not represent part of the family, and what security are we providing for them? I am not suggesting that the Minister has no concern for them, but because there is no single department concerned with this constantly researching and programming, what inevitably happens is that you react only to the current pressures&mdash;and these may be lawful and justifiable pressures&mdash;or the current pattern.</P>
    <P>There are many old people living in the home which, in fact, they have transferred to the son or daughter. I take it from the Minister that this Bill provides no protection for them? The Minister nods his assent.  I do not know whether the Minister considered that there should be protection for them and decide it would be too difficult to achieve, but I believe that such old people around the country, who actually own the house anyway, must be given protection in the family home in the same way as is guaranteed to the husband or wife and children. Is there any logical reason why the old cannot have the same protection? This Bill overlooks them and I cannot see why it should.  It may be what one might call a blameless oversight.  The point may have been considered by the Minister and rejected, but I doubt that.  This is only something that occurred to me as I was reading the Bill this morning in the House.  If we were thinking in a comprehensive way about this matter, then I suggest that the definition of &ldquo;family&rdquo; and &ldquo;family home&rdquo; would be much broader.  The same applies to the Family Law Act as it now is. Unless we are satisfied&mdash;and I do not believe we are&mdash;that the old do not <Col N="381" /> need protection in the family home, then they should be written in here in the same way as the spouse and dependent children.</P>
    <P>There is a very hallowed tradition and precedent for this.  The <i>familia</i> in the sense that it was known in Roman times did not start with the father and the immediate young children. It was a very broad concept going back as far as the grandfather and grandmother and maybe sometimes, if they lived long enough, the greatgrandfather. In Ireland the grandfather and grandmother are very much a part of the family scene and the family home.  In many cases they are very much involved in the family home where there are working parents. Surely they must be written into this legislation, or, if not, into some other legislation.</P>
    <P>I wonder why such old people are not included.  Is it because all the publicity and pressure, justifiable as it is, are for married women these days, so that we have forgotten things that are staring us in the face?  It is essential that these people should be allowed to stay at home and feel secure, where they give affection and trust both to their children and grandchildren, and where they can form, as many of us know from our own personal experience, a very real element in the family home.</P>
    <P>Related to that is the fact that the definition of &ldquo;dependent children&rdquo; excludes dependent grandchildren. Once again, looking around the scene in Ireland, we see many cases where husbands or wives, as the case may be, have left or are working elsewhere or have died and the children are living with their grandparents.  That situation is not at all exceptional in rural Ireland, and I think the comments I have been making in relation to the grandparents are equally important the other way.  Could the Minister say whether there is any protection in this Bill for grandchildren as distinct from children?  I do not think it is in the Bill.  They are not within the definition of dependent child.  If we are going to provide protection for the children, is there any reason why we should not extend protection <Col N="382" /> to the grandchildren in the case where the family home in which they are living can be sold over their heads against their interests?</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;dependent child&rdquo; and &ldquo;family&rdquo; in that case is equally narrow.  We will obviously have to extend the definition so as to take into account the needs of grandchildren and grandparents as well as parents and children.  It may be less frequent but I would not have to travel more than two or three hundred yards from my home to find a few cases where there are grandchildren being looked after by grandparents.  Surely some concern must be expressed for them in this provision.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;family home&rdquo; is also a narrow definition, that is, a dwelling in which a married couple ordinarily reside.  What would the position be where one or other of the parents may have died and there is only the widow or the widower as the case might be?  What restriction, if any, will there be in favour of the children to ensure that they are protected? The dependent child is protected under the consent which the wife must give.  In the event of the death of the wife an irresponsible man might sell the house over the heads of the children.  This has happened and it is not exceptional.  In what way can the interests of the children in the family home be protected in the way that they can be when the mother is still alive?  As I see it, this Bill, as at present drafted, provides no protection. I know from the spirit of it that the purpose of this Bill is to provide such protection, and I would suggest that the Minister should make amendments on Committee Stage to provide it. Otherwise we may give some thought to presenting some amendments from this side of the House which I hope will be acceptable.  I hope it is clear from what I have said that the Minister will have my full support and my party's full support in this measure. But in so far as there are gaps the Minister will have our constant awareness to remind him of the need to plug those gaps.  Is it intended to take this in a special committee or a committee of the whole House? <Col N="383" /> I agree that the proceedings under the Bill should be taken <i>in camera.</i> There will be many consequential proceedings of a type other than the actual vindication or claim by the wife against the husband who is alienating the family home.  Supposing proceedings arise which involve a purchaser saying that he took all necessary steps when he and his wife were buying the home from the other couple, is it envisaged that these proceedings will be <i>in camera?</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Bill stands at the moment, it seems as if those proceedings and all consequential proceedings in a sense, would also be covered by the provision&mdash;<i>in camera.</i> This is an area that will demand constant reform having regard to the developments of social habits and standards from time to time.  What was thought upon 50 years ago as being a major breakthrough in giving separate rights to property to married women is now looked upon as being absolutely antediluvian.  If we were to stop here and think that we had reached the end of the line, it would probably be looked upon in 50 years time as being antediluvian.  This highlights the importance of having a constant programme of review for the protection of the family and all associated with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy de Valera made clear and the Minister made clear in his introductory speech, this legislation is not concerned with the vast majority of cases.  Our hope is that it will never be concerned with the vast majority of cases.  It is there as a protection, where the responsibility that is due to a wife from her husband is not forthcoming.  I welcome it as an instrument of that protection.  It is important that in all our legislation we should stress the positive side of the family.  We must always strengthen it in every way by educational provisions, proper accommodation and in many other ways.  These positive steps would mean that the kind of thing we are trying to guard against <Col N="384" /> in this provision would not happen. It is vitally important that there should be a separate Department to deal with this area so that we can guarantee that the Minister in charge will be constantly aware of what the need is, will have adequate finance to meet that need and, above all, that the public will respond to thir responsibilities as parents.  Until such time as we have such a separate Department, certainly until such time as the department of the family is separated from the department of national security, we will not have a consistent pattern of development.</P>
    <P>Some questions have been asked about the constitutional implications of this.  That does not worry me too much.  As I think the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out this morning, there will always be a limitation on what one might call the fundamental personal right; one's social obligations will always involve that.  I concede that there may well be some constitutional hazards in this Bill.  At the same time I feel they are risks well worth taking and our side of the House have put their position on the record very clearly in supporting the Minister in what he is doing.</P>

Since the fourth session of the conference has only recently ended there has not yet been time to complete a detailed study of the revised single negotiating text but co-ordination meetings have already been arranged with a view to reaching agreement on a common position on as many issues as possible for the coming session in New York in August.</P>

      <P>I missed the last bit of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply.  I take it the Parliamentary Secretary will acknowledge that it is vitally important that these co-ordination meetings will take place in view of the fact that the position of the Community <i>vis-à-vis,</i> for instance, our territorial waters and fishery rights is obviously essential?  Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, in addition, whether he recognises that our special right as a maritime State&mdash;in conjunction with, say, that of France and Holland&mdash;could be presented at that conference, not merely in our national interest but also in the Community interest?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do accept that.  But of course the Deputy, in his turn, will accept that our fisheries problems and the problems of our fisheries waters are ones that must be settled mainly within the Nine and not so much as between the Nine and the rest of the world.</P>

I quite accept that it would and I am told that consensus has been virtually reached on a 200-mile limit as a <Col N="386" /> global norm for the world.  But, as the Deputy knows, our problem does not arise in the rest of the world; it arises only basically in the Nine.  Our problem is both in regard to the admission of foreign trawlers and policing.  Until we can achieve a regime with our EEC partners, we are only scratching the problem as far as others are concerned. It is true that a Rumanian was arrested yesterday but such happens once in a blue moon.</P>

      <P>At the end of the fourth session a revised single negotiating text was produced by the chairmen of the three main committees and this will form the basis for discussion at the next session of the conference in August.  Copies of this text will be made available in the Dáil Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> If the conference adopted the provisions relating to islands as they now appear in the revised single negotiating text Rockall could not claim an exclusive economic zone or Continental Shelf, and the Irish delegation will continue to support the inclusion of provisions of this nature in the convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Acknowledging that this is what we hope will be the outcome, I think the Parliamentary Secretary will have seen recently some expert in the area of international law suggesting that because we did not make a claim in the same fashion as did Britain to the island of Rockall, we may in fact have conceded. Has the Parliamentary Secretary seen that report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I saw that opinion. Basically he said that more than 20 years of apparent acquiescence in the British annexation of Rockall had left us with no claim of that kind. But that has not answered the question whether Rockall itself can or cannot generate a jurisdiction of its own.  The single negotiating text to which I referred specifically excludes uninhabitable rocks from the definition of islands which are capable of generating their own jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not recognise, at the same time&mdash;while that negotiating text is probably what we hope will be adopted&mdash;that, in the nature of things&mdash;having regard to some views of international lawyers&mdash;it would have been and might still be prudent on the part of the Government to protect our flanks by at least stating a formal claim in case that negotiating text is not adopted?</P>

      <P>If I suggest to the Minister that there has not been such a case will he acknowledge then that, as Deputy O'Malley has said, this is a matter which affects our Parliament?

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not wish to be drawn too far into this but I am in a difficulty.  The question as put down carries with it an implication which I think is incomplete.  I think, therefore, the basis on which Deputy O'Kennedy is putting his question may perhaps be something of a misapprehension.  In fact, Deputy Briscoe was received by the ambassador and handed in a petition on 22nd December, 1975.  It is my information that petitioners arriving during working hours at the embassy have not been refused admission but naturally outside working hours the position is somewhat different, as it would be indeed at any of our Government offices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I better clarify that.  The petition referred to here is not the one that Deputy Briscoe was presenting at the embassy.  Even if it were the same the position is that a Member of this Parliament has been declined a visa to enter a country with which we have diplomatic relations. The Minister, as our representative, does not see fit to express his disapproval or protest on our behalf.</P>

      <P>The grounds stated in the question for the visa being sought are grounds which do not correspond with the information at my disposal, in so far as Deputy Briscoe was received on 22nd December, 1975. I am informed, subject to correction by any Deputy in the House, that petitioners arriving during working hours at the embassy have, of course, been received.  Given that the grounds stated in the question for seeking a visa would appear on the information available to me to be incorrect the Deputy will appreciate that, even if protest were proper in regard to non-issue of a visa, it is scarcely a case in which I could undertake to do what the Deputy wishes me to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy refers to expenditure from State funds.  Including the salaries of officers in the embassy in London concerned in matters involving the welfare of the Irish in Britain and adding expenditure on the repatriation scheme, grants to emigrant bureaux, the resettlement scheme, and welfare payments by the Department of Social Welfare, the total annual cost of these items to the Exchequer is at present approximately £1,936,000.  The Government are at present having examined the question of extra assistance towards the employment of social workers in Britain, but I am not in a position to anticipate what the Government decision will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate there can be some difficulties in this field.  Will the Minister consider applying more money to the welfare of young people, apart from ordinary residents, who go away without proper guidance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing schemes are available to people who apply and who come within them.  They include a repatriation scheme, grants to emigrant bureaux, a resettlement scheme in the Department of Labour for people returning here, social welfare payments and, of course, the emoluments of officers in the London Embassy concerned in this work.  The benefits of these various forms of expenditure are available, as appropriate, to young people.  Obviously, social welfare payments, which are a very major aspect, go to the people who are legally entitled to them and they cannot be diverted in favour of a particular group, young or old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. MacDonald Mr. MacDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Government give consideration perhaps to allocating some placement or welfare officers to work in close collaboration with the voluntary committees who run the Irish centres at Camden Town, and the other three or four major centres in Britain, who do a tremendous amount of work on a voluntary basis?  Would it be possible for the Government to assign officers to take on some of that burden?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>At present the question is being studied as to whether assistance of this kind is required and could appropriately be given or whether it should be given in the form of the allocation of social welfare officers or alternatively in the form of financial assistance to help the organisations concerned to employ social welfare officers.  There is no Government commitment in the matter.  The desirability of any further action in the matter is at present under consideration and I cannot anticipate that decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the matters discussed at the recent meeting of EEC Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg; and the agreement, if any, recorded on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission, of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> The recent meeting of EEC Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg was the latest in a series of such informal meetings the first of which was held during the German Presidency at Schloss Gymnich in April, 1974.</P>
    <P>The matters discussed were the Tindemans Report on European Union and the arrangements for direct elections to the European Parliament. In their discussion on the arrangements for direct elections, the Ministers concentrated on the major outstanding issue of the number and distribution of seats in the directly elected Parliament.  The Parliament's own proposal in relation to this matter and certain other proposals put forward by the member states were taken into account.</P>
    <P>It was not possible to find a political solution to the problem which would have proved acceptable to all the member states.  Nevertheless, I believe sufficient progress was made to give grounds for hope that agreement can be found in the near future when Ministers have had time for further reflection and an opportunity for consultation in their respective capitals so that direct elections can take place as intended in 1978.</P>
    <P>There was a general discussion on the Tindemans Report followed by a discussion on the procedure which might be followed for its further consideration. Because of the character of the meeting, no formal decisions were taken.  Discussion will continue in the more usual frameworks, that is, at the meetings of Ministers in the Foreign Affairs Council and in Political Co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that he believes sufficient progress was made to give us grounds for hope.  Could he give any indication what that progress was?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was evident in the discussions that all Ministers were very anxious for a settlement and were anxious not to take up rigid positions.  They were willing not to exclude a number of possible solutions pending further consideration.  The general atmosphere of the meeting was confident.  That offers no assurance of <Col N="398" /> success, I have to make clear to the Deputy, but the situation was much more positive than any previous discussion on this matter at any level. While I would not necessarily anticipate that a decision will be reached at the next Council meeting on Monday or Tuesday, it is possible that a favourable decision on the distribution of seats, clearing the way for direct elections could be reached later in June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that the Minister's optimism derives from the change of mood as distinct from any agreement or specific proposals, even on a preliminary basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is quite clear that there was no agreement on any particular proposal.  Each proposal considered in all its variations met with some continuing objection from one or other country and therefore there was no agreement.  On the other hand, some countries did ease or drop objections they had to certain proposals.  The difference was, therefore, narrowed and it was clear that each member state was anxious not to exclude the possibility of agreement on some compromise within the framework of the different possible solutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister convey on our behalf to the next meeting our concern that if some positive progress is not made, all the woolly hope and expectation will not be sufficient to ensure that this Community will realise its own aims?  If some positive agreement is not reached, it would be better and honest to say so rather than have the continuous position of hope and unrealised expectation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly convey the general sense of the Deputy's views on that subject.  There is a general realisation of this and the psychological consequences of public opinion of the failure to reach concrete agreement on this and other issues at the last European Council meeting have had a perceptible effect on the attitudes of all member countries.  There is a general realisation that failure to <Col N="399" /> achieve a conclusion on this in the near future will have a very adverse effect on the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a question in two parts?  First, what particular proposal is the Minister advocating as regards the allocation of seats, and second, is 1978 still a realisable target or what emerged from the meeting in that connection?  When is it hoped that the first direct elections might take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the proposal I put forward some time ago, and which is under consideration, Ireland will have 18 seats in a parliament of 384 members.  This is close to the present percentage share in the existing parliament.  The other proposals range very widely and some of them would give Ireland very few seats.  There is an obvious difficulty in reconciling the different positions but we hope a solution can be found which will offer this country more seats than the 13 contained in the Patijon Report which I regarded as inadequate.  In so regarding it, I think I reflected the views of this House and I took account in this matter of the views of the Committee on Secondary Legislation.</P>
      <P>On the question of the realisability of direct elections within a time scale, the general view of all member states is that if agreement can be reached in June, it will be possible within the space of just under two years to organise direct elections which will take place in May or June, 1978, the most probable date being towards the end of May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In our own jurisdiction have we cleared our minds about our procedures if direct elections are a possibility by 1978?  Can the Minister tell us about any internal procedures or arrangements we are making in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Some preparatory work has been done in the relevant section of the Department of Local Government.  The matter has not come before the Government because, <Col N="400" /> until we know the number of seats, it has not seemed worth while to get involved in the details of systems. The Deputy will be better aware than most that there are divergent views on this.  One is that there should be a list system for the whole country. Another is that if the number of seats is large enough to make this feasible, we should maintain the existing kind of proportional representation system in constituencies of three to five seats.  The question of which of these might be better is one which I strongly feel can best be considered when we have a decision on the number of seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will bring diplomatic pressure to bear on the South African government to ensure proper administration of justice in the disputed territory of Namibia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland takes the view that <Col N="401" /> South Africa's presence in Namibia is illegal and that it should withdraw from the territory without delay. Ireland supported the termination in 1966 by the General Assembly of South Africa's mandate over Namibia, welcomed the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in 1971 which affirmed South Africa's obligation to withdraw its administration from Namibia, and has indicated support for resolutions of the Security Council and General Assembly to this end.  In 1975 Ireland voted in favour of a resolution in which the General Assembly, <i>inter alia,</i> strongly deplored South Africa's continued illegal occupation of Namibia, its brutal repression of the Namibian people and its persistent violation of their human rights.</P>
      <P>In January of this year, Ireland joined with its partners in the European Community in a <i>demarche</i> to the South African Government urging it to withdraw from Namibia as soon as possible, so that the people of Namibia should be able to exercise their right to self-determination and independence at an early date.</P>
      <P>While South Africa remains in Namibia, it applies to that territory its policies of apartheid and certain repressive laws and legal procedures. I have previously made known my opposition to these laws and the way in which they are applied in South Africa itself and in Namibia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may have in mind the recent sentence of death imposed on two Namibians after a trial under the Terrorism Act.  As the Deputy will appreciate, in the absence of direct diplomatic links between Ireland and South Africa, I have some doubts as to whether direct representations on these matters by Ireland would be very effective.  I would add, however, that on 16th May the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Luexembourg Mr. Thorn, on behalf of his colleagues in the European Community, and with their agreement, sent a message to the Prime Minister of South Africa expressing concern about this trial and appealing for clemency on humanitarian grounds.  I strongly support this <Col N="402" /> appeal with which Ireland was associated as a member of the Nine.</P>
    <P>I would further express the hope that South Africa will refrain from any actions in the administration of justice which could further prejudice the satisfactory resolution of the problem posed by its presence in Namibia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am gratified my question has enabled the Minister to give such a detailed statement on the position which has the full support of this side of the House.  I understood that the anti-apartheid movement here sought a meeting with the Minister&mdash;I do not know if it took place&mdash;requesting that the Minister would do exactly what I am asking now.  I want to make it clear that I put down the question in my own right without any consultations with them.  Has the Minister met the anti-apartheid movement to discuss the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear that.  I am sure the Minister is aware that a distinguished lawyer from Ireland attended at some of these trials and that he has reported back to the anti-apartheid movement.  I think this information would be helpful and useful to the Minister in bringing further diplomatic pressure to bear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The applications referred to have not been attended to earlier because mainly of delays in extending the exchange building to take extra equipment and in installing the equipment.

      <P>I regret that the information requested by the Deputy is not available.  However, my Department's records show that on 21st May, 1976, approximately £700,000 was held in respect of money paid in advance by applicants for telephone service covering connection charges, advance rentals and deposits, but this figure includes amounts paid by applicants who had been provided with service during the previous few months and for whom accounting records had not yet been set up.</P>

      <P>I should explain the procedure that applies which gives part of the answer to the Deputy's question.  When the Department expect to be able to provide a telephone service within three months the applicant is required to sign an agreement and to pay the appropriate connection charge and an amount in respect of rental covering the initial period of the agreement.  A deposit in respect of call charges is also payable in certain cases.  The telephone number is subsequently allotted and instructions are issued by means of an advice note to the engineering branch to provide the service.  When the installation is completed, a copy of the advice note is forwarded to the accountant's branch for preparation of the necessary accounting records. The payment made by the applicant is then transferred from the advance payments file to the subscriber's file and an initial account is issued to the subscriber.  Depending on the particular date and the quarter when the installation is completed, a period of up to five months may elapse between the date service is provided and the date the money is transferred from the advance payments file to the subscriber's accounting records.  The answer would be three months in most cases, but sometimes up to five months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not so much a question of proposals or surveys as of measures which have been taken to combat vandalism.  New specially designed reinforced coin boxes have been installed, 202 in the Dublin area and 16 in the provinces. Of course, Dublin is the main problem area here.  Of the total of 3,500 cases of vandalisation, 3,000 are Dublin cases.  Such coin boxes are proving very useful in combating vandalism. Some further boxes of this type are being installed.  Steel plates to which the coin box can be bolted have now been fitted in about 770 kiosks with the object of preventing removal of <Col N="408" /> the coin boxes.  Continuous fluorescent lighting has been installed in more than 2,100 kiosks and an alarm system has been fitted in 99 kiosks which alerts the local manual exchanges&mdash; this is in the provinces&mdash;by lighting a special lamp if the coin box is being interfered with.  The number of cases of extensive physical damage to kiosks has diminished as a result of the introduction of strengthened coin boxes. Of this rather alarming total of 3,500 some have not been very extensively damaged and the phones were out of service only for a short period.</P>

      <P>On 9th October, 1972, the Dublin Port and Docks Board applied for a harbour works order to authorise them to construct embankments to reclaim about 200 acres south of the South Wall and to the east and south of the Poolbeg generating station to provide a site for a proposed oil refinery and tank farm. The House was informed on 26th October, 1972, in reply to Dáil questions, that no action on the making of a harbour works order would be taken until after a decision had been taken on the relevant planning application. The Dublin Port and Docks Board were similarly advised on 30th October, 1972.  On 11th September, 1974, the board amended their application for a harbour works order to permit reclamation of 157 acres to be used exclusively for oil storage purposes&mdash;no part of the proposed refinery itself would be located within this area.  The area of 157 acres is part of the area of 200 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board applied in 1975 for a harbour works order to carry out port development works on the south side of the River Liffey, consisting of the <Col N="410" /> construction of one quay, a number of embankments and the reclamation of two areas of 13.2 hectares and 2.9 hectares respectively.  These applications have been left in abeyance by agreement with the board.</P>
    <P>The board also applied in 1975 for a harbour works order to authorise them to carry out port development works on the north side of the River Liffey.  On 8th March, 1976, the board amended this application and the works to be covered by the order consist essentially of the construction of one quay, a number of embankments and the reclamation of two areas of approximately 6.27 hectares and 2.24 hectares, respectively.  This application is being processed.</P>
    <P>On 5th April, 1976, the board applied for a harbour works order for the construction of a slipway, embankments and reclamation of approximately 0.9 hectares at the North Bull Wall.  This application has been deferred by the board.</P>

      <P>There is no truth in the rumour to which the Deputy has listened about the indefinite deferment or stopping of plans in this case&mdash;that is not on.  I do not see what significance or relevance the fact that the American carrier coming into Dublin has in regard to the question.  I have told the Deputy that the land is being purchased under CPO and by agreement, where it can be purchased by agreement.  It is hoped that purchase of the total of 700 acres required for this plan will be completed some time <Col N="415" /> this year, perhaps early this year. When we can see that the growth in air traffic will be resumed to the level anticipated for the use of that runway, its construction will go ahead.</P>

Then it was postponed until 1978-79 and it looks now as if it will be 1980 or 1981 before the runway is being used.</P>

      <P>The report is an advisory document intended for the information and guidance of Government departments and airport and local planning authorities concerned with the expansion of Dublin Airport and its implications for land use strategies. The report has been made available to the interested parties.  It is for the planning authorities to take account of the findings of the report in dealing with the future development of the area in the neighbourhood of the airport.  The report has been put on sale to the public and parties contemplating the provision of buildings, including dwellings, in the area would be well advised to study its contents.</P>

      <P>Yes, if you are concerned with studying noise from aircraft but there are other factors besides noise which dictate to people where they should build in the area. There are such considerations as roads and such facilities as water and electricity and all these will have to be taken into account so that the overall planning strategy of, I suppose Dublin County Council, can be evolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <P>No, I do not because while the Surrey and Wilson Committee report are referred to in the Loughborough report that the Deputy has there, these are only used as a basis and an example of what can be done.  Obviously, you cannot say that the same conditions obtain outside Dublin Airport.  They got from my Department the types of aircraft it is thought would be used in these areas, the levels at which they would operate and the technical level of noise and they said that if these things were so at that time, and given the existence of the new runways and the flight paths used by those aircraft, you would then get this level of noise.  I think the contours are shown on the map the Deputy has.  It is not intended to dictate to Dublin County Council how they should develop their land strategy in North County Dublin but it is intended to be of help to them to show the effect the use of the airport would have on residents occupying that area at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Double Taxation Relief (Sea or Air Transport) (Spain) Order, 1975,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid on the table of Dáil Éireann on the 18th day of November, 1975.</P>
      <P>Copies of the draft order relating to the agreement with Spain for the avoidance of double taxation on income derived from the business of sea or air transport were laid before Dáil Éireann on 18th November, 1975.</P>
      <P>The agreement has been signed on behalf of the respective Governments. Subsequent to the signing of the agreement the White Paper setting out the terms of the agreement was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country the law provides that an arrangment entered into with a foreign Government to afford relief from double taxation on sea or air <Col N="421" /> transport income shall have the force of law here if the Irish Government makes an order accordingly.  Prior to the making of such an order, however, a draft of the order must be laid before Dáil Éireann and a resolution passed approving it.</P>
    <P>Deputies will find the text of the agreement scheduled to the draft order now before the House.  For the convenience of Deputies, a separate memorandum has also been circulated with the draft order explaining the effect of the articles in the agreement.</P>
    <P>The main object of this agreement is to exempt from the taxes on income of either country any profits arising to a resident of the other country from the business of sea or air transport. The agreement follows the general pattern of reciprocal arrangements of this type previously concluded with Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Norway, South Africa, Sweden and Switzerland. The effects of all of these agreements, with the exception of that concluded with South Africa, have been suspended as full double taxation conventions are in force with them.</P>
    <P>The agreement provides for the exemption from Spanish tax of all income derived by Irish enterprises from the business of sea or air transport between Spain and other countries. It also provides for the reciprocal exemption from all taxes chargeable in Ireland of all income derived by Spanish enterprises from the business of sea or air transport between Ireland and other countries.</P>
    <P>Under the agreement both countries give up the right to tax any interest or dividends payable out of the income of an enterprise of the other country from the operation of the business of sea or air transport unless the recipient is resident in the first country for that country's tax purposes.  On the same basis the agreement secures that personal earnings of members of a board of administration of an enterprise of either of the States shall not be taxable in the other State unless the recipient is resident for tax purposes in that other State.</P>
    <P>The agreement will come into force <Col N="422" /> upon the exchange of instruments of ratification.  It will then be effective in both countries in respect of income or profits derived on or after 1st January, 1969.</P>
    <P>The agreement is to continue in force indefinitely but may be terminated at any time by either contracting party on giving six months' notice to the other contracting party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no difficulty on this side of the House in agreeing to this motion.  There are just one or two questions I should like to ask. The first relates to Articles 1 and 2 which refer to income being exempt from income tax and other taxes on incomes or profits which are or may be chargeable in Ireland in one case and Spain in the other.  I presume that includes exemptions from corporation tax and capital gains tax.  I should like that confirmed.  I should also like to know whether any other tax is involved besides income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  The second question relates to the fact that, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, where we have had agreements of the same kind with other countries their operation has been suspended when a comprehensive double taxation agreement has been entered into.  What plans are there, if any, for the conclusion of a comprehensive double taxation agreement with Spain and how long may we expect this double taxation agreement to be confined to the rather limited area dealt with in this particular motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The second point raised by the Deputy is best answered by saying that the demand for this particular agreement arises essentially from the two air carriers involved in traffic between Ireland and Spain, Aer Lingus and Iberia.  They are the only <Col N="423" /> concerns which have expressed a wish for an agreement of this kind. Although the trade between the two countries has been increasing in the last seven or eight years even quite steeply, there has been no demand from any other individuals or concerns, so far as we know, which would justify the conclusion of a comprehensive agreement of the kind that the Deputy refers to.  There is a small amount of other traffic on the invisible side, I suppose, between Ireland and Spain, in particular, Irish holiday makers there and Irish people who go there to live for part or the whole of the year on retirement.  Apparently this situation does not cause difficulty, and neither this Department nor the Department of Foreign Affairs has encountered any demand for comprehensive double taxation agreements or any dissatisfaction with the pre-existing situation except from Aer Lingus and Iberia.  It is in response to the representations from these two air carriers that this agreement was made and that this motion is now before the House.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The family as a unit is the basis of our society, and any legislation to protect the family must be welcomed and supported. Therefore, I welcome this Bill as introduced by the Minister and compliment him on introducing yet another measure which is designed not only to afford greater protection, security and shelter, to one or other of the spouses but also, perhaps, to conserve happiness and ensure that the family home will always be looked upon even as a refuge, especially for the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes we in this country adopt the attitude that some of these problems do not exist.  I think the Minister is right in extending the number of reforms he has brought in to protect the family and to protect the status of <Col N="424" /> the individual, and he is to be congratulated on the tremendous efforts he has made in his field.</P>
    <P>One of the great difficulties about Irish life is that everybody is very much concerned about what the neighbours think.  If there is a row in an Irish family home it is more likely to have a regime of silence rather than the continental form where the participants screech and shout and toss things at each other, and they do not particularly mind whether the neighbours or the people on the street enjoy the spectacle. Consequently, it is sometimes very difficult in this country for anyone who is empowered by law to intervene to see that there is difficulty.  I was interested in the remark by Deputy de Valera this morning that there was a danger that some sections of this Bill might encourage people to cohabit.  I am inclined to agree with the views expressed by Deputy Kelly that people who get married do not think of the gloomier days that may very well crop up. Therefore, I think the amount of protection the Minister is affording in this Bill is adequate.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that so many unions seem to fall on rough times, but it is still more unfortunate if, as happens, human nature being what it is, people get very much entrenched in their attitudes and in their hatred, perhaps; it is not a nice term, but it applies in many cases.  I see this measure as ensuring that a spouse who may be careless about his or her responsibilities towards the other spouse and towards the family will be constrained by the provisions of this Bill.  This Bill also affords a considerable amount of protection for the wife and, in some cases, for the husband, where a husband marries into property or a homestead, and also protection for the children.</P>
    <P>This Bill is necessary in a changing society.  We cannot bury our heads in the sand and think that the 'seventies will not touch the mode of life in our country.  It is sad to hear of family rows and cases even where wedding presents are disposed of and not given to the partner to whom they were originally presented.  The Bill should ensure that people will take a more thoughtful <Col N="425" /> and more positive view of the situation and will not be able to treat family squabbles as lightly as some people have treated them in the past.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome section 11 of the Bill which gives a spouse the right to register with the Land Registry the fact that he or she is a spouse of the registered owner.  That provision will give added protection.  I would like also to refer to section 10 (6) which provides:</P>
    <P>Proceedings under this Act shall be conducted in a summary manner and shall be heard otherwise than in public.</P>
    <P>Then subsection 7 reads:</P>
    <P>(7) Proceedings in the High Court and the Circuit Court under this Act shall be heard in chambers.</P>
    <P>I am not a legal luminary, and I suppose that is just legal terminology, and that the two subsections mean the same thing on different levels.</P>
    <P>Although this Bill is quite small, it has aroused considerable interest throughout the country.  It gives tremendous security to a lot of people whose spouses when perhaps a little inebriated lay down the law on who owns what.  It gives the other spouse that modicum of security.  We would all like to think that Christian ethics and standards will always prevail but sometimes they are overlooked and this Bill will ensure that in such cases justice will be done by the family, and that as far as the State is concerned the minimum amount of hardship will be imposed on the husband, the wife or the children.</P>

    <P>This Bill is intended to end the abuse of vindictive sales by husbands over the heads of their wives and dependent children.  The principle of <Col N="426" /> the Bill was welcomed generally. Some Deputies felt that the method adopted by the Bill for ending this abuse was somehow inferior to procedure whereby joint ownership would become compulsory.  I am in favour of voluntary joint ownership.  There is a section in the Bill whereby the State waives its rights to take stamp duty on transfers into joint ownership between spouses, and also waives land registry fees in the case of the land registry dealing with such transfers. That is a clear indication of my attitude towards the concept of joint ownership.  I think it is ideal, but only when it is voluntary.  I am not in favour of compulsory joint ownership.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan and Deputy Mrs. Desmond both advocated joint ownership as being a preferential mechanism for securing what the Bill wants to secure.  In another jurisdiction where they had the means for investigating these law reform measures in some detail, it took many years to investigate this question of compulsory joint ownership and the question still is to some extent an open one and the problems that were found in that jurisdiction are equally present here. There could also be a constitutional difficulty in relation to compulsory joint ownership.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews raised the constitutional issue in regard to what is proposed in the Bill by asking if it would represent an invasion of the right to private property given by the Constitution.  I have no doubt that it does not.  The right to private property is very much qualified by references to the common good.  It is not an absolute right, it is a qualified right.  I was supported in this view by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy John Kelly, whose expertise in that area is well known.  If we must look further than Article 43, which deals with private property, we will find, in the Articles dealing with the family, even more arguments to support my contention that the Bill is constitutional.  That is not to say that a constitutional question might not arise if compulsory joint ownership were proposed, because this would be a very serious interference with the <Col N="427" /> right to private property.  It would be an interference under the guise of the common good and benefit of the family.  It would be a blanket interference, whereas, under the Bill, if there is an interference with a husband's right to alienate his property, that right can only be exercised where there is a family situation that merits this interference, and in each individual case the common good or the greater good of others can be specifically pointed to.  Compulsory joint ownership would give rise to a number of technical difficulties.  One of its consequences in the event of a dispute is that it involves the tedious, expensive and quite difficult necessity of a partition suit.  This would involve the parties in a very difficult legal area.  That is obviated in the present situation.  No case has been made at this stage that would convince me that compulsory joint ownership is preferable to what is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I understand that the number of dealings in the land registry in respect of new houses shows a very high proportion as being in joint ownership. This is a desirable and a good thing. At the moment we should only go so far as to encourage voluntary joint ownership.  It has been suggested that joint ownership would solve the problem of the wife who is left with the responsibility for mortgage payments and would preserve her security of tenure.  This is a misunderstanding of the position because even if she were a joint owner she would not be likely to be in a stronger position to remain in possession than she is under this Bill because the strength of her position depends on her ability to procure funds to meet the liability under the mortgage.  It is not an answer to say that that problem would not arise if there were compulsory joint ownership. It could just as easily arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews raised the question of whether the provisions of the Bill would in some way inhibit lenders of mortgage money.  I do not think so, because one thing that a mortgagee does not want to do is to have to realise his security and to have what is commonly known as a sheriff's sale. <Col N="428" /> He wants to get back his money with the appropriate interest and he would much rather get it back over a longer period by instalments than be forced into a situation of having to sell the security.  The Bill enables a married woman whose husband has defaulted on mortgage payments or rent to stand in his place and to take over responsibility for the mortgage repayments or the rent.  If she is not in a position to do that a system of compulsory joint ownership will not help her.  At this stage it would not be proper to introduce into any legislation any measure which would prevent a mortgagee or a landlord from realising his property.  If there were such a measure in our law there would be no incentive, but there would instead be a positive disincentive against lending money to married couples.  That of course, would be socially disastrous.  To suggest that joint ownership would resolve that sort of problem is fallacious, as even a superficial examination must reveal.</P>
    <P>It was suggested also that the Bill was defective in that it did not deal with the position of parties where the family home might be the subject of a compulsory purchase order or proceedings by the Land Commission, that there was no protection for the wife in that case.  To raise that objection shows a misunderstanding of the fundamental nature of the Bill.  As I said at the outset, this Bill is to prevent a husband selling the family home.  The positive action of selling comes from the husband whereas, in the case of compulsory purchase proceedings, or Land Commission proceedings, it is not the husband who is the initiator of proceedings; it is society via the local authority, the Government agency or the Land Commission.  Certainly, as far as the Land Commission is concerned&mdash;if the family are in residence&mdash;I cannot ever see it happening.  In the case of compulsory purchase orders it can arise if the property is needed for whatever scheme the local authority have in mind.  It has arisen and will arise in the future.  This Bill is not designed to inhibit local authorities in <Col N="429" /> the discharge of their duties nor does it in any way leave parties more vulnerable to that sort of procedure than they are already.  One may put it this way: the question of compulsory purchase orders is irrelevant to this measure.  If the House felt that a compulsory purchase order should never be made against family homes, then, in that situation, it could be considered but that would be a very drastic thing indeed to suggest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews felt that sections 6, 7 and 8 of the Bill would circumvent the rights of a mortgagee and a lessor. I do not think that anything of the like will happen.  The Deputy felt specifically that under section 8 (2) mortgagees would not be entitled to call in the entire mortgage debt and that their rights would be clogged.  As I have pointed out, the essence of a mortgage arrangement is to provide for repayment.  That section gives the wife a legal entitlement <i>vis-à-vis</i> the mortgagee to take over those payments. It does not in any other way inhibit or diminish the rights of the mortgagee. We were very careful not to do that because, if we did so, we would then make lending to married couples an extremely risky business, so risky that lending agencies would be forced to give it up.  We are putting the wife into the legal position of being able to say to the lending agency: &ldquo;I want to pay you the arrears; these are my proposals, and these are my proposals to continue paying the current sums due&rdquo;.  If those proposals are reasonable, they have to be accepted by the mortgagee.  The wife is then on the same footing <i>vis-à-vis</i> the mortas the defaulting husband.  The mortgagee then is not prejudiced by this. He is getting his loan back, albeit some of it in arrear, but he is getting it back. That is always preferable to a mortgagee than having to go and realise his security.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews referred to the rights of a woman in the marital home, and appeared, I think, to suggest, in the context of section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, that that provision was to the effect that marriage, as such, confers on the wife a right of property in the home.  Whilst <Col N="430" /> the section does not provide this, the entitlement of a wife to a beneficial interest in the home under that section has been extended by judicial decision. This is a matter in which there is some doubt as to the exact borders of this extension.  It is something that may require legislation to tidy it up or possibly we may await further clarification judicially.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies mentioned the necessity for legal aid and some Deputies stated that the rights given under the Bills are not really valuable in the absence of legal aid.  I agree that the presence or availability of legal aid would be in ease of many persons, not just under this legislation but throughout our whole legal code.  At the same time it is not a good argument to say that a good principle, as this Bill proposes, is somehow lessened because the mechanics for enforcing it are not as perfect as we would like them to be.  We have to provide the legislative reform.  That is the first thing.  Then, hopefully, we will be able to provide these additional benefits subsequently.  In any event, the burden or the onus for taking legal proceedings under this Bill will not rest on the wife.  They will rest on the husband because all that the wife has to do in the case of a proposed, vindictive, sale is to refuse her consent.  Her husband then accepts her refusal or, if he does not, he goes to court&mdash;he is the person who has to go to court&mdash; and asks the court to hold that the refusal is unreasonable.  Therefore, the onus is on him; he is the moving party in the court.</P>
    <P>Of course, the wife will have to appear to make her case in the court and she will have to have legal assistance to do that.  It is not provided for in the Bill but I would anticipate that the costs would be awarded against the party who was the stronger financially and probably that, in practice, will turn out to be the husband.  It will not be a question of costs following the event because what is the event?  Possibly if a wife unreasonably and vindictively withheld her consent, she might find herself punished by costs.  I would say: &ldquo;fair enough&rdquo; in that situation.  But, if her <Col N="431" /> opposition to the sale was reasonable and so appeared to the court, then the court in finding equity between the parties, would not punish her in costs. Therefore, I do not think the lack of legal aid will be an inhibiting factor in the operation of this Bill.  The onus is being placed on husbands, not on wives, to move.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value who have taken reasonable steps to investigate the title and made all reasonable inquiries.  Does the Bill place an undue burden on purchasers? Just recall what is in the Bill.  It provides that for a sale of a family home to be valid the conveyance must be endorsed with the wife's consent. Where the vendor is a single man, or appears to be a single man, the question then arises: what is the position of a purchaser in that case?  There are two courses open.  One could say that the concealment of a wife and her subsequent arrival on the scene could vitiate the sale, but I think that would be an intolerable position.  No conveyance or transaction in regard to property would ever be final if that possibility were lurking in the background all the time.  The procedure adopted in the Bill is to put an onus on the purchaser, who must be a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value.  In other words, there must be no element of collusion on the part of the purchaser.  He must be <i>bona fide</i> and have given full value.  He must have made all reasonable inquiries. The phraseology in the Bill refers to the obligation to make reasonable inquiries as does the Conveyancing Act, 1882.  Deputy O'Kennedy asked precisely what it meant.  It has a clear meaning in the realm of conveyancing. It means that reasonable steps, in the circumstances of a particular title, have to be taken by a purchaser.  That normally means that he puts the usual requisitions or questions to the vendor and may seek a statutory declaration to support the replies to the requisitions. He has to make reasonable inquiries to satisfy himself that there was no need for a consent.  If one did not have that, a vendor would be <Col N="432" /> placed in the impossible position of having to prove that he was not married. Therefore, I do not think this obligation will be a burden on the title.  It is only another incident of title that will have to be investigated on the conveyance and it will not be a harsh or onerous burden.</P>
    <P>The alternative was to allow a defeated wife to appear at any stage and defeat the contract or conveyance. At first sight, that might seem a desirable thing to do but it would have the effect of ensuring that no conveyance was ever final, or free from attack in the future.  It is in that context that the protection for the <i>bona fide</i> purchaser has been introduced.</P>
    <P>However, the debate did raise in my mind as something I shall have to consider between now and Committee Stage the position regarding subsequent purchasers.  I will not go into that at this stage.  It does raise technical, conveyancing problems that, in the event of, say, the original purchaser taking a conveyance from an apparently single man who turns out to be a married man and where it is subsequently shown that his investigation was not of the standard required by the Act but, in the meantime, he has sold to a second purchaser, what is the position then of the second purchaser <i>vis-à-vis</i> the wife who may appear at a later stage?  It is something we shall have to consider before Committee Stage.  It is a technical point of conveyancing.</P>

      <P>I could not quite follow the point raised by Deputy Andrews that the Bill was conferring jurisdiction on the Circuit Court and that this is somehow inappropriate. The Circuit Court is a court of full jurisdiction in this area.  It is fully geared to handle any business given to it by the Bill.  It is only right that the Circuit Court would have that jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to the question of the costs of voluntary transfers into joint ownership in the context of the section that encourages such transfers by abolishing stamp duty and waiving land registry and court fees.  He then said that the solicitor's costs would still be an inhibiting factor.  I take the point that they will not make it any more attractive but the level of costs for such transactions is considerably less than the level of costs obtaining in sales for full value. In the case of a transfer from one spouse to another there is no investigation of title.  It is a simple procedure. <Col N="435" /> I do not anticipate that legal fees will be an inhibiting factor there. The biggest factor was the stamp duty, which was chargeable at one per cent on the full market value of the property being transferred.  This, having regard to the present day value of houses, could be a substantial sum. I know in many instances it inhibited people from transferring the family home into joint ownership.  Let me repeat that this is something I am in favour of on a voluntary basis but not on a compulsory basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke raised the question of a man whose marriage is annulled by a particular religious tribunal and asked if he would require his wife's consent in the event of subsequent sale of the family home.  The answer is that he would because in the eyes of the civil law that man is still married and his wife's consent would be required.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to how long an interval we had to wait for at least a beginning to be made to deal with some of the anomalies in this whole area.  I do not want to start that debate over again because of Deputy Andrews' sensitivity. Deputy Burke and other Deputies raised the question of the definition of family home and asked what the position would be in regard to residential business premises.  One cannot define a family home so as specifically to take account of the premises which is used &ldquo;half and half&rdquo;.  If it is so structurally laid out that the residence can be sold separately, then there is no problem identifying the family home. On the other hand, if it is an integral part of the business premises, in my opinion, it would not be possible to sell the business premises without the wife's consent because the business premises would automatically bring with it the family home.  It will depend on the layout of the premises in the particular case.  If the consent were to be refused it would have to be threshed out before a court.  The court would then have to decide whether or not the sale would be reasonable.  One could have the situation of a 100-bedroom hotel in which <Col N="436" /> there was a family flat.  If there were very strong reasons why that hotel should be sold would it be right that the wife, in order to preserve her right of residence in the flat in this very valuable property, should be able to prevent the sale?  This is something that the court will have to rule on. In the case of premises that would be mixed in their use the court would have to decide in the circumstances of the particular case whether or not the consent should be waived.</P>

It is only after hearing all these facts that a court can decide.  It would be impossible for me to anticipate what a court would decide without a complete statement of the relevant facts, such as I have indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Desmond spoke about the case of wives married to brutal husbands whose brutality forced them <Col N="437" /> to leave their family homes.  She said they had just cause for leaving and she referred to the need for shelter for them.  She possibly is overlooking the fact that under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act there is provision in section 22 of the Act for the Court to exclude the violent husband from the home and so obviate the need for the wife to leave.  That problem should not be as great in the future as it has been up to now.  It is important that the rights under this Bill, when it becomes law and under the other Act, should become as widely known as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins raised the question of having family guidance centres where advice might be given.  In many parts of the country there are now community service councils which provide this service and are making known to people their rights under the social welfare code and the whole area of family law in general.  It would be important in the case of the battered wife that women who have been subjected to such treatment, or who are in danger of it in the future, should be aware that they can now go to the Court in a very simple way and have those violent husbands excluded from the family home, and so avoid the scandal of such wives and their children being put out into the streets.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera was apprehensive that the Bill in seeking to deal with what is commonly acknowledged in this House as a very small number of cases in the totality of marriages in the country, was unavoidably affecting all marriages and this could have some adverse effects.  He gave the instance of a husband who was transferred in his job from one part of the city to another and wanted to move house for economic considerations. The wife was anxious to stay where she was for social reasons, her children were at school and she had established a circle of friends.  Those reasons might not be as compelling as the economic indicators and possibly social indicators for moving to the area of the new job.  The Deputy pointed out that under the Bill as it now stands the wife could refuse her <Col N="438" /> consent, could force the parties into court and he considered this would not be a good thing.  I concede that this is a consequence that could arise, but if it did arise, it would not be an ideal marriage because these problems arise in every marriage from time to time and have to be settled by the parties out of their mutual love, tolerance and common sense.  The alternative to doing it was to allow a continuation of male dominance which is the present position in this regard and allow the husband to have his way.</P>
    <P>It is an unavoidable consequence that from now on the consent of the wife will be required in all cases of the sale of the family home.  In the vast majority of cases this will present no difficulty whatever.  In a number of cases it may be a matter for debate, discussion or even argument within the family.  In a smaller number of cases it may end up in court.  The abuse and the scandal that this Bill is designed to end is so harmful and hurtful to the parties concerned, even in a small number of cases, that the Legislature had to step in to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera criticised my introductory speech where I indicated the sources to which we had recourse when studying the proposals at the early stage of formulating legislation. I referred there to textbooks and reports in this field.  He said we should not seek a solution in the light of commission reports and reading textbooks and so on.  He said we should procure the solution here entirely within the Irish context by practical common sense.  The problem that this Bill sets out to solve is not exclusively Irish.  It is a social problem that manifests itself in many other countries.  It would be dangerously narrow if we were to approach its solution without reading the sources that are available on the subject.  I make no apology for going to the experience of other countries in an endeavour to have this legislation as complete and as adequate as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera felt it was inappropriate that the State should now interfere in a matter between a married couple.  Again, he took the <Col N="439" /> example of the husband who got a transfer in his job and wanted to sell the house to move closer to the job. He said in such an area it was wrong that the State, via the court, should come in and act as a referee.  But, this is not a new proposition in our legal code.  At the moment, under the Guardianship of Infants Act, a court may have to settle conflicting claims with regard to the welfare of children. The old male dominance, the right of the father to make decisions in regard to the children, has been superseded by that Act, and by judicial decision. The proper criterion now is what is best for the children.  Under this Bill the criterion that the court will apply will be what is best for the family as a whole, for the spouse who is objecting, for her children and the husband who wants to sell.  The consequence of the point Deputy de Valera criticised was to allow the situation of the male prerogative to pertain no longer.  We are not prepared to do what Deputy de Valera suggests because the Bill recognises that the time has come to end the scandal of vindictive sales.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy was worried about the position of a couple purchasing a house from another married couple.  He considered that there might be a difficulty where the wife actually gives her consent.  If I was correct in understanding this to be his interpretation of the section in question, I would not agree.  He was interpreting section 3 (3) regarding the <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value after reasonable inquiry in the context of a married couple purchasing from a married couple where a consent had been given, but this question would only arise in the case of a purchase from a person where a consent had not been obtained.  In the case of a married couple, where the consent is actually given, that is the end of it. There is no need to look behind that title.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly raised the point under section 7 as to how a wife could become involved in a mortgage suit in the absence of some specific provision directing service of proceedings on her.  He has an interesting point here <Col N="440" /> and we will have to look at it between now and Committee Stage to ensure that there is a proper procedure and mechanism so that she will become aware of mortgage proceedings.  It may be that under Rules of Court the matter can be accounted for but if it cannot, we may have to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews raised the question of family courts.  Again, this is something that has been raised on numerous occasions but nobody has spelled out what he means by a family court.  It is a desirable concept but I have asked before&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have asked before what precisely is meant by a family court.  At what level in our judicial system is it to be inserted?  Who is to compose the family court?  Is it to be a judge?  Is he to have the assistance of a permanent corps of assessors?  Will the assessors be appointed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis from time to time, or will it be an itinerant court that will move around the country?  Will there be different chambers of it sitting in different locations in the country?  What rights will it have over the disposal of property or over the custody of persons or children?  These are major questions that have to be decided on.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy has answers to those questions I would be extremely interested in reading them. Deputy O'Kennedy wondered about the position of grandchildren and grandparents.  The Bill does not extend to cover their position and I do not think it can do so.  In effect what the Deputy is suggesting is that grandparents living in the family home should have the right to prevent the sale of that property.  I think that would be going too far.  They are in the home either as predecessors in title who handed over the home to one of the spouses, and in that case one would normally expect that their rights would be protected in the transfer, or, alternatively, they <Col N="441" /> are there at the invitation of either or both spouses.  If the right of a spouse to withhold consent is available it can be withheld in the general family context and the court, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, can decide if the consideration of the situation of the grandparents was a valid reason for refusing to give consent to the conveyance.  I think it would be going too far to extend the protection to parties other than the spouse and children.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy also raised the question of the single parent family, the widow or the widower with children, and he wondered what right is there to stop that parent from a vindictive sale over the heads of the children.  The short answer is that there is none.  The single parent is left with responsibility and would have to be given the responsibility and onus of doing what is best for the family. To allow a third party to intervene would be a very far-reaching principle. We have allowed a third party to intervene in the legislation dealing with the maintenance of spouses and children to ensure that proper maintenance is provided in such cases and I think that is as far as we should go.  It would be going too far to allow a third party to intervene to prevent a man or a mother selling the family home.  If it is a single parent, we will have to trust that his or her discretion will be properly used.  Should it be used in a way that proper maintenance will not be afforded to the children, the right of a third party to intervene arises under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the points raised in the course of the debate.  Many of them were Committee Stage points that may be raised in detail on that Stage and I look forward to dealing with them then.  I should like to thank Deputies for the general welcome they gave the Bill.  It will meet the difficulty it is designed to meet, that is, it will end the scandal of vindictive sales.  The mechanism proposed in the Bill is the proper one to do this.  The alternatives were the registration system&mdash;I indicated in my opening speech why that was not suitable <Col N="442" /> and this has been accepted&mdash;and the other alternative was to introduce a system of compulsory joint ownership and I gave reasons why that was not desirable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke said that compulsory joint ownership would obviate legal proceedings but, on the contrary, it would make such proceedings just as likely to take place and it would have the effect of making them more complex. The Bill provides for the wife's consent to be obtained by the husband and, in the event of her unreasonably withholding consent, it is a simple mechanism to have it given by the court.  It puts the onus on the husband and I think it will afford every protection to the wife and children.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress I was pointing out to the Minister that it would have been better had he told us honestly that he was short of money and that he would have to cut down on the services we had last year.  However, instead of this he told us that he will be able to provide the same services although we have pointed out this is not possible <Col N="443" /> in view of the amount of money given to the health boards.  I mentioned that the health board in my area is short £500,000 if they are to provide the same level of services as last year.  When the Minister allocated money to the health boards did he take into consideration the inflation factor and also the fact that increments are payable to the staff?  There has been no mention of this.  The shortfall is greater than we anticipated. If the Minister had admitted frankly that he had not the money and that it would be necessary to cut, we might have been more sympathetic. However, I would not agree with any cuts being made at the bottom of the scale, as the health boards are doing. It is the unfortunate people at the bottom of the ladder who are being hit most severely.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion I referred to the question of medical cards.  Even in the short period since then many more people have been told that they are not entitled to medical cards.  The health boards are adhering strictly to guidelines that are all wrong.  A question was asked in the Dáil recently and the Minister admitted that it is possible for a couple drawing the old age pension to be deprived of a health card.  I have heard that a single person with an old age pension of £10 can have £6 income from another source, making a total of £16, and in this case the guideline for eligibility for a medical card is £19, but some people in this situation have been refused medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us the criteria used for determining eligibility for a medical card.  Why is it different from that applying to an old age pension?  A single man can have £6 and get a full old age pension and the guideline for obtaining a medical card is £19.  Under the guidelines he can have £19 and still get a medical card.  A man and a wife in receipt of the old age pension would be getting £20 together with the £12 they are entitled to and that would mean that they would be over the guidelines because the figure is £28.25. I cannot understand the system of <Col N="444" /> finding out a single person's means.  A person is not entitled to the old age pension if he it getting more than £6 per week but if one adds that £6 to the old age pension he is brought to £16 per week while the guidelines are £19 per week.  The whole medical card system will have to be looked into.  The Western Health Board asked that the guidelines for man and wife without children should be set at £35 instead of the unrealistic figure of £28.25.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when I questioned him about this, told me that such people were out because of the good pensions being given by the Government but does anybody consider that a man and his wife, with the huge increase in the cost of living, can live on anything less?  Surely people with £32 per week cannot be considered to be in the middle income group.  I appeal to the Minister to look into this matter of medical cards.  I know the hardships caused in this regard.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with a live issue in my area at present, the question of amalgamation and federation of hospitals.  The people of my area were complimented by the Minister for keeping quiet on this matter for so long.  We did not shout about the Portiuncula hospital in Ballinasloe, one of the finest hospitals in the country, or the nurses training school in that town because we expected it would retain full status as a general hospital but we understand that under the new set up it is to be federated with Roscommon County Hospital which is 25 miles away.  Without saying anything against Roscommon County Hospital, I believe a federation between that hospital and Ballinasloe cannot work.  The fact that two important appointments which have been approved by the Ballinasloe hospital board have not been sanctioned by the Department has made the people in that area concerned. Deputy Hogan O'Higgins and myself are trying to keep the people quiet by telling them that they will continue to have their hospital but the people are concerned because the appointments have not been sanctioned. Such an arrangement is not considered <Col N="445" /> satisfactory by Roscommon and we will make a lot of noise if anything happens to Ballinasloe hospital which is run by an Order of French Sisters.</P>
    <P>There is rethinking on the question of amalgamation and federation of hospitals in England.  They are more inclined now to revert to the smaller hospital because they feel it can provide a better service.  I never agreed with the Fitzgerald Report because I felt it was unsuitable for this country. The people of Ballinasloe did not kick up a fuss about their hospital because they did not think there was any necessity to do so; it was easy to see that the facilities were there.  The services available at that hospital are not available elsewhere but we have been told that there is a danger of the hospital being downgraded because appointments are not being sanctioned.</P>
    <P>Another important matter in my area concerns the treatment of the mentally handicapped.  Those involved in that work in Galway are very short of money and have written to local representatives about the matter.  Last year there was a shortfall of £20,000 and if they experience a shortfall this year they will not be able to provide many of the facilities for the mentally handicapped.  At St. Joseph's special school for moderately handicapped children 75 children are being looked after while at the unit in Galway for severely handicapped 22 are looked after.  At St. Dympna's Centre at Portumna eight are cared for while 12 are catered for at the Tuam Centre. At the St. Joseph's Training Centre in Galway for school leavers 20 are catered for.  We have been informed that the amount agreed for this work in 1974-75 was £27,000 but the amount given was £12,000 while in 1975, £28,000 was agreed but only £20,000 granted.  I believe they have been promised £20,000 this year but that is not enough.  The health board have not the money.  The fact that this money is not made available is not the fault of the officials of that board. There will be severe curtailment in all essential services run by that board. I am not saying that a better service should be provided this year but if <Col N="446" /> the Minister honestly told us that it was not possible to provide the same services as last year we would help him.  The same cuts made at the bottom should be made at the top because, unfortunately, it is the under-privileged who will suffer.  I believe the health services will be cut drastically this year.</P>
    <P>I believe there will also be a severe cut in the home care allowance.  It is a shame that because a person who is looking after an old person lives with a husband or family that that person is not given an allowance.  I should like to point out very forcibly to the Minister that if I were Minister for Health I would gamble on giving more money to those looking after old people and providing community care in the belief that we would have fewer hospital problems and fewer cases of beds being occupied which were badly needed by others.  At present there are too many in hospital who could be kept at home.  It is a matter of money. If a married woman with a family has an old relative in the house the chances are that if there is something wrong with the old person the doctor will be asked to get a bed in hospital for him or her on the ground that he or she cannot be looked after at home.  I believe that if the woman were paid pretty well, under proper supervision, for taking care of the old relative this situation would not arise.  One could ensure that the old people would be well cared for.  I have been emphasising this since I came to the House.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that we in the Western Health Board cannot provide anything like the services we gave last year with the budget we have this year.  I do not believe the Minister made any provision for the increments which normally arise.  In this regard the various health board allocations are completely unrealistic.  I know the officials of the Western Health Board and there are no more conservative people in bringing in estimates and I cannot understand the Minister suggesting that we can run the show for £500,000 less than estimated.  Is he accusing the officials of introducing excessive estimates? <Col N="447" /> This is not on.  I hope the Minister for Education will convey what I have said in all sincerity to the Minister for Health.  If it were a Minister of my own party who was sitting opposite, I would have to make the same criticisms because I am in constant contact with the hardships endured by the people I represent. The health cards are being withdrawn: we are being hit on the lowest level.  I make a final appeal to the Minister to reconsider these health board allocations because they are completely unrealistic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to renew an appeal to the Minister which has been made by me and by others on a number of occasions to reconstitute the advisory health committee, the southern committee of Cork County Council.  Unfortunately, neither the Minister nor his Parliamentary Secretary is present and this is a rather complicated matter which the Minister for Education will scarcely be able to follow.  The matter was raised by me on a number of occasions by means of parliamentary question and by way of deputation.  Both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary promised sympathetic consideration but nothing happened.  Resolutions, requests, and even demands were sent by the Cork County Council and the southern committee for the restoration of this advisory body but to no avail.  I do not want to reflect on the absence of the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary but I shall wait for another opportunity, perhaps next week, when I may be able to address <Col N="448" /> myself personally to one or the other of them.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned hospitals that are being built and replacements that are in progress or about to be undertaken but there is no mention of hospital demolitions for which the Minister is responsible.  I refer particularly to the demolition of hospitals in Fermoy and Middleton.  Deputy Cronin in the case of Fermoy and myself in the case of Middleton put down parliamentary questions as a result of complaints by the public about the demolition of these buildings which were in excellent condition structurally.  It was nothing short of vandalism on the part of the Southern Health Board wantonly to destroy them particularly in this time of crisis when the chances of either replacing them or providing new buildings are nil.  Also in Fermoy and Middleton areas there is a very severe lack of accommodation for geriatrics and for patients mildly handicapped physically or mentally who could use the accommodation these hospitals could have offered.  As a result of the public outcry, Deputy Cronin and I put down questions but we got no satisfaction.</P>
      <P>There is still room for improvement in the ambulance service.  In some parts of the Southern Health Board area more ambulances are required.  I speak particularly for the town of Cobh where the people have been agitating for an ambulance for a number of years.</P>
