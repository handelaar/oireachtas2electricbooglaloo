      <P>I should like to give notice that I should like the Chair, for our information and for the benefit of the House and our guidance in future, to give an indication why he made a ruling yesterday disallowing a question on the Adjournment on the grounds that the Minister had no responsibility whereas the question was already permitted on the Order Paper.  It appears to be inconsistent. I am giving notice now so that later in the day, perhaps either at the beginning of or after Questions he might give an indication of the grounds for his ruling.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 28:</P>
    <P>In page 27, line 33, before section 32, to insert the following section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;32. &mdash;(1) In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;society&rsquo; means a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1971, which is an agricultural society or a fishery <Col N="1520" /> society within the meaning of section 220 of the Income Tax Act, 1967;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;period of account&rsquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 155 (5) of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;wear and tear allowance&rsquo; means an allowance under section 241 of the Income Tax Act, 1967;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;initial allowance&rsquo; means an allowance under Chapter I, Part XV of the Income Tax Act, 1967;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;investment allowance&rsquo; means an allowance under section 22 of the Finance Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>(2)  In the case of a trade carried on by a society no transaction on or after the 6th day of April, 1976, shall be regarded as an exempted transaction for the purposes of section 220 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a society comes within the charge to corporation tax in respect of a trade before the 6th day of April, 1976, an accounting period of the society shall end for purposes of corporation tax on the 5th day of April, 1976.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a society carrying on a trade incurred before the 6th day of April, 1976, capital expenditure on the provision of machinery or plant for the purposes of the trade and that expenditure was either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  qualifying expenditure within the meaning of section 11 of the Finance Act, 1967, or</P>
    <P>(b)  expenditure on qualifying machinery or plant within the meaning of section 26 of the Finance Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>an allowance equal to the specified amount of that capital expenditure may at the election of the society be made in taxing the trade of the society for the accounting period which commences on the 6th day of April, 1976, as if it were an allowance on account of the wear and tear of the machinery or plant in that accounting period, and where such an election is made, the amount of the capital expenditure on the <Col N="1521" /> provision of the machinery or plant still unallowed as at the time of any subsequent event shall for the purposes of Chapter II of Part XVI of the Income Tax Act, 1967, be deemed to be nil.</P>
    <P>(5)  For the purposes of subsection (4) the specified amount of the capital expenditure means the amount of that capital expenditure together with any investment allowance in respect of that expenditure after deducting from the aggregate amount thereof&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the amount, as diminished by section 220 (5) of the Income tax Act, 1967, of any investment allowance made to the society in respect of that expenditure;</P>
    <P>(b)  the aggregate amount, as diminished by the said section 220 (5), of the wear and tear allowances and initial allowances made to the society in respect of that expenditure for all chargeable periods before the accounting period commencing on the 6th day of April, 1976;</P>
    <P>(c)  the aggregate of the amounts by which the wear and tear allowances in respect of that expenditure would have been diminished by the said section 220 (5) if the only wear and tear allowances for those chargeable periods in respect of that expenditure were the amounts which would have been made if a proper claim had been duly made by the society for each chargeable period without regard to section 11 of the Finance Act, 1967, or section 26 of the Finance Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a society comes within the charge to corporation tax in respect of a trade,</P>
    <P>(b)  the society was within the charge to income tax for the year 1975-76 in respect of the trade, and</P>
    <P>(c)  a period of account of the society commences before the 6th day of April, 1976, and ends on or after that date,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> the income from the trade for the period of account shall be computed (in accordance with the provisions applicable to Case I of Schedule D) without regard to the provisions of section 220 (3) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and the income as so computed shall be apportioned to the part of the period of account falling before the 6th day of April, 1976, and the part falling after that date, and for the purposes of subsections (3) and (4) of section 220 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and section 70 (5) of the Finance Act, 1963, each such part shall be deemed to be a period of account and the income from the trade for that part shall be the amount apportioned to it under the provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>(7)  Any apportionment to different periods under this section shall be made on a time basis according to the respective lengths of those periods.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with a suggestion which has often been advanced in recent weeks that there is some very unique distinction between the activities of co-operatives and of businesses.  It has been suggested that in some way or other there is something lacking in the Government's understanding of this unique difference. It is said that it is wrong to align co-operatives and private enterprise for similar tax treatment.  As I pointed out, there are a number of very significant areas of major business generating considerable activities where the co-operative movement and private enterprise are in direct competition and it is impossible in equity to justify continuation of a situation in which one group are exempt from tax in respect of profits derived by them from such business or from business so closely allied with and related to it as to make it extremely difficult to distinguish between exempt and non-exempted activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth is&mdash;and this is to the credit of the co-operative movement and I am not saying it to their discredit <Col N="1523" /> or in criticism of them&mdash;that the co-operatives particularly over the last decade, entered markets and engaged in business on a scale that was never contemplated when the exemptions were first introduced.  They entered these markets and engaged in business using their tax-free advantages to compete against private firms who do not enjoy such advantages. Even if some of the activities are not themselves exempt they can be, and frequently are financed by accumulated co-operative profits which have not borne any tax whereas private enterprise has to invest its own money after it has borne tax, so that from the start of the race as it were, co-operatives have a considerable advantage over private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the line between exempted and non-exempted capital expenditure, overhead expenses, services and materials supplied to such enterprises by co-operatives can often be so blurred that the proper treatment of the tax exemption system is a near impossibility.  The suggestion is made that co-operative societies do not engage in activities with a view to making profit but do so purely to render service to their farmer members.  This statement must be looked at against the background of some activities carried on by co-operatives for which they have sought exemption over the years.  Some of the exemptions they have sought have been so extreme as to include exemption for retail sales of ice cream, milk and honey.  Recent items in the public Press indicate that they have been participating in a very substantial way in an enterprise which is selling imported motor cars and, on the very day that the movement held a mass meeting to pass a unanimous resolution condemning the proposals for this very modest tax, that same meeting was encouraged to invest £400,000 in prospecting for offshore oil.</P>
    <P>Other activities in which the co-operative movement is engaged&mdash;legitimately, I emphasise, but because they are engaged in it I think they must be treated on equal terms with others&mdash; include insurance, property development, the manufacture of tankers and <Col N="1524" /> silos and even the importation of fruits and foodstuffs from abroad and their distribution to their members.  All these activities I regard as very desirable ventures but can hardly be in keeping with the statement that the co-operative movement is not similar to private enterprise in its activities and in the type of services which it renders.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that if the tax proposal which will collect a couple of million pounds on a turnover of over £750 million goes through it will so denude the societies of their profits that these societies will be left without capital and that as a result they will be put out of existence.  At the same time we are told that co-operatives are unique because they are not private enterprise operations; they are the farmers themselves.  It is very difficult to reconcile the two arguments.  It is suggested that because of disinclination to pay tax that farmer members of co-operatives would wish to destroy businesses which can render such useful service to them.  It is a nonsensical argument that I fear is on a par with many of the arguments advanced since this issue was raised.  Even if the tax charge on co-operatives were to impose some liability on the farmer, the burden on any particular farmer would be minimal.  In fact, having regard to the impact of the tax, certainly in the early years, and the membership of the societies which we are told is about 180,000, the figure would be about £10 per farmer but we know in truth that they will not even be called upon to pay that tax because the vast majority of those who are shareholders are not within the tax net or within 1,000 miles of it, or perhaps even that many years of it also.</P>
    <P>All that has to be compared with the figures I gave last night of the average tax that has to be paid without any possibility of avoidance by people on comparatively small wages. I accept that the farming community are willing to pay their share of taxation. They have said that again and again.  They have been party to discussions with me as how best to devise a system of taxation affecting farming profits and I will be having <Col N="1525" /> further discussions with farming organisations to discuss their problems as they see them.  Of course their view may not correspond with the view of others in regard to the amount of tax they should pay.  That is not peculiar.  Most people think others should pay more tax and they should pay less.  One thing is certain: they will not be left in the gutter where a previous administration left farmers when they came to see them about what they considered to be their legitimate grievances.</P>
    <P>The amendments go a long way towards meeting the current problems of the co-operative societies.  The principal problem of some of these societies at present is that they have borrowed very heavily in recent years, borrowings on a scale they would possibly not have made if they had had a liability to tax.  That is why we are not proposing to impose the tax in relation to profits previously made and why by and large the first payment of the tax will be in October, 1977.  This allows the co-operative societies to adjust their affairs so as to take account of the liability to tax.  It will also mean that they will be able over the next year to adjust the very substantial borrowings they have made and will therefore be in a healthier position.</P>
    <P>I said last night&mdash;I have good reason for saying this because it has been represented to me by competent accountants&mdash;that the measure the Government are introducing has obliged many co-operatives to take a hard look at their financial business arrangements.  As a result many have identified practices which were not in their own interests and which got not a few of them into some trouble in recent years.  I would hope that when the emotion and political opportunism has evaporated, as it ought to very soon in the interest of the co-operatives themselves, people will settle down to accept what is a very reasonable system of taxation on what is a very substantial business.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I was challenged to give names of particular co-operatives and individuals.  The Revenue Commissioners do not furnish me with names <Col N="1526" /> of particular co-ops.  It would be quite wrong for them to give any particulars to me or to anybody else about the tax liabilities of individuals or of organisations. The profits of co-operatives are published annually and anybody can see the size of their profits, even if they are not aware of their tax liabilities.</P>
    <P>I would like to give a few examples so that people will see the position we are trying to adjust and the justice of our proposal having regard to the very large number of societies involved and the very large profits some of them make.  As I pointed out last night, the profit made by the largest co-op in recent years was £4.7 million.  Naturally the figures vary, but the profits of the top ten were between £4.7 and £.7 million.  Here are a few examples: a co-op with a profit of £212,000 paid tax of £3,700; a co-op with a profit of £770,000 paid no tax; a co-op with a profit of £240,000 paid £12,000 tax; another co-op with a profit of £1.8 million paid no tax; another with a profit of £1.1 million paid £13,000 tax; a co-op with a profit of £390,000 paid no tax and a co-op with a profit of £1.75 million paid £1,300 tax.</P>
    <P>Some people might ask: &ldquo;.Why have they paid tax?  I thought they were exempt.&rdquo;  All their activities are not exempt.  For the reasons I stated earlier, the difference between exempt and non-exempt activities have become extremely blurred and the actual tax paid, as revealed by those figures, show they have not been burdened with any significant amount of tax in the past and, for that matter, I do not believe they will be in the future.  They will be asked to pay a little more and it is proper that a section of the community which have been increasing their income very substantially in recent years should now begin to make a more significant contribution towards the overall costs of running the country than they have in the past.</P>
    <P>I want to summarise our approach to this matter.  The Government's policy is to broaden the tax base and to establish an equitable system of taxation under which equivalent incomes, out of equivalent activities, will pay equivalent amounts of income tax.  It <Col N="1527" /> is, we believe, unfair to the general body of taxpayers and also to those businesses with which co-operatives are in direct competition to exempt from taxation a business which has a turnover of over £750 million a year. A tax charge of a couple of million pounds related to a turnover of £750 million cannot be regarded as an unjust burden or as a penal tax.  If this charge falls, as has been suggested, on the members of the co-ops, it is only a tiny charge per head on the people who are involved.  Most of these people are not paying tax and certainly they are not paying tax on their farming profits.</P>
    <P>Societies with no profits will, of course, pay no tax.  Societies with little profits will pay very little tax.  Those making large profits will contribute the largest share of the tax and there is no good reason why they should not.  If anybody can advance a good reason why they should not I will be only too happy to hear those people make that argument in public and not by way of threats issued in the dark of the night to individual Members of this House, warning them that their activities have been listed in dossiers so that they may be punished in due course for discharging their public duty as public representatives, in endeavouring to vote for and implement a system of equitable taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see the Minister has recovered a little of his composure.  Evidently, his officials have been working through the night preparing the remainder of his brief, providing him with a long clatter of extracted figures suspended in mid-air and related to nothing.  He delivered his speech this morning with an air of composure which he did not have last night when we discussed this matter. Then, he lashed himself into a frenzy, foamed at the mouth and was most insulting to the whole farming community. Even this morning it is perfectly clear that his mental approach to the question of the development and economy of rural Ireland does simply not exist.  He does not understand it.  Not only that, he projected, <Col N="1528" /> more especially yesterday but again this morning, an active hostility to farmers, their organisations and the co-operatives.  It conditioned every single word he said.  His hostility springs from his own urban background, the same background he shares with every single member of the present Government, a suburban, lace curtain, metropolitan, philosophy that rejects as ignorant and unworthy to be heard anything coming from beyond the Red Cow Inn.</P>
      <P>Beyond that point the Minister quite clearly has no conception of the enormous need of the people of Ireland, apart from the people of the city of Dublin and their enormous reliance on the farming industry.  That is why this party, the biggest single political party in Ireland, which has had that enviable title since 1932, says that the Minister's proposal is so damaging and that is why we are telling the country now that the Minister may do his damndest and introduce this crippling tax because we will repeal it when we get back into office.  If it is not repealed it will do permanent damage to the country.  Everybody knows that the activities of Deputy Ryan and his colleagues over the last three years have brought the country to a state of financial chaos and ruin.  There were three previous Coalitions and each of them did enormous damage in their turn.  I first came into this House on the heels of the activities of the second Coalition.  The country did not gain momentum again until the early sixties in spite of the fact that we took over in 1956.  The chaos that we took over then is nothing in comparison to the chaos we will be taking over after the next election but we will accept the task of reconstructing the national economy.  One of the most important facets of the national economy is the production of food for export.  It is so closely related to our main objective, which is to get the people of Ireland working again, that it is absolutely necessary to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has spent a long time attacking co-operatives and farmers and sneering at them.  He has been striving to drive a wedge <Col N="1529" /> between the people of rural Ireland and the people of the towns and cities. It is a political tack because there are more votes in the cities.  Almost everything the Minister said was false, almost as false as his opening gambit yesterday.  The Minister made a false allegation that the decision of the Fianna Fáil Party to oppose this tax was carried at a party meeting by a majority of one.  There was no division and no vote.  The decision to oppose this tax was taken unanimously by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister said was not true.  I think I have demonstrated that it was not true. Deputy Colley has said the same thing.  What are we to do?  The Minister made a statement that there has been a narrow vote on this matter at our party meeting.  This is not so. A Cheann Comhairle, I take your observations.  I know that you are concerned with the rules of order.</P>
      <P>It is of vital importance to the recovery of the national economy that the co-operative food producing industry gets special treatment.  We will rise again by our own efforts, most of all by our capacity to manufacture, process and sell on the export market.  The Minister is endeavouring to inhibit our efforts in this regard because we will be relying most of all on the food industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the farming industry, as distinct from the processing industry, has suffered severely under the Coalition Government.  At the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis over the weekend the poor Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was talking about the prosperity of farmers.  The Minister for Finance has been talking about the enormous rise in farm incomes in recent times.  If that is so, why has the consumption of phosphates and fertilisers dropped by 40 per cent last year?  Does not everybody know that <Col N="1530" /> fertilisers, being the raw material for raw material, are absolutely basic? Is it to be forgotten that in 1974 the average drop in farm incomes was 40 per cent higher than in the last year of Fianna Fáil Government?  Is it to be forgotten that thousands of cattle farmers were wiped out by the ineffectiveness of the present Fine Gael Government?  Is it to be forgotten that on the 1st January last there were in the fields of Ireland 560,000 fewer cattle than there had been on that day in the previous year.  In our administration we worried if there was not a satisfactory rise in cattle numbers on the 1st January every year.  If you put a conservative estimate of £200 on each of those cattle you will see that there was £112 million less worth of cattle in the fields of Ireland on the 1st January last year than there had been previously.  Is this the prosperity that the Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries and Finance are talking about?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Minister's period of office, when all this alleged prosperity was created, he has introduced double and treble taxation of farmers and farm production.  Our attitude on the question of farmers and taxation was always clear.  I made it clear when we were in Government. I could see no reason why farmers any more than anyone else should be exempt from paying their fair share of tax.  If other people were paying income tax, we would pay it too.  But I also said this: there is a penal tax being paid by every farmer in Ireland <Col N="1531" /> over a valuation of £20, and that is the rates upon his land.  I wonder how would a professional person feel if he had to pay an annual penal tax on the very fact that he held the profession of solicitor, doctor or engineer? Would he not consider it a penal tax? We have also to pay annuities on our land and as a result of the Minister's recent measures we will lose the VAT remission on goods produced on our farms, and this on an average farm would come to about £500 or £1,000. As well as that, we have the dearest farm equipment, I would say, in the EEC.  Farm tractors and other farm machinery like that cost thousands of pounds more than they do in the North of Ireland or elsewhere.  Yet the Minister has the temerity to stand up here and say farmers are exempt from tax, that they have enjoyed holidays so long.  I believe the Minister is talking in good faith but the fact is that he does not know the score.  He has demonstrated it beyond any shadow of doubt since the introduction of his budget, when he is crying death and ruin for the economy in one week, and then in Galway the other day he says we are going to have a growth rate of 2½ per cent in the current year.  I do not know whether we are or not.  I have my own opinion about it.  I cannot see how we are going to do it, because the country has no Government at present. Anyway, he changes his mind, like the girl in the song, as often as he changes his socks.</P>
      <P>I was saying the farming industry is very severely impaired by the activities or inactivity of the Government. The sale of calves out of this country has done long-term damage to the prospects of employment in the meat industry and, if you will forgive me for saying so, a Cheann Comhairle, you must have acute personal knowledge of the closure of the Clover Meat plant in Clonmel.  I am afraid there will be other closures in the meat industry because of the profligate management of the cattle industry by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the meat processing plants are co-operatives and, being co-operatives&mdash;and <Col N="1532" /> this is a thing the Minister does not seem to be able to understand&mdash;they assume responsibilities that no private undertaking will ever do.  Of necessity they must cater for the free rider&mdash;he is called a free rider by people in the co-operative movement&mdash;that is to say, a person who avails of the facilities provided by farmers' co-operatives, and of fishermen's co-operatives for that matter, but contributes nothing.  They must also provide a service in areas that are not particularly economic.  In this regard the development of the dairy industry in the west of Ireland will be heavily dependent on the development of the co-operative movement, and if farming in Connacht and in the west of Ireland generally is to develop at all it will have to develop around the co-operative movement and in particular around the co-operative dairy business in the west of Ireland. No private enterprise is going to take over large-scale agricultural development.  It will have to be done by the co-operative movement.</P>
    <P>Woven through the Minister's speech like a thread in a fabric was the misconceived notion that co-operatives exist for profit, that that is their purpose.  This simply is not the case. I know, because I am a member of a couple of co-operative enterprises myself, as many of my colleagues are as well.  Look at the development of the livestock selling system in the country over the last decade or two.  This was developed by the farmers themselves from their own pockets, and it is now a very highly developed modern method of selling cattle, for instance, the development of IMP, Cork Marts and Clover and, above all, the enormous development which took place in the dairy industry, the concentration that was advocated by me and by my colleagues in this House long before it took place.  The members of this party could claim a great share of the credit for urging the co-operative movement to do this concentration which gave us the five or six big plants in the south and Killeshandra and Lough Egish in the north-east, that are now highly efficient food processing plants.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's view about this whole <Col N="1533" /> enormous business seems to be diametrically opposed to the view of the Coalition Government as interpreted by the Minister for Finance.  We intend to rebuild the herds and the flocks of Ireland after the havoc wrought by this Government.  There are one million sheep fewer in the country than when Fianna Fáil left office. There are about 800,000 pigs; they have been reduced to that level although they will begin to rise again because there is a cyclical factor in the pig herd.  Apart from rebuilding the herds of Ireland, we will also participate in the development of the processing end of the food industry.  That is only half developed at present.</P>
    <P>I am accepting the role of defending the co-operative food processing industry because I have a personal interest in it and because my party realise the vital importance of it to the country.  However, I have no hesitation in saying that there is a great deal to be desired in the organisation of that industry.  There is room for improvement in their product research and in the marketing of their products.  Above all, the lack of co-operation between co-operatives in vital areas like the matter of animal breeding, that has been so disastrously neglected by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, requires attention.  The use of high quality bulls and high quality semen from the artificial insemination stations shows a drastic drop every year since the Coalition took over and the herd will have been damaged very severely from that point of view when we take over office again.  But we will rebuild it; we did it before and we will do it again.</P>
    <P>The nub of this question is that which Deputy Colley challenged the Minister to try, on the ground of equity, to demonstrate, that it is right and just and proper not only to tax farmers themselves but to tax the co-operatives as well and at the same time to exempt foreign enterprises in the export market, firms like the one I think of mostly&mdash;I do not know why &mdash;Asahi, the one which will be setting up in Killala.  We wish them well. They will be giving much-needed employment to the people, but such <Col N="1534" /> undertakings are not as important nor is their importance a fraction of the importance of our own food industry. Nevertheless, because of the Minister's in-born, city slicker's dislike of rural things, which is a compound of envy and ignorance and conditions the Minister's city slicker friends and colleagues, apart from their raging need for money, apart from the fact that they know very well that the ship of State is almost on the rocks, they feel justified in doing this.  If they persist they will impair, possibly fatally, whatever prospects we have of national recovery.  As we have said, and it is worth repeating, on that basis alone the Minister would be badly advised in persisting in this because it will only result in the setting up at great expense of an apparatus for thwarting the development of the Irish food processing industry.  The first thing we will do, if the Minister persists in this, will be to dismantle the apparatus when we get back to office.</P>
    <P>According to this morning's papers the president of the IFA expressed a lingering hope the Minister might yet see reason, accept the judgment of his organisation, of our organisation and of the great mass of the people of rural Ireland, swallow his greed and his pride and accept, in view of the circumstances I have just outlined, that we will, if he persists, presently change this.  This tax will never be collected because the Minister and his colleagues will not have a chance of collecting it.  I would urge him to reconsider this and accept the dictates of the will of the people.  I doubt if he has enough manliness to do that, but anyway I ask him to do it.</P>
    <P>An aspect of this that will presumably be dealt with by some of my colleagues is the development of the fishery industry.  There is no way in which we can develop our fisheries except on the basis of fishermen's co-operatives. A small industry of this kind must be protected.  It is not unreasonable to say it should receive special protection if it needs it.  Our fishermen will need it.  Unfortunately, the Minister cannot see it that way.  It is equally clear his colleagues do not see it that way.  That is demonstrably <Col N="1535" /> shown by the way in which they have been handling the industry since they took over.  One has only to contemplate the profligate distribution of salmon drift net licences, wreaking havoc in this great national resource, by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy M.P. Murphy, to realise the Government could not care less about this industry.  They are not interested in the development of fisheries.  They are interested only in the fast buck in terms of votes.  There are no fast bucks in this taxation of co-operatives and I tell the Minister again solemnly that we will be dependent on the Irish food processing industry, its enlargement and development, for our economic recovery.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Minister and his colleagues over the last three years have sadly diminished and reduced that prospect of recovery.  There are redundancies and shut-downs throughout the food processing industry and they will continue as a result of the Minister's activities.  The pace will be accelerated if this tax is introduced. This must be obvious even to the Minister and an awful fate will befall a great many of our co-operative enterprises, if the Minister goes ahead with this, and that is the fate of the takeover by foreigners.  The interests of foreign companies in our food processing industry is large enough at the moment and it should not be allowed to get any bigger.  It will certainly fall totally into the hands of the multinationals if the Minister goes ahead with this proposal and, when it does, the prices Irish food producers will get for their pigs, their sheep, their cattle, and their dairy products will be dictated not by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, or anybody else, but by some person with an office in London or in Bonn, or God knows where, because that is the direction in which we are heading.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that the financial position of these co-operative enterprises is by no means good.  They are all carrying very, very heavy capital debts.  He must know that huge undertakings, like Golden Vale, Avonmore, <Col N="1536" /> Mitchelstown, Ballyclough and Water-ford county are all carrying huge overdrafts and the imposition of this tax will only aggravate and make worse that situation.  Nobody but a blind man or a fool would proceed with the introduction of this tax.  We have now the information gleaned by us as a result of three years' experience of this Coalition Government.  They have demonstrated their folly on many, many occasions but this attack on our main line of rescue, our main line of advance in the future cannot be countenanced by anybody with a titter of sense.  That is why we are so definite in our attitude on this side of the House.  We have no doubts at all and we reject totally this mean attempt by the Minister and his colleagues to excite hostility, envy and a sense among private traders of unfair competition.  I am not aware that there is unfair competition.  In any case, the Minister all through his speech seemed to dispute the right of farmers to come together and establish their own business, especially if they are poor farmers, because he sneered at them when he said most of them pay no tax at all.  They would certainly pay tax if they had the means.  They all pay rent and rates and they all pay for machinery, which is something for which nobody else has to pay.</P>
    <P>The inborn, innate hostility of the Minister and his party towards farming organisations, the farmers themselves and their co-operatives bubbles out of every word he says.  We do not have that hostility.  On the contrary, we recognise the vital importance of this co-operative industry to the future of Ireland and we will defend it and, at the first opportunity, we will repeal what the Minister is seeking to do here, if he is successful in his endeavours.  He will, of course, bring the troops in presently. There are none here now except Deputy Coogan.  There were none here last evening until the bells were rung to summon them.  They came trooping in then and shortly afterwards they all trooped out again.  We will probably see Deputy Hegarty and all the rest of them troop in here and vote at a city Minister's dictation, even those who come from rural Ireland.  You will see it happening presently.  It is all very sad.</P>

I have never heard such nonsense as that spoken by Members on the opposite side.  In the coming by-election campaigns they will play one tune in the town but in the country they will cry: &ldquo;Do not tax the farmer&rdquo;.

Fianna Fáil can prepare their different tunes for the country areas and for the town during the coming by-election campaign but that game will not work now.

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>After listening to the Minister's speech it is obvious that he is completely out of touch with the situation.  Those of us who are interested in the development of agriculture are concerned at the flippant way in which the Minister dealt with this matter.  Fianna Fáil consider that the Minister's decision to tax co-operatives was ill-judged and ill-timed. It should not have been taken at a time when the industry is in the process of rationalisation and when so many co-operatives are in serious difficulties. The Minister's action will force co-operatives to postpone development plans and it will be a complete disincentive to the co-operative movement.</P>
      <P>We urge the Minister to reconsider this proposal.  It is proposed at a time when many co-operatives are relatively underdeveloped and it will be almost impossible for them to expand or to provide the credit facilities that are necessary for the farming community. Horace Plunkett, Father Finley and Paddy the Cope worked to establish the co-operative movement here.  It was hoped to cut out the middlemen and to pass on the profits to the producers.  It was also intended to ensure that the producers would not be victimised.  Unfortunately the co-operative movement did not make the progress hoped for by the founders.  For some time it made only limited progress and this may have been due to the independent outlook of farmers.  However, in recent years the co-operative movement has developed quite substantially and it is now big business.  The movement may have obtained different results in different circumstances.  The Minister seemed to indicate that there was a conflict between private enterprise and the movement but that is not the case.  When he was questioned last night on this matter he spoke of a turnover of £97.3 million with a profit of £4.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rationalisation process will mean that there will be considerable changes in the industry.  Many co-operatives <Col N="1540" /> are involved in costly extensions and modernisations and they are suffering from a serious cash shortage.  This period could be regarded as the formative years of the large co-operative business.  In this country the co-operative movement involves the agricultural industry but in England and Scotland there are mostly non-agricultural co-operatives. In the last ten years there has been much activity in the co-operative movement with the addition of meat plants, cattle marts and plants for processing farm produce.  Fianna Fáil regard the processing of farm produce as a valuable factor in our economy. At the moment agriculture is under considerable pressure from a mechanised world particularly in countries where the holdings are small.  A lot of those co-ops are the saviours of our small farmers.  If we do not produce a formula which will make it possible for our people to remain on the land, rural areas will become denuded of people.  That formula must provide for a higher standard of living for those living on the land.  It has not been produced but co-ops are properly structured to meet the new circumstances.</P>
    <P>We are very concerned that the co-operative structure should remain in a healthy and progressive state rather than the economic survival of particular enterprises.  Anything that will harm that movement or reduce their incentive to expand is serious. We should examine the potential of the co-operative movement.  I was involved in a co-op from 1947, and I was disappointed last night to learn how little the Minister for Finance knows about the movement and its importance to rural Ireland.  He gave the impression that the co-ops are big profit making concerns but omitted to tell the House that they were concerned with the provision of services and finance for small farmers.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the drop in fertiliser usage.  The increase in the use of fertiliser on our farms after the war was mainly due to the co-ops. They imported large consignments of phosphate, potash and basic slag.  That fertiliser was sold to farmers on a nonprofit <Col N="1541" /> making basis because the co-ops were bearing in mind the future of agriculture here.  They were aware that it was essential to raise the quality of the land so as to ensure that in their planned expansion scheme for milk production they had sufficient feed for stock.  That development continued up to the seventies but in 1974 we had a large number of stock and no animal feed.  Deputy Coogan can shout about cutting calves' throats but the problem at that time was due to the mismanagement of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I recall that in the early fifties the co-op which I was interested in imported basic slage and sold it to the farmers at £4 10s per ton.  The co-op imported in lots of 600 tons to Dundalk.  The margin of profit was 17/6 per ton and out of that the co-op paid the hauliers 12/6 per ton to transport it from the boat and deliver it in ten-ton lots to the farmers.  The remaining 5/- had to cover telephone charges, supervision by a shipping agent in Dundalk, wastage and breakage.  Co-ops were providing the fertiliser to farmers at that price because they were concerned about the future.  Admittedly, in later years co-ops developed into large enterprises but it should be remembered that in the early years their profits were being channelled into creating new enterprises and providing better facilities for the farming community.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the wrong outlook on this.  He has been badly advised.  In the area I represent there is the Killeshandra, Monaghan and Lough Egish co-ops.  Men like John O'Neill, John O'Donnell and Brian Daly, by their enterprise and foresight built those co-ops into valuable assets for the farming community.  On 8th April Brian Daly, chairman of Lough Egish co-op and chairman of the Food, Drink and Tobacco Federation of Ireland slammed the tax on co-ops.  He said that the withdrawal of tax concessions in the budget from the co-ops was wrong.  He felt that the current climate was not exactly conducive to fresh investment in the industry which he emphasised was a necessary prerequisite to the creation of international competitiveness and the stabilisation of employment and subsequent expansion in <Col N="1542" /> work opportunities.  That man is deeply involved in the co-operative movement. That is also our attitude.  Most merchants situated in areas where co-ops are doing business admit that they are unable to provide the credit facilities being provided by the co-ops.  The Minister accused us of using this for political purposes but that is a red herring.  We are putting pressure on the Minister because we know that it is necessary for the co-ops to be able to use their profits to provide facilities for farmers.  Co-ops are necessary for the advancement of the agricultural industry. The Minister should have another look at this before the end of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I tell the Minister through the Chair, and I would like him to withdraw it, that, not a lie, but I will say an untruth has been stated by the Minister on the question of Fianna Fáil and their decision on the matter.  I would like him also to say who is the respectable farmer who said this, because I would like to know.  Rumours have gone around and certain people have been associated with them, and the sooner this is cleared up the better.  This was not a voted decision, it was a unanimous decision of the party.  Any members of the Fianna Fáil Party who met the IAOS made it clear that they were knocking at an open door, that it was the decision of the party to oppose this.  The Minister should not make statements here unless he has proof and I request him to do so.  I would like to know who is the respectable farmer in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a wrong interpretation of the co-operative movement. He has a wrong impression altogether of the strength and the amount of money which the co-operative movement has, particularly where the co-operative movement is mostly wanted, and that is in the west.  We in the west were completely lost until the co-operative movement was started there.  The co-operative movement was started so that the producer would have some say in the disposal of his goods and would be able to get what was essential to the production of farm produce at the cheapest possible <Col N="1543" /> rate.  An extraordinary thing about it is that in the west quite a number of merchants became members of the co-operative movement because they knew that the survival of the west depended on the co-operative movement. In regard to the question of competition they said: &ldquo;Fair enough, but if you have not the co-operative movement you will not be there to buy anything from us&rdquo;.  In my area, in a small village, I collected about £400 from merchants to set up the creameries in the west.  This shows us the support the co-operative movement had from all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the west went over to creamery products and milk production because milk and pigs were things it was possible to have without having a large farm.  The pig co-operatives were started in the west. They gave hints to farmers to help them to get into pig production.  They even had a grading system to tattoo the bonhams so that the proper type of pig would be produced for the factories.  Some of those pig co-operatives would have closed were it not for a certain Minister for Finance, whom I will not name but he was a Fianna Fáil Minister, who put his name to the dotted line with the ACC to keep them open.  These co-operatives are barely surviving at present.  Pigs are not fattened at the moment, but we would have no pigs in the west if it were not for the pig-fattening co-operatives.</P>
    <P>During the period when one could not sell a bonham the co-operatives gave a price and they got the banks to lend money so that they could continue to pay it because they had hope for the future, that this was a cycle and that pigs would come back.  At that time the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister were not very hopeful.  The Minister claims that he never said we should get out of pigs.  What he did say was the European Community, the people in Brussels, would like to see us getting out of pigs because there is no future for them.  In spite of that the pig-fattening co-operatives in the west <Col N="1544" /> kept the people in pigs.  I will not say that pigs are very profitable, but nobody in the west would be keeping them if it were not for the co-operative movement, and those co-operatives are barely surviving.</P>
    <P>I am a member of one of the largest creameries in the west, recently started in my home village. There were no cows suitable for milk production in the west.  This creamery bought cows collectively for the farmers and got the banks to give loans to help get the smaller farmers into milk.  This was all done by the co-operative movement, as I know. Those creameries and co-operatives in the west cannot afford to pay this tax. I ask the Minister not to cripple the co-operative movement at this stage. It is more essential now than ever.  I would not mind if the Minister set out to reorganise the co-operative movement.  When a movement begins to expand there is a lot to be desired. Perhaps that is the case at the moment in the co-operative movement. I do not believe there would be any opposition to that reorganisation from this side of the House, but to tax the co-operative movement at present is a disaster, particularly for the smaller farmers.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that there is no danger of the small farmers, who are the vast majority of farmers in the west, being taxed on the dividend they get, because they have not got a bob.  The largest amount of shares which anyone can hold in a co-operative society is £1,000.  Seventy per cent of the capital of the co-operative movement at present is bank money.  On the question of turnover I have heard nothing at all about the bank overdraft.  The Minister now admits that the co-operative societies are very heavy borrowers, heavily in debt.  Had it not been for the commercial banks the co-operative societies would have closed down long ago. Now the Minister is going to put a tax on them at this crucial time in the development of the co-operatives, particularly in the west.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley and Deputy Gibbons referred to equity in taxation.  Equity in everything would not be in <Col N="1545" /> the national interest.  The Minister is right not to tax exports from industries, but it is not equity.  As Deputy Colley and Deputy Gibbons pointed out, the co-operative movement is vital to the survival of the farmers, particularly the small farmers. The large farmer can get on without his co-operatives but the small farmer cannot.  In the west we even have machinery co-operatives which provide machinery for the small farmer, costly machinery which the small farmer cannot afford to buy.  They let it out on contract to these people, very large machines such as Forrest harvesters, combine harvesters and so on.  At one time a farmer could not afford to buy even a tractor.  In my home town this machinery was hired out at a reasonable rate to small farmers, a rate that would keep the co-operative viable.  This is the difference between a private enterprise and the co-operative movement.  I have no objection in the world to private enterprise but the fact is that in order for the smaller type of farmer to survive he needs the co-operatives.  He is the person the Government are supposed to be saving.  Here is a very real way that he can be saved, through his co-operatives.</P>
    <P>I am not going to deal with fisheries because the man who can do that is sitting in the front benches, but being a west of Ireland man I know how important these co-operatives are.  A lot has been said about the livestock marts.  I remember very well when these were started.  At that time in my home area a big company from across the water came to set up a private mart.  They had money, and it was to be on both sides of the counter: they would be the buyer and the seller. However, the producers, very small farmers, came together and said: &ldquo;Why should we allow one man to be on both sides of the counter, as buyer and seller?  We as producers should be at least in control of the selling of our produce.  We got about £5,000 or £6,000 in £5 notes and not more than £20 because they did not have it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We set up the co-operative system of marts in the west because we <Col N="1546" /> believe that a primary producer should have control of what he produces all the way to the selling end.  Every buyer is welcome, but it would be too bad if a syndicate could come in here and set up livestock marts all over the country, so that the producer would just bring in his stock and have no say whatever in the selling of it. We would not stand for that.  We got the support of the then Government and we thought we would have the support of every Government.  There was no politics in starting the co-operative movement and many Deputies from the Minister's party played a vital part in helping to get co-operatives set up.  They know very well that this approach to the co-operative movement will have serious consequences for the west.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to completely withdraw this proposal to tax co-operatives. It is a tax of £3 million on a £750 million turnover.  Only this morning the Minister admitted the amount of money borrowed by the co-operatives.  If the banks did not have confidence in and put money into the co-operatives, the co-operatives would fold up.  The old co-operatives which were not limited liability companies had gone by the wayside in the west when we first tried to get this co-operative movement going.  We had to convince farmers that they were limited liability companies and that they were responsible only for the share capital they took in the co-operative.</P>
    <P>The co-operatives are providing a service.  That is what they were set up for.  If profit is being made, it is being ploughed back for expansion of the co-operatives and for vital services such as the machinery service, money advanced to provide stock, and so on. The co-operatives arrange for loans with the banks for small farmers. Nobody except the people associated with co-operatives knows the extent of the services that the co-operative movement provides for the small farmer.  If the co-operative movement was not there big syndicates would come in here and take over.  We must ensure that the Irish producer will have control of the marketing of what <Col N="1547" /> he produces.  Should the farmer lose sight of his product after it has left the farm gate and let other people take over?  That approach was finished with once and for all when the co-operative movement was set up.  We decided that we would look after our own products and make sure that we had a say in it until it was sold.</P>
    <P>The co-operative movement has been a very good employer in the west.  It pays union wages and there is very seldom a strike because there is great understanding between the co-operative committee and the workers. The majority of the co-operative committees comprise small farmers whose sons and daughters are working within the co-operative movement. There is co-operation because they are dealing with the same type of people; they are not dealing with directors who are paid may be £30,000 or £40,000 a year.  The members of the committee are paid only very small expenses for attending the meeting. They work solely in the interests of the producers and in the interests of the country.  It would be terrible if the Minister does not listen to the voice of the people in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to admit that farming prices are good at the moment.  It has been said that there is a scarcity of cattle because the cattle were sold. Cows which were in calf were sold in 1974 because the farmer could not sell the calf, and that is the reason for this scarcity of cattle now.  We appealed at that time for something to be done to remedy that situation. The co-operatives are now trying to get loans for people whose cattle herd has gone down so that they can attempt to increase their herd.  This in an area where the co-operative movement is essential and is working for the people.  I should like to see another look taken at the whole question of co-operatives so that democracy can work right through the co-operative movement.  To take a blanket look at this and say that co-operatives will be taxed across the board is very wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about intimidation. <Col N="1548" /> I assure the Minister that I do not stand for intimidation.  Supporters of the Minister's party were very much in the line of intimidation before.  I can make up my own mind and abide by my party's decision.  Do not think that anyone is talking from this side of the House because they are afraid of intimidation.  That would be entirely wrong.  We talk against this proposal because we believe it is wrong.  If the rural Deputies from the west were sitting over there today they would entirely agree with what I am saying.  I have sympathy with them because I suppose it is our party affiliations.  When the Whip is put on, you must toe the line.  If I had to toe the line I would at least stand up and speak in favour of the co-operative movement, although I might have to do what I was told afterwards.  The terrible thing about politics is that you must toe the line although it may not be what you believe. Why do they not come in and say what the co-operatives have done for the small farmers of the west and that the small farmers cannot survive without them?  If this tax is implemented there are certain small co-operatives in the west which will have a very hard job to survive.  These co-operatives were deeply in debt.  If it were not for a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance one particular co-operative would not be open today.</P>
    <P>This tax which it is proposed to put on will be felt by every member because most of the small farmers are members of the co-ops on which they depend for advice and for a certain amount of credit.  It is not on for the Minister to endeavour to imply that there is rivalry between the merchants and the co-operatives in the west because in the smaller towns and villages the vast majority of the merchants are members of the co-ops and they appreciate what the movement is doing.  I appeal to the Minister to withdraw this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>It came as a great surprise to me to learn that the Minister proposed a tax on co-operative societies.  In Kerry there are 23 co-ops.  These societies were set up <Col N="1549" /> to help the small farmers in producing, processing and marketing. They consist of five creamery co-ops, four livestock marts, five fishing co-ops, three pig fattening co-ops, one lamb fattening co-op, one horticulture co-op, one development co-op and one agriculture co-operative store.  They have a membership of about 10,000 and a turnover of about £30 million.  They are engaged in necessary and very good work on behalf of the farmers of the area but to tax them now would result in a detrimental effect on their business.  Not only will this Government go down in history as the first Administration to tax big farmers but also to have taxed small farmers because this is what they are doing when they tax the co-ops.  However, it is the type of policy that we have come to expect from this Dublin-oriented Government, a Government who have no interest in the farmers, particularly the small farmers.</P>
      <P>Throughout the country there are 14,000 people employed in the co-operative movement, 900 of whom are employed in the movement in my county but the imposition of the proposed tax could result in many of these people losing their jobs.  This would be a high price to pay especially in rural areas where employment is needed so much.  At a time when there are 116,000 people out of work we should not be risking the loss of further employment.  Apart from that aspect the taxing of co-ops would impose a severe hardship not only on small farmers but on the farming community generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that the rural Deputies in the parties who make up the Coalition have not put in an appearance in the House since we began debating this issue.  I suppose we can take this as an indication of their lack of support for the Minister's proposal but one would have thought that they would at least have been here to voice their disapproval of what he is suggesting. Even at this late stage I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the proposal.  It is a retrograde step which can only act to the detriment of the farmers.  Consequently, it cannot <Col N="1550" /> be justified in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House very long on this issue because the argument against the proposal has been made forcefully already by the other speakers from this side of the House who have indicated clearly our opposition to this proposal.  I am amazed at the Minister's approach to this debate but I suppose it is an approach that is typical of a city man on an issue affecting a rural area.  We cannot blame the people in the cities for endeavouring to get their food at the lowest possible cost but the issue in question goes much deeper than that.  Since this Government came to power they have pursued a policy of ensuring that, regardless of what harm they are doing to the national interest, everybody is to be brought within the tax net.  Their new tax code embracing wealth tax and so on resulted in many would-be investors changing their minds about setting up here.  These were people who could have made a large contribution towards reducing the unemployment figure of 116,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all right for the Government to say co-ops are making big profits. Perhaps one or two of them are, but I doubt it because if their books were gone into properly the Minister would find that the profits are ploughed back to local farmers who are benefiting from them.  In the west I have seen the tremendous contributions the co-ops have made to the standard of living of local farmers.  Fifteen or 16 years ago a local separating station was set up in my parish and I became engaged in collecting share capital&mdash; £6 per share.  The success of that venture illustrates how things have been improved by such ventures.  At that time local farmers were keeping only two or three cows each and we were asked at the time where the milk would come from to supply the separating station.  The improvement has been so great that that parish was selected as one of the first pilot areas in the country.  Farmers were encouraged to improve their farming methods, they were encouraged to use more fertilisers, and of course their milk supplies increased substantially.  I have <Col N="1551" /> attended the annual general meetings of that co-op and have seen the balance sheets.  I have never got any of that profit the Minister has been speaking about because the money made by the committee has been ploughed back to build up the industry in the parish.</P>
    <P>Many people think farmers are making huge profits.  That is the cry when things are going well, but we must remember the dire straits farmers were in in 1974 when they could not sell their cattle at any price. At that time huge numbers of in-calf cows were slaughtered in factories and the result is that today there are 560,000 fewer cattle and one million fewer sheep in the country than in 1973, creating a very serious situation. Fertiliser sales are down by 40 per cent, due no doubt to the high cost.</P>
    <P>Farming in the west must develop around the co-op movement.  Great development can be made in small areas in that way.  Farmers can be encouraged to improve their methods and consequently their standard of living.  That was the idea of Horace Plunkett when he established the movement.  Were it not for that movement large enterprises would be taking over and farmers paying far more for their fertilisers.  We know what happened a few years ago when people with money bought up vast quantities of fertiliser and later sold them at enormous profit.  This eventually led to the Minister holding an inquiry into fertiliser sales.  I do not know if a report has been issued but if it has been I have not seen it.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the co-operative movement employs 14,000 or 15,000, a substantial work force. Most of the co-ops are in rural areas where there are not any other industries. Their activities involve mainly agricultural transactions and an industry which employs such numbers of people deserves the support of this House.  Even at this late stage, I join with other Deputies in appealing to the Minister to think again about this tax provision before it reaches the Statute Book.  I have no doubt it will be proved that what we <Col N="1552" /> have been saying is right.  For the good of the country, of agriculture and of the co-op movement, the Minister should drop this penal tax measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is probably one of the most important to take place in the Dáil for a considerable time.  There is no doubt that the implementation of the Minister's proposals in regard to taxing the co-ops will spell the death-knell of small farmers.  In his glib way, the Minister accused us of playing politics, of shedding crocodile tears for the farming community, but the Minister himself is obviously playing politics when he goes about this type of taxation. He knows that in his constituency, particularly because of the type of propaganda he has been issuing, these measures will please a lot of people.</P>
      <P>Sixty per cent of the employment given in this country is directly or indirectly from agriculture.  Surely our main aim at least is to keep those people we have employed in employment and not, through the imposition of taxation such as that envisaged on co-operatives, put very many people out of work.  When that is taken in conjunction with the fact that in some cases it is costing us now £60,000 to create one job, the Minister for Finance or any Government must see the writing on the wall if these madcap taxation policies of the Government are to continue.</P>
      <P>In most countries in Europe co-operatives are exempt from taxation. Even in England, an industrialised country, there is recognition of the fact that co-operatives are different, because the Revenue Commissioners see that co-operatives in the main act on behalf of the less well-off members of the community.  I believe the difference in England is something in the region of 20 per cent.  Therefore even in an industrialised country such as England there is recognition of the fact that co-operatives are different and distinctive.  They do have distinctive characteristics of which the Minister seems totally unaware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, they have open membership. That means that any person <Col N="1553" /> who can be reasonably serviced can become a member of a co-operative. They have limited shareholding.  In other words, an individual's shareholding in any co-operative is limited by law to not more than £1,000.  They have par value on shares; shares are available or transferable only at par. There is no opportunity for capital gains or appreciation on the transfer of shares in co-operatives.  One of the most fundamental of all rights is: one man, one vote.  The fact that voting is conducted on the basis of one man, one vote, is indicative of the recognition by the co-operatives that the smaller man should have the same right as the bigger man.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for us in rural Ireland to come to any sound conclusions about why this tax is being imposed.  If the Minister is listening to his colleagues, certainly if he is listening to my two colleagues in west Cork, Deputy John L. O'Sullivan and Deputy Michael Pat Murphy, he must realise that every farmer is absolutely united on this issue, that they have told Coalition Deputies in no uncertain fashion what will be their attitude at the next election if the Minister does not rescind this stupid imposition of tax on co-operatives.</P>
    <P>I see something far more insidious in the taxation of co-operatives.  We have been subjected over the past 12 months, perhaps two years, since this Government with their strong metropolitan bias came into office, to utterances of the desirability of taxation on farmers.  A lot of current affairs programmes on television are very pointedly slanted inferring that the urban dweller is being discriminated against in favour of the small farmer.  Let us not mince words.  The whole reason for the introduction of tax on co-operatives is the ultimate taxation of each individual farmer, regardless of his valuation, because why else would the Minister set up all of this machinery, as he says himself, not for the collection of a mere £1,250,000 but for something more far-reaching than that&mdash;the ultimate direct taxation of each individual farmer.</P>
    <P>Of course the books of all co-operatives <Col N="1554" /> would be readily available to the Revenue Commissioners.  They could see what every farmer is supplying in the way of milk and other produce. Each mart would have to open its books, show what each farmer was selling and what he was getting there for the sale of each beast.  Let us say out straight that this is the prelude to the direct taxation of farmers regardless of their valuation.  This is what we predicted not so long ago when the Minister introduced taxation on the so-called &ldquo;big&rdquo; farmers.  If he examines the situation again he must realise that, if we continue to pay grants to farmers for the erection of buildings, for the reclamation of their land and for other desirable purposes farmers are a different body and are in need of assistance.  The very payment of those grants is an admission that they are in need of assistance. Surely we are not going to have a situation in which we pay out on the one hand and take it back with the other?  The only people to gain out of that would be the bureaucrats because that is a most inefficient way of looking after the State's business.</P>
    <P>We must point out also the dangers of the imminent closure of a lot of co-operatives if the Minister's taxation proposal goes ahead.  None of us wants to go back to the day when we had the tangler, when farmers had to take their cattle to the fair, perhaps wait all day until some ring agreed to pay them the minimum price.  If a farmer was not prepared to accept that minimum price, then he had to take his beast home again.  Surely we are not going to sound the death knell of the marts again, a service that has been so important and vital to our farmers, especially the smaller ones, ensuring that they got a proper price for their produce?  Let us not have any doubts about it&mdash;if co-operatives are to go <i>per se,</i> then the marts will be in serious danger as well.</P>
    <P>We shall be doing a great disservice to the whole of our agricultural community if we do not do something to rescind these penal taxes.  Of course the Government have denied that the extraction of these moneys from co-operatives <Col N="1555" /> will retard their development. I suppose it is only natural they would say that.  However there is no doubt but that, along with the imposition of VAT, it will retard their development.  It will cost the average farmer something in the region of 2p per gallon for his milk if the Government's proposals go ahead.  That means that a small farmer with ten cows will be paying something in the region of £160 a year extra, or £3 a week.  Even the Minister for Finance, living in his ivory tower in the middle of Dublin, must be aware of the fact that there are a lot of co-operatives in very serious trouble, that in two of the larger ones the banks have their representatives looking after their interests.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise also that the food industry is one of the most important as far as our country is concerned.  Surely it is in that industry we hope to create most employment by way of food processing? Surely the imposition of this tax is a threat to the economic recovery we were all hoping for and that the Minister was predicting a few days ago?  I do not think in the history of this country we have seen the economic fibre of it so seriously affected.  People engaged in both industry and agriculture have had to suffer severe reverses.</P>
    <P>There have never been so many unemployed. Where is all the money that we are borrowing going?  Foreign borrowing over the past three years has been ten times greater than all the foreign borrowing of all previous Governments.  Where is all that money going?  Why do the Government feel it necessary to impose taxes on the small farmers?  I am not surprised that private investment in the country is ceasing.  I hate to predict gloom, but surely as a result of those policies unemployment must rise and instead of having 130,000 or 140,000 unemployed we will approach the 200,000 unemployed.</P>
    <P>Surely the industry we should be able to depend on is the food processing industry to help in our economic recovery and create more jobs.  We <Col N="1556" /> realise that this industry is in the development stage and that a lot of our food processing is only very partial.  We look forward to the day when we will do all our food processing.  Surely that industry must be hit on the head by the imposition of this tax?  I would have thought that instead of imposing taxation on this most vital industry we should be doing everything in our power to help it.  Politics is politics and the Minister sees far more votes from urban dwellers than he does from the farming community so he will go ahead regardless of what is said in the House in relation to the plight of farmers and impose this tax.  I warn him that the time is not very far off when because of his policies we will have a very serious economic crisis in the country.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to listen to his backbenchers who are as aware of the position as we are and take note of what we are telling him.  Before the Coalition Government came into power they promised open Government; they promised consultation with the people. Will they prove that the promises they made at that time were true by consulting with the people, the farmers, the co-operatives and their own back-benchers who will tell them the injustices being perpetrated on the co-operative movement in the name of equity?  This is a crippling imposition of tax and will cause very serious troubles throughout the length and breadth of rural Ireland.  When the co-operatives have been put out of business by the Government what alternatives are there for the small farmers? What kind of businesses will they have to deal with then?  Will they have any say in how their produce is sold and marketed?  As far as I can see the only aim of the Government is to sink the small farmers of rural Ireland further and further down into the economic quagmire that is being created by the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons and other speakers have already pointed out to the Minister the complete fallacy in his insinuation of equity and tax.  There is no comparison and there are no people in rural Ireland complaining about the presence of co-operatives, merchants or otherwise.  I challenge the Minister to tell us when he is replying what <Col N="1557" /> co-operatives have written to him telling him that they agree with the taxes announced by him.  He stated last night that he had correspondence from co-operatives who told him they were in agreement with the imposition of this tax.  I challenge him to name the co-operatives who wrote and said that to him.  I do not believe any agricultural co-operative has written to the Minister and stated that.  When Fianna Fáil get back into Government in the not too distant future every action by the Minister in relation to the taxation of co-operatives will be repealed by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Unlike his statement last night there was unanimity in the Fianna Fáil Party room in relation to the abolition of this tax.  There was not one dissenting voice at our party meeting.</P>
    <P>I can well appreciate why the Minister for Finance would try to divert attack away from him and create a bit of a red herring.  We must nail the lie that there was any disunity in relation to the abolition of the taxation on co-operatives.  Would the Minister listen to his own back-benchers? I am sure he was just mirroring what is happening in his own party when he accused us of disunity last night.  There is disunity in his party and a great many voices speaking against this madcap taxation, which I presume is so-called socialist. I know it is just a sop to the Labour Party because they do not worry about rural Ireland.  They have very few representatives in rural Ireland.  In order for the Minister for Finance to stay as Minister he has got to make those concessions to the socialists who want agriculture out.  I ask the Minister not to pursue those taxation policies and to give the farmers of Ireland a chance.</P>

Up to now, while technically they are subject to tax, they were really not being taxed because of sales to shareholders and so on.

      <P>I think the most serious side of taxation is the taxation of farmers and I should like to make brief reference to it.  I think it should be approached in a different way and the type of tax I have in mind would be a sort of land tax.  I know that is difficult to operate and there are snags involved but I should like to see something like a tax of a few pounds per acre.  There are certain anomalies in the present tax system for the 100-plus people.  Where there is intensive farming, such as dairying you could find that the harder you work the more you pay and you could end up with a situation where farmer A in dairying would pay a lot of tax while farmer B in a tillage or similar enterprise would pay no tax and both might put the same amount of money into the bank.  That is not a fair situation.</P>

You subtract your rates from your land tax and say the land tax is £10 per acre&mdash;I know that is over-simplifying it but that is the type of thing I should like to see, a continuation of the notional system perhaps, but it would have certain advantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think farmers are as worried about this matter as we are led to believe.  They have come to realise that if widows receiving a pension of £9 or £10 a week, if they clean offices or something of that kind in the evenings, have to pay a few pounds tax a week, there is no reason why farmers should not pay their share.  I do not think there is any objection to this.  There is a certain amount of resistance however to the difficult business of keeping farm accounts and a simpler system would be welcomed.  That is why I want to put my views on record.  I am not worried about the co-operative side of <Col N="1561" /> taxation because as a member of a co-operative management committee I know what we do and the bulk of our profits&mdash;in fact all of them&mdash;come from sales of fertilisers, farm machinery, buildings and so on.  What we make on the dairy side we pay out to farmers.</P>

      <P>I am sure that if some anomalies show up between the private sector and the co-operative system, for instance in regard to the export of meat, these anomalies will be corrected. The private sector should not have any advantage over the co-operative sector.  Basically I am satisfied that, with the necessary amendment and given an opportunity to figure this out, we have not very much to fear in taxation. You are taxed if you make a profit; if you do not make a profit you do not pay tax.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hegarty is to be congratulated because he was the only Government Deputy to give his views.  I do not see any Labour Deputies offering to give their views on this taxation.  They know what the people in rural Ireland want, and what they are telling them about taxing co-operatives.  Deputy Hegarty said this was an open Government, a Government by consultation.  He said he met IFA leaders last night but he did not say what they told him.  They asked him to repeal this section but he did not carry out their wishes.  He <Col N="1564" /> listened to them, took no action and then he says in this House that he had consultation with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>But what did you do? You talked against it.</P>
      <P>The co-operative movement has given protection to the small farmer through the years, not alone in this country but in Denmark and Holland. Every farmer in those countries is a member of five or six co-operatives. The agricultural community is built around the co-operative movement, which was started by an Irishman, the late Sir Horace Plunkett.  Now this Government intend taxing the co-operatives and taking away this protection. It is no wonder the Bishop of Kerry came out so strongly against this and the Minister had the audacity to say: &ldquo;Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>He realises how important the co-operative movement is to the small farmers, particularly in that country where 88 per cent of the farmers have farms under £20 valuation; 7 per cent are between £20 and £33 valuation and 6 per cent with a valuation over £33.  It is very important to have a good co-operative movement in such an area to protect these men against bigger firms and ensure that they get reasonable prices for their cattle and agricultural products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The co-operative movement has been working well, particularly since the war years.  It has extended from the southern counties to the west and midlands.  A number of these co-operatives are having difficulty keeping afloat.  Last year in my constituency a receiver went into a co-operative. It was so important that this co-operative be kept going that the farmers rallied round and put in 10 per cent of the cheques being paid for their corn, provided the ACC, another State-sponsored body, were prepared to put up pound for pound to try to keep it afloat.  They got that money.  The economist who studied <Col N="1565" /> the business advised the farmers and the co-operative committee that if they got the extra capital, hived off a few non-paying concerns, they could reasonably expect to make £100,000 profit per annum.  Their repayments to the finance houses&mdash;the ACC and the banks&mdash;would be £60,000.  Because of the provision in this section they will have to pay the Minister £50,000. This will leave them £10,000 short to meet their commitments.  The Minister is sounding the death knell for that co-operative by this taxation.</P>
    <P>A city-based Minister does not really understand the way co-operatives, particularly the milk co-operatives in the south, work.  A large number of farmers use co-operatives to provide everything that is needed on the farm and in the house.  The milk pays for all that.  They have a settling-up day at the end of September after which they have a few pounds.  Taxing the co-operatives means that they will not be able to provide that service.  Since the Minister stated his intention to tax co-operatives a number of them are already looking for more capital.  Their bankers are telling them that they are under-capitalised. Therefore they have to look for more money from their members.  All co-operatives have been grossly under-capitalised but they were able to borrow ten times their share capital because of low taxation. A private concern would always need to have more capital than the amount of credit it could expect to get.  On account of the goodwill and the service that was given to the community by co-operatives finance houses have always accommodated them.</P>
    <P>When I was driving through Limerick some years ago it was possible to see the difference between a good co-operative and a bad one. Well manured fields meant that there was a good co-operative in the area. The Minister would not know that because he travelled to Killarney for the IMI meeting by helicopter.  If the Minister had gone down in a State car he would have seen the difference between good and bad co-operatives. <Col N="1566" /> He wanted to get a cheap dinner as well.  It will cost the Irish taxpayer £700 for his helicopter trip.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hegarty said that the farmers have never had it so good.  How could he say that at present when our cattle numbers are down by nearly half a million since 1974?  Our sheep numbers are also down.  Any farmer knows that once the number of the stock drops the writing is on the wall.  When that happens the farmer has to use his capital and his returns get smaller each year.  One co-operative has seen the danger and has started a calf scheme to increase the number of good cows in their area, but the Minister is now going to tax them and take their incentive away.  A city Minister would have no idea of the serious effect the lowering of cattle numbers has on the country.  Two very good Ministers, Deputies Gibbons and Smith, provided schemes to increase the cattle numbers in the previous ten years.  In their second year in office, through their inactivity, this Government have wiped out the cattle numbers.</P>
      <P>What was really galling was the Government's announcement in October that we had a surplus in our balance of payments.  Taxation is a serious matter for co-operatives.  Their expansion would be of national benefit. This is the act of a bankrupt Government. They are trying to get money by any means, but they are steering clear of the towns and cities.  God help the poor old farmer.  The Minister should withdraw this section from the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody on this side of the House should criticise the Minister for Finance too strongly at present because he is the best thing <Col N="1567" /> we have had going for us since Eamon de Valera.  He has been referred to by many names recently and one could be forgiven for calling him &ldquo;Revenue Richie&rdquo;.  Here is a man who has only one consideration in mind and that is to go wherever he can to get the much needed money, without any concern for the effect it will have on the national programme.  He does not have any concept of what Irish life is about and he certainly has no concept of where we should be going in the future.  Because he has no concept, and the Government of which he is a member have no concept, they can, willy-nilly, without regard for the consequences, raise the revenue from every possible angle.</P>
      <P>This is one of the extreme examples of the damage they are doing because of their lack of a national programme and concept.  Taken in conjunction with the other tax impositions we have had, such as the savage increases in petrol and motor taxation which are vitally important for many people in rural Ireland, you can see that the man must not be aware of the damage he is doing.  Certainly he can hardly be aware of the reaction to him and his Government throughout rural Ireland.  If he were, he would have some second thoughts on the proposals he is introducing.</P>
      <P>There is another element that he might not be aware of.  A Minister for Finance has a difficult task, as, I am sure, Deputy Colley will confirm, but his major responsibility must be to motivate the people to action, to create the incentive and determination to ensure that his targets will be reached.  The one responsibility he does not have is to preach to the people and point out their sins.  We have heard so much from the Minister recently in radio interviews and otherwise that what he is succeeding in doing is&mdash;I am coming to this, it is all part of this legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but if the Minister brings in this proposal as just, equitable and necessary in the context of his overall tax proposals, surely I am entitled to deal with the background to it to some extent.  What I am saying is the Minister has gone on to our national communications network in relation to this provision we are now discussing; he has chastised the Irish people and told them they are being too greedy and irresponsible, that they want everything but will pay for nothing. Whatever else they are prepared to listen to, they do not want lectures on public morality from the Minister for Finance.  They would prefer that he would give them an incentive and opportunity to do the work they really want to do, and this is where we come to the co-op tax.</P>
      <P>Here is a movement which, by its very nature and ethos, is one that is guaranteed to develop the community attitude and to foster community welfare, not just in the country, as some people seem to say, but throughout every aspect of life in Ireland.  This affects all of us whether we are farmers, workers or businessmen, and certainly it affects in my constituency the workers in the towns of Nenagh, Thurles, Roscrea and Templemore as much as it affects the farmers who seem, in the opinion of some, to be most directly involved.  We have or had a thriving and developing industry in these towns, thanks in particular to the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Jim Gibbons, who is now in the House here, and who enabled us in my own town of Nenagh to expand the co-operative movement considerably. However, the co-ops in these towns&mdash; and I am sure this is merely a reflection of what happened in other towns&mdash; for their development programmes had to borrow considerable sums to meet their programmes and particularly to borrow under term loans which involve fixed commitments over stated periods to the banks and various credit sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These co-ops were entitled to do this in the knowledge that the provision for tax exemption for co-ops would be continued, because it was part and parcel of the social and economic <Col N="1569" /> scene in Ireland.  Now they have to revise all of that because of what this Minister is doing.  In many cases in my own constituency&mdash;and I cannot name names as the Minister will appreciate&mdash; it will mean that because they are going to have to pay this extra tax imposition of 50 per cent, they will either have to turn to their suppliers and alter the price to them or impose a levy on them which would be in some cases as significant as 2p per gallon.  This may have to be done&mdash;some costings have been done in my constituency&mdash;or else some even more drastic consequences may follow.</P>
    <P>If this means that in some of these co-ops to which I am referring the farmer has to make a decision which affects the supplier, then the Minister can see the direct consequence of what he is doing.  But if it means as well that the extra employment we have got in Nenagh, Thurles, Roscrea, Tipperary, Borrisoleigh and elsewhere, which means so much at a time of rampant unemployment, is going to be put at risk, as it is being put at risk, then again the Minister and his Government will be held responsible for the consequences not just for the farmers, as people seem to say, but for those in the towns of rural Ireland.  I think my constituency is a very good example of this, because we are absolutely dependent on the welfare of the co-operative movement to maintain employment.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister would consult with his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but there is, as he is probably aware, a crisis of employment in many industries in rural Ireland.  Those that are particularly based on agriculture in this sector and especially in so far as they involve the co-operative movement with all that represents, are invaluable to the social and economic development of constituencies like North Tipperary and other parts of the country that are similar.  With employment reducing in other sectors, it is difficult to understand how the Minister for Finance can introduce legislation of this sort when we should be doing the opposite, encouraging this sector in the same way as we should be encouraging people in <Col N="1570" /> every possible way to achieve something for themselves.</P>
    <P>Our spokesman on Finance, Deputy George Colley, and our spokesman on Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Jim Gibbons, who have considerable specialist knowledge in this area, have argued in great detail the issues of the revenue and the tax effect of this and the special aspects of it.  Therefore I just want to say to the Minister finally that if my constituency is in any way representative of the effect this tax will have on the economic and social scene in Ireland, then what he is doing is drastic indeed.  I wish he and his Government, even at this stage, could turn their thoughts instead to generating employment, increasing activity, and motivating the Irish people to give the response they are capable of giving, which they have given so often in the past under a Fianna Fáil Government, instead of preaching to them, instead of criticising and castigating them and instead, above all else, of generating divisions in our community between city and country where no divisions should exist, so that all of us can recognise what areas are fundamental to our national development.  If there is a fundamental area, it surely is the co-operative movement, which has been so harshly penalised in this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest last night to the Minister's contribution on this section 32, and he taxed us at that time with being a party that conferred privileges on a certain sector in regard to taxation. We could take a certain amount of pride in being a party that conferred on the people of Ireland the privilege of being allowed to work.  The Minister should keep before him at all times, in whatever outlook he has&mdash; let it be a vision of equity in the dim and distant future&mdash;a vision of the huge army of unemployed and the stranglehold that our social welfare payments to those people has on our economy.  Taxes are higher as a result; fewer people are paying those taxes, and if the Minister pursues this towards equity, as he claims, he will reach a stage where he will have equity for everyone because the <Col N="1571" /> economy will be reduced to zero.  He can divide that by any figure he likes and give everyone the same, because everyone will be left with nothing. The Minister should do as he has been advised to do, take steps to get the economy moving.  Our spokesman on Finance has tried to impress that on him.  I think it has been lost on him, that it is a question of casting away our pearls as far as the Minister is concerned, but the Minister would be wise to take that advice for a change.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to a mistaken impression that the Minister has conveyed in a hazy fashion but that is widespread among his own party, that co-ops do not pay tax on their trading accounts.  I am informed that items not strictly relevant to agricultural production are subject to tax. Businessmen, whom the Minister threatened on me last night, are being fed this line and told that co-operatives have an unfair advantage over them.  I attended a meeting the other night at which the president of the IFA spoke.  He said he had spoken to two Fine Gael Deputies and both were under this mistaken impression.  I can well understand why Deputies on the Government benches are under this mistaken impression because they refuse to attend meetings where this whole matter is discussed and clarified. On the only occasion on which representatives of the Minister's party attended a meeting in Naas the other night one of those attending happened to be the president of the ICA.  She disowned the Minister.  She said she was against this tax.  So did a prominent Fine Gael councillor in Kildare. I noticed Deputy Hegarty was the only one on the Government benches to come in here and speak in support of this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hegarty qualified his remarks by saying it was essential they should do what they were told, so he is passing the buck, too, and the Minister is the bad little boy who tells them to do what they are told.  I am told that the effect of this particular section on the economy will be to reduce the price of milk to the primary producer by one penny a gallon at least and a previous speaker said it would possibly be two pence a gallon in some places.  I heard the chairman of a well-known mart say the effect will be, when coupled with the recent announcement to charge 45 pence at least for vets' fees, to knock £5 off the price of a bullock.  This taxation will not come from any particular group.  It will all come back to the small man, the primary producer.</P>
      <P>I have studied the debate so far and I think it is apparent that all major co-ops are in debt.  We have encouraged them to go into debt in our anxiety to get them to maximise their potential and rationalise their working.  We have encouraged them to amalgamate and to spend a great deal of money and, now when they have done that and are becoming competitive, our attitude is to tax them.  To give co-ops full credit they have answered the call and facts have already been quoted here to prove that.  The turnover of co-ops increased in the 24 years from 1950 to 1974 from £30.2 million to £743.4 million.  The co-ops have fulfilled their promise.  They have done the job they were asked to do and we are now letting them down with this proposed legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To bring home to the Minister exactly what co-ops do I would like to quote the case of a small pig co-op in my own county.  A guaranteed price was given for bonhams and that price never went below £14 even when the price was as low as £9 on the market. This helped the pig population in Kildare because it encouraged people to stay in pig production.  The attitude of the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was one which would allow the pig population to become extinct.  To enable co-ops to do that and to subsidise farmers in the lean times it is only fair they should <Col N="1573" /> be allowed to put a few pounds together when times are good.  But the Minister's proposal will not allow them to do that in future and so small co-ops, like Moorehill, will be forced out of business.  When that happens it is the small farmers who will suffer.</P>
    <P>I remember when the Minister a few years ago first proposed to compel farmers to pay income tax.  He said his proposal would bring 10,000 farmers into the tax net for the first time and he met with a very ready response from the Labour representatives from my county, who was quoted as saying: &ldquo;Good, good&rdquo;.  Now, apparently, the hope is that by making the mesh that much smaller the Minister will catch the smaller man.  That is the attitude that prevails.  It is a sad reflection that in a country where we pride ourselves on the work of Paddy the Cope in helping co-operatives to reach the stage they have the Minister who could not cope should now pull the rug from under the co-ops.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is vital to our economy. We have a very big food producing and processing industry.  It is through this industry the upsurge in our economy will come.  It is one of our primary industries and it helps us in our balance of payments.  Anything that would hinder rather than help that industry is madness.  The Minister should realise our economy is in a shambles.  What is needed is something to uplift it.  This will be a deterrent. It will not give any encouragement and the end product will be short-time working, redundancies and closures.  Is it possible to impress on him&mdash;maybe there is some merit in this proposal; the Minister seems to see some merit in it&mdash;that now is not the time to do what he proposes.  This section is the child of an urban, metropolitan Cabinet and that Cabinet's way of thinking.  They seem to be spurred on by a desire for equity.  They should remember that we have a situation in which so few are paying income tax to keep so many others.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned businessmen. He is on the side of the businessmen in this legislation.  He waved them at us as if they were something <Col N="1574" /> that might frighten us.  I am prepared to meet businessmen in Kildare, or anywhere else, and explain to them my stand on this particular matter and tell them that it is my belief that this legislation will bring down the standard of living for everybody.  The Minister should remember that farmers are businessmen too and any businessman will endeavour to buy wholesale and sell retail.  If he reaches a stage where he buys retail and sells wholesale he is out of business.  The co-ops have endeavoured to give the farmer the right to be the master of his own destiny.</P>
    <P>Our co-ops are still in the early developing stage.  Our agriculture is only developing.  We have had only 50 years, less than that really, since the war to give our agriculture an opportunity of patching up on the neglect of centuries.  Remembering what we have done we can take our place in competition with farmers in Denmark, Holland and elsewhere, and that is a tribute to the work of our farmers and particularly to the work of our co-ops.  It has been pointed out to the Minister that they are under-capitalised and underdeveloped.  They have huge borrowings.  This proposal will drive them to the wall.</P>
    <P>We need to encourage farming.  We should take advantage of the markets in the EEC about which Deputy Hegarty spoke if we are going to be competitive.  No business would be expected to put up with the impositions the Minister proposes.  A large percentage of the retail grocery trade has passed out of Irish hands and if legislation like this is passed and implemented the supply of the farming needs could also pass out of Irish hands too.  If co-ops get the hammer that could well be the evolution.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that we are responsible for all the adverse propaganda and that we are the people who called the farmers out of their fields too early to attend meetings.  I can assure him I had no hand, act or part and neither had my party in calling meetings in Kildare, but we were called to meetings by the IFA.  I must confess I was not very <i>au fait</i><Col N="1575" /> with this proposal until I listened to the IFA and other representatives of farming organisations who illustrated clearly to us how foolish the Minister was in persisting in this.  Only last Monday night I attended a meeting in Naas, a meeting attended by 600 farmers whose political way of thinking would not answer the call of the party I represent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Breslin</b> asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will provide a grant to assist the Ceimicí Teoranta factory at Carndonagh, County Donegal, to reestablish their crab meat processing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Ceimicí Teoranta processed crabs at their factory in Carndonagh on a trial basis in 1972 but the project for a crab meat processing <Col N="1578" /> industry was not proceeded with because it constituted a threat to crab supplies for an existing factory and existing employment elsewhere.  I explained the position to the late Deputy Cunningham in reply to a question on 18th December, 1975, and said I would have the matter looked into again but unless there were new circumstances which would remove the threat to existing employment I considered it unlikely that I would reverse the decision that Ceimicí Teoranta should not establish a crab meat processing industry at Carndonagh.  Since December, 1975, the position in this matter has not changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that the main purpose of a factory of this kind is to assist local fishermen?  There have been many benefits with regard to extending the fishing season.  Will the Minister not agree that the other crab factories he mentioned are quite a distance from Carndonagh?  Surely it should be possible to have grants made available to make this industry here viable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the employment currently being given in crab processing is not in Carndonagh. However, I do not think it would be prudent to use public moneys to give people jobs in one place at the cost of jobs elsewhere.  If it were simply a matter of establishing new jobs without threat to existing jobs and if such representations had not been sharply made to us, then, of course, we would support Carndonagh.  However, where this representation has been made and where my advice is that the threat is a real one, there is little benefit in substituting one job for another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the jobs provided in this instance would not be factory jobs?  It would be extra remuneration for fishermen.  In that way it would benefit the area generally rather than the extra jobs that would be provided in the factory itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If that were so the Deputy would have a case, but my advice is that this is not so.  I am <Col N="1579" /> informed there is a market for the produce of the fishermen but it is not a market on the spot.  There would not be an increase in the available resource, namely, the catchable crab, or an increase in the number of people working in the industry if there were an extra factory there.  Apparently there is a sufficient market and sufficient factory area to process the crab meat elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that this crab meat processing factory was initiated by other than a State organisation, that they moved in and that the only purpose they served ultimately was to bring about a closure of what was the beginning of a small industry?  Is the Minister aware that since the closure of this plant the fishermen who were initiated into crab fishing are no longer doing this work because of the great promises made by the other factory?  That factory felt it was being injured, it does not give a damn and the fishermen in Donegal are left as they were.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of the serious situation that exists in Glenamaddy because of overcrowding?  Is he aware that unless an additional classroom is provided before the beginning of the new school year it will not be possible for the vocational school to co-operate with the local secondary school in the provision of courses in woodwork, drawing and construction, something which would be a serious setback to the students from the secondary school?</P>

Perhaps more important still, in view of the public accountability involved, is the degree to which they liaise with the Department and keep the Department informed as to how public money is being spent.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is concerned lest security be endangered by the practice of auctioning worn Garda uniforms, let me explain that caps, buttons and insignia are not sold and that the uniforms as disposed of are practically indistinguishable from several other types of uniform. Accordingly, their sale is not regarded by the Garda authorities as involving any security risk whatsoever. This was explained in an official Press release from Garda Headquarters in September, 1974.</P>
      <P>It so happens, however, that, because of selling costs, the system whereby worn uniforms are auctioned does not at present produce a net gain to the Exchequer and it has been decided to discontinue it, for the time being at any rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. The section mentioned, which provides that an employer may not withhold payment from an employee in respect of a period of absence on jury service, potentially affects all employees as well as employers, now and in the future, and it would be quite impracticable for my Department to undertake to forward <Col N="1588" /> the terms of the section to each of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is as to whether the terms of section 29 have been forwarded by my Department to all employers affected.  I said that could not be done because service of an employee potentially affects all employees as well as all employers, now and in the future, and it is quite impracticable for my Department to undertake to forward the terms of the section to each of them.  There is the further reason that everyone is presumed to know the law, and this section of the law is well-known by reason of the debate which took place. This aspect of it got a lot of publicity at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely in the circumstances the employers, while presumed to know the law, do not necessarily know it.  In those circumstances their employees may become the victims of their lack of knowledge in relation to this requirement.  Could the Minister say whether the publication of notices at Garda stations and other places of public attendance might take care of the problem?  It is an extremely important matter.  I know the Minister is aware of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important matter but the point of the question was could I notify employers concerned. I am saying it would not be practicable to do that.  I will check if the instructions sent out to people who are summoned for jury service contain any reference to this matter and if they do not I will include it in them, but speaking from recollection I think they do.  That means that the attention of jurors will be drawn to it and if they are employees they could in turn inform their employers of their obligation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, in the case referred to by the Deputy, improvement works costing £1,168 were carried out by Kerry County Council.  The net cost of the work, after deduction of the grants payable for similar works to private houses, is £389.</P>
      <P>In calculating the sale price, the local authority deducted a tenancy discount of 39 per cent from £1,920 which is the original all-in cost of the house updated to current monetary values.  A further deduction of £900 was made in lieu of the new house grants and rates remission, and £389 was added to the calculation.  This resulted in a sale price of £660 which was notified to the tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In calculating the sale price, the local authority should have deducted <Col N="1593" /> the tenancy discount from £1,920 and £389.  On this basis, the sale price should be reduced to £508.  The local authority has been notified to this effect.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to a similar question in March, 1975, the taking in charge of housing estates is a matter for the local authority concerned, in this instance Dublin County Council.  I have made inquiries from the council and I understand that the outstanding works which must be carried out by the developer before the council can take the estate in charge relate mainly to sanitary services with some works outstanding on roads and footpaths.  A number of meetings have been held with the developer's architect and builder.  At a meeting last week, agreement was reached on the outstanding sanitary services works which are to be put in hand as soon as possible.  Further meetings will be held shortly to agree on other outstanding works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the action he proposes to take to ensure that Irish beef is exported in special cuts rather than in carcase form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the employment and added value aspects, it is obviously desirable that the greatest possible proportion of our beef should be exported as cuts or in processed form.  I have advocated this on many occasions and my Department have supported the making of grants for the provision of boning and processing facilities at many of our meat factories.</P>
      <P>In recent years a proportion of our exports has been shipped in the form of vacuum packed cuts but the demand for this vac-pac beef on export markets has been developing only slowly.</P>
      <P>I might add that the Community intervention arrangements provide positive encouragement for cutting and boning carcases and the export refund system involves a higher level of refunds in the case of cuts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary noted the contents of a lecture given recently by the general manager of CBF in which he stated that the export of beef in special cuts could yield 3p per pound or approximately £20 per animal more than if the animal were sold in carcase form?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct to state that beef exported in special cuts yields about 3p per pound more than when it is exported in carcase form.  As I indicated, we are doing our best to ensure that as much beef as possible is boned before export so that not only <Col N="1599" /> will we get the best value in terms of money but that there will be the greatest employment content possible in the processing operations.  I indicated also that the demand for vac-pac beef is developing rather slowly and we must be guided by the demand for the product.  Unfortunately, this is not developing as rapidly as we had hoped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The main explanation is that the factory confined its processing operations to crabs.  Experience has taught us that it is extremely difficult for a fish processing factory to be viable if it concentrates exclusively on one species.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1600" /> the factory in question closed but there are a number of factories in operation which deal with a variety of species of fish, including crab.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prohibition of Herring Fishing by Purse Seine By-law No. 585 of 1976 was made for the purpose of conserving herring stocks.  The by-law will be enforced by the Naval Service and by officers of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell the House within what limits it is proposed to enforce this by-law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be enforced within our own exclusive limits where we have absolute authority and, in conjunction with the NEAFC, the Celtic Sea is covered as also is the Donegal Coast while in the Deputy's part of the country&mdash; Mayo and Galway&mdash;the by-law will operate also within our limits.</P>
      <P>This by-law has general approval although there may be a number of small objections to it.  A purse seine is a very large net which can be likened to a circular wall surrounding a large area of sea.  The net is very effective and can catch large quantities of fish.  Depending on specifications it can cost anywhere between £30,000 and £80,000.  So far as we are aware there is no such net being used at present here.  A small number of skippers have in mind the expenditure of a large sum of money on acquiring a net of this kind.  I made this order quite recently so they cannot come back and say that they have a net costing £80,000 which they cannot use.  There is no such net in operation at present and the conservation of our herring stocks, which is so important, compels us to ensure that no seine net is fished around our coasts in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain areas such as the Celtic Sea that is so, but outside our limits we have no <Col N="1602" /> authority to exclude fishermen from using this net.  We have agreement with the NEAFC in so far as the Celtic Sea is concerned.  This kind of net is banned throughout that area. Discussions on this question are continuing and possibly we will get wider acceptance by the fishermen and by our partners in the NEAFC in regard to this ban which is essential if our herring stocks are to be conserved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

There is no reason to believe that the degree of delay caused by our checkpoint would be significantly different from that of the British checkpoint.  In fact, the position is that the Flagstaff Road, which involves a fairly small deviation, is available to people who prefer to pass through an Irish rather than <Col N="1607" /> a British checkpoint.  The arrangements we have made in the area are designed to secure maximum security and to minimise inconvenience.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that people in the Omeath area are convinced that this checkpoint is simply retained as a deliberate provocation, that as Deputy Farrell has stated it is possible, without any difficulty, to go on to the Newry to Dundalk road, to Ballymascanlon, turn off to Omeath, ande reach Omeath, without having any checkpoint on that road?</P>

      <P>I am not aware that people so regard it.  On the contrary, the presence of these checkpoints is, I think, regarded by many people as a reassurance while also being a very net inconvenience to people because of delays that are involved passing through them.  But I think the general view&mdash;and certainly the security view&mdash; is that the presence of checkpoints, whatever inconvenience they may cause, are of net benefit to the preservation of life on both sides of the Border.</P>

      <P>I have informed the Minister as to what is the general opinion, whatever the security forces may think of it.  Is the Minister aware that the fact that his checkpoint is there and the slowness with which traffic is allowed to proceed through it have damaged the tourist potential in the Omeath area to such an extent that it is almost non-existent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The damage to tourism in Border areas derives from a more fundamental cause than the presence of checkpoints.  Checkpoints are necessary because of the security situation.  We are aware of the problems caused by delay and have frequently urged that improvements be made to ensure that people can pass through more quickly.  This has been a problem at several points along the Border where checkpoints have been operated.  We have sought to ensure adequate provision to speed up the process of people passing through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business this morning Deputy Jack Lynch, the Leader of the Opposition, asked for a statement on the disallowance of a matter for the Adjournment on the ground of lack of ministerial responsibility when the same matter had been permitted to be raised by way of parliamentary question.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Lynch for the opportunity he has given the Chair to clarify this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as parliamentary questions are concerned, the Standing Order is specific to the effect that questions to a Member of the Government must relate to public affairs connected with his Department or to matters of administration for which he is officially responsible.  In interpreting this Standing Order the Chair has always taken the view that questions should not be disallowed unless (1) they are quite clearly outside the scope of the functions of any Department or (2) they relate to matters for which Ministers in the past have refused to accept official responsibility.  Under this latter heading a whole series of precedents, going back many years, has been established in relation to State-sponsored bodies set up under Statute. <Col N="1612" /> In the case of a large number of these, for example, CIE, Aer Lingus, the Arts Council, Bord Fáilte, ESB, RTE &mdash;questions relating to their day-to-day administration have been disallowed because Minister have refused to accept official responsibility.</P>
    <P>There are, however, many other State-sponsored bodies about whose general activities Ministers have supplied information in response to parliamentary questions even though they could not be held in law to have official responsibility.  The most obvious example in this category is the Land Commission.  Down through the years successive Ministers for Lands have supplied information on the acquision and division of land, a matter which is by law reserved entirely for the Land Commission.  I am sure that the House would not wish that the Chair should apply the rule relating to official responsibility so strictly that it would be denied information of a kind it had traditionally received.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to matters raised for debate on the motion for the Adjournment of the Dáil is, however, quite different.  There are, basically, five criteria for the admission of such matters and they have always been strictly applied by the Chair.  The first of those is official responsibility.  The others, as a matter of interest, are advocacy or criticism of legislation, repetition or anticipation of debate, <i>sub judice</i> and matter more suitable for a substantive motion.  The Chair examines every matter raised for the Adjournment to ensure that it is not in conflict with these criteria.  If official responsibility cannot be established, the matter is not in order.  Some examples from past rulings will highlight this point. The Social Welfare Acts provide for deciding officers and appeals officers to determine the amounts of benefit due to social welfare claimants. Parliamentary questions in this area have never been disallowed, but no matter for the Adjournment has been permitted which sought to deal with the amount of benefit awarded as it is not the official responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare to make <Col N="1613" /> the determination in any particular case.  A similar position obtains in regard to matters which are within the statutory responsibility of the Land Commission, to which I have referred, or of State-sponsored bodies in general.</P>
    <P>I trust that this statement clarifies the position for the Leader of the Opposition and for the House in general.  Perhaps I should make it clear that the procedure I have described relates only to Questions and the half hour Adjournment Debate. The House is not, of course, precluded from debating such matters as the Leader of the Opposition refers to on other occasions.  For example, a Deputy can table a substantive motion dealing with the matter in question and have it brought forward for debate.  I trust that this assists the Leader of the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The kernel of the justification of your ruling yesterday lies in your reference to matters in which Ministers have no responsibility. I do not think I have to tell you that we on this side of the House have recently been concerned with some of your rulings of this nature as being unduly restrictive of our democratic function in this House and of our public duty in having matters of this nature fully debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this question was tabled yesterday and permitted to be tabled and answered by you it was reasonable for Deputies to expect that they could raise the matters on the Adjournment without having recourse to the excuse of lack of ministerial responsibility. Much of what you have said today seems to be incompatible with one part of your statement and the other.  However, I will not make any observation on that.  I will confine my remarks to saying that the Minister has accepted full responsibility publicly here for matters affecting the contract which was under discussion here yesterday. The contract concerns the erection of <Col N="1614" /> a fertiliser plant at Marino Point, Cobh, County Cork, for which an international firm named Kellog have got the overall design and to some extent the construction contract.</P>
    <P>There are several aspects of this particular plant which are the subject of different contracts.  In respect of one of these contracts the Minister, in the course of the debate on the Second Reading of the Industrial Development (No. 2) Bill, 1975, on the 11th December last, as reported in column 1474 of the Official Report of that day in connection with another part of the contracts affecting the NET plant at Marino Point, said:</P>
    <P>The decision in regard to NET was a difficult one.  I went into the matter thoroughly and I should like to state emphatically that I take full responsibility for the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister apparently yesterday was willing to take responsibility as well but the Ceann Comhairle decided otherwise.  I referred to your statement as being incompatible, one part with the other.  May I say your reason for not allowing the question to be raised on the Adjournment seems to be incompatible with what the Minister publicly declared as his responsibility and your interpretation of his responsibility.</P>

      <P>I have tried to explain the position of the Chair in this matter as clearly as I can.  I would like to emphasise to the Leader of the Opposition and all Members of this House that in matters of this kind the Chair is following precedent built up since the establishment of this State. There is no question of the personal choice of the occupant of the Chair entering into these decisions.  I follow strictly on the lines laid down by my predecessors and the advice of the Oireachtas staff.  In this regard, in the case of the question under reference, the Minister in his answer said yesterday: &ldquo;The placing of contracts by NET is a management function and as such is for decision by the board of the company.  My consent is not required.&rdquo; The subsequent information furnished by the Minister was stated to be supplied to him by NET.  In these circumstances, <Col N="1615" /> I had to disallow the matter for the Adjournment Debate in accordance with the practice and procedure I have already described.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;32.&mdash;(1) In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;society&rsquo; means a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1971, which is an agricultural society or a fishery society within the meaning of section 220 of the Income Tax Act, 1967;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;period of account&rsquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 155 (5) of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976;</P>

    <P>&lsquo;initial allowance&rsquo; means an allowance under Chapter I.  Part XV of the Income Tax Act, 1967;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;investment allowance&rsquo; means an allowance under section 22 of the Finance Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>(2)  In the case of a trade carried on by a society no transaction on or after the 6th day of April, 1976, shall be regarded as an exempted transaction for the purpose of section 220 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a society comes within the charge to corporation tax in respect of a trade before the 6th day of April, 1976, an accounting period of the society shall end for purposes of corporation tax on the 5th day of April, 1976.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a society carrying on a trade incurred before the 6th day of April, 1976, capital expenditure on the provision of machinery or plant for the purposes of the trade and that expenditure was either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  qualifying expenditure within the meaning of section 11 of the Finance Act, 1967, or</P>
    <P>(b)  expenditure on qualifying machinery or plant within the meaning of section 26 of the Finance Act, 1971,</P>
    <P>an allowance equal to the specified amount of that capital expenditure may at the election of the society be made in taxing the trade of the society for the accounting period which commences on the 6th day of April, 1976, as if it were an allowance on account of the wear and tear of the machinery or plant in that accounting period, and where such an election is made, the amount of the capital expenditure on the provision of the machinery or plant still unallowed as at the time of any subsequent event shall for the purposes of Chapter II of Part XVI of the Income Tax Act, 1967, be deemed to be nil.</P>
    <P>(5)  For the purposes of subsection (4) the specified amount of the capital expenditure means the <Col N="1617" /> amount of that capital expenditure together with any investment allowance in respect of that expenditure after deducting from the aggregate amount thereof&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the amount, as diminished by section 220 (5) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, of any investment allowance made to the society in respect of that expenditure;</P>
    <P>(b)  the aggregate amount, as diminished by the said section 220 (5), of the wear and tear allowances and initial allowances made to the society in respect of that expenditure for all chargeable periods before the accounting period commencing on the 6th day of April, 1976;</P>
    <P>(c)  the aggregate of the amounts by which the wear and tear allowances in respect of that expenditure would have been diminished by the said section 220 (5) if the only wear and tear allowances for those chargeable periods in respect of that expenditure were the amounts which would have been made if a proper claim had been duly made by the society for each chargeable period without regard to section 11 of the Finance Act, 1967, or section 26 of the Finance Act, 1971.</P>

      <P>I had almost completed my contribution on this section before I reported progress, but I would not like to stop without complimenting the Minister on one particular quality he has, the quality one sees in an Irish terrier that of standing alone with very little support from the rest of the pack.  I can assure him that the finger of blame is pointing very much at him alone.  When this matter is discussed down the country there is no mention of Government or Cabinet responsibility.  He is the person who is disowned. Maybe, as a political animal, I should glory in this type of thing, but a sense of fair play prompts me to point it out to him; and a sense of equity, which he has mentioned as being so necessary in our present economic situation, prompts me to tell him that we should have a certain amount of equity in politics as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister blamed us for, in the words he used, &ldquo;spreading manure around the country&rdquo;.  He said that Fianna Fáil propaganda helped to call the farmers from the fields early to attend meetings.  I can assure him that this is not so.  I wish to point out that the IFA called a meeting in Naas last Monday night.  Leaflets were distributed in the marts.  The Fianna Fáil Party had nothing to do with it.  Between 600 and 700 farmers attended the meeting to hear all about this section, the tax on co-operatives.  The president of the IFA and other leading <Col N="1619" /> lights in that organisation and in the co-operative movement attended and contributed to the debate.</P>
    <P>All the local TDs in Kildare were invited to attend.  I attended but the two representatives of the National Coalition Government did not turn up. The extraordinary thing is that in their invitation they were asked that in their unavoidable absence they would appoint somebody of equal stature to represent them but they did not find anyone of comparable stature to attend on their behalf.  I am not sure if this was a directive from headquarters or if it is an unusual show of modesty from these particular people.  This is an example of the open Government which was promised to us by the National Coalition parties and, in the words of the Tánaiste, &ldquo;an entirely new Government determined to solve the problems of all our people.&rdquo;  How can you possibly solve the problems of the people if you are not prepared to listen to those problems?</P>

      <P>The Irish terrier should welcome very much that intervention by the bulldog in the background.  It appears that the National Coalition are not prepared to listen to the problems of the people.  They were afraid to face there the very people who helped to elect them three years ago. They spurned the hands that had given them No. 1 votes.  Today we heard from the other Members who contributed from the opposite benches criticism of a former Minister who did not talk to the IFA.  Now we have representatives who are afraid to talk to them at local level, afraid to hear of the problems besetting the farming community and the co-ops.  If this is the idea of a National Coalition regarding <i>detente,</i> they stand condemned of being afraid to speak to those who elected them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that occasion, the Minister might well remember, two representatives of the Fine Gael Party spoke.  One was a member of the county council.  He <Col N="1620" /> disowned the Minister and said he did not agree with the policy being pursued by the Minister.  He indicated that he was under the mistaken impression that co-ops in their trading were in direct competition with private interests and had an unfair advantage because they did not pay tax on their non-agricultural trading.  This opinion is very much abroad in the Government benches and has never been denied.</P>
    <P>Another member of the Fine Gael Party, a lady, who is National President of the ICA and a member of Kildare County Council also contributed and disassociated herself from this move by the Minister to tax co-ops. It is only fair to remind the Minister of the situation although he has probably already read the telegram sent to him on that occasion at the end of the meeting when there was a unanimous vote that three telegrams be sent&mdash;two to the two missing Deputies asking them to vote against this motion and one to the Minister to drop the legislation.  Before the business was finished a delegate from Meath who is chairman of a farming organisation wished to be heard and said that not alone did the meeting speak on behalf of the Kildare organisation but was also representative of north Leinster and south Leinster.  It was unanimously decided on his proposition that a further telegram be sent to the Taoiseach asking him to sack the Minister for Finance whom he described as &ldquo;the greatest boob of all time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This morning the Minister said he felt it was a very dangerous practice for certain people to compile dossiers on Deputies and the very words they might use could be used against them. Some of the words I use may be used against me but I am prepared to face the music and face the businessmen with whom the Minister threatened me last night.  He can be happy in the fact that when Deputies do not appear their silence can hardly be used against them; but the fact that they had not the courage to appear and make the case for the Minister at the meeting indicates that there is something very wrong with the National Coalition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> I ask the Minister to reflect on what I have said.  The silence from the Government benches on this section is deafening.  The Minister is being picked out as a stool pigeon by his own colleagues.  He decided, rather belatedly, to give a stay of execution for a year on this measure by allowing people to make certain charges against income which in fact means that they will not be taxed for a year.  I ask him to go the whole way and withdraw this section altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to the numerous voices on this side of the House protesting against this tax on co-operatives.  The situation is that there is an outcry across the country and I cannot understand why more people have not intervened in the debate from the Government side in an effort to cover for the Minister for Finance on this issue.  The Minister must be aware from the promptings he must get at parliamentary party meetings, particularly Fine Gael meetings&mdash;he will not, I suppose, get many promptings from Labour Party meetings&mdash;that this is a very unpopular political decision he is forcing through. More specifically, I want to talk of the untold harm the Minister will do to the future of the country by this imposition.  The effective postponement of more than half of this taxation for 12 months by means of the amendment the Minister is introducing is a sort of sugar coating on the pill and, as I see it, is a direct result of promptings from back-benchers in his party who have to face meetings with interested people throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended, like Deputy Power, a similar meeting in Laois where all the Minister's party representatives were present.  Whether it was compensation or otherwise the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government who was adamant in his condemnation of the Fianna Fáil Government for their hard-hearted approach to farming stood four-square behind his Minister and said it was unfair that everybody should be punching poor Deputy Ryan, that he himself was willing to take some of the punches, and that full party and <Col N="1622" /> Cabinet responsibility was involved. His two colleagues were not as forthright in their condemnation of the farming presence on that occasion and conveyed that they would, as effectively but as unobtrusively as possible, do what they could to meet the wishes of the meeting having fully accepted the arguments that tremendous harm was being done to our food industry.</P>
    <P>The points against this tax have been very effectively made by our spokesman on Finance and our spokesman on Agriculture and by Deputies on this side who have spoken from the heart on this issue. When Fianna Fáil were in Government we had to stand up to a great deal of abuse from farm organisations who felt we were doing them an injustice or not doing a sufficient amount for agriculture.  At that time every abusive word hurled at the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Government was backed by about 500 per cent by a vociferous Opposition. Now, we have the same party that cashed in solidly on complaints against the Government at that time hiding their heads obviously in shame. As Deputy Power said, there have been two speakers of a back-up group.  I heard one, Deputy Coogan, this morning and his contribution was not the greatest.  He flung the indecent remark across the floor at Deputy Gibbons that he left members of his family sitting on the steps of Government Buildings.  One thing Fianna Fáil did&mdash;and it is no harm to draw attention to it&mdash;in their time in Government is that they brought country people and city people together.</P>
    <P>Maybe one can criticise us for this but when I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture I recall city people queueing to sign and add their names to the farmers' protest.  The Minister for Finance comes here today and flings across the House that every word uttered from this side in justification of the farmers' case is a criticism of Government policy.  As I see it, they intend taxing the food industry, the only source left open to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taxed farmers by <Col N="1623" /> way of income tax.  We are not making a case against justified taxation on farmers who can afford to pay.  We are making the case against the taxation on basic raw materials which are helping to keep this country going.  I cannot speak strongly enough in my opposition to the contempt evident in the Minister's words this morning when he was talking about the people who made up the co-operative movement and the contempt which he showed last night which unfortunately resulted in one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies having to be removed from this House. This is galling.  A term I heard from my parents to describe perkiness and abuse was&mdash; a cocksparrow.  The Minister for Finance is the Coalition Government's cocksparrow.  If there was anybody who could less ill-afford to project himself in that way it is the present Minister.</P>
    <P>I know it is wrong to talk about personalities in the House.  I listened to the Minister this morning doing his damnedest to create a civil war between the city and country people. We have had enough of that.  That is why I used the example I gave a few minutes ago.  I do not say it is any credit to the Fianna Fáil Government, but we brought the city man very close to his country cousin.  Now we have the contemptible conduct of this Government.  In an effort to scrape the bottom of the economic pot&mdash; where the Minister for Finance is at present squatting&mdash;to get a miserable £2 or £3 million, he is willing to take a chance on killing the future of Irish agriculture and the food processing industry.</P>
    <P>If I were to go into the necessary detail about this subject, I could go on at very great length.  However, if I did that I would spoil my case.  I could travel many different roads criticising what the Government are doing through the Minister for Finance.  I fully accept the assurance of Deputy Flanagan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, not to blame &ldquo;poor Richie Ryan&rdquo; because this was full Government responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1624" /> We know the Labour Party are fully behind this but there must be many people on the Fine Gael benches who are reneging on their heritage when they come in here to impose this tax on a section of the farming community which is not and should not be liable to taxation.  There is no reason why any spokesman from the Government side should convey the impression that as far as the Dublin Corporation worker or any other worker in Dublin is concerned, he has a justifiable grouse if a ten or 15-acre farmer is not taxed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided to make a very brief contribution on this section lest somebody might think that none of the four Deputies from Wexford county was prepared to add his voice to that of our front bench spokesman on Finance and other speakers. I am sure my colleague, Deputy Allen, will have a few words to say on this.</P>
      <P>I come from a constituency that has a number of excellent agricultural co-ops and two or three very good fishery co-ops which have made a tremendous difference to the people who live by the sea in the southern part of Wexford county.  Like my colleague, I can report that there is an outcry from farmers in County Wexford against the Minister's proposal to withdraw a concession which agricultural and fishery co-ops have had for a number of years.  I do not speak for so-called co-ops.  We have very big co-ops in Wexford and Enniscorthy towns but they are not the ones I have in mind.  I am thinking of the Shelbourne Co-op in Campile.  If the Minister suggests that that is a &ldquo;so-called co-op&rdquo;, I suggest that he go down and say that in that area of New Ross.  That co-op has brought about the greatest change that could be brought about in a typical rural area because it gives employment to about 250 to 300 people.  It is supporting the families of a huge rural area in County Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another co-op in Bunclody. Deputy J. Gibbons's constituency.  The Minister might regard this as a &ldquo;so-called co-op&rdquo; and put somebody on this side out of the House for trying to get him to withdraw that unfortunate <Col N="1625" /> remark.  I think he will agree today that it was an unfortunate remark even for the present Minister for Finance.  I remember Bunclody, a beautiful village about which poems have been written&mdash;the Slaney flows through it; it has delightful trees and streets.  Nine or ten years ago the employment in that village was 15 or 20 people in local firms and a few men were employed by the agricultural community.  The rest had to seek employment in Dublin or across the water in Birmingham, Liverpool, London or wherever they could find it.  The Bunclody co-op was established.  Thanks to a group of small local farmers, this is now one of the most thriving businesses in the country.  That co-op is giving employment to between 80 and 100 people.  It is supporting something like 100 families in that area of North Wexford.</P>
    <P>That is the reason we demand the withdrawal of this section by the Minister.  He has dithered, changed his mind and gone from one idea to another; but still he comes up with a section that will impose a certain amount of taxation on these agricultural and fishery co-ops in the years ahead.  There may be a break for one year; I do not know whether there is or not.  It is very difficult to understand what this legislation really means or how the Revenue Commissioners will operate it.</P>
    <P>The reason we oppose this legislation so strongly is that these co-operatives give tremendous employment at a time when there are 120,000 people unemployed and when school-leavers cannot get a job of any kind.  If the co-operatives are given the concessions they were given in the past they will be able to provide much more employment in the future.  I believe there is a great future for agricultural and fishery co-operatives if the Minister keeps his greedy hands off them.</P>
    <P>During the past week a group of farmers came to see me.  They were mostly small farmers who would not be liable for tax, despite what the Minister or the people of this city might think.  They told me that there was an outcry amongst the farming <Col N="1626" /> community against this section and the withdrawal of the concession. They had also been with the other Deputy for the county, Deputy Allen, and we explained what we were trying to do.  They assured me that they had approached the Fine Gael Deputy for the constituency and that he favoured their case but that he found it impossible to get anywhere with the Minister and the Cabinet. Judging by the manner in which they have deserted him in this House I have a feeling that most of the Minister's backbenchers from rural Ireland are opposed to this legislation. They have not got the guts to say it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to withdraw this new section rather than to postpone the taxation for one year. I appeal to the Minister to withdraw it in the interests of rural Ireland where employment is so urgently needed and in the interests of the farming community who depend so much on agricultural co-operatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is completely out of touch with rural Ireland.  It is obvious from the proposed legislation that the Minister wants to get at the small farmers. Deputy Colley said that over 70 per cent of the suppliers were small suppliers. To be more specific, the figures for my own territory in north Cork, which is our primary dairy industry centre, show that 72 per cent of the suppliers to Mitchelstown Co-operative have under 23 cows.  The average number of cows per supplier in Ballyclough is 24.  These suppliers could hardly be regarded as being in the big farmer category.  These are the people who form the membership of co-operative societies in the best dairy districts.  When you take these figures into account they show clearly that co-operative societies are the business of the small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years these societies have been developing and expanding to the advantage of their suppliers and the economy generally.  A figure of 14,000 has been mentioned as being the number engaged in employment in co-operatives. In Mallow town alone the Ballyclough Co-operative Society employ <Col N="1627" /> on average 910 people.  That is a fair contribution to the national economy.  It is a sizeable figure when compared with the 800 unemployed people in Mallow at present.  A factory in Mallow, which is a subsidiary of Ballyclough Co-operative, has laid of half its employees.  I say this to stress the part which co-operative societies play in the development of our economy.</P>
    <P>To say that the Minister is out of touch is an understatement.  To say that their profits should be taxed is wrong.  The surpluses which the co-operatives accumulated made their expansion possible, an expansion which produced employment and contributed to the dairy industry as a whole.  You can talk about gas and oil, but our basic resource is agriculture. The Minister has succeeded in extinguishing almost every type of enterprise.  There is high unemployment in every town in Ireland.  The Minister has decided to have a go at the one industry on which we can bank.  There is very little left for him to do.  I would ask the Minister, even at this late juncture, to leave the dairy industry alone.</P>
    <P>Since my childhood I have understood that the co-operative movement was the answer to our problems.  I remember the formation of the Castlelyons Co-operative Creamery in the thirties.  This was a difficult time for farming because credit facilities were tight.  The society was formed by the farmers in the area.  It provided a service enabling them to get reasonable credit facilities and that helped them to progress.  They were able to buy their fertilisers, their animal feeding stuffs and have a little time in which to pay.  I remember as an employee of the Beet Growers Association forming co-operative farming groups.  The small farmers were formed into groups.  I refer to those small farmers growing five or six acres of beet who could not themselves afford the big machinery needed to make the industry a viable proposition.  Were it not for that co-operative movement in the 1950s the beet industry, about which some <Col N="1628" /> Government Deputies groan, would scarcely be in existence today.  Co-operation was the keynote.  Resources were pooled and machines were shared.  In that way these co-operative groups were able to avail of the most modern and efficient equipment.</P>
    <P>The Minister is after the small farmers now, the people who are the backbone of the country.  It is a shame that a Minister who has no real rural experience should introduce legislation of this kind.  It is all very well to tax profits.  I know one co-operative which has a trading profit this year of about £1½ million but it is in dire financial trouble.  How will the Minister sort out that situation? Rather than restricting agriculture we should be giving it every kind of support.  At every meeting I have attended I have emphasised that the well-being of the farmer, of the agricultural community, is the well-being of the community as a whole.  I have pointed this out in both urban and rural areas and the people know that this is true.  If one were to take Ballyclough creamery, the chocolate factory and Cow and Gate out of Mallow what would one have left?  Take out the sugar factory as well.  The whole townland is based on agriculture and the well-being of agriculture.  So is Mitchelstown, which manufactures cheese, and the Galtee tinned milk factory.  These are all based on what the farmer produces.  I would hate to see the farmer in the position of the business man at the moment who asks himself what is the point in working harder when Richie will be at the back door with both hands open to take whatever he makes away from him.  This is the policy that has the economy in the position it is in today.</P>
    <P>I never thought a Minister for Finance would stoop so low as to strike at our basic industry, but that is exactly what he is doing.  I would appeal to him to think again.  He may, with his city mentality, smirk at my appeal.  He has smirked at most of the proposals coming from Cork.  We have looked for concessions from time to time from the Minister but all the <Col N="1629" /> has done is to smirk and treat our proposals with arrogance.  Now the farmers are being treated in the same way.  Deputies on the opposite benches representing rural constituencies should have the courage to stand up like men and be counted.  I am a townsman but I have some agricultural connections.  I am opposed to this legislation.  I am opposed to it on behalf of the milk suppliers.  I know from personal experience that farmers regard this as national sabotage.  This Government have closed down a great number of industries. This Government are thousands of millions in debate to foreign interests. All that we have is mess and in a short time we will have to take over once again and clean up the mess. I am sure the by-elections in Dublin and Donegal will point the way.  We cleaned up the mess before and we will do it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night we heard the Minister, with the venom to which we have become accustomed, lash out at this party because of our opposition to this proposal.  He said our arguments were political and that we had no real interest in co-operatives and the work they are doing.  I would like now to quote from a document produced by Muintir na Tíre.  It is an article on community development and the goals of regional development:</P>
      <P>Muintir believes that the essential objective of all plans for economic development ought to be to help people to help themselves or, in other words, to help people to identify their social, economic, cultural and recreational needs, to exploit the organisation of their local resources, human, physical, financial to maximum capacity and to facilitate the integration of local community and voluntary effort with the national and regional plans for development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These ideals are fully exemplified in the workings of co-operatives.  More than any other organisation these co-operatives have helped to build up a spirit in rural Ireland and assist the general advancement of the economy. The Minister has tried to divide town and country.  Co-operatives are a union <Col N="1630" /> of rural people getting together to help themselves and to provide better services for themselves, thereby helping their fellowmen and women in both town and country.  These are the ideals about which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  Deputy Kelly, has been talking during the past few months all around the country.  He has been encouraging this type of activity.</P>
    <P>The Minister accused us of playing politics.  We, in Fianna Fáil, recognise and have always recognised the value of co-operatives.  We gave management grants to Gaeltacht co-operatives and to fishery co-operatives.  Through the county development teams we gave grants to agricultural co-operatives to help them to employ fully qualified personnel to manage the co-operatives in a businesslike fashion.  That is the practical way in which Fianna Fáil recognised the value of co-operatives and it is most unfair, therefore, of the Minister to come in here now and accuse us of playing politics in this matter.</P>
    <P>Many rural organisations have been involved in the formation of co-operatives: Macra na Feirme, Macra na Tuaithe, Muintir na Tíre and local development groups of all kinds.  If the Minister had any experience of the country and had any recognition of services, he would know that no group have done so much by way of voluntary effort in order to get these co-operatives moving.  It is not easy for a person to go around among farmers, business people or others collecting share capital, and it is very often hard to get people to contribute or see that what is being done is in their own interests.  Now the Minister by introducing this tax is going to kill all this spirit.  People will feel there is no use trying to promote projects themselves or to promote the economy; they will feel they are doing it in order to give more to the tax man.</P>
    <P>The co-operatives have provided a wonderful service for people.  Let me refer for a moment to the fishing co-operatives which have been successful in arranging better marketing facilities for members.  They provide gear for <Col N="1631" /> new members who are starting off and who find it hard to face all the costs involved in getting a fishing boat going.  They have organised transport for members to market their produce and they have, through being competitive with other business people, arranged to get better terms in the purchase of gear and other equipment necessary for the industry.  Here again we find the Minister breaking the spirit of the people who are anxious to help themselves.</P>
    <P>In the west our farmers have the lowest income in the whole country, and were it not for the fact that a number of co-operatives were started a few years ago to help our small farmers, particularly in milk production, the position would be very much worse.  Now, thanks to the co-operative movement, a number of these people are enjoying a much better standard of living and see a future for themselves in their little holdings.</P>
    <P>In a speech last night the Minister implied that co-op workers were not paying tax.  I do not know why he tries to come across with this kind of argument.  He mentioned typists and other people working in Dublin. Typists or other employees working for co-operatives are liable to tax just the same as the city person.  I cannot understand the reasoning in the Minister's argument, except again that he is trying to drive this wedge between rural and urban dwellers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not give the location of the typists or the industrial workers at all.  Of course the position is precisely the same no matter what part of the country they work in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister cannot compare a co-operative with a limited company, with a business where people who have money invest that money in order to gain profit from their investment.  In the case of a co-operative, people get together not for the sake of making an investment as we ordinarily understand it but to provide a service for themselves. I happen to be a member of three co-operatives and I do not expect to collect any dividend, and I <Col N="1632" /> did not take my shares in these co-operatives hoping I might collect any dividend.  Any profits that are made are used to expand the business of the co-operatives, as has been said already, and in this way modernise and generate more employment.</P>
      <P>The Minister should bear in mind that this argument of city versus country is one that can backfire on himself.  Most of the city dwellers are not that far removed from the country and they will realise that he is the one who is playing the political game in this matter.  However, we have to realise, I suppose, that his handling of our financial affairs has been so bad that he has no choice but to scratch everywhere he can in order to get more finance to run the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister should seriously consider the section, because our major industry, agriculture, is the one that is going to feel the pinch more than any other.  I would join with my colleagues on this side of the House in asking the Minister to reconsider this matter, not in the interest of the co-operatives alone but in the interest of the whole economy and particularly of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my few words to what has been said about the appalling situation which the Minister has now created.  It is no harm to advert for a few moments to the last general election when we were presented with a 14-point plan.  The only point that comes to mind concerning rural Ireland that has been implemented was that in relation to the abolition of death duties.  Death duties have been abolished, but you now find yourself in the situation where you will pay all your taxes before you die so that whoever comes after you will not have to pay anything. We now have many new forms of taxation about which the people in rural Ireland were told nothing at the last general election.  We were certainly given a glossy 14-point plan, but most of it has not been implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do the Minister and his colleagues in the back benches, many of whom have not been in for this debate, <Col N="1633" /> realise the part played by the farming community in the economy down through the years?  I am convinced that neither the Minister nor the Revenue Commissioners realise the contribution such people have made to the economy.  Certainly the Minister has not seen the light yet in regard to the economic drive that has been made by the farming community.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister been doing for the past three years?  He has killed any incentive the farming community has had, and he is now dotting the i's and crossing the t's for the implementation of a tax on co-ops which will seriously affect the farming community. The Minister baffles me at times and he also baffles the ordinary members of the co-operatives down the country.  Last night here he accused the co-operative movement at large of robbing the countryside.  In my own county there is a fish co-operative at Kilmore Quay which was set up to improve the livelihood of the fishermen in that area.  They set up a processing factory and they provide gear and facilities for young fishermen.  In the same village there is another fish factory that has gone bankrupt.  As the Minister knows, because of the increased oil prices the fishing industry is on the road to ruin and the Minister has aggravated the situation by this new measure.</P>
    <P>It is about time he saw the light and listened to common sense.  Not one member of the Government side, including the Minister, has shown any sense in his contribution.  Even at this late stage I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter quickly.  He is totally biased against the farming community and the fishing industry. He should spell out quite clearly where he stands.  He chickened out last night and a Member on this side of the House was put out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the job of any Government to unite the people in the country.  The behaviour of the Minister and some of the spokesmen on the Government benches has been appalling.  They have been trying to drive a wedge between the people in the urban and rural areas.  The only <Col N="1634" /> unity that seems to prevail is the combined aim of the Ministers huddled around the Cabinet table to hold on to their Mercedes and Peugeots at any cost despite the damage they are doing.  They have destroyed incentive for private industry and the workers and they are now trying to destroy incentive for the farming and fishing co-operatives.</P>
      <P>They say that this measure is being introduced to have equal taxation across the board.  They maintain that the young typist in the city is being taxed while the co-operatives get off scot-free but this is unfair.  It is immoral for the Minister to suggest such a thing.  It is a downright lie and the Minister knows it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw the phrase.  It is improper for the Minister to suggest such a thing.  He is part of the Labour-Fine Gael Coalition. In the late sixties when the Labour Party were proclaiming the seventies as the era of the new Republic they put forward a manifesto on agriculture. One of the main items was that co-operatives were to be encouraged at all times.  What Labour speaker has asked the Minister to assist the co-operatives, as was set out in their declared party policy?</P>
      <P>It is obvious that this taxation will prove to be a disincentive and it will increase the cost of living across the board.  The producers will get less or the people who buy the produce will have to pay more.  Because of this measure, the situation cannot remain as it is.  In my constituency there is the glasshouse industry.  It is suffering because of the increased oil prices and because of unfair competition from our European partners who are sub-sidised by their national Governments. Our Government will not help the industry here and now they are imposing additional taxation.  The same situation applies to the fishing industry and to agricultural co-operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not come forward with ideas that would give some incentive to workers and that would help <Col N="1635" /> to get the economy going.  Even at this late stage I would appeal to the Minister not to go forward with this mad suggestion of taxing co-operatives.</P>

      <P>I have never seen such a display of interest on the part of Fianna Fáil in Opposition on any matter.  Matters of far greater moment to our people have never evoked so many individual speeches.  I must say I found it quite refreshing to hear so many Members make, so far as I am concerned, their first contribution to any financial debate in this House.  I suppose that in itself was quite exhilarating and worth while.  However, there was a careful avoidance of the real facts, of the small charge that is to be made on a business that has a turnover almost comparable to the turnover of private companies.  If the latter have a turnover of about £950 million they will pay tax.  We are now being chastised because another form <Col N="1636" /> of legitimate business is being asked to pay a small contribution towards the total tax burden.</P>
      <P>Any foreigner observing this debate would be astonished that there should be such a song and dance and demonstration when a request is made for a small contribution from such a tremendous amount of business.  No attempt was made by the Opposition to justify unfair competition, and there is a great deal of unfair competition where many traders find that their legitimate business is being competed against by organisations which are free of tax while they are subject to tax.  I do not think that is fair and the change we are making will go some way towards correcting it.</P>
      <P>I have received quite a number of letters, but they are from individuals &mdash;I would not be free to disclose their names without their authority&mdash;since we brought in the amendment which will mean that the tax will not require any effective payment until October, 1977, and the tenure of those letters is to complain bitterly that, having made what they regarded as a courageous and correct decision to subject agricultural and fishery co-ops to taxation, the Government should delay the implementation of it.  They say that they now find themselves in a situation where having been lead to believe that the unfair competition was going to cease they now realise it will last for some time longer.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the change, as I explained, is to facilitate those co-operatives with transitional problems related to the very high borrowing they made in the past and to the non-existence of a charge to tax. While some people made a song and dance yesterday about the use of the phrase &ldquo;so-called co-ops&rdquo; I noticed that Deputy Browne used it in relation to a number of co-ops that he then named in some of the larger towns in Wexford.  He then went on to say that he did not consider that some of the smaller ones were &ldquo;so-called co-ops&rdquo;. In my view that intervention by Deputy Browne speaks for itself.</P>

      <P>Deputy Colley has suggested that there is a lack of consistency between having a tax exemption on the export of manufactured goods and removing the tax exemption which previously has been enjoyed by agricultural co-ops.  Let us consider what is the tax exemption on the export of manufactured goods. Firstly, it is reasonable to attract business to Ireland which otherwise would not be here to generate business which otherwise would not be generated, to encourage people to find foreign markets.  It was not until we had Fine Gael in Government that such a very sensible step was taken. It has had very beneficial results but &mdash;and this is important&mdash;the exemption lasts for only 15 years, phasing out then for five years.  It lasts for 20 years at most and quite a number of firms are moving towards the end of that exemption.  It was never intended that the exemption should last for ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are doing here is removing an exemption which has been enjoyed for more than 50 years.  Exemptions are justifiable if they can bring about an improvement in economic performance and economic pattern, but it is wrong to allow exemptions and concessions to last indefinitely in such a way as to disturb the equity of the tax system.  Exemptions related to small co-ops which were dealing with the production, purchase and marketing of agricultural produce or fishery produce is one thing and could be justified in the circumstances in which the exemption was first introduced, but to extend that into what are now major manufacturing and marketing organisations which are in competition with private enterprise is to argue for the operation of a system which will <Col N="1638" /> multiply the inequity as long as it is allowed remain.  We have taken into account representations made to us. We have met the bodies primarily concerned.  We have not allowed our judgement on this matter to be in any way coloured by some very rude criticisms that have been uttered.</P>

I have no wish to generate, and I will oppose all efforts by anybody else to generate, any hostility between town and country.  We live off one another and we depend on one another.

      <P>I trust that, much as they might dislike my presence here, members of the Opposition do not propose to use the same methods to dislodge me as they when in Government used to dislodge that beautiful Doric column in O'Connell Street.  I want to return to the issue which has been raised wrongly and dangerously &mdash;the suggestion that there is any effort to generate hostility between one sector of our community and another. There is not, but one cannot avoid <Col N="1639" /> recognising that there is inequity if one allows a substantial number of people to avoid paying taxation when people with somewhat equivalent standards of living and incomes are obliged to pay and have no opportunity to avoid paying.  That is wrong.  As I have so often recognised, the process of change is a difficult one.  One gets very little thanks from those who are not affected by changes because they are not upset by them.  There is probably some little element of gratitude but they seldom express it when they see others being brought into the net.  But one gets nothing but abuse, and a great deal of it vituperative, from those who no longer enjoy the exemptions and concessions they previously enjoyed.  Deputy Colley experienced that when he was Minister for Finance and every Minister for Finance in this and other countries have experienced the same, but one must discharge one's duty as one sees it and have the courage to do it.  If one is failing in that courage then one ought to quit the post.  As long as I have the privilege of being Minister for Finance of Ireland I will pursue this course of equity in taxation and also pursue the other necessary policies to achieve here a just society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be edifying, if one had not heard the Minister earlier, to hear him decry any effort to divide the rural dweller from the urban dweller, the farmer from the townee but it is almost impossible to avoid the conclusion that that is precisely what the Minister was trying to do earlier. In purely political terms one can understand this because he had run into such a barrage of criticism from what appeared to him to be rural elements that he thought the only thing they could do to salvage something from the wreck was to appeal to town relatives. But he is making a very big mistake, I would suggest, in approaching it in that way.  That does not absolve him from responsibility for what he has just said.  What he has just said is something with which I would fully concur, but having approached it in that way I suggest he cannot get <Col N="1640" /> out of his responsibility by saying the opposite today.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, when he originally produced this proposal to tax co-operatives the Minister did not realise, and possibly even still does not realise, that co-operatives are in one sense more important to the people who live in towns than they are to farmers because they are the vital element in creating jobs in many parts of this country.  They have provided many thousand jobs and any interference with their activities puts thousands of jobs at risk.</P>
      <P>I suggest the Minister has been trying to mislead people in regard to this whole matter because, while he did not specifically say it, he certainly allowed it to be understood that the co-operatives did not pay tax.  He did dwell at considerable length, as he did yesterday, on his allegations that co-operatives engage in unfair competition with other traders.  Knowing, as he does, that of course co-operatives pay tax&mdash;as do all other traders&mdash;on what broadly might be called their non-agricultural activities, if he believes that there are many activities in which they engage on which they should pay tax, why is the proposal not before the House to apply taxation to those activities? Then we could discuss the liability which should apply to co-operatives in regard to those activities in a reasonable way.</P>
      <P>But that is not what the Minister is proposing at all.  I suggest that because that is not the proposal it is quite clear that this question of what they pay tax on and what they do not pay tax on and whether they are in competition with other traders is unfair.  The Minister's proposal before the House is to apply taxation to all the activities of the co-operatives. That is the proposal, the Minister stands or falls on.  If he believes that there is any truth in what he was saying in the other regard, his proposals should be quite different.  The proposal before the House is to apply taxation to all the activities of the co-operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that as far as this side of the House is concerned <Col N="1641" /> we believe that the co-operatives should not be in a position to engage in unfair competition with ordinary traders and shopkeepers. But the activities of the co-operatives in relation to agriculture, particularly in relation to the small farmer, are a vital economic and social element. The food industry is what we are concerned with in particular&mdash;what is being done to it under this proposal, how much potential it has for our economy and the damage involved in this proposal to that potential.  I am not speaking of its potential for farmers.</P>
    <P>I am speaking of its potential for all the people, for exports based on home-produced materials with virtually no element of import involved, with all the added value done here at home, not just by farmers but by workers in factories in the processing and packaging and so on, all done here at home.  That is the ideal kind of industry for this country.  That is what we are talking about.  That is what we on this side of the House are trying to protect.  That is the kind of industry we believe the Minister should not alone not be attacking but ought to be encouraging and giving an incentive to.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, there are aspects of the co-operative movement which could be greatly improved in the interests of the economy as a whole. We on our side, although in opposition, are now hoping to encourage this development.  Deputy J. Gibbons, our spokesman on agriculture, will very shortly meet representatives of one of the farming organisations in order to discuss with them this very topic and try to see between us what we can do to encourage the development of the co-operative movement in order that it will contribute even more to the future of our people and to the provision of employment for the young people.  One could reasonably expect this kind of approach in a much more intensified fashion from the Government in present circumstances, but what do we get?  A proposal to apply blanket taxation, with no regard for the consequences.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that difference in <Col N="1642" /> approach alone illustrates why this country is in the condition in which it is under this Government as compared with the condition in which it was under the previous Government. The Minister of course would have us believe that the world situation is such that he has no responsibility.  Of course that argument has worn completely thin by now.  When one finds, as one did within the last few weeks, the OECD processing a report showing that this country has had this year the highest inflation record of any developed country and when one realises that all the other developed countries who have been facing the same problems of the energy crisis and the world recession have done better than we did in handling inflation, that we have the highest rate of unemployment in the EEC and have as well the highest rate of borrowing in relation to our GNP, one is entitled to say that the Minister had better stop trying to hide behind the excuses he has been giving. Even if it were true that he could not do anything about this aspect of the world scene it would make it all the more necessary that he should be picking out the sectors of our economy which can be got to generate employment quickly.</P>
    <P>Nobody who looks at our economy across the whole spectrum to pick out areas which could produce more employment and more exports quickly could overlook the food industry. When he looks at the food industry will his approach be to apply further taxation to it, or will it be how to use incentives to get this industry to contribute to employment and to growth?</P>
    <P>It has taken me a long time to get the Minister for Finance to face up to the contradiction inherent in everything he has been saying about equity in taxation on the one hand and granting export tax relief on the other. Finally in this debate I have got him at last to talk about it instead of going on and on blandly, as he has done in the past, about equity of taxation. When we come to gross equitable provision nobody knows exactly how much tax is being saved in export companies.  Some of them are far lower and some of them higher.  Of <Col N="1643" /> its nature people cannot know how much is involved, but there could be little doubt that it is not less than £100 million a year.  It may well be considerably in excess of that, but there can be little doubt that it is at least that much.  Every single argument that the Minister has advanced on the grounds of equity for applying the taxation proposed in this amendment could be advanced with much greater force in favour of applying the taxation proposed in this amendment could be advanced with much greater force in favour of applying taxation to our industrial exports.  For example, the Minister talks about the typist who is paying at least £3 a week in tax under PAYE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>£6 or £7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Depending on what she earns.  Multi-national companies with millions of pounds capital and hundreds of thousands of millions of pounds turnover all over the world are getting relief from taxation in this country worth very easily in one case £10 million a year.  Is that justifiable in pure terms of equity, which the Minister keeps trying to ram down our throats?  Is that fair when the typist has to pay £6 a week?  Does the Minister begin to see the injustice and the dishonesty of the arguments he has been making in this debate if I put it that way?  The Minister knows as well as I do that this country needs to have export tax relief, that thousands of jobs depend on export tax relief.  The Minister knows it is right that we should have export tax relief.  I put it to the Minister that, if there were any honesty in this approach he would apply that argument to this proposal before the House and he would not compare this with the situation of the typist but would see what would be the economic and social consequences of applying this tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened carefully to what the Minister said in this debate yesterday and today and not once did I hear him talk about the economic or social consequences of what he proposes to do here.  He talked about equity and unfair competition.  Why did he not talk about the economic consequences? I would suggest that it was because <Col N="1644" /> the Minister knows that if he talked about the economic consequences he would find himself making the same arguments for retaining exemption from taxation for co-operatives as he made for retaining export tax relief. The Minister may say that there is only a small amount of money involved and that therefore it cannot be of major significance.  But, even if the Minister did not know before, since this proposal was produced he has received sufficient representations to show him the detailed figures from various co-operatives, their commitments in regard to the repayment of huge loans which they had got to add to their reserves in order to expand, and provide more employment and more exports.  The Minister knows that in a number of cases the proposal now before the House will mean that they will be unable to service the debts they have or debts they plan to have in order to expand.</P>
    <P>The Minister also knows that in a number of cases hundreds, maybe thousands, of jobs are marginal at the moment and that the effect of this proposal could well be to throw those people out of work.  I suggest that it is grossly misconceived to imagine that the workers in Dublin or in any other town have some kind of a vested interest in the introduction of a measure of taxation which will throw hundreds and thousands of other workers out of a job.  No amount of endeavouring to mislead the public or to create envy between one position and another can obscure that fact. It is in the interests of all the people of this country, whether living in towns, cities, or farms, that we should encourage the co-operative movement in the genuine activities of co-operatives. I do not for one moment suggest that there should be any encouragement of or defence of activities by co-operatives which are not related to the agricultural industry and in which they are competing whether fairly or unfairly with other traders.  That is another matter altogether which could be dealt with separately, if the Minister believed that that is so.  That is not what the Minister is doing here. What the Minister is doing is striking a blow at all the activities of co-operatives <Col N="1645" /> and in particular at the food industry.</P>
    <P>We have pointed out to the Minister that the bulk of the people who will be affected in this way are small farmers. The Minister has tried to obscure that fact by saying that of course such people are not going to be liable to income tax.  We never said they were.  What we did state, and what the Minister cannot deny, is that the application of this proposal will have the effect of reducing what is available to the members of co-operatives.  The great bulk of the members of co-operatives are small farmers.  These are incontrovertible facts.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has grasped the fact that the consequence of what he is doing is that either the value of the return in the form of credits or availability of fertilisers and so on to small farmers will decrease or, alternatively, that the price of the food sold by co-operatives will go up.  Almost certainly the latter is the position.  If the cost to the farmer of producing food goes up ultimately the cost to the consumer will go up.  Therefore not alone are the jobs of people in towns and villages at stake but the cost of foodstuffs to people all over the country will be affected by the Minister's proposals. Furthermore, we reminded the Minister that one of the reasons co-operatives were founded was to enable farmers to save themselves from exploitation by merchants, large and small, by gombeen men, and by huge corporations. The only way the small farmer can be protected from such exploitation is through the co-operative movement.  The Minister in this proposal is opening the door to these exploiters once again to come back and exercise the role from which the co-operative movement has banished them.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House do not believe that any of these consequences are justified.  We believe that the argument about equity is specious and has been shown to be so and that in so far as there is unfair competition the matter could be dealt with in quite a different way.  This proposal does not deal with unfair competition at all, and <Col N="1646" /> it will have serious consequences which are even more serious because of the present appalling state of the economy.  That being so, we are opposed to the proposal contained in this amendment.  As we have indicated, we intend on returning to office after the next general election to repeal this measure should it be passed now by the Minister and the Deputies who sit behind him.</P>
    <P>In this regard I wish to say how much I deprecate the efforts that are being made by many people who purport to be supporters of the Minister to denigrate the Minister personally and to give the impression that he personally is responsible both for this proposal and for the appalling mess in which the country finds itself. Of course he is responsible, but that responsibility is shared by every member of the Government and by every Deputy behind them who votes with them.  These efforts to denigrate the Minister imply that everything in the garden would be rosy if he were replaced. Each individual on the benches opposite is responsible for the present situation and will so be held by the people at the next general election.</P>
    <P>There are a few technical points in relation to the section which the Minister might clarify for me.  In particular can the Minister say what kind of activity is envisaged in relation to subsection (3)?  How does a society come within charge to corporation tax? In regard to the reference at the top of page 15 to &ldquo;any subsequent event&rdquo; is that phrase defined in the 1967 Act?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The kind of activities that would come into charge to tax would be any which were liable previously to tax.  The Deputy knows that all activities were liable save those that were exempt.  The phrase &ldquo;any subsequent event&rdquo; is in the 1967 Act.</P>

      <P>Why does the amendment not propose to grant the kind of allowance in respect of industrial building that is granted to manufacturing industry generally and can the Minister say if the effect of not granting this allowance will mean no relief <Col N="1647" /> in respect of livestock marts which do not have plant and equipment?</P>

      <P>Regarding subsection (6), I would point out that the earlier part of paragraph (c) refers to income computed without regard to the provisions of section 220, subsection (3) of the 1967 Act, but later in the paragraph it says that each part shall be deemed to be a period of account for the purposes of subsection (3) of section 220 of the 1967 Act.  In other words, while the latter seems to be excluded at the beginning it is brought in at the end.  I think I know what is sought to be achieved here but I doubt if the wording is such that it will achieve what the Minister has in mind, at least not without causing a great deal of confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out also that at the end of subsection (6) it says that for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, <Col N="1648" /> 1967, and the Finance Act, 1963, each such part shall be deemed to be a period of account.  I do not think that the phrase &ldquo;period of account&rdquo; appears in either subsections (3) or (4) of section 220 of the 1967 Act although it says here that for the purposes of those sections each part shall be deemed to be a period of account.</P>

      <P>In page 28, subsection (3), line 10, to delete &ldquo;(2)&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;(3)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  It arises from the fact that the last three subsections are erroneously numbered (2), (3) and (4) instead of (3), (4) and (5).  This will be corrected in the next print of the Bill.  Consequently the reference in line 10, to subsection (2) should be to subsection (3) and the amendment secures this.  It is much to do about a little.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure, yes, no shortage of wind; nothing offensive. This section empowers an officer of the Revenue Commissioners authorised by them for the purposes of this section to enter business premises and to inspect books, records, and documents relating to the business.  Where necessary, they may remove books for a reasonable time for proper examination.  I may say that this power is similar to that in relation to value-added tax and is contained in section 18 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate what is unsatisfactory in the present powers enjoyed by the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The present powers are not as extensive as these new ones. The House will recall that in my budget speech I said that steps would be taken to give the Revenue Commissioners the necessary powers to enable them to ensure that taxpayers kept proper records to meet their obligations.  I said in relation to this section in my budget statement and I quote:</P>
      <P>Cases which appear to warrant special attention will be subjected to intensive investigation....  The Revenue Commissioners will also take special measures as regards those taxpayers who have an obligation to keep records.</P>
      <P>The provisions which we are making here now are a lot less stringent than apply in many other countries but are, I consider, the minimum we must give to the Revenue Commissioners in order that they may have the power to ensure that the proper records are being kept and that the information furnished to them is also correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will observe, in subsection (1) that there is a definition of &ldquo;an authorised officer&rdquo;.  Normally such an officer would be an inspector of taxes appointed by the Minister for Finance under section 161 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  However, an officer of the Revenue Commissioners, other than an inspector, may be authorised for the purposes of the section.  It is proposed in the first instance to authorise <Col N="1653" /> only inspectors and accountants in the Investigation Branch of the Revenue Commissioners for the purposes of this section, that is to say, persons who, in the course of their work, are engaged in examining the records and accounts of persons in respect of whom the orders will be issued.  It is imperative that they have this power in order to carry out detailed inspection of records.</P>
    <P>Deputies will observe that banking business is excluded.  That is done deliberately in order to remove any possibility of a suggestion being made that there was an invasion of the confidential relationship between banker and customer.  What we are doing here is empowering the Revenue Commissioners to make detailed inspection of records in cases which have come to their notice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say that it is proposed to appoint inspectors of taxes and accountants in the first instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Investigation Branch of the Revenue Commissioners. When I say &ldquo;in the first instance&rdquo;, I do not at present visualise that others would be authorised.  The Deputy will recall that in order to, as it were, reduce the possibility of persons being appointed at will, and too many being appointed, we undertook to make an amendment which would be coming in on the next Stage to provide that any persons authorised in this regard would have to be authorised in writing. As the Deputy knows, he himself &mdash;when in office&mdash;appointed inspectors of taxes.  They must be mandated and given their authority under seal of the Minister for Finance, likewise in relation to accountants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that amendment apply to this section as well as to the earlier section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You will see that when exercising any power conferred on him an authorised officer shall if so requested by any person affected, produce to that person a certificate of the Revenue Commissioners that he is authorised to exercise the powers <Col N="1654" /> so conferred.  Any persons exercising these powers will have a certificate to establish their authority to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister see any objection from his point of view to confining the authorised officers envisaged under this to inspectors or accountants in the Revenue service? He did, as I pointed out, preface that by saying &ldquo;in the first instance&rdquo;.  He will understand the concern that this could develop into a situation in which people could be appointed much too freely.  They are being given enormous powers under this section.  I do not see any reason why the Minister would not undertake in the House at least, if not in the section, that the powers would not be given except to an inspector of taxes or an accountant employed full-time by the Revenue Commissioners. If it were desired to change that afterwards I suggest that the matter could be brought before the House but I do not think it is right that such powers be given and be, theoretically at least, conferrable on people who might even just be engaged for a particular job by the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not say that is what is envisaged at the moment but I do not think we should leave it open to have that happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can sympathise with the view expressed by the Deputy.  It would not be my wish that what he visualises could happen should happen. I would like to make it clear that when we talk about accountants in the Investigation Branch of the Revenue Commissioners these are full-time officers of the Revenue Commissioners. An officer of the Revenue Commissioners is, in fact, defined in the Acts.  He is employed by the Revenue Commissioners and paid by the Minister for Finance.  There would be no question of empowering some person who was in a temporary capacity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be if one goes on the basis of what the Minister said, in the first instance, that it would only be inspectors and accountants, as he has described them.  In the second instance if it was not confined <Col N="1655" /> to them, could it not extend to the kind of people I have mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, though I can see it might not appear so on reading it, the section is drafted the way it is because it is not proposed to empower all inspectors to exercise the powers conferred by this section.  It will be only those who are involved in the special work of surveillance in the investigation branch.  If we include inspectors of taxes there is the possibility that it would be extended too widely.  I am prepared to give the Deputy an assurance that as far as I am concerned I will be at pains to impress on the Revenue Commissioners that this power is to be exercised very carefully and that only people who are in the investigation branch or work which is necessarily related to this particular branch should be given this power.  We can be assured that the Revenue Commissioners will not proceed to use this power recklessly or widely because they would not wish that junior officers should have power of this kind which obviously is one which must be exercised with very great caution in the interests of the taxpayers and those of the Revenue Commissioners themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has said goes some of the way to meeting the concern I have expressed.  I dealt with this matter because it appears first in the section.  I may be putting the cart before the horse because, basically, what I want to say to the Minister is that I do not think the power proposed in this section should be necessary at all.  Is it not the position under present law that there is power to require the production of the records which are sought to be made available under this section?  If that is so why is this additional power necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is power in section 174 of the 1967 Act to call for records.  For handy reference in section 3 of this Bill there is a table containing the amendment of section 174.  That states that &ldquo;where a person who has been duly required by an <Col N="1656" /> inspector to deliver a statement of the profits&rdquo; fails to deliver it or where the inspector is not satisfied with the statement he may serve on that person a notice in writing requiring him to deliver to the inspector copies of such accounts and so on and make available within such time as has been specified in the notice for inspection by the inspector, all such books, accounts and documents in his possession.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that conferring of that power does not mean that the right records are produced. I consider it necessary that the inspectors should have power to enter premises where business is conducted to satisfy themselves that the books are being properly kept and that there are not, to put it quite bluntly, two sets of books, which is something which has been known to happen in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that what is proposed in this section goes very far and that there is an obligation on him, I submit, to justify the giving of such power.  The kind of general statement he has made does not justify it. He must tell us from the practical experience of the Revenue Commissioners that there have been quite a number of cases in which they have found the existing power unsatisfactory before he seeks the kind of power sought in this section.  It may be that that is so but the Minister has not said it and I rather doubt, if in fact, that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have had cases, probably accidentally, in which more than one set of accounts has been produced to them in respect of the same trading period.  Therefore, it is considered necessary that the Revenue Commissioners should have the power to satisfy themselves that books and records are being properly kept, that they are a true reflection of the business and that there is not, in fact, more than one set of books. Even the right to inspect may not detect the presence of two sets if one set is very carefully concealed.  It is considered that we cannot effectively ensure an end to evasion practices <Col N="1657" /> unless the Revenue Commissioners are given stronger powers than the ones they have at the present.</P>
      <P>This power already exists in relation to VAT for the simple reason that no doubt Deputy Colley when he was introducing the value-added tax in 1972 was of the view that it was necessary that the Revenue Commissioners should be able to enter premises where business subject to value-added tax was being conducted so that they could inspect any books, invoices, credit notes, debit notes, receipts, accounts, bank statements, vouchers or other documents whatsoever relating to the delivery of goods and the rendering of services and he also obviously considered it necessary at that time that they might remove and retain any such books, invoices, credit notes, debit notes, receipts, accounts, vouchers, bank statements or other documents for such period as might be reasonable. I consider that Deputy Colley was right in so providing in the value-added tax Act.  That is a power which can be used there much more extensively than it is proposed to exercise the powers being conferred now by section 33.</P>
      <P>The powers in section 33 will be used only where the Investigation Branch of the Revenue Commissioners have reason to believe that they will be justified in sending in an inspector or accountant to premises to establish that the returns made are valid in accordance with the business.  The Revenue Commissioners are aware that they have received accounts which have not been in keeping with the actual position of firms and the only way that can be ultimately determined is by having power of this kind.  Mere calling for accounts does not ensure that you will get the correct accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is seeking to achieve here may well be defeated by the provisions of this section. In regard to value-added tax he will appreciate that the records required in the case of a business, broadly speaking are all the records of the business, of purchases and sales. <Col N="1658" /> The chances of a second set of accounts detailing all the purchases and sales of a business being kept and being kept falsely, I suggest, are much less than the chances of a second set of accounts the object of which is to keep an account of the actual profits of a business which is what the Minister is concerned with in this section. I do not know if the Minister has considered this but the position at present is that if the Revenue Commissioners are not satisfied they may serve a notice calling for the accounts showing the profits.  It is plausible to say: If there are two sets of accounts the taxpayer may produce the wrong set, but it is not quite as simple as that because, to produce the wrong set of accounts deliberately in response to a notice means that the taxpayer is exposing himself to a charge of fraud with very serious penalties.  The great majority of taxpayers will think twice before exposing themselves to that risk, whereas with this power if the Revenue Commissioners exercise it and move in and take away the accounts, the odds are that they get the wrong set of accounts but the taxpayer will not have produced them to them and will not be guilty of fraud.  The Minister may find that this section will defeat the purpose he has in mind.  I urge him to think again about it because I think it is a little more subtle than it seems and he may be better served in what he is trying to achieve by the existing provisions than by this apparently more onerous and rigorous provision in section 33.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As in all things, one must assume that the Revenue Commissioners will act reasonably.  The courts so assume but if they act unreasonably the courts will correct any action taken by them which the courts consider to be unreasonable.  I cannot honestly see how the Revenue Commissioners can effectively police the tax system unless they have power such as this.  The mere right to call for records is not sufficient.  The revenue from value-added tax may, in some cases, be smaller than that in relation to income tax and if it is considered necessary to have this power for VAT purposes, I consider it is also <Col N="1659" /> highly desirable to have it for income tax purposes.  The innocent person who is correctly keeping accounts has nothing whatever to fear&mdash;nobody can deny that.  Those who would have any reason to be upset by it are those who have not been keeping accounts properly and have not been furnishing proper accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister taken my point that if the Revenue Commissioners move in under this section and take away accounts and get wrong accounts the taxpayer in those circumstances is not guilty of fraud?  He can keep accounts for fun if he likes and they can deal with anything.  They are chasing them here, not calling on him to produce them and the Revenue Commissioners' position may be much weaker under this section than the Minister thinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not just a question of going into premises to collect accounts which the taxpayer is under an obligation to deliver in any case but a question of going into premises to check whether accounts already furnished are correct&mdash;quite a different thing.  I am not certain that I would follow Deputy Colley on all he says about the absence of moral turpitude on the part of a taxpayer who might allow the Revenue Commissioners to leave premises&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about moral turpitude but about legal liability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with accounts which, by his silence or otherwise, he might lead the Revenue Commissioners to assume are the correct ones. We need not enter the field of criminal law but I do not think the situation is a black and white one such as Deputy Colley was illustrating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made what to him appears to be the valid comment that the man who keeps only one set of books and has sent in a proper return has nothing to fear. Apart from what Deputy Colley has said, I think there is more in this that the Minister should look at.  If <Col N="1660" /> the Revenue Commissioners move in on the honest trader and find nothing but confirmation of what that trader has already submitted what will be his position?  They will have the right to remove the books for what is called a &ldquo;reasonable period&rdquo; but what they consider reasonable may not seem reasonable to the trader.  Presumably the man has a staff who know the Revenue Commissioners have been in; the word gets about that Joe Murphy's business merited a call by the Revenue Commissioners who feel that he is fiddling his books.  If officials call under section 33, it means that they have found him guilty before they considered it necessary to move in. I assume the authorised officials will not demand to see books or ask anybody in the employment of the proprietor to produce books for examination without having some reason to believe they have not got proper accounts.</P>
      <P>The Minister says the section is only frightening from the viewpoint of the man who is fiddling his books but that it should not frighten the honest trader who is giving fair accounts.  I suggest that if the Minister is dealing with me as an honest trader and sends in authorised officers, in the normal way the staff and a number of people doing business with me will become aware that I am held under suspicion by the Revenue Commissioners. Depending on one's point of view, that can do damage to one's business.  On the other hand, I appreciate the fact that people can give credit to the man who can put one over on the Revenue Commissioners, but I do not think the Minister would use that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to use the argument but I am glad the Deputy outlined the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier the Minister conceded the giving of a warrant to an authorised officer.  In a criminal proceeding the principle would have been that, before my house could be searched or my property could be confiscated by the police, a warrant would have to be secured.  That warrant would have to show cause <Col N="1661" /> as to why this was necessary.  Here we will have the Revenue Commissioners' authorised officers going in on a general warrant and nobody is to know whether there is cause for this or not.</P>
      <P>I want to mention something which might be a sobering thought.  It is a well-known fact that legislation dealing with driving tests has induced widespread suspicion among the public as to the <i>bona fides</i> of procedures and the integrity of the system.  We are now going to legislate and put something into our revenue law that will have a similar effect.  For obvious reasons I will not spell out the details, but the way the Minister is going, sooner or later it will be necessary to spell them out.  I am approaching this case from the point of view of the good name and the undoubted untarnished reputation of our tax gathering and revenue administering system and organisation.</P>
      <P>If we put legislation like this on the record we are going a step further. This is something the Minister has been consistently doing, that is, passing his own responsibility for making decisions, and the odium for these responsibilities, back to an agency that has served this State well, an agency which over the years has been conspicuous, as anybody who has examined the accounts of this country or had anything to do with the Committee of Public Accounts will recognise, and outstanding as a model of the public service both in integrity and efficiency.</P>
      <P>The return per pound from tax collected by the Revenue Commissioners over the years has been, until recent burdens were accumulated and thrown upon them, extraordinarily good.  To put it another way: the net return to the Exchequer, after you take the money collected and the expense in collecting it, has been very high.  I have taken that in conjunction with integrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it may appear that I am wandering from the point and perhaps I am, but those two facts have a bearing on this section in this way.  Firstly, its mechanisms and provisions of power, on the surface <Col N="1662" /> may seem to be arbitrary and without the protection which the custodians and guardians of the law have in normal procedures.  They are not here.  We are bringing about a situation where more and more, following on the Minister's attitude, the Revenue Commissioners eventually will be in a position in the eyes of the public comparable with the legendary position of the publican in the New Testament.  That is a very serious matter.  In the long run it can only bring disastrous consequences for all concerned.  That is the relevance of my first point dealing with integrity.</P>
    <P>The relevance of the second point is that the more one multiplies these procedures the more staff will be required, the more administrative expense will occur and will have to be paid out of revenue collected, and the net return of the Revenue Commissioners per pound will fall.  I am aware, as chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, of many of the difficulties facing the Revenue Commissioners and their officers in collecting revenue in certain Departments through the fact that mechanisms and demands for taxation have been imposed on them and they have been left with the responsibility of collecting them.  I know that that is a serious enough problem for them to consider.  Indeed, I can very well see and sympathise that some of the present pressure about tax evasion may stem from just that situation.  My point is that this section is not going to help, that we are getting lost and the Minister is getting lost in an obsession that perhaps one or two errors might occur and that they must be caught.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been preaching about equality of taxation.  That is all very fine but that is not what he will achieve.  What he is achieving is expense to the community, a diminishing net return to the Exchequer, the creation of a monstrous organisation where before there was model efficiency, the destruction of the confidence of the public and consequently, the loss of any degree of co-operation there was in the system, particularly for the Revenue Commissioners.  All <Col N="1663" /> these things I regard as extremely serious.</P>
    <P>On another section the Minister talked about social and political consequences and tried to suggest that political and social disturbances in other countries are largely attributable to taxation inequality.  May I quarrel with the word &ldquo;inequality&rdquo; and say &ldquo;taxation imposition&rdquo;?  The more taxes are imposed in this way and the more people are bound with unproductive taxation, the more the revenue authorities are put in the position of being agents for an unproductive system which in the end is basically unfair to all taxpayers, a system that is introducing friction and destroying mechanisms that should work.  This is what we have to contend with.  This section has all the elements and is characteristic of this as it stands.  I would ask the Minister to seriously reflect on the consequences.</P>
    <P>I have talked about general public consequences.  Let me talk about the economic consequences of this section if passed.  The Minister, in company with certain other elements in the community seems to have completely forgotten that economic activity, prosperity, the maintenance of standards of living, even the provision of the wherewithal to live, depends on productive and useful economic activity and is not a product of academic or literary efforts, or of administrative provisions, or of accountancy, law or anything else.  We have got our priorities wrong.  Accountancy, law, revenue and the State service itself are auxiliary and ancillary to, and depend utterly upon a basic economic activity that support it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in a jam today. He may get the plaudits of administrative staffs in public as well as in private for his wonderful efforts, but basically the country is in the state it is in today&mdash;and it is well known what state it is in&mdash;because the Minister and the Government have failed to realise that all this is supported by economic activity.  I am not wandering when I say this because I want to show the impact of the section.</P>
    <P>This section is bad enough at present. I can assure the Minister from <Col N="1664" /> personal experience&mdash;and anybody who is engaged in any kind of productive activity other than one of these service auxiliary jobs, whether as employee or employer, manager or worker, will realise it&mdash;that the effect of this administrative burden that is coming upon the community from all angles is that everybody's time is being absorbed in this kind of work and in preventing problems arising.  As a result of this, productive work is suffering.  When this is done, what will be the effect?  Everybody in business, whether retail or productive, is going to be very concerned that anybody can walk in&mdash;and the Minister conceded me a general warrant earlier&mdash; and demand not only the production of what you might call regular books but can demand documents, correspondence, and carry out a general search.  They could even search a manager's pockets under the terms of this section.</P>
    <P>What is the practical effect of that going to be?  First of all, it will stifle all activity because there will be an immediate reaction to deal with a section like that.  Even a company's auditors, statutorily appointed under the Companies Acts by the shareholders of a company, cannot walk in and do that.  They can see the authorised books of account.  Their function is to see that accounts are adequate and sufficient.  They can see the minute book of the company, ledgers, various contract documents, wage records and things like that.  But under this section the Revenue Commissioners can come in and inspect even correspondence dealing with a tentative contract or negotiation.  Are we going to create a dictatorship which can do practically anything it likes economically in this way and force that dictatorship on a people who do not want it?  If the Minister goes on like that, let us appoint a revenue minister, a minister who will take public responsibility.  Let us pass simple legislation to put the public responsibility in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners and cut out the farce of putting the responsibility on this House.  That is the logic of it and, of course, it is a <i>reductio ad absurdum.</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> The effect of this section is going to be not only stifling but positively conducive to two most undesirable things: first of all, the adjustment of all accounting, all management, to the requirements of this section.  Talk about tax evasion; you will be creating the temptation and atmosphere for a massive concentration on methods of tax evasion that will require an army of administrators to cope with.  You are already starting your fraud squads. It will not be squads, it will not be platoons, it will not be battalions, it will be divisions you will want of them before you are finished with this kind of legislation.</P>
    <P>A day of reckoning will come. Again it was not I but the Minister who talked about political and social consequences in other places and other countries.  The complete abdication of the Minister to points dealing with tax evasion, his obsession with this, will have the most disastrous effects along lines like this.  While the Revenue Commissioners are being gradually put in an intolerable position&mdash; because this is what will result from it &mdash;the whole economic fabric will be further disrupted and destroyed.</P>
    <P>The second consequence of this is that you will have to legislate&mdash;and you will not get reciprocal tax agreement on this&mdash;for where documents are kept and where they are not kept. The stage will be reached when an authorised officer will have to be sent along with every negotiator from the country, because he is going to go out of the country, carry out the business, keep the books elsewhere and only keep certain things at home.  You cannot beat that unless you send an officer out with him and have him present at his negotiations and what he is doing outside the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister may smile, but the Minister smiled when we talked about his deficits.  The Minister smiled when we talked about his borrowing.  The Minister smiled when we talked about what was going to happen inflation and employment.  The Minister stopped his smile when he went out appealing to the unions for restraint, appealing to the public, and then finally the Minister abdicates and surrenders his <Col N="1666" /> whole function to an organ of State set up by the House, the Labour Court.  Incidentally, who is going to examine the accounts of the State. For instance, in this, can an authorised officer, authorised by somebody else to carry out Government policy, go in and examine the Revenue Commissioners themselves?  Will some other Minister or maybe the Taoiseach bring in that?</P>
    <P>This is where we are going, and if my language seems extravagant and if I seem vehement today, it is to warn against the dangers that this is gradually sliding us into.  If I use graphic and perhaps over-graphic descriptions, it is in a very earnest desire to impress upon the Minister that proportions are being lost sight of.  Coping with tax evasion is something with which we fully agree, and we have always wanted to give the Revenue Commissioners discretion in this regard.  The only occasion on which I demurred against this principle was when I felt they were being asked to be judges in their own case, which is not fair to anybody.</P>
    <P>Again, that has a very big bearing on the approach here.  It was being urged on the Minister to give a discretion in a certain case and it was remarked that I did not support it.  I think I said silence might be more eloquent.  In face of this section maybe I should give my reason for that remark.  The remark was precisely this, that it would be grossly unfair to impose that discretion on them in that case.  The imposition of this responsibility&mdash;because in the last analysis it is a responsibility, not a privilege&mdash;may seem to the man in the field a help, but let the thinking top staff look at it&mdash;and I think they will&mdash;and it might be a chalice that they might prefer to have pass.</P>
    <P>This is what is in this section and in the whole Bill, and with the greatest sympathy for much here, I earnestly ask the Minister to reconsider what is being done here.  It would be much better to have a special squad in the Garda Síochána to whom these things could be referred than to turn the Revenue Commissioners into a police agency and a secret police agency at that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1667" /> I know what the Minister is trying to get at here in this section.  I know that books can be &ldquo;cooked&rdquo;.  I know that partial information can be given. I can well understand the frustration of an inspector or anybody dealing with these matters who has circumstantial evidence for believing that somebody is getting away with something substantial.  Incidentally, in fairness to the Revenue Commissioners it must be remarked in passing that they have always been most reasonable and sensible in dealing with matters that were not serious, if you know what I mean.  They could take a very sensible view of things.  In other words, they would not spend £100 to get a halfpenny or they would not upset the whole apple cart because one apple was a little bit off; nor would they cut off a nose to spite a face.</P>
    <P>I am quite ready, therefore, to accept that the intention of this is governing substantial cases.  The intention is to deal with cases where there is turpitude and malice&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;malice&rdquo; in its legal sense&mdash;and, using the words of another Act, something that is material.  There is, in other words, gravamen.  Now, although I may have been a bit hard on the Minister, I want him to accept from me that what I have said I have said objectively.  I do not want him for a moment to think that what I have said is meant in any petty sense.</P>
    <P>Consider those cases then.  If you have a situation of that nature it will be clear and you will want more circumscription.  You must approach this very much in the spirit in which one has to approach criminal law because, in effect, Revenue law is becoming criminal law.  There are two well-known facets of a well-known principle in criminal law: everyone is innocent until proved guilty and the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy give way for a moment?  It is also an aspect of criminal law that the police are given power of investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1668" />
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that.  That is the principle but, as cases developed right up to certain crimes, with which we are all too familiar in this country, where one has, so to speak, to go to extreme lengths in the criminal law, one can visualise the same kind of problem, an analagous problem, facing Revenue law.  However, the point I want to make is that the basic principle is there and there is a movement away from it.  It may be necessary, unfortunately, as one moves out more and more to circumscribe this principle&mdash;erode it, if you like&mdash; and I am not saying that the circumstances and the temptations now built into our tax law are not producing and will not produce that situation.  What I am saying is that it should be an outward extension.</P>
      <P>Here we are putting in in omnibus form a complete sweep across the board which is equivalent to obliterating rights, equivalent to saying in the criminal law that it is too difficult to administer because there are too many fellows getting with it and so we will give the Commissioner of the Police and the police power to do whatever the devil they like.  That is what this section is doing&mdash;giving power to do whatever the devil they like.  It is that I protest against and I ask the Minister if there is any way by which there could be circumscription of this power and, if there is not, then I think it is necessary to show more cause as to why a power of this width should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, notice must be given.  Can it not be specified?  In the Income Tax Acts and in other Acts, even in Acts that are not ostensibly for the purposes of the Revenue and the Minister for Finance, there are provisions in aid of the administration and collection of tax.  Take, for instance, the 1963 Companies Act.  When that Act was being passed I was guilty of commenting that it should be subtitled &ldquo;An Act in Aid of the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;. There was a great deal of bluff about the rights of shareholders, what accounts were to be given and so forth.  I was on that Committee and all the pressure was from the Department of Finance and <Col N="1669" /> its representative on that Committee, though the Act was emanating from another Department, in aid of revenue collection.  How has it worked out?  It has certainly worked out in aid of revenue collection but it has also worked out in aid of speculators buying and selling and dealing in productive companies.  This kind of legislation we have here will do precisely the same thing.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for talking at such length on one section but can we not face the problem posed by this section?  We must talk in global terms if the legislation is phrased in global terms, but can we not say specifically what we are aiming at here?  Can we not say specifically what the difficulties are? Can we not confine the powers given to the minimum necessary?  Can we not make the procedures definite? Can we not give certainty even to the accused?</P>
    <P>On a further analogy with criminal law, when an accused is indicted in an ordinary criminal case he has an opportunity of preparing a defence and the prosecution are constrained by certain rules of evidence.  Take the protection an accused has if he is interrogated by a policy officer.  It is a very well-known objection, indeed, that the statement given by the accused was not a voluntary statement or that the evidence to be tendered was got in an irregular way.  There is no such protection for the ordinary citizen in this.</P>
    <P>This section is worthy of the OGPU at its worst.  I am, perhaps, talking extravagantly but now is the time to face some of the issues and I am saying all this in defence of the Revenue Commissioners and in protection of the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not want to see them thrown into this position, given indiscriminate powers of this nature, with all the odium and responsibility attaching thereto, plus the inevitable necessity for multiplying staffs and effectively diminishing the net return of the tax collected.  These will be the inevitable consequences of the section as drafted and, indeed, of many other sections of the same genre in the Minister's tax code.  My appeal to the Minister is made on the grounds of the good name and the confidence <Col N="1670" /> the public have in the efficiency and integrity of the Revenue Commissioners. This must be maintained.  But this section is putting that in jeopardy. It is also putting in jeopardy the dignity of the citizen and the right of the citizen to function as economically as possible as a part of the community and not to be reduced to the position of a slave of the machine.  I am putting it on the grounds of going beyond what even our criminal law does and creating a situation where, instead of minimising the crime, it is going to be an incentive towards tax evasion, a multiplication of red tape, a multiplication of expenses in collection and a further distraction towards administrative detail at a time when all our energies should be given to productive activity.</P>
    <P>The whole community of the State has many analogies with an army in action and it may be because the life of the community is always a battle.  In an army the essential thing are the fighting troops.  The administrative services, the paymaster, the quartermasters, the adjutants and the ancillary corps are essential to the good administration and working of an army but in the final analysis all these staffs depend on the fighting troops.  An army can have the finest staffs and services and the most efficient back-up organisation, but if the fighting troops are not there the opponent soon sweeps away all the services and the personnel are destroyed.</P>
    <P>Again, I come back to the Minister's remarks about political, social and economic consequences.  In a Europe when there is a ring around from the Mediterranean that, under this Minister, is coming rather near this country, it is well for us to reflect that the army of the State, the fighting troops of the community, are the productive workers and managers and those engaged in economic activity that is providing the wherewithal for us to live and to maintain and improve our standards of living.  The ancillary services, what I might call the general category under Schedule D, including the State services and State agencies are dependent on this. Let the administrative mind see it as <Col N="1671" /> it likes and plan it from any point of view.  If the support fails, they fail also.  They are utterly dependent on it.  It is a sober thought that when we talk about remuneration, tax and what the tax is collected for, the source of that tax can erupt and be destroyed.  Too late those who are dependent on the return from tax will realise that what I called the Schedule D category will not stand up without the support of the rest.</P>
    <P>This section hits right at the root of the productive elements, as do other sections and provisions.  We need something else here.  Let us face the problem.  We are with the Minister and the authorities on this.  Can we not limit it?  We must make it definite. We cannot simply say to someone: &ldquo;Here is a warrant; you can do what you like, you have more power than the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána&rdquo;.  Are we going to say this in this House?  Then the Minister, the Government and every Deputy who goes into the lobby must take responsibility for that before the public.  It will not be long before other people, talking in a different vein and tone, will say what I am trying to say now by way of a friendly warning.</P>
    <P>Let us think twice about giving such lethal presents and responsibilities to the people to whom we are delegating responsibility for doing our work, because they will prove to be lethal presents.  Each dose may be small and tolerable and seemingly insufficient but the poison is cumulative. I want everything I have said here today to be taken as a friendly warning to all of us and a friendly reminder to Members of this House because we have the responsibility here.</P>
    <P>We should not embark on this.  We are behaving irresponsibly and damagingly to the people who have been most efficiently serving this State.  In fact we are administering cumulative doses of very lethal poison to the State organisation and for this reason I ask the Minister to reconsider this section, make it specific, bring in limitations.</P>
    <P>I believe we would make a start by <Col N="1672" /> putting a limitation.  Perhaps we have got tired trying to deal with the specific and there is the temptation to deal with the general, but that is a fatal mistake.  Let us first deal with the specific and when the point comes up let us see how we can meet it.  We then have to see whether it is worth meeting it or not.  That is the way to approach penal legislation and Revenue legislation has now become penal. This section is a penal section and the person in contravention of it is liable to a fine of £500.  If a crime is established and it is sufficiently grave to warrant any provision like this, then the penalty should be big.  But putting in sanctions against a crime of that magnitude is like providing for imprisonment for a petty offence such as not having a light on a bicycle.  We have had it in history where men were hung for stealing sheep, and that is the answer to the Minister on that matter.</P>
    <P>There is something wrong in the principle of our approach here.  The way it is being presented is almost an insult to the House.  We should be given some closer view of what the problem to be faced is.  We should have an opportunity of debating what is necessary, an opportunity of dealing with the problem in less general terms than I have been forced to deal with. However I realise that the secrecy of the Revenue will come into this but that is all the more reason why such a section should be avoided.  A complete re-think is needed on the section. I hope the Minister will take what I have said, vehement and all though it was, as a warning to him before the undesirable consequences of this type of thing built up to proportions that we will all regret.  It should be remembered that up to this the Minister has been attracting odium and I have had some sympathy with him in this regard.  At the same time I must confess that it is his own fault. But all I hear said about the Minister around the town and in the pubs is not very complimentary.</P>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy for the Minister.  I wish he did not work as hard and I think he should have a holiday.  We will try and arrange to give him one as soon as <Col N="1673" /> possible.  What I have said is an undoubted fact and it will not be long before this is being said about officers of the State, about permanent servants of the State.  That would be a diabolical situation to introduce, but the fault would be ours.  We as a Parliament do not deserve to exist and democracy would not deserve to survive here if we allowed this to happen. The Minister is paving the road to that very undesirable situation with this kind of legislation and that is why I called it a lethal present.</P>
    <P>It will not be long before that kind of thing happens if the Minister carries on with this.  I plead with him while things are all right, bad and all as he made them in that regard, to reconsider this type of legislation. Even at this late hour he should withdraw the section.  Although I have no authority to say this for this side of the House&mdash;Deputy Colley has that responsibility&mdash;I would go so far as to say that if the Minister withdrew this section and introduced a short Bill later to deal with the problem in proper terms, I would be glad to give it to him.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to believe the spirit in which I am pleading with him.  I do so in the hope that things I have been forced to say may be listened to and may not be said in another way&mdash;I believe the Minister knows what I am saying&mdash;on a much wider network.  The Minister was good enough to accept the point I made about the warrant, but here he is doing something to the person who receives the warrant, to the people doing something to the person who who give the warrant, and to the whole State.  If the trend continues it can only end in a major disaster.  My warning is meant to be a friendly warning but I urge him to withdraw the section, even temporarily.  I am sure the people concerned are not going to press him too hard merely on the grounds of administrative convenience. That has never been the tradition until recent times when considerations of this nature, not only administrative convenience but administrative necessity, have been forced upon us.  It is not too late yet to save the situation, but time is running out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And they will I am sure be the same in the future.  They would not dream of using these powers unless they had reason to believe the exercise of them would be likely to yield a reward.  They might be wrong of course in their suspicions in the first instance, in which case the taxpayer would be in no way disadvantaged by the exercise of these powers. However, if they had reason to believe that closer examination of the accounts, books and records might lead to the disclosure of information which had been withheld then they would exercise these powers.  It would be right that they should do so.  I cannot see any way in which we can effectively combat evasion unless we give the Revenue Commissioners powers of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that in the great democracies of the world, in Britain, the great democracies of western Europe with whom we are so proud to be associated in the EEC, the USA, Canada and Australia, the powers of the Revenue Commissioners are much greater than they are here.  I have had a look at some of these powers and I have hesitated&mdash;Deputy de Valera will be glad to know&mdash;at introducing powers of an equally draconian nature here.  I am not certain <Col N="1675" /> what Deputy de Valera had in mind when he spoke about the need to condition, as it were, the exercise of these powers.  Perhaps I am not using his exact words, but he seemed to feel that we should specify the circumstances in which these powers should be used.  That worries me.  I do not like to write into legislation of this kind that if the Revenue Commissioners were of opinion that a certain person was possibly not giving an adequate return of income then these powers would be exercised.  That would be tantamount almost to charging the taxpayer with the commission of an offence.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera has drawn some comparisons between what he considers is the criminal code and the tax code.  I pointed out to him and to others on several occasions that there are many lines upon which there are departures.  The most critical line of departure, the most unique and original is that very one which is a cardinal principle of our criminal code, that every person is innocent until proved guilty.  If that was the code on which the tax laws operated how on earth could the Revenue Commissioners ever draw up an assessment in the absence of information from the taxpayer?  The Revenue Commissioners must, when they make assessments in the absence of information from from the taxpayer, assume that the taxpayer or person named has an income. This could be regarded as being comparable to a declaration of guilt, as it were.  It certainly throws on to the taxpayer the onus of establishing, if such be the case, that the income assessed against him does not exist and has never existed and that the Revenue Commissioners were wrong in levying the charge or the assessment in the first instance.</P>
    <P>While there is a natural tendency, particularly with us lawyers, to think in a legal fashion about laws and their enforcement and the investigation procedures, there are several departures, and have necessarily to be several departures, between the criminal law and the tax laws.  There must be a balance in a sensible and sound <Col N="1676" /> society between the efficiency of the tax laws and the right of the individual to privacy.  Deputy de Valera is good enough to accept that I respect the need to strike that balance and that I would not wish to err in such a way as would unnecessarily interfere with the right of the individual&mdash; by whom I mean not just the person but businesses&mdash;to adequate privacy. At the same time there is no point in our passing laws creating liability to tax unless we provide the Revenue Commissioners with the means to ensure that the laws are equitably, evenly and efficiently applied.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Revenue Commissioners have received evidence which indicates that the powers they already have, merely to send for records, is not sufficient.  In 1972 my distinguished predecessor, Deputy Colley, was of a mind similar to my own today.  He saw the need to empower the Revenue Commissioners to enter premises and examine records for the purpose of value-added tax and, indeed, the right to obtain information and documentation is, I would think respectfully, greater in the value-added tax of 1972 that it is in this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to argue on that.  Deputy de Valera has suggested that we should be more specific in section 33 than we are. The dangers about being specific about the kind of documentation that can be obtained is that a person can then escape, as it were, from the impact of the section by putting the documentation in some other form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly some other place, but in that connection too the net is closing, because the EEC and, indeed, the Council of Europe, are considering ways and means in which the avenues of evasion and avoidance which can be easily operated on an international plane can be closed.  The Deputy will be glad to know that as far as Ireland is concerned, <Col N="1677" /> while we are anxious to close these, we are not disposed to go as far as some of the very draconian powers existing in other countries.  We are insisting upon the preservation of the secrecy and confidentiality of our system of tax collection.  He need have no fears on that score.  Anxious as we are to close off evasion, we would not wish the principles upon which we operate here to be tampered with simply because other countries have drifted further down the road that Deputy de Valera fears we are going. I do not believe we are on that road. If we want people to respect our tax system and to feel reasonably content that others are not evading their obligations, we will have to empower the Revenue Commissioners in such a way as to enable them to check that information furnished to them is correct. That is the purpose of these powers.  The people who would be empowered in this way will be senior officers of the Revenue Commissioners' staff&mdash;inspectors, accountants in the investigation branch, people who are directly involved in examining the accounts.  I am sure it was simply one of his oratorical flights when Deputy de Valera said that he would prefer these powers to be given to the police rather than exercised by the commissioners.</P>

I am not putting that interpretation on it maliciously but God knows we want to preserve privacy in relation to persons' incomes and that information must be available to the Revenue Commissioners and nobody else, except in relation to the wrongdoer who will ultimately be brought before the courts.  In this country there has been a tendency to treat wrongdoers in a kid-glove fashion which they do not always deserve. There is a practice in other countries &mdash;which I am not proposing to introduce here&mdash;whereby a list of the names <Col N="1678" /> and addresses of tax evaders who are caught is published annually.</P>
      <P>I have given fair warning that for these who come before the courts it is intended to use those powers that are already there, and such names will be published.  In other countries names that have not come before the courts, but where settlements and so on are arrived at annual lists are published which give this information.  That is no doubt a great inducement to make people to behave properly.  What we are doing here is providing a means wherby records furnished to the Revenue Commissioners can be checked. The people who will be empowered to do this will be responsible officers of the Revenue Commissioners.  They will seek to exercise these powers in the first instance towards the owners of the businesses in question, towards the managers of the businesses in question&mdash;if they make themselves unavailable obviously one cannot let the Revenue Commissioners' inspection be frustrated&mdash;and then the powers will be directed towards other persons.  We are not seeking power to enter private premises.  We are conferring power to enter premises and places where a trade is carried on and where anything is done in connection with a trade. In other regimes, in other jurisdictions, powers already exist and in others powers are being sought to enter private premises.  This is not the intention of this section.  It is in relation to businesses, and I consider it an essential weapon.</P>

      <P>If a person does not want his private residence to be searched he can conduct his trade elsewhere.  As Deputies know, the section <Col N="1679" /> is drafted in such a way as to relate to places where anything is done in connection with the business. If it was not done in that way, there would be innumerable ways of escaping from the impact of the section and it would be futile for the Dáil and ultimately the Seanad to bring in a section which would leave a multitude of easy avenues of avoidance. I do not want to curtail any other Members speaking on this Bill but I would like to remind the House that we are under a Constitutional and a statutory obligation to have the Finance Bill through both Houses and signed by his Excellency, the President, by 29th May and we have an understanding that we would complete all stages of this Bill tomorrow.  On that account I would impose silence upon myself.</P>

      <P>The Minister has represented this section as only being a case where there is suspicion.  One of the objections to this is that it is a &ldquo;spot-check&rdquo; system.  It is a deliberate inducement to &ldquo;spot-checks&rdquo; which is a very undesirable thing.  I am afraid to say that the spot-check technique can be all too easily resorted to under the section.  I mean by &ldquo;spot-check&rdquo; technique that certain people will be sent around from firm to firm at random to make a check on things.  It is not confined to what the Minister said.  The Minister said that it was confined to trade premises.  Deputy Colley quite rightly pointed out that the wording is:</P>
      <P>An authorised officer may at all reasonable times enter any premises or place where any trade is carried on or anything is done in connection with the trade....</P>
      <P>That section is wide enough to enable the Revenue Commissioners to raid the house of a managing director or any other executive of a firm under suspicion, or even raid, on a &ldquo;spot-check&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not the section is ridiculous.  The point is that either the provision has or has not this power, that either it can or cannot be evaded.  The question of a motor car, for instance, raises a fine legal point: is it a place?  In regard to official records there arises the question of auditing, of accounts being examined and compiled by a reputable firm of auditors.  In such circumstances I cannot see either the usefulness of or the reason for this provision but where accounts are not kept one must find an alternative way of dealing with the situation.  However, this section is such that the authorised officer would be entitled to come to my desk at my place of business and inspect every document or communication on it.  Not only that but he would be entitled to come to my home and ask whether I had there any document relating to my business and if I answered in the affirmative, he would be entitled to demand to see that document.  From my reading of the section, I am not sure that he would not be entitled to arrest me in transit and demand that I hand over my briefcase. I am not saying that an authorised officer would take this action but the power to do so is being conferred on him by this section.  I challenge the Minister to deny that the powers being bestowed are as I have outlined. Might the authorised officer not be entitled to stop me on the street and demand that I hand over for inspection <Col N="1681" /> any document concerning my business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That could only happen if the Deputy conducted his trade on the street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister puts that construction on it, he is caught in another trap.  I have outlined what I read into the section but I am taking the Minister to confine this provision since he said at the beginning that it would not affect private houses.  He now says that I could be apprehended on the street only if I conducted my business there. Is this not equivalent to the possibilities I have outlined?  If the powers are limited to where I conduct my trade &mdash;my office or my factory&mdash;there arises the point as to whether I am conducting my business at home.  To take that to its logical conclusion one might as well stay at home but ensure that the documents which are produced are only those which he wished the authorised person to see.  Regardless of how one views the section, it is objectionable.  The Minister mentioned rightly that it has been necessary elsewhere to follow up such legislation with other powers.  I commend him for his anxiety not to have to do that but if he does not do it and we take his construction of the section, the whole thing becomes futile.</P>
      <P>No matter how one views the section it is bad law.  It is bad if it is restricted as the Minister says, bad if it is intended to be a mechanism for sampling and spot-checking.  I find it very difficult to see in what way it might be good law although I sympathise fully with what the Minister has in mind.  However, he is going about the problem in the wrong way.  The way to cope with it is to use the regular procedures.  In this regard I have mentioned auditors.  Where there is a firm of competent auditors there should be no problem provided that the confidence and co-operation between auditors and the Revenue Commissioners will not be destroyed by what the Minister is doing.  Where there is a problem it should not be dealt with as the Minister is proposing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1682" /> As it stands any letter, confidential or otherwise, in relation to trade could be demanded by the authorised officer. We are all human so there is always a certain risk in this regard especially in relation to big organisations.  The commissioners have been most commendable in maintaining secrecy but the more their organisation is multiplied and the greater the number of people they employ, the greater will be the danger to secrecy.  The section should be withdrawn and anything the Minister may say in defence of it can only stimulate further objections to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming the accounts of the trade or business are taken under this section and retained for some time by the Revenue Commissioners for inspection and that the trader requires to inspect the books&mdash; it is easy to think of a number of reasons why on occasions he would want to do so: for instance, he might get a pressing bill and wanted to show from his records that he did not owe it&mdash;what provision is there for him to inspect his account while they are in the possession of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to spell into the Act a provision which would enable the person to look at his own accounts.  He may be assured that the Revenue Commissioners will allow him to inspect them while in their possession.  I am satisfied that if the Revenue Commissioners declined to allow the person to inspect his own account there is a very easy and immediate remedy available because the courts would insist on the commissioners making the accounts available for inspection.  The whole purpose of writing in this clause is that the commissioners may have the accounts for a reasonable period and to ensure that they may not keep them indefinitely.  If they keep them for a period that is longer than reasonable it is open to the owner of the accounts to apply to have the accounts returned to him.  It is the principle of our law that the courts would readily enforce that a person would not be denied access to what is his own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope the taxpayer in those circumstances would not have to have recourse to the courts.  I do not think the Minister meant that he would.  I think he was outlining the extreme case.  What I wanted to get on the record was the Minister's assurance, which he has given, that in circumstances like that, the Commissioners would make the record available.  There are two other points I want to have clarified.  In subsection (2) (a) there is a phrase &ldquo;any person who is employed by the person carrying on the trade&rdquo;.  Can that include a caretaker employed by the person, an apprentice or an office boy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt whether a caretaker is carrying on a trade.  The Deputy's contention could apply to a gardener at home, if a person were lucky enough to have one.  What this has been interpreted as meaning in the past is a person who is employed in a certain capacity.  The Revenue Commissioners cannot apply to a person who has no responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I should like to see written into the section but it is not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say whether this has been so interpreted by the courts in this country but it has been elsewhere.  The Revenue Commissioners could not command an employee to do something which was beyond his duties or powers.  We must assume that the commissioners will act reasonably.  In all these cases they will require in the first instance the owners or the managers.  If the owners and managers have been made aware of their obligations then the commissioners must be empowered to require others to discharge the duties because if that were not so the commissioners could be frustrated by the simple refusal of the owners and managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3), described at the moment as subsection (2), provides for dealing with persons who wilfully obstruct or delay an authorised officer, but can paragraph (d) of the previous subsection place an obligation on persons involved to give <Col N="1684" /> to the inspector or authorised officer all reasonable assistance?  How far does that extend?  Suppose a person hands over the books, is there any obligation on him over and above that which would be deemed to be reasonable assistance or would be deemed to be withholding reasonable assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the conditions in which an officer of the commissioners could be obliged to work could make it very difficult for him to work, and such reasonable assistance might mean leaving him a place, a table or a counter or a chair, in which to conduct the work.  A mere entry in the record might not in itself be self-explanatory and reasonable assistance would involve giving an explanation of such an entry.  There are illustrations of what reasonable people would understand to mean reasonable assistance but obviously we could not proceed to spell them out in the Act because if we tried to do that we could leave out several cases where reasonable assistance could be offered and yet, because it was not in the Act, no offence would be created because it was denied.  For instance, if the Revenue Commissioners were to call in the late afternoon and were denied the aid of artificial light for the purpose of inspecting the books, the person would not be rendering reasonable assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me to give illustrations of what we had in mind.  A person could say: &ldquo;Yes, you may inspect the records but down in the basement or in the strongroom&rdquo;, into which no natural light enters.  It is obvious that no unreasonable hinderance should be put in the way.</P>

      <P>The Minister will put people in personal danger by the time he has finished.  I should not like to be an authorised officer by the time the Minister has finished.  These are the thoughts that will occur in regard to this dangerous occupation.  The Minister spoke about the light.  It is <Col N="1685" /> very easy to contrive a power failure which cannot be traced to the person who did it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested earlier that the exercising powers were adequate and that this section might reduce the powers of the commissioners.  I do not think the Minister has justified the case for this section because either <Col N="1686" /> the powers conferred by it will go way beyond what they should do, certainly beyond what is needed on the basis of the Minister's case, or this in practice will not add to the commissioners' powers and may indeed reduce them. Either way, I think the section is objectionable and the Minister has not made an adequate case for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 28, after line 16, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;34.&mdash;Section 115 (3) of the Income Tax Act, 1967 shall have effect, in relation to a payment made on or after the 6th day of April, 1976, as if for &lsquo;£3,000&rsquo; there were substituted &lsquo;£8,000&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to increase the figure in section 115 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, approximately in line with the fall in the value of money since it was fixed.  That figure relates to payments made on retirement. This section provides that a payment not exceeding £3,000 made to a person on retirement would not be subject to tax.  This amendment seeks to raise this figure to £8,000, approximately in line with the fall in the value of money since it was fixed. If it was justifiable then this figure, or something around the figure in the amendment, is justifiable now.  I do not think the Minister should have any great difficulty in dealing with it and accepting the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that in Britain the figure was fixed in 1964 and it has not yet been changed.  The real reason we have a figure at all is that it is purely a matter of ministerial convenience to avoid having to look at all cases.  It is not so much a question of relief to the taxpayer as simply a question of avoiding unnecessary examination of small sums. Deputy Colley says his attention has been drawn to the possibility that maybe the time has now come to increase it.  I am not saying that it should forever remain at its existing figure but at this point on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 1976 I do not feel I can give adequate consideration to the change which Deputy Colley recommends. I might well have a look at it in relation to the Finance Bill, 1977. In relation to the actual need for doing it in 1976 there certainly is no need on the administrative side to provide the relief which it would grant on the administrative side and as far as the general body of taxpayers is concerned I do not think it is a crucial matter.  I suggest that we have a look at it now that the seed has been sown by Deputy Colley in his amendment.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister indicate the total amount of the increase in the price of a pint of beer since the date of the budget arising <Col N="1689" /> either by virtue of the increase in tax imposed by him or the increase in price authorised and sanctioned by his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I have those figures correct.  First of all, as far as the impact of the budget is concerned, the increase was 5p.  Subsequent to the budget the National Prices Commission recommended an increase of £1.86p for brewers.  As the Deputy knows, one brewery applied that increase and another brewery did not. Subject to correction on this, although I think I am right, the vintners, of their own volition, without authority from the National Prices Commission or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, increased the price of a pint of beer by 2p so 3.86p would be the increase which is not attributable to any budgetary action.  There was a VAT increase related to the increase imposed by the vintners and brewers which carried its own related VAT and also the VAT adjustment itself, giving a total increase of 10p altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the other increase by vintners was put on without the approval of the National Prices Commission or the permission of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The actual budget increase as a result of the decisions which were verified in the Dáil on 28th January last is 6p which I am sure everybody would like <Col N="1690" /> to bear in mind instead of succumbing to the temptation, as some people are doing, of trying to pin a 10p increase on the Dáil which never voted it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the increase in taxation is more than 6p per pint because the budget called for an increase of 6p and VAT operating on the 3.86 increase that the Minister mentioned is an additional tax increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is an increase of .14 which is attributable to the decision of vintners and brewers to increase their profit margin but it was not part of budget policy or decision and was not in mind when we voted on this matter on 28th January last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is rather difficult there in that legal action was taken in connection with this.  Offhand I cannot say what the position is but I know that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is actively considering steps to regularise the position in relation to the <i>ex parte</i> increases which the vintners have from time to time granted to themselves on beer price lists but it is a very complicated matter and not one on which I should like to talk at length at present but it is the Government's intention that the same price control that operates in relation to other commodities should be applicable also to liquor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the legal position is, is it the situation that the consumer is obliged to pay an extra 10p per pint for the various reasons mentioned and that that is the figure which is included in the calculations on the consumer price index?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out, one brewery decided not to increase the price of beer and therefore in regard to that particular brand which I am not in a position to mention here the price increase is not in operation.  There may also be cases in which vintners have not themselves imposed an increase of 2p <Col N="1691" /> and so, in such cases where neither the brewers' increase nor the vintners increase has been applied, the actual increase in the price of the pint is 6p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must have been aware, when introducing the budget that an application was before the prices commission for an increase on the lines eventually approved and in the light of that surely it was ill-advised, considering the effect it has on the consumer price index, to impose such taxation as the Minister imposed knowing it would result as it eventually did?  Or does the Minister for Industry and Commerce not tell the Minister for Finance what applications are before the commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not blame the Deputy for not knowing it as he may not have been in the House when the National Prices Commission was set up but applications made for price increases remain confidential to the commission and are not necessarily known to the Government or the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister for Finance.  When the Government determined the pattern of tax increases to be proposed to the Dáil they were not in a position to contemplate that there would be further increases in the price of the commodity resulting either from a desire by brewers or by vintners to increase their margins.  We were justified, I believe, in the decisions which we recommended to the Dáil and which the Dáil took because the impact of the increases proposed as a consequence of the budget were not material in relation to the consumption of beer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Those figures indicate, as best I can calculate them, an increase of about 15p in the pint of which the trade took 7p and tax 8p.  Of that increase 8p was returned to the public in the form of revenue <Col N="1692" /> redistributed but the other 7p was taken to the trade itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All that is for the public benefit.  I am just emphasising that of the 15p, 8p was expended for the public benefit and the other 7p was siphoned off for the interests of the trade.  I do not say that they did not require it.  Roughly speaking, half was returned to the public and the other half went to the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision of the Minister and of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in approving the increase has had an effect which none of us want to see and that is that the pint has now become more expensive than the short drink.  This is an undesirable situation.  If young people decide to buy drinks the inclination would surely be to go for the cheaper drinks and so, perhaps, they are inclined&mdash;I shall not say forced&mdash;to start by drinking short drinks rather than pints.  I think this is anti-social and undesirable.  I do not suggest they should start with pints either; it would be better if they did not drink at all probably but the incentive should not be to drink short drinks at an early age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Burke that it is desirable that beer should be cheaper than spirits.  That was a consequence of a budgetary decision.  Following the budget beer was cheaper than the usual measure of spirits.  If beer is now dearer than spirits for the normal measures the reasons are not attributable to the budget but to the vintners and brewers' increases, not to the increases imposed as a result of the vote of Dáil Éireann.  Therefore Dáil Éireann, both sides of the House, should be careful not to allow themselves to be put into the position of accepting blame for that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>For the very short time being Deputy Ryan, Minister for Finance, is part of a Government who were given authority by the people of this country to govern.  He cannot now <Col N="1694" /> stand up like Pontius Pilate, wash his hands, and say: &ldquo;Although beer has gone up by 20p in three years, we are not responsible&rdquo;.  If you are the Government, you should take action.  You came in on a 14-point plan, one of the main points of which was at least to hold prices and to reduce them as far as possible.  You cannot say the Dáil and the Government are not responsible, but the big, bad, publicans are responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In this little exchange of views here we have had a perfect example of the approach, not just of the Minister for Finance but of the Coalition in general, to responsibility and trying to get out from under.  You will have noticed, Sir, that the increased taxes in the Minister's view were not the responsibility of himself and his colleagues who voted for it, but of Dáil Éireann, not even the majority of Dáil Éireann but all of us were responsible.  He is sliding out there.  Then the increase which was not the result of increased taxes, he said, was the responsibility of the publicans, the brewers and so on, ignoring the extent to which that had <Col N="1696" /> been sanctioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and then saying that they were not responsible for the fact that people had increased the price illegally and the Government had not been able to do anything about it.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil were responsible for that because the law was not good enough.  The Minister knows that this kind of problem never arose in the past.  If the law was ineffective, he had three years in which to change it, but he did nothing about it.  He cannot win that argument either.  The fact is that this Government came into power saying they were going to stabilise prices and halt the price rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Stabilising prices was one of the headings in their 14-point plan.  The pint has increased by 20p. If the Minister remembers pre-decimal money he will realise that there has been an increase of 4s. on the pint in three years.  If one were to listen to the Minister for Finance one would imagine that no responsibility attaches to the Government for this. When we were in Government we were responsible for every single item of increase.  Suddenly even tax increases are not the responsibility of the Minister because he is recycling them back to the taxpayer.  He is also, as Deputy Burke said, recycling them, broadly speaking, to the gnomes of Zurich, but he does not like to talk about that.  The fact is that the pint has gone up under this Government by 20p. and there is very little to show for this enormous and inordinate increase except that it underlines the failure of this Government in this as in so many other areas to do anything effective even remotely like what they promised to do when they went before the people looking for their votes in the last general election.</P>
