    <Title>Juries Bill, 1975 [Seanad]: Committee Stage.</Title>
    <P>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act shall, to such extent as <Col N="384" /> may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds of thousands of people&mdash;I know this is a sweeping statement, but I cannot be accurate&mdash; who will be ineligible for jury service because they will be unable to afford it.  On the Second Stage of the Bill I, as well as others, mentioned that, in rural Ireland particularly, people will have to incur expenditure in travelling to the court, that if they have to travel the night before because the bus or train service is not suitable and have to stay in a hotel or guest-house that night, all this will be a severe drain on those who are unable to afford it.  I know this problem will not arise in city areas such as Dublin, but in rural parts it certainly will arise.  If somebody is called from the western part of Cork or Limerick to Limerick city or Cork city for jury service, the bus fare is at least £2.  If they have to be at the court at 10.30 in the morning they will have to go the evening before and stay overnight. If the case goes on for more than a day or two these people will be under considerable expense.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage we mentioned the word &ldquo;payment&rdquo; for jury service. That might convey the wrong meaning, in that I would be most anxious that legitimate expenses incurred by those who would be called for jury service would be met.</P>
    <P>There are 110,000 to 120,000 unemployed. As well as that there are in each of the health boards a large number of people, male and female, over the ages of 18 years on some form of allowance or other.  All of those would be involved.  Perhaps the purpose of this Bill is not being met when we say we intend to give everybody the opportunity to serve on juries if he or she is 18 and under 65.  There could be anything between 300,000 and 500,000 people who might not be eligible for jury service because they could not afford it.  I am sure if the finances of the nation allowed it, the Minister would be willing to accep my point of view.  It is unfortunate that at present the nation cannot afford it.  Some hope should be held out to <Col N="385" /> these people that they are not going to be debarred or automatically excluded from jury service because they cannot meet the expenses involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of anybody being debarred or rendered ineligible.  It will be for each individual citizen to decide whether he wants to fulfil his obligation under this Bill.  If he decides that in fulfilling this obligation he is going to impose an undue hardship on himself and on his dependants, he will then be perfectly free, like any other citizen who will be subject to hardship by having to fulfil his obligation for whatever reasons, to approach the county registrar and seek exemption.</P>
      <P>I do not anticipate that the numbers affected will be anything like the number Deputy Collins puts forward.  The number of people he mentions have to be considered in the national context, in a population of some millions of people.  The percentage then is small. Again when you take the random balloting procedure, the number that will be balloted on to a panel for a particular sitting will be small, and the proportion of people within that panel who might be hardship cases, such as Deputy Collins has in mind, would again be extremely small.  We have had people making the argument that jury service is not a privilege.  I think it is and it is a civic duty.  People have said that it may be a privilege and a duty but it is nonetheless a burden and we do not want persons to be burdened by it.  That is why the county registrar is given the right to exempt them.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that a good case for exemption would be where hardship would result.  You cannot argue on the one hand that we provide for meeting the hardship situation and, on the other hand, argue that this is an undue burden.  All we can do is provide for the undue burden.  I do not think that by doing that it can be said we are depriving people of their rights to appear on a jury.  They still have their rights, and, if for some extraneous reason, they are unable, without hardship, to fulfil their rights, we excuse them from having to carry out that duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins </NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that many more people would be eligible for jury service if it did not impose a financial burden on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney </NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not mix up eligibility with ability to attend.  They are all eligible.  The financial status of the person has no bearing whatever on his eligibility.  There may be some cases of the type posed by Deputy Collins where, while eligible, they will be unable for financial constraints to discharge their duty.  In those odd few cases the county registrar will exempt the jurors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins </NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that allowing that all are eligible, of all who are eligible, many more would be able to give jury service if it was not a financial burden on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney </NameTxt>
      <P>We are speculating as to how many would be unable to serve. I anticipate very few will be unable to serve on a jury because the number of such people in the total population represents only a very small percentage, and that is further diluted by the random picking of jury panels.  It would be a very rare case where a person will be unable to serve as a juror because of inability to meet travelling expenses to the county town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that anybody in rural Ireland who is called at random for jury service will have to pay his own expenses to get to the county town?  In this day and age these expenses are fairly high.  Unfortunately, many people in rural Ireland are on some sort of social welfare or in receipt of allowances from health boards, particularly those in the west.  Many of the people called, even if they are eligible, will be unable for financial reasons to fulfil their civic duties no matter how much they may want to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point, but I disagree with him when he says that many people will be unable to serve on juries because it would impose financial hardship.  There is no doubt that a person in rural <Col N="387" /> Ireland who gets a jury summons will have to get to the county town but that will not be a novel problem for him.  He has frequently to get to the county town on business of all sorts. It is closing our eyes to the realities of life in rural Ireland to suggest that all people in receipt of welfare have no means of transport.  One constantly hears about the queues of cars on certain days of the week in different areas.  I do not accept that people in rural Ireland who may be in receipt of State benefit of one kind or another are not in a position to organise transport for themselves, either their own transport or as they usually organise it when they have business in the county town with the county council, the county clinic or their solicitor.  It is part of their normal living to be able to get to the county town.  It is unreal to suggest that to come in for jury service would impose an undue hardship on them when they are doing this on a weekly or even a monthly basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that particularly in rural areas, there are many old cars, lovingly referred to as &ldquo;bangers&rdquo;, which are used to bring families to Mass or to villages and towns.  Some of these no doubt would make the 40 miles each way to the county town if petrol was a reasonable price. I can see the Minister's mind is made up on this.  Perhaps he might consider issuing travelling vouchers similar to those issued by the Department of Social Welfare to those who are called to courts of appeal when dealing with social welfare cases.  These vouchers would enable them to travel by public transport.  The Minister might consider this when issuing his instructions, either ministerial or statutory instruments, to the county registrars when he is implementing this Bill.  I do not want a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; now because I understand what is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated there was a car in nearly every home whether the people were on social welfare or not.  There are cars in <Col N="388" /> many homes but it would not be available to every member of the family who is 18 years or over.  If a man in that family is working he has the use of the car.  A person of 18 years living in Portumna and called for jury service in Galway city would have to travel 50 miles.  There is no bus service which will get him into the city in time to serve on jury duty and he has to come into the city the evening before.  Unless he is provided with expenses he will be unable to serve on a jury.  Expenses are even more important when a man is unemployed.</P>
      <P>I realise that people can be exempt from jury service if they cannot afford it but I can see this being abused by people who can afford it but pretend they cannot merely to be exempt.  Up to now if a person wished to be exempt from jury service he had to provide a doctor's certificate.  Is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be a ground at the moment.  One would not expect it to arise now because jurors are confined to the more prosperous section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan </NameTxt>
      <P>My point is this. Who will define whether a person can afford it?  I am in favour of women serving on juries but I can see very few women wanting to do this.  I am worried that too many people will seek exemptions, quite apart from those who genuinely cannot afford to serve.  I have never been called to serve on a jury but I know of people who have been called and they had to leave their farms at a time when they were badly needed there.  Small farmers do their best to get exempted because they do not want to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This may lead to a situation where juries are drawn from the affluent society because the plain people may not be able to afford to serve.  I should not like to see this happen and neither would the Minister but it will happen unless there is some form of voucher system.  Deputy Collins mentioned this; at least people should be entitled to free travel.  In many cases they have to stay overnight.  It is just not on to say that everyone over 18 years is eligible to serve on a jury <Col N="389" /> when no expenses are provided even for the unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney </NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that people with the means to serve on juries without any hardship would be able to fool a county registrar that it was a hardship on the grounds of means.  The county registrar will have certain means of information to check an application on those grounds. County registrars are men of common sense and I have no doubt that they will inform themselves before they rule on an application.  I do not anticipate that any undeserving people will escape their liability in that way.</P>
      <P>I take the point made by Deputies Collins and Callanan that in the case of an unemployed person, particularly an urban unemployed person or a person who is in receipt of what is known as the small farmer's dole, it would be an undue hardship for him to attend at the county town.  However, having regard to the way the jury franchise has been extended, the numbers involved at any particular sitting would be very few.  It is up to them to make the move to the county registrar.  The latter will exercise his common sense and he will have access to information &mdash;I am sure if he required information from people connected with my Department he would be assisted&mdash;and the registrar would be able to inform himself of the <i>bona fides</i> of an application. I am satisfied that there would not be an injustice.</P>
      <P>It would be regrettable that because of his financial position a citizen might have to seek exemption.  However, to try to cover every eventuality, to ensure that every citizen would be urged towards the jury room and that nobody would find himself unable to serve, would envisage building a large administrative structure.  The question of vouchers was mentioned.  It is an attractive idea but when one thinks about it one can see the snags.  First, should it be on a means test basis? Should it relate to the type of assistance to the person concerned, whether it be unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or a disabled person's allowance.  There is a fair amount of bureaucracy immediately&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="390" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is considering the matter, I would ask him not to have a means test basis. Have vouchers available for all on application because the buses on the roads are empty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney </NameTxt>
      <P>The simple voucher may not be enough to meet the needs of the person in the category mentioned. He might need more than just a voucher for transport.  The position is bedevilled with problems.  I think the best solution is to leave it to the common sense of the county registrar to exempt the man who would be genuinely prejudiced by a summons to serve on a jury.  If a person is so genuinely prejudiced that he wants to get off, let him make the choice.  In spite of the fact that the person may find it a hardship, if he wants to discharge his duty by serving fair play to him, but if he does not want to do this let him be exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan </NameTxt>
      <P>The only way a person can be granted exemption is on production of a medical certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney </NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position at the moment but the Bill will change that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan </NameTxt>
      <P>I know quite a number of people get exemption by producing a doctor's certificate.  There is now the question of the person not being able to afford to serve and the county registrar will decide.  Investigating whether a man can afford to serve will be a long job.  I am convinced this is wide open.  How will the investigation be carried out quickly?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the matter of vouchers.  It would help in one way in that the person called to serve on a jury could leave the family car at home.  As a result, the family would not suffer such great hardship.  I am anxious to know how it can be decided quickly who will be exempt on the grounds of not being able to afford to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Deputy has said about releasing the car for the rest of the family.  At that stage it is a question of the convenience <Col N="391" /> of the community as against the family and I do not know if the family would be entitled to be convenienced at the expense of the community. Certainly there is room for argument here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens if the man's son is working and needs the car?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney </NameTxt>
      <P>That problem would arise if the mother had to go to the dentist.  These problems have to be met and solved; they are part of everyday life.  The Deputy raised the question of who would investigate the matter quickly.  Under the regime proposed in the Bill the jury summons would be served four or six weeks before the jury man is wanted and there would be that interval of time available for investigation.  The person will apply for exemption and he will have to state his grounds.  A phone call or a letter from the county registrar to the person seeking exemption, or to some other source where the registrar might expect information to assist him in making a decision, could be done within a matter of days.</P>
      <P>I do not anticipate that county registrars will be snowed under by applications for exemption.  Because of the widening of the franchise new people will be coming in and they will be prepared to carry out this new duty.  At the moment because it has been falling more frequently on a small class of citizens there was a temptation to seek exemption but I think this will be largely removed.  As in all cases where a new procedure is prescribed, we will have to wait and see what teething troubles arise but I do not anticipate any in that direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a person's civic duty to serve on a jury.  I would cite the case of a man of modest means, or even someone on social welfare.  This person makes a big effort to attend, perhaps hitching a ride early in the morning, and he finds himself on a panel.  If that case continues for a few days or even a few weeks in the middle of the trial that man through no fault of his own might <Col N="392" /> become physically unfit to be present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it was a privilege for young people to be qualified for jury service.  What good is that if they cannot enjoy it?  He said that people did not find any difficulty in going to towns from the country to do their business.  He knows that jury trials can go on for as long as three weeks in the country and jurors would have to be in town at 10.15 every morning.  That situation would be intolerable and impossible for a person on social welfare benefits.  To travel from Skibbereen to Cork would cost him £2.50 each day and meals would cost him another £2.  That could go on for five days each week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was a likelihood that a person of limited means would be empanelled in a trial lasting three weeks, I have no doubt that rather than have the jury discharged and the necessity for a further trial, the Garda would make informal arrangements to have the person excused.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 12, after &ldquo;service&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or is a Peace Commissioner&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment is designed to exclude PCs from jury service.  The present position is that PCs are excluded from service.  They were set up under section 4 of the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923 which sets out the duties they perform.  Some of those duties would probably mean that when they came to sit on juries they would have had knowledge of the preliminary proceedings and accordingly would be unable and unfit to sit on juries.  Having regard to that, I submit the Minister should accept the amendment and exclude them from jury service.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="394" /> There is another point.  PCs do quite a lot of work for nothing.  They may be called to a Garda station at any hour of day or night and they give the State such services for nothing.  The least we can do in return is to exclude them from jury service. I do not think there would be any great administrative difficulty in doing so.</P>

They do an enormous amount of work for nothing and, as Deputy Dockrell has said, they may have remanded people at the preliminary hearings and should, therefore, not be qualified for jury service. Apart from that, they spend half their days filling in forms and for that reason alone they should be excused from service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney </NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the argument in favour of the amendment but I am regretfully unable to accept it because I think the counter arguments are stronger.  The first is that the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in their second interim report went into this question of exemption in considerable detail and had the benefit of submissions from a wide range of people some of whom had been involved in jury service, in empanelling juries.  Having had the benefit of those submissions, the committee recommended that the list of exemptions are drastically curtailed, and among the people they recommended to lose exemptions were PCs. <Col N="395" /> I am following the recommendation of that expert committee in that respect.  Because of the general nature of the report the recommendations have to be given a great deal of weight and that reinforces me in my view that removing the exemption for peace commissioners is the correct procedure.</P>
      <P>It was suggested by Deputy Dockrell, and Deputy Callanan supports him in this, that peace commissioners could possibly have knowledge by virtue of exercising their functions as peace commissioners in particular cases.  Were that to happen such a peace commissioner would be automatically ineligible by virtue of section 15 since he would be a person who would have a connection with the case.  He would have a positive duty so to inform the court and, if he did not do so, he would be subject to penalty.  That is the only instance in which a peace commissioner's function would lead him into a situation where there could be a conflict and that is provided for.  He would be ineligible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan suggested these men are performing an unpaid service to the State and, in return, the State should not ask them to perform this duty.  Peace commissioners do not look on their office as a burden.  I think they regard it as an honour.  If we were to exempt peace commissioners then the same arguments would apply to notaries public or commissioners for oaths and we do not propose to exempt them.  I do not see any good reason for exempting peace commissioners and it has come to my knowledge that in the recent past the motivation for seeking appointment as peace commissioner was to seek exemption from jury service.</P>

The Minister would be well advised to re-enact the provisions of the 1927 Act <i>in toto</i> to cover this question of procedure in service and mode of service and proof of service of a summons.  It does not say in this section by whom the summons must be served.  It must be served by hand.  It does not say whose hand.  It does not state on whom the summons must be served by hand. Suppose whoever serves it goes to the residence of the juror and finds nobody there, or perhaps a child three or four years of age or an imbecile. The situation is not covered by that. How is the proof of service of the summons going to be made in the case if it is a member of the Garda who must serve the summons?

It can be done in two ways, by post or delivered by hand. It is not necessary to say who will be the competent person to deliver by hand.  It is enough to provide that it may be delivered by hand.  It is then for the county registrar to decide who should deliver it by hand, maybe it is the Garda Síochána, or some of his own staff who could go around the town and deliver the summonses by hand, but more than likely they will be sent by post.  The proof of service is provided for in subsections (3) and (4).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me point out a very practical difficulty which will be experienced which might slow down the operation and cause great inconvenience. It will arise by serving the jury summons by post particularly having regard to the state of the register of electors.  Unfortunately, in many parts of the country the register of electors is not as good as it should be.  It is not as properly compiled as it should be.  The most recent register of electors the Minister's party and my party had to deal with was that in the west of Ireland where it was clearly obvious to us, when we availed of the free postage facilities to send literature to all electors on the register, that many hundreds of those people were not present at their addresses.  There was seasonal migration.  We know that we got hundreds of those letters back and I am sure the Minister's party also did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my area of the south west we <Col N="402" /> have seasonal migration so that many people on the register are away.  We also have the practice in the western parts of the country that young people have jobs in the city and come home for the weekend but are registered at their home addresses for election purposes because that is their only base. If I am a county registrar and I post out 50 notices to people to attend for the panel of jurors, many of those people might not be there and might not get their postage for weeks.  The whole thing will probably grind slowly to a halt.  I know the Minister has discretion here under the section which says that it may be sent by post or delivered by hand.  I ask him not to rely to any great extent on the delivery by post.  The postman will deliver the letter to the house but the person might not be there.</P>
    <P>The county registrar will not know that the person is not at home and when that person fails to turn up the county registrar will issue a summons as is his right under the measure. People will be charged in the court who were probably picking potatoes or working on the beet crops but who are on the register.  If a number of people are to be called from an area or a parish, perhaps the Minister might enlist the aid of the Garda Síochána to deliver the jury summons. I know it is an extra duty to put on them but I am sure the Minister, being a practising politician, will agree that the problem I speak of exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well appreciate the problem put forward by Deputy Collins.  I will arrange to have it drawn to the attention of county registrars because it would set the whole thing at nought if we found that our summonses were ineffective.  I imagine this procedure will probably be of help to the Deputy and me at certain times of the year.  It will mean that the registers will be more carefully checked before they are printed henceforth.  I understand that the Department of Local Government have been apprised of the difficulties which may arise in relation to what the Deputy says.  They are endeavouring to ensure that addresses will be precise and that registers will be as <Col N="403" /> accurate as possible.  I will draw the attention of county registrars to the need to be careful in using the registers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this section because of the difficulty, for practical reasons, of putting it into operation.  During the debate on Second Stage I pointed out that the section reminded me of the parable of the man who gave the wedding feast.  When his guests did not turn up, he sent his servants out to invite those on the highways and byways to partake of his hospitality.  I will not continue with the parable because the Minister and Deputies are as familiar with it as I am but there is a comparison. If it appears to a judge of a court that the jury to try any issue before the court may be incomplete, he may require any qualified persons to be summoned by the county registrar in order to make up the number needed.  This is the relevance of the part of the parable to which I referred. Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>The judge shall specify the area from which persons may be summoned (which may be the area in the vicinity of the court) and the method of summons, whether by written notice or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I have not been to courts as often as members of the legal profession but the few times I have been there I was not very impressed.  People looked worried and were very anxious.  They seemed to be preoccupied with their problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is to cover what I expect will be an extremely rare situation.  It is possibly an ultra-cautious provision because I do not anticipate that the situation it envisages will ever arise.  Suppose the panel of jurors had an inordinately large number of people who were ineligible, disqualified or had good reason to be excused or that there was a large number of challenges and several juries were required and all the challenges were used to the full. In that case one could find that the panel would be so attenuated that there would not be sufficient to form the jury or juries necessary.  At that stage the parties might be in court and the witnesses might be in court. All the parties concerned with the trial might have assembled.  It would be preferable at that stage to bring in more jurors rather than send everybody away, including the jurors who had come and who were not sufficient in number.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has misunderstood the phrase &ldquo;which may be in the area in the vicinity of the court&rdquo;.  It does not mean within the actual environs of the court building itself.  It refers to the town in which the sitting is taking place.  &ldquo;Vicinity&rdquo; does not mean the actual court.  It means the town, so the judge would not be under an obligation to make sure that some of the panel he has drawn in came from, perhaps, 30 miles away at the other end of the county.  He could, because this is an emergency situation, take them from the town in which the sitting is taking place.  I do not believe there could be any hardship or injustice caused to anybody because it would be a random sample of citizens coming in to make up the jury and try this particular issue.</P>

      <P>There is a problem. The Minister has stated that this would be a very rare occasion, perhaps once in a lifetime.  If that is so, that probably strengthens my argument. If it is to be as rare as the <Col N="405" /> Minister thinks, he should drop it and start up afresh.  If I am in my county town going about my legitimate business and am reasonably busy and I am stopped and told: &ldquo;I want you&rdquo;&mdash;it is like the old posters one used to see in England headed: &ldquo;Your country needs you,&rdquo; and having a picture of a man with a moustache pointing his finger at you&mdash;I will feel a sense of resentment.  I have not made provision. I have to down tools, as it were.  I have not got my own house in order.  I will be brought into a court and I will feel resentful.  Human nature being what it is a person will say: &ldquo;What is this all about?  I am willing to do my duty in the proper way.  Why can I not be notified in the proper way?&rdquo; It might do harm to the whole system.  It might do harm to the courts.  This is a layman's view. Even if it will happen only rarely, I think we should drop it and start afresh.  I hope I would not be unfair to the accused or cause any problems. I can see that too.</P>

What we are proposing here is not a new procedure. In effect, this power has been there since 1927 and it has never been the subject of complaint even with the present limited jury franchise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I find this section objectionable.  Together with my colleague Deputy Collins I appeal to the Minister to drop it.  What we are doing here is updating and modernising our jury system.  This is a piece of modern legislation enacted by the Dáil in 1976. It is very important that it should have a modern look about it, and that it should be in keeping with the standards and concepts of today.  I want to suggest that this section is not.  This section is archaic and feudal in its implications and in its proposed method of operation.  To me it savours of the old press-gang concept.  If the State needed citizens to man the warships or to carry out any other particularly urgent task, it went out into the highways and the byways and gathered up the first people available and pressed them into service.</P>
      <P>To me the basic concept behind this section is objectionable in that way.  It is feudal in its approach.  The Minister is setting up a new modern structure for the conduct of jury trials.  He is setting out for us here in this legislation a sensible, practical, workable, series of proposals which conform with the recent Supreme Court decision in regard to the status of women in our society.  It seems to me that the Bill is related to the circumstances of today, to the life style of today, to the way in which people have to go about their business in these times, and earn their livelihood, and so on.  Generally speaking, the Bill conforms to the modern situation and is related to modern circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here it seems to me we have a hangover from different times.  In fact, the Minister gave a clue to that when he said there is nothing new about the section or about these provisions.  That is precisely the point.  There is nothing new about them.  They are old.  They are archaic.  They should be done away with.  I do not think that, with proper planning by a county registrar, the situation should ever arise where these provisions would have to be invoked.  If some peculiar combination of untoward circumstances bring about a situation where an adequate number of juries cannot <Col N="407" /> be empanelled, as Deputy Collins suggested, the trial should be postponed.</P>
    <P>The trial of a citizen before the courts is much too important to be left to this sort of haphazard <i>ad hoc</i> procedure. It is a relic of the feudal past. I do not know if the Minister is satisfied that under these procedures the county registrar could guarantee that the sort of persons he will gather up for jury service in this way would be suitable and competent people.  Maybe I am taking a pessimistic view but I would visualise that this procedure could throw up a very unbalanced and unsuitable type of jury.  This is a sort of emergency procedure of going out into the streets, practically, and empanelling whoever happens to be available.</P>
    <P>If the Minister looked at it from this point of view he would see this section is not in keeping with the general tenor of the Bill, or with the other modernised and up to date provisions&mdash;in particular the proposal in subsection (3) that persons who are summoned in this cavalier way will not have the right of appeal from the county registrar.  All in all it is not an appropriate section in this type of legislation.  I suggest very strongly to the Minister that he should discard it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few comments on this section. I am speaking with past practical experience as a rural practitioner.  I do not anticipate this will arise before a Dublin criminal session court.  I could see it happening in relation to a country court.  Looking at this section it is well to bear in mind that it will not necessarily be availed of at the last moment.  We must remember that the summonses are out.  The county registrar is getting the message back as to service, as to people looking for exemptions, as to medical certificates coming in from people who are ill and unable to attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose a circuit judge is sitting in Kilkenny Circuit Court and next week there is a session of the Wexford Criminal Circuit Court.  The county registrar in Wexford can contact the <Col N="408" /> circuit judge and get a direction from him to avail of this section to make quite certain there is an adequate number of jurors.  The summonses have gone out to the panel.  This is something which turns up as a result of something else occurring.</P>
    <P>I can foresee another difficulty arising.  Where people are indicted and go before a criminal court there might be six or eight people up for trial.  The bush telegraph says so many will not contest and will plead guilty. At the last moment somebody changes his mind and a jury will be required to try that case.  That means you have to have jurors prepared for that sort of situation.  In all my time practising both for prosecution and defence in criminal jury cases, it has never occurred that we have run out of juries.  I recollect on one occasion where I had challenges in hand, I did not avail of them because my client wanted his trial to go on.  While there might have been a doubt about the acceptability, from the point of view of the defence, of the last few jurors who were available, we took a chance and took those jurors because my client wanted his case on.  It was fair enough.  I had travelled 70 or 80 miles to be there for the trial; the solicitor who instructed me maybe another 30 or 40 miles, and the accused had his witnesses there.</P>
    <P>I have instanced two things; last minute illnesses and change of plea by the accused.  This does create a difficulty from the point of view of the registrar.  I can say that the registrars who acted in any courts that I was in were competent men and were always able to anticipate, although there have been a few narrow shaves due to last minute changes.  It will be a real hardship to the accused if this provision is not passed.  It is in ease of the accused because, as I see it, it makes quite certain that there is an adequate number of jurors from which the accused can raise his challenges. I would hate to see any person in the situation I outlined where, because the accused wanted his trial on, we did not exercise our right to challenge any jurors but took the last jurors that were available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little confused about this provision.  Deputy Esmonde was saying it would appear the judge would have to have a standby local panel in case there would be a shortage.  Deputy Collins's interpretation was that when the shortage occurred the judge would have authority to send out for the jurors there and then and I would be very much opposed to that.  When a person is summoned to serve on a jury he should have time to make up his mind about it and to make arrangements. If he is called in without being properly summoned, I do not think that person is in a proper state of mind to try anybody.  As far as the accused is concerned, if he is a country man he might be looking for a country jury. In this case it is all townspeople, wherever the court is being held, that would have to be called in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the section is essentially a sensible one.  What Deputy Esmonde had to say is of great importance in trying to assess the arguments for and against it.  Essentially it is in ease of the parties, particularly in criminal cases.  We are talking about rural Circuit Courts where juries would be summoned in criminal cases only, and we are talking about the case where a defendant would be ready for his trial and the witnesses would be present.  Possibly he has gone to the expense of providing for representation and then finds that his expenses are going to be doubled because there is not a sufficient number of jurors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to weigh up the arguments put forward by Deputy Haughey and answer the questions raised by Deputy Callanan in deciding whether the disadvantages of what we are proposing to do outweigh the advantages which Deputy Esmonde pointed out.  Deputy Callanan asked when the jurymen would be called in.  Deputy Collins was envisaging that this would be an eleventh hour or even a twelfth hour procedure.  Deputy Esmonde had in mind that the warning signs would come up earlier.  I think the scenario painted by Deputy Esmonde would be the more likely one for the reason that the normal panel is summoned four <Col N="410" /> to six weeks in advance.  The signs will be available to the country registrar over that period that the panel is getting thin, that the excusals, the disqualifications, cases of ineligibility, medical certificates and so on are going to be unusually high.  So that the judge should not find on the morning of the court&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the section says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The section says:</P>
      <P>The judge shall specify the area from which persons may be summoned (which may be the area in the vicinity of the court).</P>
      <P>I envisage that when the court will be in session and we are going to run short of manpower&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I finish?  We have to try to envisage circumstances in which this is going to arise, and circumstances will arise if there is an unusually large number of exemptions for whatever reason.  That information will normally be known to the county registrar a week or a fortnight in advance of the sitting.  The judge will have that knowledge, because it will have been made known to him by the county registrar, and then the mechanism provided by the section will come into play.</P>
      <P>It could be a last minute happening, for example, if there were a very high number of exemptions that did not appear in advance so as to justify warning the judge earlier.  Supposing it turned out that there were a large number of challenges; if there were two defendants and the prosecutor, that would give a total of 21 challenges without cause, and if there were further challenges with cause, the panel could be suddenly attenuated. At this stage, too, this procedure would be available to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might not be possible at that stage, because of the time that would be involved, to have the extra jurors summoned there for that day.  It would probably be adjourned to the next day.  The judge might decide in his discretion, after hearing the <Col N="411" /> parties&mdash;and they are the people for whose benefit the whole trial is taking place&mdash;that they would have to adjourn the trial until the full panel would be available at the next sitting.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan raised the point as to where the jurors would be called from and asked what would happen if a country man was being tried and he wanted a jury of countrymen; if this section were invoked he thought the county registrar would be forced to go into the town because of convenience of distance.  At that stage the parties to the case would be entitled to object and could exercise their challenges against these extra people coming in, or they could say to the judge that they consider such a panel would be unduly limited having regard to the background of their client and the nature of the case against him, which might have rural overtones to it.  In that case one would hope that the judge would exercise his judicial discretion and say: &ldquo;Very well, we will wait until the next sitting.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The judge has a discretion which is exercised in the interests of justice, that is, in the interests of the parties before him.  If he, in his discretion, decides that this is not a proper procedure for this particular case, it may be adjourned until the next sitting.  But if the parties are agreeable and anxious to go on, he has this machinery to invoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey objected to it on the grounds that it had feudal overtones or that there was a press-gang atmosphere about it.  I reject that <Col N="412" /> analogy because the press-gang was to bring people in and send them off on war service from which they might never return.  All we are asking here is that people serve on a jury for a day or even part of a day.  The press-gang were not entitled to seek excusals. There was no appeal once they were on board ship.  In my view, it is not a feudal idea either.  It may have a certain swiftness and cutting through red tape to which we are not accustomed when providing statutory provisions, but it may be refreshing for that.  The principle is the same.  The people are being summoned by the court on a random basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Without notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With shorter notice. This is the difference, but the principle of summoning the citizens to perform a jury service is what is involved. The difference is a matter of procedure in that the notice is shorter.  Deputy Haughey says there should be proper planning by the county registrar when calling juries.  There is no planning in the sense of being able to reordain anything with regard to jury service henceforth.  It will be random non-discriminatory, by lottery.  That excludes any element of planning.  Deputy Haughey said that bringing in people off the street would be a haphazard and <i>ad hoc</i> procedure.  This is essentially the nature of summoning juries from now on.  It will be haphazard <i>ad hoc</i>, random, non-discriminatory, by lottery.  There will be no preplanning about it.  A motley collection of citizens will eventually gather from which a jury will be picked.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey said there would be a danger that suitable and competent people might not be brought in under this emergency stipulation.  This Bill now proposes that all citizens on the electoral register are, by definition, suitable and competent people.  To bring in a random selection from the vicinity of the court is not doing anything different from what the Bill proposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Weighing up the situation where the parties are assembled and the accused is anxious to get on with the case, <Col N="413" /> and the hardship that would be inflicted on him if he could not get a jury for his trial, against difficulties of getting in a jury under the unusual procedure devised by this section, in my view the balance is in favour of giving the power to the court to act in ease of the parties before it, that is, acting in the interests of justice.  The mechanics provided are not such as to take away from the interest of the parties or to lessen the justice they are entitled to.  Should there be any element of that in it by virtue of the arguments put forward by Deputy Callanan and Deputy Haughey, the judge intervenes.  That is his function.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this section visualises a situation where people are literally brought in from the highways and the byways in the vicinity of the courts?  The judge may dispense with written notice and instruct an officer of the court, a member of the Garda Síochána to go out and bring in another few dozen people for the jury panel.  In the meantime, the court will be held up.  Is that right?</P>

      <P>Where will the Garda go?  Into the first pub and then the next and the next.  There are plenty of pubs near courthouses all over the country.  As a result, we will wind up with 20 or 30 people who have come out of the pubs who are probably going to, or going from, the dole because they are unemployed.  In this way we will not have the representative jury panel envisaged by the Minister.  That would be inevitable in such a situation.</P>
      <P>This system is too random, slipshod and haphazard.  While I agree with the picture painted by Deputy Esmonde, I do not think any accused would be satisfied with that type of system.  It could work against him rather than for him.</P>

      <P>We have to assume on the part of our Judiciary a certain concern for the parties before them and a certain anxiety to dispense justice.  Dispensing justice means keeping the interests of the parties paramount. We have to assume that what the parties would say would be a matter of great concern, and possibly the only concern, to the judge.  I envisage that any situation where the person has to be literally captured in the street and brought in would be only where there was a shortage of one or, possibly, two on a jury.  If a judge, in his wisdom, and with the consent of the parties, decided to make up a deficiency of five or six, I am sure he would do so in such a way that it would not bring in the type of citizenry suggested by Deputy Brosnan, although they are perfectly eligible, suitable and competent to act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the Minister is putting the situation completely in reverse to what it is.  This section does not confer any rights whatever on the parties.  It confers the rights in the operation of this procedure <Col N="415" /> entirely on the judge and the county registrar.  If the Minister is prepared to write into the section a right by the parties to object to the procedure being invoked the section would be much less objectionable from my point of view.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde made a persuasive case but I suggest it does not stand up.  He was inclined to suggest that there would not be any great rush or expediency about this, that it would be known in advance and that plans would be laid.  That is not what is in the section.  The section has an urgency and an immediacy in its wording&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>If it appears to a judge of a court that a jury to try any issue before the court will or may be incomplete,...</P>
      <P>We are talking about a jury in the court, about the judge and the case before the court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording is &ldquo;If it appears to a judge of a court...&rdquo;.  It can be indicated to the judge in advance. He does not have to make the decision in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>To me the wording clearly envisages the court being in session when this arises.  I am quite satisfied that is what is intended by the section; if anything else was intended some other procedure could be invoked by the country registrar.  The Bill would enable the county registrar to deal with the situation through the normal processes laid down by the Bill if the situation is clear to him in advance of the sitting.  I suggest to Deputy Esmonde that the nice, safe suggestion he has made does not stand up.  As Deputy Brosnan pointed out clearly, what is involved here is last-minute, emergency pressgang procedure, where the court is sitting, where suddenly at the last minute it becomes apparent that there will not be enough <Col N="416" /> people to man the jury, and where the officers of the court go out to get people in from the highways and the byways.  Let us be clear what we are talking about.</P>
      <P>If we are talking about a situation that can be planned in advance that is different.  However, we are not talking about that; the section is quite clear. Nothing the Minister has said makes this in any way more attractive to me. It still smacks of the old feudal idea that it is possible to go out and dragoon citizens from the work bench, from their place of entertainment or wherever they may be, and press them into the jury box.  That is completely out of keeping with a modern, up-to-date piece of legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister is putting this before us on the basis of fairness to the accused.  I suggest that is not the situation here.  I suggest the position undoubtedly will be that the accused in such circumstances can have no guarantee whatever of what kind of jury will be turned up.  I do not think there is anything far-fetched about what Deputy Brosnan said, about going across the road into the nearest pub or to the nearest place of entertainment and dragooning the appropriate number of people to do the job.  Whatever objection the accused might have to a delay in bringing the trial to completion, he would be much more concerned with making sure he got a fair trial and I do not think anybody in this House would argue that point.  Except in the case of a complete and utter recidivist, I do not think it is possible to visualise that there would be any question that an accused person would prefer the trial over and done with rather than get a fair trial.  I do not think we should hear any more of that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are concerned with here is laying down proper procedures for the empanelling of decent juries, good men and true, fellow citizens to try criminal cases.  We want those procedures which we are laying down in this legislation to be suited and adapted to the circumstances of modern life.  On the whole the Bill does that quite well except in this one instance.  However, for some reason or other this relic of former <Col N="417" /> feudal times and old legal traditions which are better done away with has survived into this legislation.  I strongly suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider the whole provision.</P>
    <P>I noticed when the Minister was defending this provision that from time to time he had to say that if there was anything undesirable about it, if it did not appear to be satisfactory, that the case could be adjourned until the next day or week.  That is defeating his own argument.</P>

      <P>Most ordinary decent, respectable citizens would be going about their lawful jobs and business.  The Minister keeps saying that if the parties do not like it they can ask for an adjournment but there is nothing in the section about it.  It is left entirely to the judge to decide whether to adopt this procedure and <Col N="418" /> to go ahead with it.  If the section goes through, I suggest the parties would have no grounds for asking for an adjournment.  On the Minister's own evidence they would have their counsel and witnesses there and, therefore, the accused or his legal representative could not seek an adjournment because he did not like the procedure or the kind of jury turned up by the procedure.  I feel quite strongly that this is an undesirable relic of olden days that has crept back into this modern legislation and it should be got rid of.</P>
      <P>The last point I wish to make refers to the convenience of the ordinary citizen.  Jury service is an onerous obligation which citizens have to undertake.  It is onerous in the normal course of events but at least when a citizen gets notice about jury service on a certain day he can make his plans accordingly.  However, under this procedure people will be pressed into service without any notice.  That is unfair and it could result in serious inconvenience and hardship for certain people.  It might not bother unduly the lads across the way in the pub, but some person going about his lawful business suddenly finds the heavy hand of the law descending on him and at a minute's notice he has to go into court and serve on a jury. I think that is very unfair.  I do not think anything can be said for this section and I strongly suggest that the Minister dispense with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey raised the question as to when it would come into being.  It could come into play 14 days before the trial, because if the warning signs are longer than 14 days before the trial then a jury summons could be issued.  From 14 days before the day of the trial this procedure will be available whether the court is sitting or not because it refers to a judge of the court and that does not preclude the judge from hearing this in chambers in another town.  Cognisance should be taken in advance of a possibility arising that a jury would be incomplete to enable proper action to be taken, so the procedure might be in effect at any time <Col N="419" /> for up to 13 days before the sitting of the court.  This is a matter that has to be left to the judicial discretion of the court to exercise reasonably and in the interests of justice.  If you had a witness coming from England or further afield and there was one juryman missing, quite clearly the proceedings set out here should be adopted.  I think the Bill would be considerably lacking if it did not provide for that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy G. Collins.</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (3), line 52, after ballot to insert &ldquo;; and it shall be the duty of the judge to explain to the jurors the nature of the trial or the action to be heard by them and the parties thereto so that any potential juror who may have an interest in or connection with the case or the parties shall communicate the fact to the judge, if he is selected on the ballot.</P>
      <P>I think it should be very clear what Deputy Collins is seeking in this amendment.  Section 15 deals with the selection of persons to be empanelled as jurors and stipulates that it shall be made by balloting in open court.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>The power of summoning jurors under section 14 may be exercised after balloting has begun, as well as earlier, and if it is exercised after balloting has begun the judge may dispense with balloting for persons summoned under that section.</P>
      <P>That would take care of the situation arising out of the undesirable procedure laid down in section 14.  Subsection 3 is as follows:</P>
      <P>Before the selection is begun the judge shall warn the jurors present that they must not serve if they are ineligible or disqualified and as to the penalty under section 36 for doing so; and he shall invite any person who knows that he is not qualified to serve or who is in doubt as to whether he is qualified or who may have an interest in or connection with the case or the parties to communicate the fact to the judge (either orally or otherwise as the judge may direct or authorise) if he is selected on the ballot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a very reasonable proposal by Deputy Collins.  Subsection 3 deals with the question of ineligibility <Col N="421" /> or disqualification and the penalties which jurors would incur by acting as jurymen if they were not fully qualified or eligible.  The judge warns them about that but the subsection does not give any indication about how they are to come to the decision that they are ineligible or unqualified.  It does not help them in any way, it is totally <i>in terrorem</i>, if you like.  It simply confines itself to the manner of their being ineligible or disqualified and Deputy Collins wants to make the judge tell us what the action is about and therefore they would be in a much better position to decide whether they could say to the judge &ldquo;I think I am disqualified&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Cavan</i>): It is not proposed to accept the amendment.  Section 15 (3) provides that, before the balloting for a particular jury is begun, the judge shall warn the jurors present that they must not serve if ineligible or disqualified.  It also provides that he shall invite any juror who may not be qualified &ldquo;or who may have an interest in or connection with the case or the parties&rdquo; to mention the fact if he is selected on the ballot.  The amendment would add a provision relating to the words quoted.  The amendment would provide that it shall be the duty of the judge to explain to the jurors &ldquo;the nature of the trial or the action to be heard by them and the parties thereto&rdquo;, so that a juror may mention his interest or connection, if any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Presumably the idea behind the amendment is that, unless the jurors are told who are the parties and what the case is about, they will not know whether there is any fact which they should mention.  It is true that they may not know this, but the amendment is unnecessary, because clearly the judge will have to give the assembled jurors the necessary information in any event.  For example, in a civil case he might give the names and addresses of the parties and say that the action is for breach of contract, trespass, libel or whatever it is, and in a criminal case he might say that the accused is so-and-so and is charged with burgling the house of so-and-so.  It can be left <Col N="422" /> to the judge to decide how much he need tell the jury in order to enable them to say whether they should mention any facts that might make it undesirable that they should serve on the jury.</P>
    <P>The amendment as worded would require the judge to explain to the jurors &ldquo;the nature of...the parties&rdquo; to the action.  This is probably only a drafting slip, as it would be clearly wrong for the judge to tell the jurors anything about a party except his name and, where appropriate, his address and any other fact essential to an understanding of what the case is about.  It is not considered necessary and, therefore, it is not proposed to accept it.  As the Deputy will know, a jury is often empanelled in the High Court to try a number of cases.  That is a quite frequent occurrence and if a judge had to explain all about each case it would be very unwieldly.  As well as that, the provision for challenging, which has been extended, should obviate the necessity for any such elaborate procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that subsection (3) places the onus on a juror but does not make any provision for any guidance to enable him to come to a proper decision.  If, as the Minister says, the amendment is unnecessary&mdash;it is not harmful, or detrimental, but just unnecessary&mdash;then he is really compelled, I think, to accept it.  It is clearly desirable, if not strictly mandatory and necessary, that the judge should&mdash;remember, these unfortunate jurors are in strange circumstances and, for the first time, perhaps, in this intimidating atmosphere&mdash;give some direction, guidance or help to enable a juror to say that, in view of what the judge has said, he realises he is disqualified or ineligible to sit.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This subsection deals with a number of things.  It deals with people who are ineligible and with people who are disqualified. They are ineligible or disqualified for a number of reasons, one of which may be that, although they are on the register, they have not attained 18 years of age, or they might be in a category declared ineligible or <Col N="423" /> disqualified.  These will already have been notified because it is provided that the summons shall be accompanied by a memorandum setting out those who are disqualified or ineligible. That being so, the only other reason why a person should not serve on a jury would be that he was in some way connected with the parties, had some particular knowledge or some particular association.  The judge will be at liberty to give a brief synopsis of the case.  The parties are always known because the registrar says: &ldquo;I am now about to call the jury to try the case of So-and-So&rdquo;.  In the High Court in Dublin that might not convey much but in the country it will certainly convey a great deal.  In a criminal case the registrar reads over the charges to the accused person.  And then empanels the jury and, in those circumstances, the jury must have a fair idea and it will be open to any juror to ask the judge for further information if he has any doubt.  For these reasons I believe the amendment is neither desirable nor necessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3 in the name of my colleague, Deputy Collins:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2), line 26, after &ldquo;separately&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or in such numbers as the judge may in his discretion decide&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is related to subsection (2) which section states that the jury shall be sworn separately.  Deputy Collins' amendment seeks to make that more flexible, to enable the judge if he wishes, to swear the whole jury together.  I think it is a legitimate opinion that it would add to the solemnity of the occasion if the jury were all sworn together.  I think that is what Deputy Collins had in mind rather than any time saving element.  If a judge wished to do so he would be entitled to swear the entire jury at once, together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>The time element should be taken into account, because with the increased number of challenges open to parties under this Bill <Col N="428" /> that is inevitably going to lengthen the empanelling of the jury considerably. The swearing of jurors one by one separately is completely unnecessary. They should be sworn in batches, except perhaps in criminal trials on the application of an accused person.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I regret I do not propose to accept the amendment for the following reason. Section 17, subsection (2) replaces section 53 (1) of the 1927 Act which provides that in capital cases, jurors are to be sworn individually and in other trials, collectively, that is, all the jurors or some convenient number are to be sworn at one time, except that a juror who asks to be sworn individually, or who is to be sworn otherwise in the ordinary manner, is to be sworn individually. The new section requires that in all cases jurors shall be sworn separately.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I want to put it on record.  The change is being made in order to emphasise the importance of the duty of a juror to give a true verdict in accordance with the evidence.  The individual swearing will take marginally longer but the greater solemnity of the oath when taken separately will amply compensate for the slight delay.  A similar change was made by section 35 (3) of the British Courts Act 1971 now section 11 (3) of the Juries Act 1974 and had been recommended by the Morris committee on jury service. The committee said at paragraph 314: &ldquo;This [collective swearing] seems to us to be undesirable, and we are greatly fortified in our opinion by the fact that the judges have expressed the view that it is convenient that each juror should be sworn separately... It seems to us that the solemn nature of the juror's duty is emphasised if each one takes the oath individually.&rdquo; The Deputies who support the amendment do so on two grounds.  The first is that to swear them collectively will save time.  Here we have a matter of minutes involved and I do not think that is a substantial argument.  The <Col N="429" /> second one is that it would be a more solemn way if a number were sworn together.</P>
      <P>I believe that the converse is the case.  If each person is asked to take the oath separately it is a more striking way of doing it.  It is more individual way of doing it and it brings it home to the individual in a more solemn and striking way.  Another thing which strikes me, which I have seen from time to time, is that you have sometimes the man who wishes to affirm or you have a member of the Jewish community who wishes to be sworn in a different way.  If you have three jurors and one wants to be sworn in a different way, you make him stand out like a sore thumb.  You are taking one and three and the judge has to say to No. 2: &ldquo;Sit down for the time being and we will deal with you afterwards&rdquo;.  I always thought that was an undersirable way of doing it.  It is better to take 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 individually and swear them.</P>

      <P>We will not make a federal case out of this.  It is just to complete my argument on behalf of Deputy Collins.  There are two ways of looking at it.  The concept of the jury being welded into a unit and swearing collectively at the start of a trial will have a certain solemnity of its own and will indicate that they are a composite team to get on with the trial. However, I withdraw the amendment.</P>

Under existing law on the civil side each party could challenge three jurors without giving any reason and he could challenge as many other jurors as he could give reason for.  We are increasing that from three to seven.  It is on the criminal side that there is a more substantial change.  At present the State can stand by as many jurors as they like without showing any reason.  The accused person can challenge five but has no right to stand by.

If the judge kept them together the meal was provided for them.  There is no difference whatever here.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 9, to delete lines 50 and 51 and in page 10 to delete lines 1 to 3 inclusive and to insert &ldquo;The Minister shall by order regulate the practice and procedure to be adopted by county registrars in the discharge <Col N="432" /> of their duties under this Act but nothing in this section shall authorise the Minister to make an order providing that&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The existing section 27 reads:</P>
    <P>With a view to securing consistency in the administration of this Act, the Minister may issue instructions to county registrars with regard to the practice and the procedure to be adopted by them in the discharge of their duties under this Act; but nothing in this section shall authorise the Minister to issue any instruction...</P>
    <P>It is fairly obvious what the difference in approach is.  The section says the Minister may issue instructions.  Deputy Collins wants this provision to be mandatory and to say that the Minister shall.  I think it is desirable that it should be so.  The situation should not be that, if the Minister does not feel like co-ordinating the procedures throughout the country, he need not do so.  The Bill should make it mandatory on him to so order things.  Secondly, Deputy Collins wishes this to be done by order, whereas the section as framed is very loose in its approach.  It simply says that the Minister may issue instructions to county registrars.  I recommend the amendment.  I hope the Minister will not adopt the attitude he has been adopting fairly consistently up to now that the Bill is perfect and cannot be improved, and no matter what amendments we put forward they do not matter.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The amendment proposes to prescribe by order the method by which the county registrars shall make up the jury panel.  We think it is undesirable to write it down and make it a statutory obligation, so to speak.  What it is proposed is to do it administratively. The circular which will be sent to county registrars suggesting how juries should be empanelled will be placed in the Library of the House.  It is felt that, if we were to have a hard and fast rule as to how the panel should be made up, it could be questioned in trial after trial, and could lead to endless delays and endless litigation, all of which would be unnecessary, and <Col N="433" /> would not be required to ensure that the panel was properly compiled.  The panel will contain the names of many more jurors than will be necessary to try any case or all cases.  For those reasons I believe that procedure adopted here is the more practical procedure and the better procedure. There are two views about this, just as there are two views about most things.</P>

There should be some method whereby the county registrar would notify the employer of the fact that the employee was not empanelled on a jury and, in other words, could do his day's work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In Part II, page 13, after line 54, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Secretary to the Commissioners of Irish Lights and any person in the employment of the Commissioners on a certificate from the Secretary that the person concerned performs services for the Commissioners that cannot reasonably be performed by another or postponed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I shall not delay the House very long on this amendment.  The Minister will immediately see it is eminently reasonable.  We are concerned here with the situation of persons in the service of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  I could subject the Minister to a long and impassioned dissertation on the service which the commissioners and their staff render to the nation and, in particular, to our merchant navy.  However, I shall not do that.  I shall just leave it to the Minister's common sense.</P>
      <P>The Bill as drafted makes provision that among those who can be excused as of right are lighthouse keepers actually employed as such. That is not enough to meet this situation. My amendment is in line with the provision made for teachers, professors, lecturers and so on.  I suggest that the Secretary of the Commissioners of Irish Lights be put in the same position as the head or principal of a college or university and that he would be able to issue a certificate to state that the person concerned performed services for the commissioners &ldquo;that cannot reasonably be performed by another or postponed&rdquo;&mdash;the same provision which applies to teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 618 persons altogether employed by the commissioners.  I am not seeking that they should all be exempt through the provisions laid down in the Schedule, but there are about 85 per cent of those who are either working on the coast or are required almost constantly to be available for duty there.  The Bill as it is drafted covers lightkeepers and <Col N="439" /> masters of vessels.  Lightship men are in exactly the same position as lightkeepers and they should be covered, as should the crews of lighthouse tenders.</P>
    <P>There is a cadre of building tradesmen who for most of the year are out on the lighthouses or travelling to and from lighthouses.  There are quite a number of professional, technical and industrial staff of the commissioners who are required to be available for duty on the coast.  The position of these people would not be met by the Schedule as framed.  I recommend my amendment to the Minister as being very reasonable; I am speaking about amendment No. 6, because amendments Nos. 7 and 8 are consequential if the Minister accepts the principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Lighthousekeepers are exempt under the Bill and there is no problem there.  What the Deputy wants to do is to give authority to the Secretary of the Commissioners of Irish Lights to issue a certificate exempting anybody he thinks should be exempted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes.  I know the Deputy's feeling about this, but I am advised it is not necessary, because the lighthousekeepers are exempt and anybody else who thinks he should be exempt can apply for exemption.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, there are more elaborate provisions in this Bill than were in the legislation up to the present.  Under the existing law, the county registrar has no authority to exempt anyone from answering a jury summons.  The people who did not turn up in court in obedience to a summons took the chance that the judge might or might not exempt them.  In this Bill the summons has to be served 14 days in advance, unless in the very exceptional case discussed earlier, and the county registrar has the right to excuse somebody from attending in obedience to the summons.</P>

      <P>It is necessary.  This is a typical example of the way we put forward a reasonable amendment which is called for by the circumstances of this type of employment and the Minister turns it down out of hands.  It makes one despair of the procedure in this House.  What is the point of having a Committee Stage of a Bill if, when we highlight a defect in the Bill which is unanswerable, the Minister just refuses to accept it?  As I said, it makes one despair of even trying to amend legislation.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Bill sets out a list of persons who are excusable as of right. If the head or principal teacher in a college or university has this right about a member of his staff, surely the Commissioner of Irish Lights should have this right.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>But he is not excused, unless he is employed as such.  There are other persons who are in exactly the same position as lighthousekeepers. &ldquo;Lighthousekeeper&rdquo; does not cover the situation.  The Minister must not have been listening to what I was saying.  I elaborated on the type of person concerned.  A man on duty on a lightship is in the same category as a lighthousekeeper.  He is not included in the Bill as it stands at the moment. The crew of a lighthouse tender, engineers, men who are travelling up and down the coast on all kinds of emergency duties, are not included. Tradesmen who go to the light stations are out there for maybe two or three months on end and they are not included. If the Bill provides this power for the head or principal teacher of a <Col N="441" /> college in respect of any professor, lecturer, or member of the teaching staff of such institution, surely it is perfectly reasonable and logical to give the same facility to the head of a life and death service like the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  I feel quite incensed at the Minister's rejection of this reasonable and sensible proposal which is necessary to enable a vital life and death service to function properly and efficiently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I worked in the lighthouse service for 15 years.  I understand the problems and the Minister has been misled or misinformed on this occasion.  Maintenance personnel operate from a depot in Dún Laoghaire to do a job&mdash;the safety of mariners.  This is a very important job. A man may be sent to Blacksod today and then get a telegram telling him to go to Loophead, the Aran Islands or some other place tomorrow. He is constantly on the move dealing with problems.  Every storm and every high sea create problems.  There is a constant demand for engineers and technicians to maintain this vital and effective service.</P>
      <P>I was often on a run for six weeks and got my mail for the full six weeks when I returned to my home base. I moved from station to station dealing with one problem after another. Every storm creates a variety of problems along the coast and at outlying stations and shore stations.  A very special case should be made for some tradesmen who are away for several weeks.  Getting mail to lighthousemen is not as simple as the Minister thinks and, therefore, in the normal way one could not be summoned for jury duty. This is a special service which demands special attention.</P>
      <P>A lighthousekeeper on shore leave is on stand-to.  Because of sickness at a station he may be called at any given moment.  Every member of the lighthouse service, whether on the coast, in the depots or on the lighthouses, is on call 24 hours a day. This is one of the most important and misunderstood services in the country.  Without this service, the lives of every mariner would be at stake.</P>
      <P>On one occasion I went away to do a job that would take three hours but was away for ten days on board a lightship.  I could not come ashore because of bad weather.  That gives some indication of the situations that can arise.  Other people have been six, eight or ten weeks on stations. There are helicopters available now but they do not bring out the mail every day so that you can get your summons for jury duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is reasonable and <Col N="443" /> the Minister should give it very careful consideration.  It reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Secretary of the Commissioners of Irish Lights and any person in the employment of the Commissioners on a certificate from the Secretary that the person concerned performs services for the Commissioners that cannot reasonably be performed by another or postponed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Every situation is an emergency situation.  It would be very serious if the lights around the coast were out because a person was on jury duty and could not fix them.  I do not know if the Minister yet understands the grave problems confronting this service because of the non-acceptance of this amendment.  I hope the Minister will examine the situation again and seek further clarification from the Commissioners of Irish Lights if he is not satisfied with what Deputy Haughey or I stated here.  I would ask the Minister to do that rather than reject the amendment so that he may have a clear picture of the situation. By doing that he could ensure that the lives of the mariners are not interfered with by this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not think the fears expressed by the Deputy will materialise.  The county registrar has this power.  Apart from that, if the summons is not served it is not served and there is no obligation on the juror to attend.  If it is served and the juror does not turn up there will never be any prosecution. I could not see any reasonable person directing a prosecution&mdash;common sense would prevail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Haughey pointed out, personnel who are not required for coastal duties would be available for jury service.  We are dealing with personnel who are normally on call at all times.  If there is a <Col N="444" /> storm tonight there will be problems on the west or on the east coast tomorrow and they must be attended to immediately. Tradesmen and technicians must be transferred to the areas affected immediately in order to maintain essential services.  There is a safeguard that personnel who are employed in a clerical or other capacity can be available.  If the amendment is accepted it means that personnel can move freely from station to station on a certificate from the secretary.  This is reasonable and if the Minister reconsiders the matter I am sure he will share my view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Part II deals with persons who are excusable as of right and it sets out a large category who are thus excusable.  It states:</P>
      <P>Chief officers of local authorities for the purposes of the Local Government Act, 1941 (No. 23), health boards established under the Health Act, 1970 (No. 1) and harbour authorities within the meaning of the Harbours Act, 1946 (No. 9) and any employee of a local authority, health board or harbour authority on a certificate from its chief officer that it would be contrary to the public interest for the employee to have to serve as a juror because he performs essential and urgent services of public importance that cannot reasonably be performed by another or postponed.</P>
      <P>Those words apply specifically and clearly to the type of person employed by the Commissioners of Irish Lights. Where is the justification for granting this procedure to harbour authorities, organisations who function on land and whose employees operate on land, and not granting it to the Commissioners of Irish Lights?  The Minister's position is totally indefensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next paragraph refers to the head or principal teacher of a college, school or other educational institution. The most minor educational institution has this procedure available to it&mdash;it need not necessarily be a university or a school.  That head or principal has the facility afforded to him of being able to certify that a particular person is engaged on work that cannot reasonably be performed <Col N="445" /> by another or be postponed.  That certificate enables the person to be excused as of right.</P>
    <P>It is beyond comprehension how the Minister, in the light of those two provisions, can deny a similar provision in regard to the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  I am certain if the latter had been aware of what was happening they would have been in touch with the Department of Justice and when the Bill was being drafted the provision would have been included. Simply because we are putting it forward as a necessary improvement in the Bill it is rejected out of hand.  We are lectured about the Opposition not doing their job but there has been very little encouragement for a member of the Opposition to go to any trouble on this Bill.</P>
    <P>We have been very reasonable about this Bill.  We have facilitated the Minister and we have let sections go through which we might have dealt with at greater length because we understand there is some urgency about the matter.  Our attitude with regard to this Bill has been one of co-operation.  Here we are highlighting for the Minister an absolutely legitimate and necessary amendment but we are not given the courtesy of it being dealt with in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the Minister can possibly defend the situation, where the procedure is laid down with regard to harbour authorities but is not granted to the Commissioners of Irish Lights. The Minister's argument that lighthousekeepers are covered is not enough; there are countless persons employed by Irish Lights who are in exactly the same position as lighthousekeepers. If the Minister sees it necessary to include the latter he has no valid case for rejecting the procedure we are putting forward.  I find it difficult to remain calm about the way the Minister is dealing with this proposal.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The proposed procedure for excusing jurors is far more elaborate than the existing one.  It goes a long way towards relieving any hardships that may be imposed on jurors.  The present <Col N="446" /> amendment relates purely to employees of Irish Lights.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes.  This Bill is required urgently.  It was discussed in the Seanad and in this House.  I am not saying this in a complaining way but simply as a fact&mdash; the present amendment was put down late last evening.  It so happens that the Minister who is responsible for the Bill was called away on urgent business and I am standing in for him. It may well be that if the Minister for Justice were here he would accept this amendment.  I do not want the House to be at any disadvantage because the Minister for Justice is not here.  I have the same rights and responsibilities while I am here as the Minister for Justice would have if he were in the House.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the arguments of Deputy Haughey and others in support of the amendment.  It may well be that the Minister for Justice, if he were here, would have accepted it, but my opinion is that it will not make a lot of difference one way or another, that it is perhaps not unreasonable that the secretary to the Commissioners of Irish Lights should enjoy the same privilege, if it is not going too far to call it a privilege, as harbour authorities. In the circumstances I propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>, <i>Cavan</i>): I thank the House for its co-operation in giving me the remaining Stages today.  I am satisfied the Bill makes a big improvement on the existing procedure for trial by jury.  I am personally convinced that the jury system by and large has stood the test of time and that it is the best method of trying cases, particularly criminal ones.  The Bill updates the Act of 1927 and subsequent amending legislation.</P>
      <P>There are many improvements which will be in ease of jurors.  It will mean that jurors will not be called on nearly as often as they were and there is provision under which jurors must be given 14 days' notice. Under existing law only four days were required.  Furthermore, county registrars will have the right to excuse a juror and that is a very big advantage. As the Minister for Justice said when introducing the Bill, it was overdue. Its provisions are in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.</P>

      <P>Last week I was trying to establish the effects of the Minister's panic budget.  I said that no proper assessment had been made of the economic plight of our people. This morning we read in the newspapers of the massive increase in CIE fares and here again, as a direct result of the budget, we inflict further hardship on the poorer sections of our people.  Freight rates are to go up by 20 per cent and this, in turn, will have its effect on employment.</P>
      <P>Last week I pointed to the tourism situation and we have now been told by the director of the Irish Hotels Federation that thousands of holidays booked this year have been cancelled. I also mentioned the increase in the tax on drink and over the weekend I made it my business to make inquiries from the breweries.  I was told that only a fortnight after the budget there has been a decline in the volume of drink sales.  I do not know if the Minister consults with the Prices Commission before introducing his budget. He should be aware that last December the breweries submitted a claim to the commission for an increase to meet the cost of production.  Is he aware that the insurance companies have lodged a claim for a further 30 per cent increase in car insurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="449" /> When we talk about collective responsibility, which is so essential in any Government, I wonder does such a responsibility exist in the present Government? Do Ministers make their own decisions without consulting with their colleagues?  Do they make decisions irrespective of the consequences those decisions may have on another Department?  Apparently that is the position because I recall a discussion some time back on Verolme Cork Dockyard.  The Minister for Labour informed us that he had been approached by representatives of the trade unions with regard to the problem existing there and I remember him saying that, on Monday morning, it was his business and the business of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to have consultations with the Minister for Transport and Power on the matter.  This bears out my charge. Here were two Ministers waiting to consult with a third and, at the Labour Party conference in Galway on that Sunday, neither the Minister for Labour nor the Minister for Industry and Commerce was able to inform the delegates that the Government had a policy for Verolme.  We talk about collective responsibility.  Here was an extraordinary situation.  Two Ministers had to meet another Minister and then come in here and tell us the Government had a policy.  Incidentally, we have not heard what the policy is yet.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government set up a commission to investigate the reasons for poverty.  Everybody must be aware of the reasons, everybody except the Government.  Poverty is created by mass unemployment and inadequate social welfare benefits to meet the exorbitant cost of living. The Minister made a brief reference in his budget statement to a 10 per cent increase in social welfare benefits but we were not told anything about the forthcoming increase in the social welfare contributions.  Presumably the Minister for Social Welfare will announce these.  The Government claim to be a socialist Government. Yet every aspect of this budget inflicts hardship on the people they say they represent and for whom, they say, they will provide.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> Are the Government aware of the poverty that exists in homes at the moment?  Are they aware of the poverty suffered by single people dependent on social welfare?  I suppose we will have an opportunity later of discussing this with the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Cork harbour development plan.  Everyone in Cork and throughout Munster was confident the Government would provide the necessary moneys for this plan. Now I understand it is being shelved for some years.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make a very special case to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport and Power to rethink the decision with regard to this development plan.  It is of vital importance to the harbour.  The harbour is the gateway to Europe.</P>
    <P>I was amazed that there is no further reduction in the qualifying age for old age pension.  We were not told the reason for not reducing it. The Minister should have had the decency to tell us why it is not being reduced and I hope he will take the opportunity of doing so when he comes to reply.  It must be a great disappointment to many.</P>
    <P>The projections in every budget since this Government took office have been wrong and the Government must realise the confusion engendered by their failure to make a proper assessment of the economy. Industrialists and others are suffering because of this failure.  The Government must now formulate policies designed to safeguard the economy from further deterioration, even if that means introducing emergency measures.  Employment must be provided for our young people.  We know what happened last year in the case of 50,000 young people who completed their education.  Will we have the same situation this year with thousands of young people walking the streets in search of employment? The Minister for Labour should introduce some measures to provide employment or will we again go through a period during which our quays will be lined with emigrants, <Col N="451" /> the lifeblood of the nation?  It is sad that any Member should have to plead to the Government on behalf of our young people.</P>
    <P>I spoke last Thursday and I tried to place emphasis on certain aspects of this budget, especially in the area of employment.  It is regrettable that less than a week later we can see the effects on tourism, the motor trade, and on CIE, all leading to more unemployment. It might be necessary at this stage for the Government to re-think the whole budget because the effects are showing in less than a fortnight. It will be interesting to know the effect on the unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>Before Christmas I had a question down asking the Minister for Finance if when finalising his budget he would make the necessary moneys available to implement the terms of reference of the task force on child care set up by the Government.  I was told that the Minister could not anticipate the outcome of the budget.  For me, and I am sure for anyone interested in young people and their development, and that is almost everyone, this is one of the most important reports placed before the Dáil and it has been completely ignored.  We all agree that the economy is in a bad way and that moneys are not available, but surely someone should be able to implement some of the important recommendations in this report.  It is a pity that we should turn our eyes away from it.  It is a pity that sufficient moneys are not available now to implement some of the aspects of this report.  No mention whatsoever of this was made in the Minister's speech, and the nation is crying out for some action on this very important matter.</P>
    <P>Finally, no one likes to forecast doom.  We, the Opposition, are trying to build up in this nation the confidence that our people had before the present Government took office.  Unfortunately, we know that the people are losing confidence in the fuure of the nation and that is a bad thing. I plead with the Government to show <Col N="452" /> initiative now; to show some concern for the people by producing proper policies, by giving the people to understand that the Government are making some effort to alleviate the appalling conditions in which our people now find themselves.  Meet a man in the street and the first thing he will ask is: &ldquo;Are you working?&rdquo; Surely this is a note of warning to the Government. We do not know what the end of this year will bring&mdash;maybe a general election.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that our party are ready and prepared to make the sacrifices, maybe unpopular, to raise the economy of this nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak particularly about the whole aspect of the general economic situation.  We hear from the far side of the House that we are borrowing trouble, we are overspending on the one side, and on the other they say, &ldquo;Why are you not implementing this and spending money on that?&rdquo; I realise they are in Opposition and have to indulge in some form of criticism, but they are not coming forward with any positive alternatives.  There is an economic wind blowing across Europe today which is basically unprecedented.  This resulted and manifested itself from the oil crisis and the increases in the price of oil.  When they occured we still maintained as a nation the same standard of living which we had despite these vast increases.  Unless we increase productivity we cannot hope to sustain that standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government wish to protect the less well-off in our society.  The only way they can do that is by social welfare benefits, by cushioning the effects of inflation and particularly the imported inflation which we have to endure.  Despite the increases in the price of oil we tended to indulge in high income demands, high income claims and settlements which we now realise were far too high.  If we want to pay ourselves more than we can afford we are going to run into an economically ruinous situation which, if it did continue through the national wage agreement, we would be in severe trouble.  The only way to protect our economy now is for restraint to be <Col N="453" /> exercised by everybody.  The Government will have to curb employers and trade unions right across the board.  If they do not we will have more unemployment. Now is the time seriously to examine the incomes policy and base it on productivity.  If we hope to get any real increase in our standard of living this can only come about by higher productivity.  If we talk about getting an increase of X per cent or Y per cent it is not very relevant because prices will automatically rise. This will eat up the increase unless we are determined to work harder and determined to increase our productivity to make ourselves more competitive in world markets.  We have to compete with other nations.  Our productivity is not as high as it should be in relation to our competitors abroad.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the money going to AnCO has been increased by 70 per cent this year.  Industrial training is important.  We must have trained personnel to go into industry.  When people come here to set up industry we must ensure that trained people are available to go into productive employment quickly.  If those people are not available the people who have money to invest will not come here. Despite the cutbacks in various areas I am glad that the Government have seen that it is important to put money into AnCO.  When the economic situation improves and industry is able to take on more people we will have the labour force trained to take up this employment.</P>
    <P>The employment situation is a very serious matter.  Unemployment must be tackled in the long term.  I would like the Minister to look at the construction industry.  In our 14-point plan we said we would built 25,000 houses a year.  We have succeeded in this and nobody can point a finger at that aspect of the building industry. However, there has been a fall off in office development and other aspects of the building industry.  We must try to get more employment in that area.</P>
    <P>In Dublin there is a growing need for development within the city area of houses, flats and construction generally. If we make this attractive we will get people to come here.  If <Col N="454" /> people decide they want to build large blocks of apartments or engage in some housing development we should give them some type of tax concession to encourage them to come in.  When the <i>entrepreneur</i> wishes to invest money he wants to see a return for it. Building in the centre of the city, as I have outlined, could employ a large number of workers and give us housing development to supplement our local authority housing development.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to developing the central city area.  In Dublin the Government have acquired 150 acres of land for local authority houses.  Some of those houses are already under construction.  We could supplement this by encouraging the private sector into this area.  It would not be any great problem to get them if they got some tax concession such as a percentage write-off on the cost of property over a number of years. When we are in a situation of economic recession and unemployment we have to look for ways and means of developing industry.  As chairman of the housing committee of Dublin Corporation I am interested in housing. That is why I bring this idea forward and I ask the Minister to give it serious attention.</P>
    <P>When the building industry is booming the economy is booming.  In America when the car industry is booming, generally their economy is booming as well.  We can use the same yardstick.  When the building industry is booming, there is a large spin-off into other industries.  Native raw materials are used in building.  It is a reasonably highly intensive industry as well.  From the point of view of employment that is one area we should be looking at seriously to see what can be done.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert on tax or on how you operate the system.  We should not be too inhibited about the tax system.  We should not feel that, if something has not been done before, it might be seen not to work. We have to be innovators.  We have to be bold.  We have to make decisions and experiment.  This is the only way in which we can come up with ideas. I know the Minister is bringing in a <Col N="455" /> paper on economic planning and development.  This is necessary.  We must plan.  We must project into the future.  Because we have inflation, or unemployment, or because other aspects of our economy do not come up to scratch, does not matter. We can always adjust our plans and our targets as we want to.  If we draw up a five-year plan, we can review it every year with a view to updating it.</P>
    <P>There is a projected upturn of 2 per cent now as against an original projection of 1 per cent.  That is encouraging.  We have to ensure that from now on there must be an upturn in the economy.  We must all work towards that end.  Deputy Wyse said people were losing confidence. I do not think the Irish people are losing confidence.  They have the will and the desire to maintain and increase their standard of living.</P>
    <P>At the moment because of the current economic situation our expectations must be limited.  We must make sacrifices.  If over the next 12 to 18 months we were all prepared to tighten our belts and make the right decisions and work for the good of the nation, I have no doubt that we will come out of this situation with few scars.  That is why I would welcome some sort of pay pause or a minimal pay agreement.  If we carry on demanding too much, the less well off people on fixed incomes and people on social welfare will suffer.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the budget was intended to cut back in various areas, it ensured that the areas of social welfare were looked after. That is the way it should be.  A country which did not do that would not last too long.  If we call ourselves a Christian society, we must devote portion of our earnings and our national wealth to social welfare.</P>
    <P>We are accused of spending too much and borrowing too much, but no real programme is forthcoming from the other side of the House which would cut the type of borrowing in which we are currently engaged. The Opposition should be asked where do they propose to find the <Col N="456" /> additional money to make up for the rates they claim they will abolish. Where would they find the additional money to increase the SDA loan to £6,000 and bring more people into that scheme?  This would involve vast sums of money.  Where would they hope to raise that kind of money without further borrowing?  It is not honest or right to make vague statements without costing them.  If we borrow less we will have to cut back on health services, education and social welfare, or cut back on areas of development.  The Opposition should be serious if the people are to accept them as an alternative.</P>
    <P>Additional spending can be brought about either by additional borrowing or additional taxation.  We all see that additional taxation is not popular. Additional borrowing would not get us very far.  We have to look to the areas of productive development. Moneys have to be raised for AnCO, the IDA and the various Government agencies in order to promote growth in industrial development.  The Government should commit themselves in that area.</P>

      <P>In my reply on 11th February to a question by Deputy MacSharry&mdash; Official Report, Volume 287, No. 10, cols. 1723 and 1724&mdash;I gave particulars of the financial allocations for the present year to the health boards which involve an average increase of almost 13 per cent over the final allocations made available for 1975 for direct expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While, as I then indicated to the <Col N="457" /> House, economies would be needed, I think that the allocations will be sufficient for the Southern Health Board and the other boards to carry out their functions properly.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, explain to the House that since the allocations were announced, there have been continuous consultations between my Department and the health boards on the extent and kind of economies which are needed in each case.  These consultations are still in progress and I expect a full report on them next week, after which the formal decision on the amount available for each service will be made.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the specific case of the Eastern Health Board in a written reply yesterday to a question by Deputy Lemass.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the IMA expressed concern because the health boards were being asked to stick to the budget imposed upon them by the Minister?  It was their view that this would mean a less than adequate medical care service for patients.  Is the Minister aware that in the event of the Southern Health Board, and other health boards, being compelled to stick to their budgets it will mean that substitutes will not be allowed to be employed on medical and nursing staffs in the hospitals during this financial year?

      <P>I am aware that the health expenditure has gone up in real terms as distinct from what the Deputy said.  As a proportion of GNP there has been a steady improvement over the last three or four years.  I should like to emphasise that the budgets have not been based on the assumption that services would be damaged. I am asking the health boards to do the same as I am being asked to do by all sections in this House, to ensure that expenditure by the health authorities is adequate and ensure that economies will be effected not alone in the Department of Health but in other Departments.  I am confident that economies can be made and the tentative response I got from some of the CEOs is to the effect that economies can be made without damage to the volume or level of service.</P>

Is the Minister aware that the proposal of the Southern Health Board, and other boards, to set up further day centres for the treatment of mentally retarded children has been chopped?  Those who have medical cards who would otherwise have got free transport to clinics will no longer be able to avail of that free transport and it is possible that the outcome of that will be that many people will suffer and have to spend long periods in hospital as a result adding further to the expenditure of the boards.</P>

      <P>If a decision has been made by the Southern Health Board in regard to the treatment of handicapped children it has not come to my notice and if the Deputy has any evidence of that I should like to see it. I do not say that the estimates have been deliberately inflated but there is <Col N="459" /> the possibility that they over-estimated and there is evidence to this effect in certain areas.  The Deputy should realise that not alone am I responsible to ensure that services to which people are entitled are given to them but I have also a responsibility to the taxpayer. The Deputy will appreciate that, with the deduction of health charges from the health boards, approximately 98 per cent of health expenditure is borne by the Exchequer. It is not the intention to cut down the volume or level of the service but I must ensure that each £ is accounted for.  I have no doubt but that the health boards can economise in certain respects, especially this year.  I have no hesitation in admitting that this is a very difficult year.  If we can economise and maintain the services at the same level as 1975, we will be doing a good job.</P>

      <P>As far as the transport of patients is concerned, I dealt with that matter at length last week on a question put down by Deputy Crowley. It has been accepted that there has been abuse of the hire of taxis to transport patients to clinics and hospitals. I do not know to what extent, <Col N="460" /> but the CEO is satisfied, and as far as I can gather, some members of the board are satisfied, that the system has been abused and there can be savings there.  As far as facilities for patients are concerned, there will be no deterioration in the service.</P>

      <P>As I explained, consultations are going on between officials of the Department and the various health boards.  They are discussing the estimates that have been prepared by the health boards and the allocations that have been made by me through the Department of Health.  I will not have a full account of these for another week or so and then I will be in a position to assess the situation but the indications from some of the health boards are that economies can be made this year&mdash;I stress &ldquo;this year&rdquo;&mdash;in order to ensure that they will be able to provide the services on the same level as in 1975 with the amount of money they have been allocated and again bearing in mind, as I said last week, that the increased allocation for health boards for 1976 is between 12 and 13 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will take steps to ensure that clerical staff and manual workers employed by local authorities enjoy the same annual leave and leave with pay on bank holidays and church holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>The leave entitlement of local authority staff both clerical and manual is traditionally a matter for negotiation between the local authorities as employers and their employees and I do not propose to intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister if he would agree that there is discrimination between the leave and holiday arrangements available to clerical staff and those available to most manual staff, and if he considers that this discrimination should be brought to an end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree there is discrimination.  This has been discussed between the trade unions representing the employees and the local authorities over the years. Satisfactory arrangements have been made and this has been accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider it anomalous that on church holidays the council offices remain closed and the clerical staff are free, with pay, while the manual workers have to report for work? Does he consider it equitable that the clerical staff should enjoy 18 days' holiday while the manual staff are limited to 15 days' annual leave? There is serious discrimination within the local government structure in respect of some local authorities.  The one I am referring to is the Galway local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that the Galway outdoor staff have, through their trade union, negotiated for working on church holidays and so have got some other days instead.  However, I am satisfied that the proper way to decide those things is to allow the trade unions to negotiate with the employer.  I am <Col N="470" /> aware of years ago when there was discrimination, when road workers got one week's holidays and nobody thought of saying anything about it in government.  I am glad I was responsible from the other side of the fence in having substantial improvements made in the holiday entitlement of road workers, including those in Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no function in it. Therefore, there is no point in considering it.  I would imagine if the people concerned are dissatisfied they would ask their trade union to take it up.  I have no function in the matter and I think it would be wrong if I intervened at this stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter that has to be dealt with by way of statistics, but the Road Fund grant will, of course, be included.  However, I would point out to the Deputy, who obviously does not know about these things, that Road Fund grants in relation to national primary and national secondary roads where new works are concerned, have over the years changed from year to year.  A local authority might be doing major road works and get £250,000 for one year and might not get anything again for four or five years.  This has been the pattern. Anybody who talks about the effect this has on employment does not know the facts of life as far as road works are concerned.</P>

      <P>Under section 106 of the Housing Act, 1966, a local authority is required to put a tenanted dwelling into good structural condition prior <Col N="473" /> to the sale of the dwelling to the tenant.  On 14th April, 1967, a circular letter was issued to local authorities containing guidelines on the works considered appropriate to section 106. On 5th May last, my Department wrote only to Cork (North) County Council drawing its attention mainly to the necessity to adhere to these guidelines, and indicating in particular that works outside that range would not rank for Exchequer subsidy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Leonard is missing a point if he read my reply when this question was asked before. If the wearing of seat belts is made compulsory, there must then be a penalty imposed on those who do not wear seat belts.  Neither Deputy Leonard nor I would like to see another offence created.  We do not want to see an ordinary law abiding citizen who, for some peculiar reason, does not want to wear a seat belt prosecuted for not wearing one.  It has been made compulsory in a number of countries, Finland, Spain and Switzerland, but other countries will not do that.  Britain had prepared a Bill and withdrew it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the insurance companies in Britain made a case before a court where somebody had been injured and who was not wearing a seat belt.  The court decided they were entitled to less compensation than if they had been wearing it.  If the same thing <Col N="475" /> happens here, this will make people wear seat belts.  I do not propose at present to make it a crime for refusing to wear a seat belt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider introducing legislation to permit to voluntary organisations the benefit of obtaining donations under deeds of covenant with tax exemptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of section 439 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, annual payments under covenant are recognised for the purposes of income tax if the payments are, <i>inter alia</i>, made to:</P>
      <P>(a)  universities and colleges in the State to enable them to carry on research or to teach approved subjects, including industrial relations and marketing; or</P>
      <P>(b)  to universities, colleges and schools in the State to assist them in the teaching of the natural sciences, or to a fund devoted to that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of section 15 of the Finance Act, 1973, similar treatment is extended to bodies <Col N="479" /> devoted to the promotion of observance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the implementation of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>
    <P>In each case the covenanted payments must be payable for a period of three years or longer.  Income tax is deductible from annual payments, under section 433 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, with the consequence that institutions in receipt of covenanted subscriptions for the purposes stated are entitled, if they are charitable bodies exempt from income tax under sections 333 or 334, to a refund of the income tax deducted from those subscriptions.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to introduce legislation to extend these provisions under the income tax code but the Select Committee on the Corporation Tax Bill have given approval to an amendment, in my name, to the Bill which will ensure similar provisions in respect of corporation tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's answer is very elaborate and rather technical. Does it mean that an ordinary <i>bona fide</i> charity could benefit by the tax exemption?  Will it mean that the person who gave money to a charity will be allowed to deduct it for income tax purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is to provide a simple definition of a charity.  The only charities that are entitled to relief are those that promote research, teach subjects, who assist in the teaching of the natural sciences or who are engaged in the promotion of observance of human rights under the United Nations declaration and the Council of Europe declaration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland gave this relief until 1940 but the then Minister for Finance, the late Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly, withdrew it in his budget. He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> I shall move a resolution to bring to an end a considerable loss of revenue arising from a device arranged by certain charitable bodies for their subscribers, as a result of which the charity obtains in effect a subsidy from the State and the subscriber secures a deduction in the computation of his income for surtax purposes.</P>
    <P>Since then this matter has arisen from time to time.  In 1967 the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, also resisted applications for extension. The reason the facility was withdrawn in 1940 was, unfortunately, because it was being abused.  It has not been found possible since to devise any method that would ensure that such abuses would not occur.</P>
    <P>There are a number of bodies including, for instance, a hospital in the city, who have a system of covenants, and some other charitable organisations which are engaged in medical research have covenanted schemes.  All of these receive benefit but it would not be possible to say that all forms of charities could receive it because there would be argument about whether it was a charity within the definitions that exist.</P>

      <P>Grants under the EEC cattle headage payments scheme are not normally withheld because cattle identity cards are not available for animals regarded as &ldquo;inconclusive&rdquo; following herd tests.  Such animals are eligible for grant provided the cards are found to be in order at the local district veterinary office and the conditions of the scheme are otherwise satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>If yields per cow are to be improved, I can only repeat the advice which I have previously given to dairy farmers which is to concentrate on better feeding and earlier calving in their herds.  They can thus get maximum benefit from the measures already in operation which include progeny testing of A1 bulls for yield and quality of milk; milk recording; and the importation of high class breeding stock and semen. No figures are yet available for 1975 but an increase in average yield of milk per cow can be expected.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Industrial Development Authority that it is at present negotiating with an industrialist who is interested in setting up a project in the 24,000 sq. ft. advance factory in Ardee.  I understand, however, that negotiations have not yet reached an advanced stage and a detailed proposal has yet to be submitted to the IDA by the promoter.</P>

      <P>In the meantime the IDA are continuing their active promotion of Ardee with a view to securing new industry for the town.  During 1975, 34 industrialists visited the town on IDA itineraries and so far this year there have been visits by four other industrialists.</P>

      <Col N="496" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That it is expedient to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provision in connection with finance.  &mdash;(The Taoiseach)</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I said a budget will only be as effective as the measures taken in it.  Unless there is restraint and constraint in the current year the budget will not be as effective as it should be.  The budget was framed with the intention of getting the economy moving in order to provide employment and get people back to work.  The moneys made available to industry and various State agencies, such as AnCO and the IDA, should show effects over the next 12 months but, unless we are competitive, we will not succeed.  One cannot stress this sufficiently.</P>
      <P>We hear a great deal about third level education and people looking for additional grants.  Any moneys available should be spent on technological and adult education.  Opportunities in the technological sector are increasing all the time while opportunities in what I might call the academic education sector are decreasing and it is on this sector we spend vast sums.  The Murphy report should be implemented as soon as possible because there is great need for adult education.  I believe that the better educated the work force is the more efficient it will be.  Resources are limited and, therefore, whatever resources we have should be spent in that area which will prove most productive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see all Departments looked at again to see if efficiency can be improved and to ensure that we are maximising our efforts.  People want high wage economies, and so they have to earn high wage and salary economies. No matter what sector of industry or otherwise we are talking about, this must be always an overriding factor&mdash;that we are maximising efforts to increase production, and seeking to raise standards.  If we do that we can pay ourselves more money and the economy can be run more <Col N="497" /> efficiently.  If we wish to increase employment greater emphasis must be placed on equipping new plant, making grants easier to get, and giving tax concessions to ensure that plant is always up-to-date.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons why England has slumped in the industrial market is that they did not retool and re-equip themselves in time and so became less efficient and lost markets. When markets are lost it is not easy to regain them.  Now is the time for retooling and gearing up.  It is not easy in a time of economic cutback, but if we want to be ready for action we must be making the necessary plant and work force available for the new jobs which will be created and developed over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>There is the problem of finding employment for young people today.  This is one of the things that concerns everybody.  We want to see that the youth who are leaving school now will be placed in gainful employment. Every effort must be made to ensure that they do not get into the habit of not working.  If people are unemployed for long enough they become unemployable, and this is socially undersirable. We must give our youth opportunity, because a nation that can give confidence in employment to its young people will prosper.</P>
    <P>We have not now the emigration that we had in the forties, fifties or sixties and consequently without the safety valve of the emigrant ship a large number of people are on the unemployment register.  I am glad to see that the people are staying at home. Given the right economic climate they will, over the next 12 months, see the necessary employment opportunities coming up.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that we have the problem of the North.  The amount of money spent on security that could easily be channelled into more productive capacity is regrettable.  No doubt people who are engaged in acts of terrorism and gangsterism are also helping to deter industry from coming into the country.  We must endeavour to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that we have the proper peaceful climate, that industrialists will see this country as a place to come to because <Col N="498" /> of its employment potential, capacity to expand, and encouragements by way of tax and grant incentives. They are first class, but we have not a peaceful atmosphere, and so unfortunately people are inclined to keep away.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Opposition accepted the concept of developing our resources. I learned last weekend that they were advocating the building of a smelter.  This is something that this Government committed themselves to and we have formulated a comprehensive policy on mining, not one of giving it away for nothing, but ensuring that the nation gets its share by still encouraging capital to come in. The same can be said of the oil and gas off our coast.  In regard to technological training, it is important that we have people prepared for these industries so that they may be ready to take jobs.  There is no use creating new jobs if we have to bring in outsiders to do them for us.</P>

      <P>I believe that the Irishman has the capacity and intelligence to take up any job whatsoever. The mineral resources in Tara and other areas as well as the oil and gas need to be used in this country. Obviously, a certain degree of expertise is required but that brought in from outside should be minimised. We should ensure that we have our own people properly trained to take over the management, design, building and running of these various industries which when they come&mdash;we hope soon&mdash;will transform our economy. On the one side they will cut our large import bills and on the other they will give us a large export trade.  From these industries we can develop large spin-off industries.  Particularly in iron ore with the smelter, we will be maximising the effect from the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should consider the metallurgical industry as well.  I think there are three areas here, digging up, processing and fabrication.  These are creating the type of employment we require.  The same can be said for the oil and gas.  We can develop spin-off <Col N="499" /> industries there which will give us employment also.  As a nation our population growth is higher than that of most European countries and a large proportion of our population is under the age of 20, which is a very healthy sign.  However, we have got to be in a position to give employment and to ensure that we have the job potential every year.  This can only be brought about by comprehensive and long developed planning.  We must plan.  We cannot drift along.  I have no doubt that when Europe gets back into full swing European industrialists will look to this country for their labour force and this will mean increased jobs for out people.  As far as I am concerned I believe that when we have natural resources we should control them ourselves and develop them as much as possible.  We are talking about very large sums of money which are available internationally. If we are unable to finance industry ourselves it is necessary for us to go abroad and seek the necessary finance which is available in other countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has produced good deals as far as Ireland is concerned in any negotiations which have taken place.  I am glad to know that there is oil off the south coast.  We also have gas off the same coast.  When those two are taken with the ore which we have, it can be seen that we have some valuable resources available to us.  In the long-term our employment prospects should be great and our standard of living should rise.  We can borrow in the lean times or the economically depressed times to ensure that we can maintain standards but this can only go on for a certain time. We have to face reality.  If we cannot continue to borrow it spells economic doom for everybody.  We must ensure if we are borrowing that it is for productive reasons.</P>
    <P>I would like to see development taking place in our food processing industry.  As Europe becomes more sophisticated the various countries will look for a better standard of living and better food.  We are very fortunate here with our climate and the facilities <Col N="500" /> for a good food processing industry. We are doing reasonably well in it at the moment but we should try to improve it.  When we combine that with our natural resources we will make ourselves more self-sufficient. The test during the next few years will be to provide jobs for out people, to ensure that they have a better standard of living and that we have a more comprehensive social welfare system.  I know some people feel we are drifting towards a social welfare State but I do not accept that principle. We must have a comprehensive social welfare system.  I would like to see our social welfare system more sophisticated.  This can only come about by developing our own resources, developing our capacity to work harder and then by increasing our natural wealth we can pay better social welfare benefits.  Capital is required for this.</P>
    <P>While the Government produce the budget they can only give the lead. The people in all parts of society must work together to ensure that we reach our goal.  Anybody looking at the country can see that we have the potential but we have to harness it now.  We must knuckle down to it over the next few years.  If we do that we will have the type of economy we all seek.  It is a question of the Government giving the lead and the people responding.  I have no doubt that over the next few years this country will be in front of some of our larger partners in the Common Market today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the budget has been so scattered over the weeks that it is difficult to follow any coherent pattern.  That is not our fault.  It is not the Opposition who have seen fit to relegate it to the background.  We have it at the end of the day on Thursdays, at times when it is not likely to get much publicity. Towards the end of the Minister's budget statement he said:</P>
      <P>Any critic, in this House or outside it, of the Government's budgetary strategy ought in all fairness to &ldquo;hold his whist&rdquo; unless willing to state publicly his alternative to our proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> In other words, do not speak unless you can produce alternative proposals. In spite of that statement, which is probably calculated to stifle discussion, I will comment on the budget proposals and why we must have such proposals at this time.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach spoke on the budget.  He referred to the ding-dong attitude of Opposition speaking and implied that it was only a waste of time having those speeches which were holding up important legislation such as the Broadcasting Bill, from which the main substance has been withdrawn anyhow.  His speech refers mostly to our criticisms of the budget debate not being given prominence in the House.  He made a rather personal attack on the Leader of this party.  I will not waste the time available to me in discussing that approach except to say that at budget time every Deputy has the right&mdash;I would go further and say the duty&mdash;to come in here and examine the Government's stewardship during the year.  The budget debate gives us an opportunity to examine the way in which they have been handling the economy over the previous year and their projections for the year ahead.</P>
    <P>That opportunity was available to us annually in the past.  It has become a rather frequent occurrence now.  In spite of many budgets under different guises which were introduced during the year, the annual budget is still an important event in the life of a Government.  To say it should be let go without debate, or to imply, as the Chief Whip of the Government party implied, that it is only a waste of time after the first day or two, is to deny to the House one of its most important functions.</P>
    <P>I will have suggestions to make about what the Government can do now in the short term.  I have the right to criticise the Government's mishandling of affairs in the past.  I remember when the Minister came into this House with his first budget. In his opening statement he referred to the slack in the economy which was not taken up and said he proposed <Col N="502" /> to remedy that.  The volume of unused capacity was to be changed by the new Government who would go for expansion in a big way and we were to have a completely changed situation.  We should remember how things stood at that time.  We had a rapidly growing export trade.  We had a manageable unemployment problem. We were still recording a decent increase in the national economy. We had a growing population as recorded in two previous censuses. Emigration was virtually at a standstill. We had inflation which was manageable.  We had prices rising, but not to any serious extent relative to what we have witnessed since. That was the scenario when the Minister for Finance brought his first budget into this House.</P>
    <P>Before that he warned of the dangers of inflation which he pointed out he had inherited.  I remember seeing him being interviewed on television before he went to America.  He referred to the serious inflationary situation he had taken over and the serious rising prices with which he was confronted.  These were the immediate tasks which he had to face.  In spite of that, he undertook to operate a policy which could have no effect other than the effect every member of this party pointed out at the time.</P>
    <P>If Members on the other side of the House are not anxious that we should discuss the budget, that is understandable. They do not wish to be reminded of the gross negligence of which they are guilty, and their lack of performance over the past three years.  I submit that, if any ordinary commercial company had managed their affairs for the past three years in the same way, the manager would be sacked without notice.  Democracy does not operate in that way and we are stuck with what we have and must tolerate it.  The Government continue on, hardly apologising for the situation into which they have led us.  They must submit to the most serious criticisms both in the House and outside it in relation to their mismanagement of the nation's affairs over the past three years.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister suggested that nobody should criticise <Col N="503" /> unless he was prepared to offer alternatives. This reminds me of the black-guardly son who drove his father's Rolls Royce over the precipice and then said: &ldquo;How dare you admonish me for doing so unless you can tell me a better way of getting it out&rdquo;.  We have more to say about the situation we are in, apart from helping the Minister to get out of it.  He went into it with his eyes open.  Most of us know why.  They elected to go for political expediency rather than the sane thing to do in relation to their budgetary performance.</P>
    <P>I remember speaking from this seat on the Minister's first budget.  I pointed out that, as sure as night follows day, the time would come when the Minister would have to come to the House to take drastic measures to correct the situation which could then have been averted.  That is on record. We all knew from the action or lack of action in that budget that we would be in the serious critical situation in which the country finds itself today.  I do not think there is any parallel in our history for the way the Government behaved, in the knowledge that what they were doing would sink us further and further into trouble.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from here?  The last speaker made a very innocent Alice in Wonderland speech.  I do not blame him for that.  He pointed out all the things he would like to see done. He did not for one moment suggest they were being done, or were likely to be done.  He just hoped things would happen.  We will not get anywhere by hoping something will happen in the future.</P>
    <P>Belatedly the Minister admitted that we will have to take action.  &ldquo;Belatedly&rdquo; is a rather mild way of saying that because the Minister should have been involved in action from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  The action he should have taken was a mild form of the action he must take now in a more drastic way.</P>
    <P>Economists do not agree on the action that should be taken when we have these alternating changes in the economy.  They are known now as <Col N="504" /> trade or business cycles and they have become well known features of world economy in recent years.  Those people who have been quoting from Keynesian theory always find something suitable to quote.  Most people are aware that even he changed his stance many times. People like Ricardo, even as far back as the Greek philosophers, advocated theories not always supported in practice. We have plenty of examples to draw from the many economists to suit our purpose at the time.  It always reminds me of Papal Encyclicals, such as <i>Rerum Novarum,</i> because the workers and the employers could always find something nice to quote from it.</P>
    <P>From all the economic theory that has been turned out in the past certain fundamental principles have emerged and been agreed on by all the economists. They are elementary and one does not need to be a student of economics to appreciate what they are. The Minister seems to be alone in refusing to acknowledge that this type of action is necessary.  The first problem when inflation manifests itself is to ensure that no serious precipitate action is taken to deflate or reflate the economy but to ensure that the economy is &ldquo;steady as she goes&rdquo;.  It is necessary to ensure that employment is watched carefully and that nothing is done to upset the employment situation. That means production, a careful eye on costings, not putting any impediment in the way of productive development and the making available of incentives to ensure that the economy is kept moving in the direction of development and output.  In that way a serious recession is avoided but the Minister failed to take action in that regard and must accept the responsibility for the serious situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>A mild form of what he is trying to do now, without any crisis or panic stations, would have averted this serious situation.  We will find it difficult to get out of it because in sending good money after bad money we have borrowed to the extent that repayments will weigh heavily on us at a time when we should be forging ahead out of the recession.  All the forecasts we have been getting have been leaps in the <Col N="505" /> dark.  The Taoiseach made reference to a 2 per cent increase but that was a statement from the top of his head and nothing more.  We had several such statements in the past but they were just prompted by wishful thinking. Those who made them were hoping that such statements would coincide with a turn-up in the world situation. We are now left in the position that even an improvement in the world economy would not give us any immediate benefit.</P>
    <P>That is a situation of our own making. We cried about external factors beyond our control until we were sick listening to them but, in the end, we had to admit that the major factor giving rise to inflation was domestic inflation. Some months ago I spoke about the lack of planning by the Government and a few weeks later the Minister countered by saying that the was producing a plan before Christmas, without saying which Christmas.  We all know that a Government cannot properly represent its people without a clear-cut policy and, based on that policy, a plan to guide the economy.  It may be a flexible programme; it may be attainable but not attained as often happened in the past but it must give guidance to those willing to invest in the economy, to those who want to know where the Government are going and what the future holds in relation to fiscal policy, taxation and expansion.</P>
    <P>All doubts will be removed if a suitable plan is presented outlining the direction in which the Government wish to go.  Governments take so much of the people's money nowadays, and put themselves in the position of controlling to a serious extent the affairs of a nation, that they cannot hold themselves apart from the responsibility which is theirs to take in relation to every sector of the economy. We must ask if the people are being given any guidance by the Government as to where they are going in the future.  I am not being in any way political when I say that the first essential of a proper policy and programme is a stable single-party Government, a Government with a unified outlook in relation to economies and which will <Col N="506" /> not be blown off course at times of difficulty.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the Government have no plan but they promise that one day they may produce a programme. This is not of much help because we are in a crisis situation.  The Minister should direct all his energies towards getting us out of this emergency and should take whatever steps are necessary in this regard before we reach the point of no return.  He should be endeavouring to instil into people a sense of emergency regarding any programme for the future.  However, he is doing nothing in this regard in the budget.  He should be concentrating on the one sector of the economy which can help to bring immediate relief to the situation, that is, the manufacturing or industrial sector.</P>
    <P>When we were in Government I recall a situation in which there was an increase in the unemployment figures beyond what might be regarded as normal.  We called special meetings of the Government to deal with the problem, to find out where employment might be created and also to ensure the cutting of any red tape that might have been holding up the provision of jobs.  The Minister should do likewise in the present situation. Every possible incentive should be given in an effort to get us out of the rut in which we find ourselves. Much can be done by way of fiscal programmes but there is scarely any improvement in that situation so far as the budget is concerned.  Indeed, the budget only presents further obstacles to solving the problem.  One has only to consider the various reactions to the budget to realise that it is not geared in any way towards solving our problems.</P>
    <P>Is it not time that the whole credit situation was examined so as to ascertain to what extent credit can be put to productive development? Is it not time to ensure that the banks operate in a way that would give private enterprise an opportunity to overcome their difficulties of liquidity?  Has the Minister thought of discussing with the commercial banks the question of whether term loans should be abandoned and the <Col N="507" /> old system of overdrafts reintroduced, at least for a period that would enable business people and those with small industries to extricate themselves from their difficulties and to re-employ some of those they have laid off?  It is time, too, to examine all our financial institutions to find out whether they are giving loans for the right purposes.  Has any effort been made to bring together all those involved in the credit business so that they might be made aware of the serious situation of the economy?  If this were done these people might work together to assist in putting the economy back on its feet.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether all the State-sponsored bodies have been called together and asked to participate in a drive towards recovery.  What, for instance, are Bord Fáilte doing to implement the plan they issued recently?  Are there any short-term plans to boost tourism or will the country be left to suffer from the serious adverse effects which the budget will have on that industry? Are means being made available to Board Fáilte to ensure that they can implement their policy in the short term and, thereby, bring about immediate results?  All State-sponsored bodies should be warned that every penny they spend must be aimed at righting our economic situation and getting it back to the point it was at when this party left office.</P>
    <P>We have been criticised for laying too much stress on the importance of the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign but is it not ludicrous to have this pretence of such a campaign when we note what has been going on in the past few years, and particularly in recent times, when orders in regard to shipping, steel and many other important commodities have not been given the attention they should have received?  We shall leave aside the question of furniture for the moment.  The present situation justifies and demands that all those people who have vast amounts of money to spend be brought together and told that we are not living in times that can be regarded as normal and that, irrespective of what any EEC directive might contain or of what past <Col N="508" /> precedents have been regarding the acceptance of tenders, we must do everything in our power to ensure that Irish industry is given every opportunity possible to survive and expand. It should get the benefit of any Irish money that is being spent for the manufacture or purchase of various commodities. Apparently there are some people who are prepared to place their orders with concerns outside the country and not to have any regard for Irish enterprise.  Rather, they regard themselves as living in an open and free economy where they are free to purchase goods which to their way of thinking are more in keeping with the high standards they apply to themselves than are the Irish-manufactured articles.</P>
    <P>All of this might be acceptable in times of a buoyant economy in which there was a movement towards full employment but they are unforgiveable during this time of crisis.  We should not rely on the little note which appears on the box of matches urging us to buy Irish.  That is all very well but much more is needed at this time when we are rapidly approaching bankruptcy.  Nothing should prevent the Government from taking what might be regarded as drastic action in regard to all these matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister went to great extremes to seek derogation from the EEC regulation and directives in relation to the postponement of the equal pay legislation which has been passed through the House, even to the extent of losing his head and letting down the country as well as himself and the Government by attacking one of the commissioners of the EEC, something which is an all-time low for any Government in the nine EEC countries. When the textile and footwear industries were feeling the draught which was attributed to the progressive reduction of import duties, why did we not seek derogation from the EEC directives on that occasion?  We were very prim and proper and afraid to offend anybody then or put a foot wrong in relation to the EEC regulations. When it suited us in relation to a most serious social matter, we looked for a derogation and we castigated our own commissioner, of whom the country <Col N="509" /> has a right to be proud, in regard to one of the most ugly affairs this Government have come through, and they have come through a good many.</P>
    <P>This sort of conduct is not likely to lead to a situation in which we would have the complete sympathy of all other countries, particularly the member states of the EEC, in getting out of the serious crisis into which we have been plunged due to not taking the proper action at the proper time.  We must look for help in every direction and we must particularly, if it is not too late now, ensure that no further orders will be placed outside this country for goods we can produce here ourselves.</P>
    <P>I do not want to flog a dead horse but placing that furniture order outside this country was inexcusable and the Minister cannot extricate himself from responsibility for that happening in the first instance.  If the Government had been approaching the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign against the background of the serious and rapidly deteriorating economic situation, the clarion call would have gone out long before that no attempt should be made by any State-sponsored body to send orders outside the country in the volume that has been involved without having reasons which would be approved by the Government.  Not merely did we lose an opportunity at a time when it was sorely needed but we also cast a great reflection on the Irish people whose resilience, whose capabilities and adaptability are second to none when called upon to do a job, even though it might not be the kind of work to which they are ordinarily accustomed.  I refer to such jobs as steel fabrication, the expertise for which if it were not available, could be immediately acquired, and I am perfectly sure that not merely as good a job but a better job would be done than by any outside firm.</P>
    <P>I cannot see what would be wrong with a furniture designer designing whatever type of special furniture or furnishings would be required, and then going around and asking firms if they could undertake to manufacture them or if they could do half of them, and getting another firm to do the other <Col N="510" /> half.  The reputation of our people as craftsmen would enable them to rise to the occasion and produce anything to meet the highest standards attainable in the manufacture of such goods.</P>
    <P>The atmosphere created by the Government was such that people felt themselves free to go where they liked and get what they liked and ignore the economic situation, the seriousness of which was not brought home to them.  It is no excuse to say it was too late when they heard what was being done.  Months and years before it happened is when the message should have been delivered to these people.  It must be delivered by the general behaviour of the Government who would not then have to sit down and write a letter to any body or corporation telling them what they should do.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that we had a discussion on this matter and that it is scarcely relevant to the budget debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to enter into any acrimonious discussion with the Chair about it.  Perhaps I have over-played it, but it is very relevant at a time when we are discussing the whole question of the economy and in the light of the amount of ridicule to which we have been exposed before the world by our own actions.  I am discussing some of the things the Minister should initiate as a matter of urgency, if we are to bring the economy back on the road to progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to criticise the lack of effort for tourism.  If the budget was designed to discourage tourists coming here, it could not do more damage than it is likely to do.  The only answer somebody on the other side of the House had in relation to that the other day was: &ldquo;Other countries are more expensive&rdquo;.  That is the type of talk that leads us to what we are today. From the beginning we should have aimed at a more reasonable cost of living.  The right action was not taken in relation to rising prices.  The Government spearheaded the move which has brought us to a situation in <Col N="511" /> which they cannot take the same drastic action as they would otherwise be entitled to take.</P>
    <P>We took a serious view of the Arab oil increase and said it would ruin our economy.  It raised the cost of living for everybody and had a serious effect on the economy generally.  If we were appalled, as we said we were, why did we put more on it ourselves than the Arabs put on?  The Minister introduced in the House one day a mere statutory order the effect of which was to take millions of pounds from the pockets of the ordinary people, the middle-class working people.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was trying to convince me across the floor one day that we did not walk enough, that it was to prevent people from using more fuel that the price was being increased.  Then to get more revenue from it the Minister for Finance has another whack at it in his budget.</P>
    <P>We are not giving any encouragement to the private sector to cooperate at a time when their co-operation is much needed.  All the measures we might take to generate employment have been neglected. There is no effort to give serious attention to the problem we are facing.  If one went into the planning office in the last two years one would see plans for thousands of buildings being held up for two or three years. If somebody did a few weeks work there, turned down the plans which should be turned down and gave approval to those worthy of approval, employment would be generated for thousands of people.  That demonstrates the complete lack of urgency which this Micawber-like Government attach to the serious situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>We expect a great deal of effort from the private sector.  The man who employs 30 or 40 people is in a serious situation because he must pay increased social insurance, higher postage bills, and greatly increased telephone accounts&mdash;usually for a telephone which does not work.  His rates are also increased.  He is paying all these increases but is entitled to none of the benefits.  Unless he is an <Col N="512" /> exporter, he pays tax three different ways.  Where is the incentive for this man to create more jobs which will shorten the ever-growing line of our unemployed?</P>
    <P>What are Governments for?  Would we not have been better off without a Government for the last three years?  At a funeral the other day I heard a once staunch Fine Gael supporter say: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil could not be worse&rdquo;.  His friend said &ldquo;If we had no Government at all for the past few years we would be better off today&rdquo;.  The civil service would make a better job of running the country if they did not have the obstacle of a Government which did not follow the dictates of common principles.  We are borrowing one day after another.  This money must be repaid.  The interest, too, must be paid with money which is badly needed for the creation of jobs.  Maybe the situation is not as serious as I see it.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us what he did in the past is right.  If there is the slightest improvement in the situation, some Minister is on his feet taking credit for it, but if things go wrong, we are told they are due to factors beyond their control.</P>
    <P>It has been said in the House on many occasions that the real test of any Government is the number unemployed.  If that test is applied to this Government, they have failed utterly.  Making allowance for all the external factors which would inevitably have some effect on trade, the performance of the Government to offset to the maximum the effects of world recession has not reflected any credit on a Government that has been credited with some ability and foresight.</P>
    <P>The only Government which can pursue a policy and plan to put before the people is a Government comprising a single party that has the necessary stability to be able to show their projections for the future, and which will not be trespassing on the other man's idealism.</P>

I can safely say that if the Labour Party, as they have done in the past, feel like coming in to support us, we will not coalesee because we do not believe coalition governments were or ever will be capable of making real progress in this or any other country.  You only get the best type of democracy out of a single-minded party with a policy and the stability to see it through.</P>

      <P>That could be; their lack of stability causes them to break up.  For a number of years we had the example of France until they got a strong man to show them the way and expose the weaknesses of coalition governments generally.</P>
      <P>Our third programme for economic and social development for 1969-72 might not be regarded as a spectacular success.  We might not have hit the target as well as we did in our first and second programmes but it was a blue-print expressing the desires, aims and the channels into which our resources were being directed so that any man, whether an outsider wishing to invest or a local entrepreneur with money to invest, knew the direction we wanted to go. It permitted the necessary flexibility. If it went off course, we had corrective measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Finance, copying the United States and elsewhere, brought in programme budgeting.  We were really becoming organised.  I remember taking the pamphlet issued by the Department of Finance in November, 1970, to bed so that I could understand programme budgeting. Paragraph 4 set out the fundamentals of programme budgeting.  It said that the programme budgeting focussed attention on forward planning and on establishing budgets relating to plans and programmes.  It also said that programme budgeting stresses results, the measurement of progress towards objectives and the expenditure needed to produce those <Col N="514" /> results.  In other words, we were adopting programme budgeting which would ensure that from month to month, week to week, and day to day, you knew where you were going, when you could ease off a little, or where you could apply more resources. We were really making progress then but now nobody knows where we are going.</P>
    <P>The Keynes theory propounded that unemployment brought down wages and because many people were clamouring for a few jobs they were willing to take them at any price. That theory is outmoded now and does not apply because we have reached the stage where we are capable of paying our people a good wage, irrespective of the numbers employed.  We should not use the recession as an excuse to postpone equal pay, which the Government have attempted to do.  The Keynesian theory of using monetary policy to prevent our sliding too rapidly downhill at a time when we were in a trade cycle spin or of easing off when we were moving upwards too rapidly is still sound enough policy.</P>
    <P>How can we hope to get out of the present recession if we borrow money for our current spending, if we do not give incentives to industry and if we impose taxes on private enterprise? People must plan in advance; this applies to those who have money to invest as well as to those with growing families who wish to place them in a worthwhile area of employment. There is no guidance for any of those people.  It is a question of hit and miss.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine the credit situation in the country.  Would it not be worthwhile to restore the confidentiality that the banks once enjoyed?  So far as commercial banks are concerned, a person might as well leave his money at the crossroads and put a stone on it.  Now the Revenue authorities can pry into all kinds of situations.  Millions of pounds have gone out of the country although there is now an effort being made to get the money back.  If we want to ensure that the commercial banks have the necessary reserves, confidentiality <Col N="515" /> should be restored.  If people who have money to lend have the necessary confidence in the system and in the country they will lend it. We should ensure that such money is used for productive purposes in order to give the necessary impetus to business and commerce to complete on the world markets.  We have frequently pointed out that the devaluation of the £ should have been a tremendous incentive and help to our exporters.  It had not that effect because our costings had risen too much.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to make an assessment of the situation.  I was surprised to hear the Taoiseach forecasting an increase of 2 per cent in the growth rate because he did not give any facts or figures to support that forecast. The trade figures for January have shown an increase in imports and the balance of trade deficit has gone askew.  That may not be a bad sign; it may mean that people are starting to replenish their stocks.  We have not been given any guidance about what the future may hold.</P>
    <P>The Government have not produced any plan; we do not think it is due to inability to produce it but it is due to the situation in which the Government find themselves.  The two conflicting ideals in the Government cannot coalesce in formulating a plan acceptable to both parties.  In the old days when Fine Gael and the Labour Party had no hope of forming a single party Government they could churn out a policy every six months.  It was no trouble because they knew they would not be called on to implement it.  I am involved in the formulation of policy-making for my party.  I hope to have an opportunity to present that policy; it will not be the programme of 14 points drawn up overnight which has eroded the credibility of the present set-up.  Anyone can sit down and write out a litany of pious aspirations and present that as a policy document.  This is what Fine Gael did in the past.  The knowledge that one will never be called on to implement it leaves one free to undertake such a project without attempting to set out any costing or to make any estimations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was interesting to listen to Deputy Brennan's speech. His final remarks were pertinent.  Parliament is composed of an Opposition and a Government.  The Opposition also have a duty to be strong and constructive and they must keep a Government on their toes.  Unless they are seen to do this democracy and the parliamentary system may be injured.  The confidence of our people will also be affected.</P>
      <P>Any Government worth their salt should engage in the exercise of self-criticism and self-analysis and it would be worthwhile for the Government to do this more often.  As a backbencher I have been criticised on many occasions because I express my own views and I criticise the Government.  I reserve the right to do this, not because I am destructive about it but because I think it is good for a Government that one of their members should criticise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For 16 years Fianna Fáil were in power and their members dutifully passed through the division lobbies without questioning one act of the Government.  It is not a sign of a healthy democracy or good Government that its members should not offer constructive criticism.  For too long we have had this lobby fodder, where the backbenchers did not offer any suggestions.  We might change that system.  Members of the Government parties might set the precedent in this Parliament, perhaps at times speaking against our own parties.  We <Col N="517" /> might be able to tell them that they are not always right, that the backbenchers are closer to the ordinary people.  This is a sign of a healthy Parliament, Government and democracy. I shall be making some pertinent statements about and criticisms of the Government and I trust the Minister for Finance will bear with me.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leat, a Cheann Comhairle, ligint dom an cheist seo an phlé.  Ní rabhas sásta leis na freagraí a thug an tAire inné agus tá mé cinnte gur ábhar an-thábhachtach é seo do na daoine a bhaineann sé leo.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I had occasion to ask the Minister for Education if he would give an assurance in regard to promises on school transport made to people in the Ballymount national school and the Clongorey national school catchment areas in County Kildare.  The Minister's reply was that the general rule in regard to transport in the case of amalgamation is that children who reside in the district of the closed school get free transport to the new central school, and that this is what is happening in the two cases mentioned in the question.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that the answer given by the Minister is incorrect because this is not what is happening in the two areas.  I accept, because the Minister has told me so, that he is not aware of what is happening in his Department, that much of what went on in regard to the matters I have revealed to him was news to him.  However, has not his Parliamentary Secretary a duty to make him aware of these things?  As I see it, so much wrong is being done, so much pressure is being applied and there is such an outcry in this area, that it is my duty to expose these wrongs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ballymount national school is in Crookestown parish, probably better known as Narraghmore, in the <Col N="518" /> diocese of Dublin, and Ballyshannon national school is in Suncroft parish in the diocese of Kildare and Leighlin.  Some nine or ten years ago Ballymount school was amalgamated with Crookestown national school and parents and pupils in the area were promised that all pupils then attending the schools, and their successors, would be conveyed to Crookstown national school, and Very Reverend Fr. Brophy, P.P. of Crookstown, has two letters from the Department to this effect.  Before amalgamation took place, at Ballymount at a public meeting a local parent, a Mrs. Doyle, asked a question and asked for a guarantee from the Department that pupils from new houses to be erected in the area would also be carried.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Parents asked for and were given this guarantee.  The guarantee is official from an official of the Department and this can be vouched for by many people if they are given the opportunity.  I have a copy of the map drawn by the Department at that time which outlines the catchment area of Ballyshannon national school in 1968 and it indicates that all families living there at the time of the closure who would be sending their children to Ballymount national school would be transported freely to Crookestown national school.</P>
      <P>The guarantee was given to a meeting of parents in Ballymount school that the children living in that area and those who would come to reside in the area, or children yet unborn&mdash; that was the expression used, still remembered by people in the area&mdash; would get free transport to Crookestown national school.  Only three families&mdash;I refrain from giving their names&mdash;were excluded from that list because they were at that time attending Ballyshannon national school, and two families who lived in that area at the time I will refer to later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see an attempt is now being made to phase out this catchment area, and last year I raised <Col N="519" /> the matter of a child attending the Ballymount school who sought free transport because the mother was ill and he was living with his grandmother in the Ballymount area.  There was an investigation into that at the time and this appeared to delay a decision in regard to what should be done in this case.  An official from the Department called to investigate and I have reason to believe he is the same official who met the deputation who recently called to the Department. This official told Mrs. Casserly that if the children were not taken off the bus he would give up his job.  Is that not an unusual statement for a Department official to make?  Was it not an example of his intent when he came to investigate the case?  It convinces me that he had no intention of being impartial.</P>
    <P>On 22nd December last CIE took up the tickets from the children concerned and in one case the children who were living in the old dispensary in the Ballymount catchment area had their tickets taken from them. They had enjoyed free travel to Crookestown national school during the last six years.  One of these children suffers from asthma and was very sick.  A doctor's letter and certificate will prove that she is incapable of walking to the Ballyshannon school, where the Department would have her attend.</P>
    <P>Another family, whose children have enjoyed free transport for six years are also being denied free transport, though they are miles inside the Ballymount catchment area. There is no tradition in this family and tradition was mentioned very freely the other day when the deputation called.  There is no tradition that children from this family should attend anywhere other than Ballymount, and since Ballymount is now closed, Crookestown.  But the fact that the mother in this case drove the school bus and provided transport for children to Ballyshannon placed her in an awkward situation regarding transport and made her position very vulnerable to the undue pressure that was exerted on her to have her <Col N="520" /> children attend Ballyshannon national school.</P>
    <P>Parents in the area, particularly people in the Calverstown area sending their children to Crookestown school were subjected to pressure. One parent was threathened that if his children did not attend Ballyshannon national school some friends of a certain teacher would call on the parent concerned and that he would have a nasty accident.  This was reported to the gardaí in Kilcullen. It is not hearsay.  I mention this to give the Minister an indication of the pressures being brought to bear on parents, and also to give the Mini-an idea of the calibre of the people whose cause he now champions.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the exceptional interest of the INTO in this case.  Their concern arises over the danger of falling averages in Ballyshannon, and the danger of the loss of a third teacher in that school.  While I can sympathise with this view, I would not be a party to the downgrading of Crookestown national school to help to preserve Ballyshannon as a national school.  I was asked to take the side of Ballyshannon in this case, and I refused, but the attitude of the Department convinces me that they are using every effort to promote Ballyshannon and in doing so, must do so at the expense of Crookestown.</P>
    <P>Deputy Malone sent a letter to one of the parents concerned in the Calverstown area from Deputy Bruton, Parliamentary Secretary, stating that the reason for the removal of tickets from certain pupils was that the INTO brought pressure to bear.  I am a staunch member of the INTO and I have been since I first taught in a national school, and I say that the INTO was never intended as an organisation to promote one national school at the expense of another.  Why is it that the Department and the Parliamentary Secretary bow to such pressure?  Not so very long ago Crookestown had an enrolment of 250 pupils.  They now have 232 on the role.  Figures were given to me quite recently by the local parish priest and manager, who is very concerned. He has a task facing him to <Col N="521" /> build two new classrooms and a general purpose room.  He now wonders will these be necessary at all, or what position will his school be in if the trend is allowed to continue. Quite recently to try to resolve this difficulty a deputation of the parish priest and other responsible people from the Crookestown and Ballymount areas called on the Department to discuss this matter.  They were all unanimous that they might as well have stayed at home.  The official that they met was not very anxious to listen to the case they were making and, in the words of one of the deputation had a cynical grin on his face. He dismissed the case.  He was not prepared to pay much attention to the two documents that the parish priest had, promising transport to all the children in the area and to their successors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  The deputation wanted to show him the map but he did not want to hear about that.  They wanted to tell him of the promise to carry children yet unborn and he denied any pressure from the INTO until the letter from Deputy Malone was read to him so it is quite clear to me that the officials of the Department were quite prepared to cover up information to make a case for themselves. In other words, this is an attempt by the Department to cover up intimidation, the abuse of free transport, undue pressure on parents and, to my mind, the Department stands condemned and in the eyes of the parents and the priests concerned in Crookestown parish and particularly in the eyes of those in the Ballymount catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One way out, as I see it, is for the Minister to allow a full public inquiry which will help to clear the name of the Minister and his party and his Department and his Parliamentary Secretary.  I am confident the priests and the people concerned will welcome this now and I will attend personally, <Col N="522" /> too, and I will prove and stand over anything I have said here and I can assure the Minister I do not intend to shelter under the privilege of the House in anything I said here today.</P>
    <P>To prove special facilities have been granted to children to attend Ballyshannon national school I would like to read the two concluding paragraphs of the letter from the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary dated 27th January last.</P>
    <P>The position is that (the particular child referred to) resides 3.0 miles from Crookestown NS, the nearest school and 3.7 miles from Ballyshannon NS.  She is therefore eligible for free transport to Crookestown NS, to which a transport service operates from a point 0.5 miles from her home.</P>
    <P>It would not, normally, be open to the Department to provide transport, whether free or on a fare-paying basis, for her to any other school.  I understand however that older children in the King family have had free transport to Ballyshannon NS for some time.  As Ballyshannon NS is not the nearest national school the facility was allowed for them contrary to the normal operations of the Free School Transport scheme.  The Department has been authorised to continue the facility for them under the terms of an exceptional arrangement which allows children to keep concessions already granted.  This exceptional arrangement also allows the younger children of the same family to be accommodated as fare-paying passengers to the same school, even though there is a service to their nearest school.  In this way (this girl) may be allowed travel as a fare-paying passenger to Ballyshannon NS, provided that there is room on the bus to accommodate her.</P>
    <P>I was glad to get that particular information because I am the person who sought that facility for her.  My policy is, if I can get free transport for anyone, I will get it.  I will not do anyone <Col N="523" /> a bad turn.  I was never the cause yet of taking free transport or fare-paying facilities from any pupil.  I am beginning to doubt now whether the Minister's colleagues can say the same and I am confident that the Deputies with whom he was reluctantly forced to coalesce and their lackeys cannot say the same.  I will now repeat that a cousin of the present Minister for Education, who lives miles into the Ballymount catchment area, is being carried to Ballyshannon and every local person is convinced that this is political patronage.  The Minister informed me yesterday that he was not aware of this and I am quite prepared to believe him, but many others do not, and is it not extraordinary that when the Department decides, as they did in that particular matter, that they can give concessions already granted to Ballyshannon, exceptional concessions, why did they not continue the concessions already granted to Crookestown when there is room on the Crookestown bus?  But CIE or the Department will not allow the children to travel on it even though there is room and they are prepared to pay.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is that new houses will be built, if the money is available, during the present year in Calverstown. The map shows the particular site is in the Crookestown area and, if this matter is allowed to fester and cause dissension, the Minister will have much more trouble later on.  It would appear to me that the present policy is a little bit different from what it was.  There was a programme years ago on television, &ldquo;Have Gun, Will Travel&rdquo;, and the present policy does seem to be &ldquo;Have Political Influence, Will Travel&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I will come now to a matter nearer home.  It concerns Clongorey national school which was amalgamated with Carragh national school some five years ago.  I told the people that time, as I was very much involved being the principal teacher of Carragh national school, of the promise that had been made and honoured before and helped, I think the Department will agree, to ensure a very quiet amalgamation because the people did <Col N="524" /> feel that the promises made would be kept, but now we have a situation where people living in new houses in the Barrettstown area, which is traditionally the catchment area of Clongorey national school, are being denied free transport to Carragh national school.  I mentioned the case of one particular family before Christmas and, if we are so keen on tradition, tradition favours this particular family on both sides as the father's people all went to Clongorey national school and the mother's people all went to Carragh national school and they are direct descendants of the grand old lady who won the title of &ldquo;Grandmother of the Year&rdquo; on the Bunny Carr Show recently and still going strong.  Everything is in these people's favour but I can tell you they will all need to be going very strong if the Minister does not soon provide the transport that was promised in their case.</P>
    <P>No decision that I have heard of has been taken in this case yet.  Certainly none was conveyed to me.  They were told they would not get free transport.  I wonder why there is such a delay in reaching a decision in this particular case?  I am convinced that this is a very corrupt case.  It is quite obvious from the examples I have given that what is considered sauce for one group is not sauce for the other.  It is an example of dictation to and intimidation of parents and the fact that the Minister was not aware of this, despite many letters from me and despite the presence on the Order Paper of a parliamentary question, convinces me that someone in his Department is taking very serious decisions and not acquainting him of them.  The fact that the Minister's own relations are getting priority treatment is surely good enough reason for a departmental inquiry to be held in public in Crookestown.  It might help the Minister to clear the air now.  To my mind this case, to use a phrase of Deputy Thornley's, stinks and many of those involved might be glad of the chance to salvage their good names.  As far as I am concerned, silence on this matter will only be construed as an admission of guilt.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> If the parish priest and responsible people in the area were prepared to lose their day and come to Dublin, there must be some merit in the case. They went home disheartened.  I would ask the Minister to let the truth be known.  If he has nothing to hide he has nothing to fear.  If he denies our reasonable request, people in Crookestown and Ballymount and Calverstown and Clongorey will only draw their own conclusions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Richard Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to Deputy Power's question, the general rule in regard to transport in the case of amalgamation is that children who reside in the district of the closed school get free transport to the new central school.  This is what is happening in the two cases the Deputy has raised.  Ballymount national school was closed on 7th January, 1969, and was amalgamated with Crookestown national school.  All the children who reside in the Ballymount closed school district have free transport to the central school in Crookestown.  The children around whom the present dispute revolves never attended Ballymount national school and reside nearer to Ballyshannon national school than to the site of the closed school at Ballymount.  Not only is it quite clear that these children reside in the Ballyshannon national school district but their homes are, in fact, less than two miles from Ballyshannon national school and they are not, therefore, eligible for free transport under the scheme.  One of these families lives less than a mile from Ballyshannon national school and the distances from Ballyshannon in the case of the other two families mentioned are 1.8 miles and 1.1 mile respectively.  One wonders if Deputy Power were principal in Ballyshannon if he would accept that children who resided such short distances from their school and were not entitled to free transport to that school should get free transport to the school five miles or more from their homes. Certainly, in these circumstances, it was not surprising that representations were made by the teachers in Ballyshannon and by the INTO that the Ballyshannon school district should not <Col N="526" /> be eroded by the provision of free transport for children living in that district and having no connection with the closed school at Ballymount to the central school at Crookestown.</P>
      <P>A large deputation led by the chairman of the board of management at Crookestown national school was received in my Department on the 10th February, 1976.  I understand that there was a long discussion on the whole and the Department's position was explained at length.  The situation is complicated by the fact that children from the two families in question were given transport in error to Crookestown national school.  This came to light when representations were made by Deputy Power on behalf of the Cassidy child who lived beside these two families.  Free transport had to be refused in respect of the Cassidy child because the family clearly live in the Ballyshannon school district and less than two miles from Ballyshannon national school. At the same time, facilities had to be withdrawn from the O'Connor and McDonald children as to continue transport for them and refusing the Cassidy child on whose behalf Deputy Power made representations would have been grossly inequitable and impossible to justify.  If anybody had the impression that the Ballymount school district was coterminus with the parish boundaries they were mistaken as to the basis on which school districts are determined.</P>
      <P>Deputy Power mentioned in the debate yesterday a cousin of mine.  I quote from the verbatim account:</P>
      <P>Will the Minister let me know why special facilities have been made available in Ballymount catchment area to get the pupils to attend Ballyshannon and whether it is a source of embarrassment to him that whether a person who is getting special treatment and is being carried to Ballyshannon is his own cousin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This child, Sandra Hickey, according to CIE investigation, lives 2.4 miles from Ballyshannon national school, 2.6 miles from the closed Ballymount national school and 4.3 miles from Crookestown national school.  She is in <Col N="527" /> receipt of free transport to Ballyshannon national school, which is her nearest school, and being under ten years of age and over two miles from her nearest school, she gets free transport under the normal conditions of the scheme.  I reject very much the implication in what Deputy Power has said that special facilities were provided to Ballyshannon national school because this child attended there.  I accept the Deputy's indication here today that he accepts my word that this is not so.  Indeed, it is interesting to note that the transport service which is now regarded as a special transport service to Ballyshannon was sanctioned in 1969 by the previous administration.</P>
    <P>The case has been made that at the time of the amalgamation children in the traditional school at Ballymount were promised free transport to Crookestown and that children from the Calverstown/Davidstown area traditionally attended Ballymount national school.  Investigations by my Department's inspectors have shown that the prepondrance of attendance from the Calverstown/Davidstown area has been to Ballyshannon and not to Ballymount.  Moreover none of the children involved in the present dispute ever attend Ballymount national school nor did their fathers. It is therefore not possible to accept the plea on the grounds of tradition.</P>
    <P>Clongorey national school was closed and amalgamated with Carragh national school on 4th September 1972.  Children from the Clongorey closed school district had free transport to Carragh national school. Deputy Power has made representations on behalf of one family who reside less than two miles from Newbridge national school and are not, therefore, eligible for free transport under the terms of the scheme.  This family's home is half a mile nearer to Newbridge national school than to the site of the closed Clongorey school and Carragh national school, to which they are seeking transport is about twice as far from them as Newbridge national school.  The argument based on traditional attendance has been <Col N="528" /> advanced in this case also but so far no evidence has been adduced that older members of this family ever attended Clongorey national school.  I am, however, having the matter investigated.</P>
    <P>The kernel of the whole matter is whether pupils reside in the district of the closed school.  It cannot be accepted that children who reside closer to a third school and would not even be eligible for free transport to that school or in the district of the closed school are so entitled to claim free transport to the central school, something I would emphasise for which they would not be eligible if they were going to their nearest school.  School transport must be organised on a rational and sensible basis, otherwise the cost, which is already very high, would become inordinately so and put the whole future of the scheme, which confers such great benefit on so many children, in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>These children, the older and the younger children to whom the Deputy referred, are less than two miles from their nearest school and are not, therefore, eligible for free transport. The concession to which the Deputy refers applies to those who are basically eligible for free transport.  These children are not eligible for free transport and the concession, cannot, therefore, be applied to them.</P>
    <P>The map which the Deputy produced in the House has no standing in the Department of Education.  I would deprecate very much aspersions cast on the officials of my Department as to their impartiality in regard to these matters.  I assure the House, and I am sure the Deputy will accept my word, that there is no question of any criteria other than the usual ones set down for the Department of Education over the years in conjunction with the Department of Finance.  The Deputy must accept my word of honour on this.  There is no question of anything other than ordinary regulations being carried out.  I want to emphasise that most strongly.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in reply to his Question No. 35 of the 24th April, 1974, on the subject, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, does not empower me to make regulations for the construction of roads and footpaths.  However, planning authorities may include standards and specifications in that regard in their development plan and many of them have done so.  Under section 26 of the Act conditions may be attached to planning permissions specifying standards for roads and footpaths.</P>
      <P>I also indicated that at the request of my Department An Foras Forbartha had prepared recommendations for site development works for housing areas and that housing authorities generally had been asked to adopt these standards in their own schemes and to encourage their use in private housing developments.  These recommendations of An Foras Forbartha have been published since the previous reply.</P>
