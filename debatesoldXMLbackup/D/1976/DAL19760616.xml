      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Redundancy Payments (Weekly Payments) Order, 1976,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 11th day of June, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this order is to give effect to a decision of the Government that an unemployed person's after-tax income from benefits should not exceed 85 per cent of the average net weekly earnings after tax that he had received prior to unemployment. This decision, announced by the Minister for Finance when introducing the budget on 28th January, 1976, derives from public concern that the cumulative benefits and concessions <Col N="996" /> available through different Government Departments to unemployed persons has left them with disposable incomes which are sometimes as great as, or even in certain instances higher than, their disposable incomes while at work.  This order concerns only redundancy weekly payments which are one of a number of benefits that an unemployed person may be entitled to receive.  The other benefits which when added with redundancy weekly payments shall not exceed that 85 per cent are unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, pay-related benefit and any refund of income tax paid as a result of unemployment.  However, if unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance by itself should exceed the 85 per cent, a person will receive only the unemployment benefit or assistance but without any diminution of it.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that in enacting the Social Welfare Bill, 1976, section 12, the Oireachtas has already provided the Minister for Social Welfare with the power to effect by regulations in so far as pay-related benefit is concerned what this order will effect in so far as redundancy weekly payments are concerned, that is to implement the Government's decision on the 85 per cent rule as outlined.  I understand that the regulations under this Act that are necessary to implement the 85 per cent decision in respect of pay-related benefit have been drafted and will shortly be made by the Minister for Social Welfare and duly laid before the House.</P>
    <P>The necessary change in the redundancy payment scheme with which I am now concerned requires an amendment of Schedule 1 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, the provisions of which apply to weekly payments.  While section 30 of the Act empowers the Minister for Labour to amend Schedule 1 by order, section 5 of the Act requires that a draft of such an order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving of the draft passed by each House before the order is made.</P>
    <P>The operation of the arrangements governing redundancy weekly payments <Col N="997" /> under the redundancy payments scheme is carried out on behalf of my Department by the employment offices of the Department of Social Welfare.  Under present arrangements payment of a redundancy weekly payment is subject to the rule that when combined with certain social welfare payments it must not exceed 100 per cent of normal weekly remuneration, namely gross taxable weekly earnings, including regular bonuses and payments in kind, at the time of declaration of redundancy, or £48.08, whichever is the lesser.  If the aggregate exceeds such limit, then entitlement to a redundancy weekly payment is reduced to keep the aggregate at that limit.  It is now proposed in this draft order, in accordance with the Government's decision, to substitute a new limit of 85 per cent of net average weekly earnings, namely net after-tax take home pay, or £50, whichever is the lesser.  Where redundancy weekly payments are combined with disability benefit or maternity allowance, the existing arrangement will continue except that the £48.08 limit will become £50.  The exclusion of persons in receipt of disability benefit or maternity allowance, or persons on short time working, and persons whose entitlements have been determined before the operative date, is unavoidable for practical administrative reasons, and the problems encountered in bringing such persons within the scope of the 85 per cent rule will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>Persons who while in receipt of redundancy weekly payments reach pensionable age will, as heretofore, remain entitled to the residue of these payments.  Finally, I should add that the new 85 per cent limit will be applicable to those who become unemployed on or after 21st June, 1976 and who because they were not unemployed during the preceding 13 weeks, submit a new claim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This order put before the House this morning regarding the curtailment of the payment of redundancy is a further indication of the lack of foresight of the Government in planning for the <Col N="998" /> economic situation generally.  They have placed before this House an order according to the 1967 Act, but I do not believe that the 1967 Act ever envisaged such a complex or complicated order being placed before this House.  It appears to me to be one of the most incomprehensible legalistic pieces of jargon ever placed by way of order before the House.  It would have been more appropriate to introduce it by way of a Bill which could be teased out on Committee Stage and possibly amended.  The Minister said it would not be practical to have it implemented without going into greater detail.  This is an indication of the lack of thought or effort which has gone into it.</P>
      <P>I realise the situation presents problems.  The cumulative benefits and concessions available to a person makes his position more attractive than it was prior to his becoming unemployed. This is serious.  It is demoralising in itself.  It encourages a person not to work.  It makes idleness and redundancy attractive.  As against that, there is the really genuine case of the person who has given a lifetime of service to a company being made redundant and going on the unemployment register at the wrong age to stay there with little hope for the future because the Government are not providing adequate opportunities for employment to safeguard him.</P>
      <P>I may be criticised, as I have been in the past, for not spelling out clearly what we would do.  This would take some considerable time.  It has been given thought and it is being given thought and it is possible to do it. The Government are trying to solve the unemployment problem by playing around with social welfare benefits and redundancy payments.  We must look on the positive side, not the negative side.  The positive side is getting people back to work.  The burden on the person working has been increased over the past year in particular because we have a diminishing work force and growing unemployment. People have been saddled with a higher stamp charge and a higher redundancy contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister some <Col N="999" /> questions on the content of the Order.  I should like him to simplify it, not only for Members of the House but for the personnel managers and the social welfare officers who will have to deal with it.  It should be put in a form which can be clearly and easily understood by them.  I want to ask the Minister about the refund of income tax.  As I see it, the 85 per cent refers to the net weekly earnings prior to the person's unemployment. The net weekly earnings do not include the tax he has been paying. Apparently he is entitled only to 85 per cent of that net figure.  The refund takes into consideration the tax refund he is getting.  Perhaps the Minister would explain this to me.  It seems to me that taxation is being imposed on him in two ways.  For the purpose of arriving at the 85 per cent, the income tax he is paying is not taken into account.  Secondly, when his weekly earnings after redundancy are being calculated, his refund of the income tax which he would have paid is taken as a payment to him.  There appears to be an injustice to the individual.</P>
    <P>There is another problem, and this is where the lack of foresight on the part of the Government is further evidenced.  No limit is imposed on the person who becomes redundant up to and including 20th June.  Limits are imposed on people who become redundant after 21st June.  This is probably unavoidable in the circumstances. A date had to be decided on.  Surely this should have been anticipated.  The Ministers concerned, and particularly the Minister for Finance, should have envisaged the situation which was arising.  Admittedly the Minister for Foreign Affairs is standing in for the Minister for Labour.  I would have expected to get from him a detailed analysis of the present state of the redundancy fund.</P>
    <P>This is important to the people who have been contributing to that fund for a long time, and who are burdened not only by the contribution but also by social welfare contributions generally and by the growing demands of direct and indirect taxation.  These working people are suffering from the <Col N="1000" /> mismanagement of the Government more than anyone else.  I want to put it on the record of this House that they are carrying a burden they will not carry indefinitely.  The Government should wake up and realise these people should be kept informed fully of the state of the funds which come up for discussion in this House.  There was a time when the redundancy fund was in a very healthy state.  The Minister has given us no details about it this morning.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the calculation of income tax.  This is a particularly complicated order.  We have the usual definitions.  We are told the Act of 1971 means the Redundancy Payments Act, 1971, the order of 1974 means the Redundancy Payments (Weekly Payments and Lump Sum) Order, 1974, and the Principal Act means the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967.  We are told:</P>
    <P>Subject to subclause (ii) of this subparagraph, the total amount being paid in respect of a week to a person shall not exceed 85 per cent of his average net weekly earnings or £50, whichever is the lesser, but he shall not receive in respect of unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, pay-related benefit or supplementary benefit less than that to which he would, but for this Act, have been entitled.</P>
    <P>What Act?  Is it not this order we are talking about, or are they trying to confuse the people still further by referring to an Act when it appears to me they mean the order.  If the Minister corrects me I will accept his correction. Let me come to the calculation.  The order states:</P>
    <P>For the purpose of subparagraph (1)  of this paragraph, a person's average net weekly earnings shall be calculated by&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  ascertaining his reckonable earnings (within the meaning of the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973) for his relevant employment period,</P>
    <P>(ii)  subtracting from those reckonable earnings the amount of income tax...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> This is the one I am querying in particular&mdash;</P>
    <P>... deducted from those reckonable earnings and the employee's portion (if any) of the amount of pay-related contributions payable by him in respect of those earnings.</P>
    <P>(iii)  dividing the remainder under clause (ii)  by the number of complete weeks in his relevant employment period, and</P>
    <P>(iv)  deducting from the quotient under clause (iii)  the employee's portion (if any) of the employment contribution which was payable by an employee in the employment in which that person was employed in the last week of his relevant employment period.</P>
    <P>To the people who may have drafted it, this may seem simple, but it is complicated, complex and difficult for the ordinary man in the street.  Would the Minister suggest that orders of this kind would be accompanied by some sort of explanatory memoranda which would help ordinary people to interpret and understand the instruments.</P>
    <P>We are not opposing this order.  We realise the necessity for it but we condemn and criticise the Government for the situation they have landed us in, a situation they have created and which they were not able to anticipate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity for this change of the 1967 Act was visualised in the budget.  At that time the Minister spoke about public concern in this respect.  Of course the public are concerned about this and other matters and the Government must now have begun to realise that public concern is something to which they must have some regard.  Public concern has become a moral issue which must be considered side by side with the realism of the present situation, when money is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the pleasure of amending the Redundancy Payments Act when the fund had accumulated and there was <Col N="1002" /> a considerable surplus.  I then improved the benefits.  We visualised then that our EEC entry would create a good deal of musical chairs in employment, that there would be changing from one employment to another, from one industry to another, that we would move progressively to better industrialisation, and we visualised a good deal of investment here from countries which were not EEC members who would take advantage of our membership. We foresaw a considerable change in the format of our industrial structure.</P>
    <P>This was rudely interrupted by the advent of the present Government and the situation we are facing here today has to be confronted whether we like it or not.  The redundancy payments legislation and the amendment which I introduced to it would be due for review by the Minister now in the light of the experience he must have had of the working of the legislation. I visualised at that time, and I wonder if it has been monitored by the Department, that people would condition themselves to becoming redundant almost on the eve of their retirement on pension.  If a worker continues in employment until retirement comes he is not entitled to redundancy payments, but if he can manipulate it so that he can become redundant six months earlier, he can get benefits.  In this regard I was surprised that semi-State bodies such as the Forestry Division have frequently acquiesced in this arrangement.  It is not the fault of the workers who succeeded in benefiting, but this sort of thing does not do much to allay the public concern about which we hear so much talk.</P>
    <P>This should give us reason to have a second look at the redundancy position generally to see if we cannot devise something so that the legislation is not manipulated in a manner which would erode the fund and defeat the purpose for which we brought it in.  That was one of the most beneficial pieces of social legislation in our statute book and it is of the greatest importance that it should be properly administered and not abused.  I am afraid that the purpose for which this <Col N="1003" /> was initiated has been fairly well obscured because of the absence of any proper plan or programme in regard to increasing employment and the provision of job opportunities. That fundamental aspect is being completely neglected.</P>
    <P>It is therefore important that the anomalies and abuses which give rise to public concern should be dealt with without delay rather than having to come in here&mdash;I use this occasion to say it lest we be accused of not reminding the Minister at the appropriate time&mdash;to curtail the amount of benefits people are entitled to receive under the scheme.  I should like to see the Minister taking some positive steps towards providing for continuation of employment and consequently obviating the need for redundancy payments, the creation of new job opportunities and giving producers and exporters a climate in which they can expand and therefore retain people in employment.</P>
    <P>The old talk about &ldquo;factors beyond our control&rdquo; has worn so thin that it cannot any longer be relied on.  We take from the taxpayers so much money, so many millions, that we are not in a position any longer to rely on &ldquo;factors beyond our control&rdquo;.  While we are taking such an enormous percentage of the earnings of our people we have to take responsibility for the conduct of our economic affairs.  We have to justify the massive impositions on production and the enormous amounts we are taking from workers' pockets.  The well is running dry.  The Minister has not given us any account of how the redundancy fund stands, whether it is in surplus or deficit. When the fund was in surplus we on this side had the pleasure of improving the amounts of benefits and thus cushioning people against the full impact of the serious situation into which they had been plunged.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to get down to the basics.  It is significant that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is sitting in for the Minister for Labour because I remember him when we were in office, when I was sitting over there, having, as Deputy Garret FitzGerald, a panacea for every economic <Col N="1004" /> ill, in articles on finance in magazines and newspapers.  He told us how everything could be regulated and manipulated without any difficulty. I am surprised and disgusted that he has not brought to bear some of his magical knowledge to the practical running of the Government, to the grassroots work of giving men and women employment to enable them to live, giving industrialists an opportunity to produce and expand, cutting the shackles binding people who are trying to generate wealth and make a contribution to progress, and not leaving us in the position of having to come in here and do little cosmetic jobs on things like the redundancy fund designed to alloy public concern because of people getting too much money as a result of possible manipulation of the different social welfare benefits that can be drawn.</P>
    <P>It is very like scraping the bottom of the barrel throwing in this income tax refund here.  I agree with Deputy G. Fitzgerald that this should be removed from the order.  The possibility is this refund might not become payable until after the death of the claimant. It takes quite a time to assess what is due by way of refund and a claimant may die before he becomes entitled to the 85 per cent.  This looks like scraping the bottom of the barrel and one of these days the bottom will be worn very thin because it is getting quite a bit of scraping now.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have another look at this legislation to see what improvements can be made.  The possibility is that anomalies can be removed and abuses eradicated.  This is comparatively new legislation. When we introduced it it was on trial, more or less, and it should be subject to review from time to time.  Any deficiencies can then be removed.  The Minister should take an overall look at this legislation instead of bringing in these complex orders which are so difficult, as Deputy G. Fitzgerald said, for the average man to understand. With orders like this there should be job opportunities for auditors and accountants to decipher the complexities of the forms.  Where redundancies <Col N="1005" /> occur it is almost imperative for one to call in the experts to examine the position.  The whole thing has become too complex and we should simplify rather than create further complexity. Those entitled to benefit would need the services of an ombudsman to straighten out their position and discover the different benefits to which they may be entitled, forecasting the possible rebate of income tax to which one may be entitled.  The Minister should simplify the whole thing and that can best be done by amending the original legislation.  We had a great many bankruptcies and though redundancy payment was made a first charge on the assets in many cases it was not recoverable.  The position should be examined carefully now and that examination can only be done by an overall look at the legislation generally, bringing in an amending Bill in due time to make all round improvements and doing away with the necessity for these complex orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very simple document, symptomatic of the Government's <i>laissez-faire</i> approach to this very serious problem of redundancy. The Minister might have given us some background showing the state of the fund, the number of redundancies so far this year and the number that may occur during the rest of the year. Will there be an increase in the stamp because of the dwindling workforce having to meet greater outgoings?  In the very first paragraph the Minister said:</P>
      <P>This decision, announced by the Minister for Finance when introducing the budget on 28th January, 1976, derives from public concern that the cumulative benefits and concessions available through different Government Departments to unemployed persons has left them with disposable incomes which are sometimes as great as, or even in certain instances higher than, their disposable incomes while at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to be the fashion to slander those who have lost their employment and the Minister's concern seems to be that the unemployed may be drawing higher disposable incomes than <Col N="1006" /> they had when they were actually working.  The vast majority of the unemployed are unemployed through no fault of their own.  They are unemployed because of lack of policy by the present Government and they are now being made the scapegoats.  They did not suffer enough by losing their jobs but the Minister for Labour, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is now going to make sure their incomes are kept down to 85 per cent of their wages.  I think this is preparing the ground for more drastic measures the Government intend to take very shortly either by increasing the price of the stamp or cutting back on the amount of redundancy payment. What the Minister should be doing is increasing the amount.  No man wants to go on drawing the dole. Think of the position of the thousands of young people who have failed to get a first job.  The Minister's glib statement annoys me because of its lack of concern for the unfortunate unemployed.  Surely the Government could produce some kind of white paper dealing with the whole problem of redundancy and retirement.  Should the older people be retired earlier to make jobs available for others?  The economists might not approve but it would show some positive action by the Government to remedy redundancies.</P>
    <P>This document does nothing to give anyone confidence that the Government are thinking beneath the surface or that they appreciate the state of the economy, where there is a record number of unemployed, and then we rap them in the manner outlined in the paragraph I quoted.  It is like the words of a Victorian do-gooder to show how benevolent the State is to allow these people to draw 85 per cent, but the public are concerned about this matter, and the Government, therefore, act because there is public concern.</P>
    <P>I read in the papers about a demonstration in the city last night which shows the public are becoming concerned very much not at the fact that unemployed people are drawing 85 per cent of their wage or salary but at the fact that 160,000 people <Col N="1007" /> cannot draw any money apart from State benefits.  It is time that the Government should recognise that the writing is on the wall and that unless they take appropriate remedial action and convince the people, including the unemployed people, that they are concerned with more than just limiting the amount of social welfare through redundancy payments which can be paid to people, they may not be sowing dragons' teeth by their very inactivity and that soon there may be grave social unrest.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister how our redundancy payments compare with those in the other EEC countries. Are they higher or lower?  If they are lower, are we aiming at parity with other countries?  I appreciate the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is not the Minister for Labour, but the fact that he is sitting in this morning for the Minister for Labour means that he must take responsibility.</P>
    <P>On the matter of income tax refunds, anyone knows that when an income tax refund is claimed, it takes so long to give one that it has lost its value because of inflation.  While the refund will be given at the figure of a year ago, it is paid in present-day currency with reduced purchasing power.  What I am trying to say is that there are many more things concerned with redundancy payments than are stated in this document.  I would suggest to the Minister, therefore, that he might consider giving the House some more information on the state of the redundancy fund, the current number of applications for redundancy payments which have not yet been decided on, and the possible number which will occur during the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>In yesterday's papers there was a report about a large Dublin industrial concern closing down.  We hope that by some means this can be averted. One can readily see the huge impact the claims from these workers will have on social welfare payments in whatever category they are placed. Therefore, I would appreciate if the Minister, as well as telling us the state of the redundancy fund, <Col N="1008" /> would say if it can stand the strain which is about to be put on it without increasing the stamp value.</P>

      <P>As I said in the beginning, the concept may be simple but the legal jargon of the Department's <Col N="1009" /> draft is shocking.  People will be wondering what little box they will fit into if they are unfortunate enough to become unemployed.  It seems to be a set of little boxes for people now and according to your classification you will fit into it.  If the Minister is taking responsibility for the Department of Labour, that is fair enough, but surely he, as an economist, ought to have given a few examples by means of a tabular statement which would clarify the position for the Members and, more importantly, for people who may become unemployed or may be unemployed and who may, because they have a claim within the past 13 weeks, become subject to this order after the 21st June, 1976.  Again the Minister says that under present arrangements social welfare payments must not exceed 100 per cent of normal weekly remuneration, or £48.08, whichever is the lesser.  This draft order now proposes to substitute a new limit of 85 per cent of net average weekly earnings, that is, the net after-tax take home pay, or £50, whichever is the lesser.  Then the statement goes on to list the exceptions, the other little boxes.  I hope when the Minister is replying he will elaborate on the different categories, or perhaps at a later date some explanatory literature will be made available by the Department of Labour so that in our clinics we may be able to help the many unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's statement reads: &ldquo;... to substitute a new limit of 85 per cent of net average weekly earnings&rdquo;.  I am concerned at the word &ldquo;average&rdquo;, and it is a little complex in the sense that when provision was being made for this change in the budget, we were told that 85 per cent would be based on the last week's earnings not, as might have been a better situation, 85 per cent of an average based on a relevant period of time.  What consideration has been given to the fact that under the new national pay agreements people at present unemployed would have been granted increases had they been employed? Was any consideration given to a system of index-linking of their <Col N="1010" /> benefits and entitlements?  Is there a double losing out by some recipients here?  I hope the Minister will be able to clarify these queries.  I look for some financial examples in tabular form which will give indications of the various categories.  Apparently, we have two new categories being created by means of this draft order.</P>
    <P>A very relevant phrase is used in the first paragraph of the Minister's statement, &ldquo;derives from public concern&rdquo;. That is a clear example of a Government not leading, a Government following; a Government with an eye to what is happening and what the views coming from the community are.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have his opportunity again and I hope he will allow me my opportunity now. The Government now see that the people are becoming very dissatisfied, that unrest is creeping into the community. We saw some of this unrest last night.  The Government are reacting to a different form of unrest, an unrest amongst workers whose stamp has become so costly.  It has become so costly that they are beginning to complain about the burden of having to carry some of the less fortunate. This draft order appears to be an effort to appease those and at the same time trying to get a delicate balance between the workers who are paying heavy stamp taxation weekly and those in receipt of benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government always tried to play up to the people.  The Minister has taken responsibility for the drafting of this statement and I take it that the phrase I have mentioned was not put in at the behest of those who drafted the order but at the behest of the Minister and the Government.  This has always been their criterion, playing up to the public, trying to have it both ways. Time is running out but nevertheless for the sake of those who will obtain an income which will be affected by this draft order I want the Minister to clarify the points I made.  I would be obliged if he would set out some financial <Col N="1011" /> statements, tabular examples, which would be a guideline for those who may have to interpret this order at clinics for the many people who ask for help concerning their social welfare payments.  Hundreds who are unemployed and in need call to us and they are in that position because of the lack of ability by the Government to lead and provide jobs for our work force.</P>
    <P>We have heard the news of a fertiliser plant closing down and workers coming on to the live register soon. This indicates how long the Government have been in not taking the advice we gave them on the many occasions the words &ldquo;fertiliser industry&rdquo; were used.  The writing was on the wall.  Why was a subsidy not introduced?  Up to 300 workers will come on to the live register after 21st June.</P>

      <P>I come from a rural constituency which has a number of big towns.  There is much unemployment in those towns at present and for this reason I will be asked questions about this order.  I would like to be in a position to explain to the people the terms of the order.  However, I am slightly puzzled.  Am I to take it that an unemployed person cannot get more than 85 per cent of his net take home earnings?  Does this apply to the people in the lower income bracket?  The sum of £50 has been mentioned.  Under the old system a person in the lower income group might get something more than what he was earning between redundancy payments, pay-related benefit and social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> I was disappointed that no indication was given as to the size of the redundancy fund and the pay-related benefit fund.  Workers who are questioning these funds point out that they are carrying the unfortunate people who cannot get employment.  I should like to make it clear that the majority of the unemployed want to get jobs.  If it happens that a vacancy occurs in any area all the unemployed try to get that job.  To say that the worker has to carry the unemployed is true but that does not mean that the worker is against the unemployed person.  However, the workers are discontented because of the huge amount of money that is taken out of their weekly pay packet.  They must get up every morning to go to work while the unemployed person can sleep it out even though he does not want to be unemployed.  This order was necessary to clear the air but the unemployed are now getting the first indication that the benefit will only be 85 per cent of their take home pay.</P>
    <P>There are other classes that you may come into.  We will be questioned and, personally, I do not feel qualified to answer without further explanation from the Minister.  If the Minister for Labour coupled with this an indication that he would do something about the appalling position of the unemployed it would be more helpful.  This may appear irrelevant but it is connected with unemployment.  If the Minister would extend the £15 that he is giving in certain categories right across the board to anybody who would employ somebody and take him off the unemployed list, that would be a desirable development that I would like to see.  It is unfortunate that what we are doing is merely cushioning people against unemployment but we are making no genuine attempt to get them off the unemployment register or the dole queue.  That is what we want to do.</P>
    <P>I think this effort should be made right across the board.  Deputy Fitzgerald pointed that out forcibly when this matter was debated previously&mdash;that the benefit should not be confined to certain classes of employers and employees.  I have met <Col N="1013" /> business people who told me that if they got the £15 they could employ extra young people but they do not get it.  I would ask the Minister for Labour to consider that.  While we do not oppose the present order, we would like to have a better explanation of how it will apply across the board.  Suppose a person is earning £40 a week as net take-home pay, what would he be entitled to if he becomes unemployed?  What would he be entitled to if the figure is £50 a week and so on?  The kind of explanation we have got does not appeal to me.  My intelligence may be limited but I should like to be able to explain to the ordinary unemployed person what category he would fit into.</P>
    <P>Anything else that I might say has already been said on this side but I appeal to the Minister for Labour to do something quickly to help the young people who are coming on the labour market.  What is being done is good but it would be much better if the £15 were given to anybody who would employ somebody and take him off the dole queue.  This is very important. I should also like to know the size of the redundancy fund because this has not been stated.  We are not opposing this order but it is complicated and we would like the Minister to define clearly the different classes of unemployed persons.</P>

      <P>It is a question of when the claim was made in respect of being redundant, not the notification of redundancy.  Liability of the fund arises at the point when a claim is made.  I should like to thank the House for the constructive nature of the brief interventions made in the debate.  I think I detected a certain embarrassment on the other side of the House because what we are doing here is remedying defects in an enormously complex system devised by the previous Government which has turned out to be absurdly intricate&mdash;as <Col N="1014" /> can be seen from what has to be done to remedy even a small defect&mdash;and also to be open to serious abuses.  We inherited a series of different codes in this country relating to the distribution of income. There is the income tax code which is not simple; there is the social assistance code and the home assistance system as well as the social insurance system which has been extended in recent years by provisions for redundancy and pay-related benefit.  The process by which these systems have come into being has been a higgledy-piggledy one.  Each of them has been tackled separately by a particular Minister in a particular Department seeking to solve a particular aspect of the problem.  Unfortunately, in the period when the main blunders were made between 1967 and 1972, towards the end of the Fianna Fáil period in Government there was no overall view of the whole system.  Nobody in that Government sat down, when they came to deal with redundancy and pay-related benefits and matters of this kind individually, to add up the sum total of what these different schemes would yield in particular instances.  Each social evil was tackled in its own way but, unfortunately, by different Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no overall co-ordination and this tended to intensify the problems already existing even before these schemes came in as a result of having a number of different systems of income distribution.  The situation was already complex before 1967 but it was certainly complicated further by these two further pieces of legislation which were not co-ordinated with each other or with the existing system. At no point did anybody try to assess the net effect for an individual. This is a typical problem of the bureaucratic process and in Ireland it was compounded by the fact that the system in certain Government Departments involves minimal co-ordination except at Government level and if the Government do not do the co-ordinating and try to ensure that the different things the Ministers are doing add up correctly, the administrative system will not easily <Col N="1015" /> do it because of the way Departments tend to operate.</P>
    <P>Perhaps our whole system involves an excessive burden of co-ordination on Government.  But that is the system we have and if the Government are not up to their co-ordinating role you get a mess and we inherited the mess. We inherited a system of income distribution which is enormously complex although the task to be performed is a relatively simple one.  The aim of all these systems is the single one, I suppose, of ensuring that if an individual or family income falls below a certain level in relation to the number of dependants, that income is supplemented by the State to prevent serious poverty occurring.  It should have been possible to achieve that simple aim by a simple system of income transfers.  But, because we inherited a range of different systems, because schemes were never co-ordinated and because the previous Government compounded the errors of the past by introducing two further schemes without any attempt to co-ordinate them, we ended up with the absurd position in which under the Fianna Fáil schemes as they actually operated, for example, a survey carried out some time ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The problem we are dealing with is not one which arises because of a financial problem of the fund.  There was a problem and there is a problem.  That was tackled by the increase in payments.  I will come back to the fund in due course and explain it.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a problem which arises because under the systems invented by Fianna Fáil people can end up receiving substantially more take home pay as a result of being unemployed than when they were employed.  That Fianna Fáil series of systems which cumulated in this effect is a bad one and we have to reform it.  It is as simple as that.  To give and example, out of just over 50 people sampled in Dublin some time ago, who were fully unemployed, it was found that of 52, 30 had net weekly disposable incomes which were higher than their preunemployment net disposable incomes&mdash;almost 60 per cent.</P>

      <P>The survey has given us the data on which to take the decisions announced in the budget which we are now implementing.  Indeed, for people on redundancy payment in this sample&mdash;a small sample but it is an indication of what can happen under the system which Fianna Fáil had left us with&mdash;the average take home pay of unemployed was 38 per cent more than when employed.  Of this the tax rebate represented 17 per cent or about half of the excess.  So there is a problem.  We have inherited this problem and we have to resolve it.  It cannot be resolved by a simple piece of drafting, because the hotch-potch of legislation we have inherited is so enormously complex that there is no simple way of remedying it here.  I hope that in due course we can devise an income maintenance system to replace what we have inherited from the previous Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to this, because the Opposition in many speeches they have made, while making relevant and useful points, did seek to leave an impression that it was this Government who had created the mess, is that we inherited the mess and are seeking to clear it up.  There has been public concern about the way in which the Fianna Fáil systems added up to a situation in which there could be abuse.  That public concern is one to which this Government responded.  Deputy C. Murphy seems to suggest that for a Government to respond to public concern in regard to abuses is in some way a bad thing.  Perhaps if the previous Government had been more responsive to public opinion we would not have had some of these difficulties.</P>
      <P>The system is complex certainly, and I agree with Deputies who feel a need to have its effects explained more simply.  The technical legal terminology cannot be simplified, given what we have inherited, but that does not mean we cannot produce a leaflet which will help Deputies and others concerned with the problems to explain what is involved.  The basic principle is simple enough.  It is that the take home pay that people would have, the amount of disposable income available to them unemployed, should not exceed 85 per cent of the disposable income when they were employed. That is the simple principle. There are difficulties about applying it in every aspect.  There are certain exceptions to it which I mentioned in my speech.  I have mentioned all of them as far as I know, and these could be mentioned in the leaflet.  They include the case, for example, that I mentioned, of somebody who is in receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance and nothing else, and because of the number of children that comes out at more than 85 per cent of his pretax income when in employment. That will not be reduced in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also other problems in relation to short-time working, but in <Col N="1019" /> general the principle being applied is a simple one in so far as it can be applied given the administrative complexity of what we have inherited.  I should also mention that the work to be done on this would be done by social welfare officers administering the order in the employment officers of the Department of Social Welfare, so that personnel officers in individual firms will not have the job, as heretofore, of administering weekly redundancy payments, so that from the point of view of the firm's concern the position will be somewhat simpler. They will not have to cope with the complexities in question.</P>
    <P>Deputy C. Murphy raised a point that it might be unfair to fix the 85 per cent limit in relation to the last week's earnings.  That is not in fact what is being done.  What we said in the budget speech was that we related to the disposable income immediately prior to unemployment, in contrast to the Fianna Fáil system which went back to a previous year, so that it went back to 1974-75.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will let me complete the statement.  I <Col N="1020" /> have got only half way through it. Deputy C. Murphy thought that the calculation was on the last week's earnings. What we said was that it would be related to earnings immediately prior to unemployment.  I did not mean the last week's earnings.  That is taking the word &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; too literally. That would be unfair.  In fact it is related to the average earnings in the employment year to date which, I think is a fairer system.  Deputy C. Murphy is right on that point.  That is what we have done.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies raised the question of the rightness or otherwise of including the tax rebates in this.  They are not included.  Then there is a situation in which people can in fact still end up better off and would in a number of instances end up better off unemployed than employed.  I think there is a concensus in the House, and certainly in the country, that the purpose of our income maintenance system must be to prevent poverty, to catch people who fall out of employment and prevent them falling into poverty, but not to leave them better off and with a demoralising incentive not to work.  If you are going to exclude the tax rebate from this new provision people are going to end up better off because of the tax rebate for quite a long period after unemployment. That would be undesirable. The tax rebate therefore has to be included here if the purpose of this is to be achieved.  I do not think the Opposition are serious in suggesting that it should be excluded, because it would undermine the effect of this. I do not think they want basically to maintain the present system under which some people could be better off out of work than at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct to say that tax is being used twice against them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not follow the Deputy's argument on that point. If I am a little slow to answer it in detail I will come back at the end if there is a point I have not answered adequately.  I must try to maintain my train of thought.  The basic issue here is to ensure that the 85 per cent limit <Col N="1021" /> is operative in relation to all payments received from the State so as to eliminate any disincentive effect that might be there.  If the tax rebate is not included that cannot be achieved. Deputy Brennan was worried about delays in regard to the tax rebate calculation. In fact it takes only four weeks from the date of application to clarify a pay tax refund.  The provisions are quite clear that the day does not extend beyond this limit and there is no problem and Deputy Brennan was incorrect in that.</P>
      <P>The question about the redundancy fund which Deputies have asked is quite a fair question.  I did not deal with it in the opening statement.  As what is being done is not related to the question of balancing the fund, the motivation for and purpose of it are quite different.</P>
      <P>The condition of the fund does not come directly into it but Deputies have asked what is the position and certainly they are entitled to know.</P>
      <P>The increase in the contribution levied some time ago related to a situation where the fund was incurring an increasing debt.  Following the increased contributions borrowings stopped, at the time of the increase in contribution, at a figure of £4,180,000.  Since then there has been no further recourse to borrowing but repayments of that sum to the Exchequer have not yet commenced because of a certain volume of arrears of rebate claims on hands which are being undertaken.  These arrears have been reduced substantially but it has not been possible yet to reduce borrowings which remain at £4,180,000. It is clearly impossible to say how long it would take to get the fund solvent again.  The best assessment one can make is that this might happen some time in the latter half of next year.  The exact date may be influenced to some degree by the effects of what we are doing here today. Certainly that is not the primary purpose of it; it would not be greatly influenced by it.  It would be some date probably in the second half of 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course that depends on the rate of fresh redundancies.  The position here is somewhat encouraging in that <Col N="1022" /> at a date this year the redundancy rate is significantly lower than last year.  It is down by something over a quarter.  If the present rate is maintained, not allowing for any further fall in the rate in the second half of the year&mdash;which in view of the general world economic situation is probable&mdash;on the present rate without any allowance for any further decline, there might be approximately 14,000 redundancies against 19,200 last year.  The economic and employment situation is clearly improving to that extent but not enormously rapidly and the position of redundancies remains serious, as Deputies are certainly aware.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is no question of increasing the stamp.  The increase that has taken place was sufficient to bring the fund into solvency at some point in the second half of next year so that there is not an issue of increasing the stamp again at this stage.  The increase that has been undertaken appears to be achieving that purpose.</P>
    <P>I was asked for EEC comparisons. The redundancy schemes in other EEC countries are in many ways very different from ours.  There is no easy comparison.  The simplest comparison would be one with Britain.  Our position is that we have a lump sum with no limit on the number of weeks' pay. In Britain it is limited to 20 weeks' pay.  We have a system of weekly payments and Britain has none.  Of course, the ceiling in Britain is very much higher because wages generally in Britain remain somewhat higher than here.  The redundancy scheme, as such, here is in those respects more favourable.  With regard to other EEC countries there is no easy comparison, certainly none I can make on my feet at the end of a short debate.</P>
    <P>Deputies have suggested that the scheme needs to be reviewed.  That is probably right.  It needs to be reviewed both in itself because there are a number of anomalies in it arising from the way in which it was prepared and drafted, but also because it is a part of an income maintenance system which, as I mentioned earlier, got out of hand because of being developed on different lines by different Departments <Col N="1023" /> under the previous Government, and there is a need for an overall review.  I certainly accept that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what the numerical increase is or is not it does not create the abuse.  The abuse arises from the combination of a number of different schemes affecting any one individual and, of course, from the levels of benefit.  It is true, of course, that the increases in benefit that have taken place under the Coalition have created part of the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly they are in no position to object to the complexity of the scheme or its potential for abuse considering they invented it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question Deputy Brennan raised of the possibility of an abuse of <Col N="1024" /> people who are about to retire being made redundant, it is true that there is a possibility of abuse there.  We need more information on that.  Some work is in hand, through data processing, to try to establish the scale of what we might call late redundancies. It is a somewhat difficult abuse to correct.  Of course, there is an element of control over it because redundancy is payable only when an employer lets somebody go and does not replace him.  Obviously it can arise in a limited number of cases only.  We need to know in how many cases. That information will have to be extracted and is being undertaken at present.  I am not saying it will be easy, in so far as the emergence of that study is concerned, to find a way of dealing with it which would be humane and would not create more hardship.  Certainly it is something which needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>I hope I have answered all of the points raised but if Deputies want to put questions which I have not answered, I will be very glad to try to deal with them if it is within the limits of my competence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one question the Minister has not answered because I do not think he has a grasp of this document at all. He has been skirting around it.  I did not ask nor did I complain about the tax being taken into consideration in assessing the 85 per cent.  What I did ask the Minister was: is it not correct that the tax is being used twice against the individual because, in the first place, his net weekly earnings, presumably after tax, while he is still working are taken into consideration? There he has paid his tax to the State and it is after payment of that tax that his weekly earnings are then reckoned.  When it comes to seeking the 85 per cent subsequently the refund of that tax is taken in as part of his 85 per cent of total.  Does not that mean that, on both occasions, his income tax payment is being used against him, or that this Minister, or the Minister responsible, is doubly taxing the unemployed person?  That is basically what is happening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that we have to try to ensure that the net effect of a combination of a number of different schemes&mdash;tax rebates, redundancy payments, pay-related and so on&mdash;does not leave somebody better off than previously.  There should be some differential as a limited disincentive and 15 per cent is modest for that purpose.  Either one takes in the tax rebate or one does not.  If one does not one will end up, in quite a number of cases, with the situation that people are paid more for not working.  I take it Fianna Fáil are not proposing that.  Therefore, the tax rebate must be taken into account in calculating the 85 per cent.</P>
      <P>Whether the administrative process we employ involves reducing redundancy, pay-related or the tax rebate, is a question of administrative organisation.  The principle involved is that the total sum received from the State should not exceed 85 per cent of the disposable income while at work immediately before unemployment occurred.  The method by which one modifies the different payments to produce a cumulative figure within that limit is a question of administrative process and what is the most effective way to do so.  To argue that people are being doubly taxed in those circumstances is quite irrational and is an argument I do not think public opinion will follow the Deputy on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is obviously out of touch.  The Minister says the 85 per cent is completely from State schemes.  That is not entirely correct because part of that 85 per cent may be made up of a refund of tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Order.  I allowed the Deputy to put a question but this is developing into an argument and, indeed, a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy would get very far with that argument.  The position is that either you take it into account in calculating the total amount and you then reduce one or other, or a number of elements, by the amount necessary to get it down to 85 per cent or you do not. If you say that the tax refund has to be paid regardless, then people will end up being paid more for not working. The Deputy is not advocating that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, he must draw the conclusion that the tax refund has to be taken into account.  The question of which of the different refunds, or payments, whatever you like to call them, are modified to get down to the 85 per cent is a matter of administrative organisation.  You can do it one way or the other way.  Obviously one tries to do it the simplest way.  The Deputies who earlier on said we should make it simple should not try to complicate the thing further by <Col N="1027" /> suggesting even more difficult and complex ways of doing what we have tried to do as simply as these schemes we have inherited from the previous Government permit us to do.</P>
    <P>I believe I have dealt with all the points raised in the debate.  I might sum up by saying that this is an important reform.  It is important not merely for its own sake in so far as it will eliminate a disincentive to work, an incentive for people not to work because that only affects, as Deputies have properly said, a relatively small group of people who are not strongly motivated to work.  Most workers want to work and they will not be put off by this.  Indeed, there are cases of workers who despite the anomalies we inherited, have nonetheless gone looking for work even though if they got work they would have slightly less income.  Most workers are primarily concerned with working but there is a marginal group, obviously, in any society of people, who can be influenced into not working if you pay them enough not to work.  We obviously have to avoid that.</P>
    <P>That is not the sole problem here. A broader problem arises because of the public concern to which the abuses deriving from these systems inherited from the previous Government have given rise.  That public concern can be generalised towards social welfare as a whole.  One of the things we have to concern ourselves about in a period of economic recession in particular is that we do not, by any defect in the administrative processes which we have, allow a public opinion to emerge which is selfish and hostile to the need for the redistribution of wealth to those who need it or to allow abuses to exist here or in the dole, where we have had to act as well, to undermine confidence and trust in the social welfare system and to turn our people, who have hitherto loyally accepted the need for redistribution of wealth at their own personal, material expense, to think selfishly.  If people see somebody getting something that they think is unfair and unjust then they will resent <Col N="1028" /> that and resist it and their resentment will be against the whole social welfare system.  It is important, therefore, that we institute reforms of this kind to ensure that an abuse in one small area affecting a very small group of people should not lead to general resentment and undermine confidence, trust and support for our social welfare system which, God knows, even today after three years of Coalition Government contains many defects still to be remedied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated repeatedly that the problem sought to be dealt with here was inherited by the Government from the Fianna Fáil system.  He also stated there was a survey done in either January of this year or December last which showed a certain proportion of people getting more by not working than by working. Could he state if he has any evidence that under the previous Fianna Fáil Government people were receiving more by not working than by working?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difficulty whatever in calculating out from the actual benefits in individual cases where people who had a certain income would have been in those circumstances better off because the previous Government totally failed to safeguard the system against this abuse and because at certain levels any system, if there is not such a control, can lead to abuse.  The scale of abuse will depend in one element to the level of benefits.  If you draw up a series of incoherent schemes unrelated to each other and with no controlled <Col N="1029" /> system or a controlled system as limited as what was there previously, which in fact did not take account of disposal after tax income but gave people full pre-tax income, then you get abuses.  The previous Government have to accept responsibility for introducing a serious of incoherent, unrelated schemes without adequate co-ordination.  It has been necessary for us to put this right.</P>

    <Title>Fóir Teoranta (Amendment) Bill, 1976: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the statutory limit on the amount of capital available to Fóir Teoranta to finance their operations.  The company were established under the Fóir Teoranta Act, 1972 and they began operations in April, 1972.  Their function is to provide reconstruction finance for potentially viable industrial concerns which are unable to raise capital from the normal commercial sources.  They are, therefore, an important link in the chain of <Col N="1030" /> State assistance for industry.  Assistance under the Act is available for firms engaged in an industrial activity or an activity ancillary to industry. This definition includes manufacturing industries allied to building such as structural steel, joinery manufacture and manufacture of pre-cast building components.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for assistance from Fóir Teoranta, firms must comply with a number of conditions which are laid down in the 1972 Act.  The employment and capital employed in them must be significant, the promoters must have made a reasonable contribution to the initial capital and there must be evidence that failure to receive financial assistance would have serious repercussions at national or local level.  Finally, Fóir Teoranta must be satisfied that the firm have good prospects of profitability, if necessary after reorganisation.</P>
    <P>As the State lender of last resort Fóir Teoranta are faced with a heavy responsibility in dealing with applications. The decision of the company will usually determine whether a firm will continue in business or whether they will be forced to discontinue their activities with serious economic and social implications for owners, the workforce and the area in which they are located.  It is necessary, therefore, for the board of Fóir to consider applications thoroughly and with full understanding of all the implications. In a period of economic difficulty such as we have recently experienced the task of the company has been especially onerous.  However, while continuing to operate within the statutory criteria, the company have shown sympathetic understanding of the difficulties which some firms have encountered and have been able to provide the assistance which enabled the firms to remain in operation.  In this way Fóir Teoranta have been able to avert dangerous threats not merely to industrial production and employment but have also contributed to the preservation of the industrial structure of the country.  The productive capacity thus preserved will be extremely valuable with the recovery in industrial activity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> It is inevitable, of course, that applications for assistance must be rejected because they fail to meet the tests applied by the company.  Most of the rejections have taken place because the applicant firm were unable to demonstrate that, even with assistance from Fóir Teoranta, they had a reasonable prospect of ultimate success. Before such cases are rejected, Fóir Teoranta investigate the firms circumstances and normally consider whether the firm might survive in association with some other group.  It is ironic that while the firms which fail attract publicity, there is little attention paid to the achievements of the company and the success attained as a result of Fóir intervention.</P>
    <P>The grant of assistance by Fóir Teoranta does not, of course, guarantee success for a firm.  The difficult conditions of the past two years have interfered with the recovery of some firms to which aid was given by the company and have even contributed to the failure of some such concerns. As opposed to this, however, some of the firms assisted by Fóir Teoranta over the past years are making notable progress and most of those assisted are meeting their obligations to Fóir.</P>
    <P>To date Fóir Teoranta have disbursed £15 million and have commitments for a further £1.5 million.  A measure of the company's activity is that in slightly over four years they have provided assistance to 174 firms with a total job content of about 30,000.  The bulk of Fóir assistance has been by way of loan finance but they have also availed of their powers to take an equity stake in firms and to guarantee loans raised from financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Apart from providing finance the company take all possible steps to strengthen the position of any applicant firm which, despite its immediate problems, has reasonable prospects of succeeding in the longer term.  Such steps frequently include investigation of association with a stronger firm, changes in management and at board level, and the introduction of consultants to deal with particular functions within a firm.  Inadequate or defective management constitutes one <Col N="1032" /> of the basic causes of the difficulties leading up to an application for assistance from Fóir Teoranta.  Many of the firms find it difficult to a attract and retain persons of proven managerial calibre.  For this reason Fóir Teoranta established their own management services unit, the members of which are specialists in the main areas of management and are available for assignment to firms where assistance at managerial level is urgently necessary. This has proved a valuable service to certain firms and it also has the merit of enabling Fóir personnel to gain first-hand knowledge of the operations of some of the firms with which they are associated.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta are reaching the limit of their borrowing powers, which were fixed at £17.5 million by the amending Act of 1973.  Amending legislation to increase their resources is therefore necessary to enable the company to continue the valuable work they have been doing to date.  Section 2 of the Bill before the House proposes that the new limit on borrowing by Fóir Teoranta be fixed at £35 million, an increase of £17.5 million on the present limit.  On the basis of disbursements since the establishment of the company, the extension proposed should suffice for another three to four years depending on demands for reconstruction finance.  To date this year, the demand for the company's facilities is short of that experienced in previous years, but this position could change quickly should the pace of industrial recovery accelerate.</P>
    <P>Virtually all of the finance required by the company until now has been provided by the Exchequer as the returns on the company's share and loan investments, including those taken over from their predecessor, Taiscí Stáit Teoranta, have been comparatively small so far.  While the company's income from their investments and the repayment of loans may be expected to grow, it will be far short of the amount which they are likely to have to advance in respect of new applications for assistance nor will it meet the cost to the Exchequer of providing the funds in the first instance.  It is proposed, therefore, in section 3 of the <Col N="1033" /> Bill, to raise from £17.5 million to £35 million the limit on the power of the Minister for Finance to provide loan capital to the company.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta provide an orderly procedure for assisting Irish firms giving worthwhile employment which are unable to obtain their financial requirements from commercial sources. The services of the company have been of particular value in coping with the effects of the recent world-wide economic recession.  The proposed legislation will make available to Fóir Teoranta an additional £17.5 million to carry on their functions. Apart from increasing the limits on the finance available to the company, no further changes in the legislation are considered necessary at this stage.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I introduced legislation setting up Fóir Teoranta, I said it formed part of an overall package tied in with the reconstruction of the IDA&mdash;legislation for which I had introduced earlier&mdash;to give the necessary assistance to industrial development. It was hoped it would form part of an early warning system to indicate when industries were likely to be in need of assistance and to enable, as the Minister said, and orderly approach to be adopted to the decision of whether such assistance should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta have demonstrably served a very useful purpose and have done very useful work.  Unfortunately it is clear that the early warning system we had hoped for has not developed. I am not faulting the Government for that because I am well aware of the enormous difficulties involved. Developments within the last few days make it quite clear that the early warning system it was hoped to develop has not worked.  A case of a substantial amount of employment about to disappear appears from the newspaper reports to have occurred without any advance knowledge on the part of the Government.  As I said, I am not blaming the Government for the non-working of an early warning <Col N="1034" /> system, but in my view special and redoubled efforts should be made to try to make such system as we have more effective.</P>
    <P>One of the major basic difficulties involved is that if a firm are getting into difficulties, the last thing they want to do is disclose that fact because the mere disclosure of impending difficulties may bring all their creditors down about their ears at the same time and actually close them down, whereas non-disclosure can enable them to weather the storm and perhaps recover fully from the difficulties.  Nevertheless, the non-existence of an effective early warning system undoubtedly reduces the possibilities of Fóir Teoranta giving adequate and effective assistance in certain cases.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to ensure that this question is again examined urgently with a view to trying to devise a more effective system than we appear to have at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister may recall that when I set up this company I expressed a view that it would be desirable from many points of view that Fóir Teoranta would recruit a <i>corps</i> of managers who could be put into firms seeking assistance to get them on their feet, and then move on to another firm in similar difficulties.  The practical difficulty, apart from the difficulties for a smallish firm seeking assistance from Fóir Teoranta, of getting such a manager is that if they were in difficulties, a competent manager would not particularly want to take on the job involved. If he failed because the situation had gone too far, not alone would he be out of a job but his reputation could be seriously damaged.</P>
    <P>When the amending legislation of 1973 was before the House, I inquired further in regard to this matter.  I was very pleased to note the statement which the Minister made today to the effect that Fóir Teoranta have established their own management services unit, the members of which are specialists in the main areas of management and are available for assignment to firms where assistance at managerial level is urgently <Col N="1035" /> necessary.  This is a very welcome development. I am pleased to note it has been achieved and, according to what the Minister says, is working well.</P>
    <P>The Minister may also recall that at the time the company was set up I indicated that, while of necessity and to get the company off the ground the services of the Industrial Credit Company would be used for the administrative and managerial purposes of Fóir Teoranta, nevertheless, I as Minister had expressed the view that the board were free, and were urged, to examine the desirability of setting up their own management and administrative structures within Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>On the discussion on the amending Bill in 1973 I inquired what had happened about this.  On that occasion the Minister told me that ICC were providing the management, that they had set up a special section for this purpose, and that Fóir Teoranta at that time, at least, found it a satisfactory arrangement.  I should like to know if that is still the position.  I hope that my concern in this regard is not going to be taken as a reflection on ICC or their staff.  On the contrary, I have an extremely high opinion of that company and their staff.  My concern is that the criteria applicable to the ordinary activities of Fóir Teoranta are different from those applicable to the ordinary activities of the Industrial Credit Company. While there is a special section of the Industrial Credit Company dealing with the activities of Fóir Teoranta they can be expected to operate different criteria.  Nevertheless, if there is interchangeability, as presumably there is, between one and the other, there is a danger that the criteria of the Industrial Credit Company, which are the normal commercial criteria applied, may get undue emphasis in the consideration of applications by Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>I do not say that that is happening; I have no evidence that it is happening. I have of course the usual number of complaints that one would expect to get in the case of any company of this kind, or indeed as one <Col N="1036" /> gets in relation to the IDA and the ICC, complaints from persons who have been refused assistance.  In most such cases, if not all, I am satisfied that the refusal was justified.  One can expect persons who are so refused to complain that the approach adopted by the particular body was wrong.  I am not saying I have any evidence that the approach adopted by Fóir Teoranta in a particular case was wrong, though I have received complaints.  But I am concerned at the possibility, if the management and administration of Fóir Teoranta are carried out by a section of the Industrial Credit Company, that quite unconsciously the persons concerned may tend to give undue emphasis to the normal criteria of the ICC rather than to the special criteria to be applied by Fóir Teoranta as laid down in the original Act establishing the company.</P>
    <P>There is another matter on which I would appreciate some information from the Minister.  The position was that assistance for a sum in excess of a quarter of a million pounds by Fóir Teoranta required the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce.  This was an administrative arrangement.  I should like to know if that is still the arrangement. I note the Minister's statement that the increase in the company's borrowing powers and the corresponding increase in the amount which may be advanced by the Minister for Finance to the company proposed in this Bill is hoped to cover this situation for another three or four years, depending on the demands for reconstruction finance.  I would have thought it unlikely that it will do so.  Indeed, I recall expressing the same hope when I introduced the original Bill but, in fact, it did not last that long at all.</P>
    <P>In view of the economic situation and the strains experienced by various industries since then, one would have thought that the demands would be even greater now than in the past. The Minister tells us, &ldquo;To date this year, the demand for the company's facilities is short of that experienced in previous years...&rdquo; I find that quite ominous because we are dealing with industries in difficulties, unable <Col N="1037" /> to secure additional finance from ordinary commercial sources, whose closure would be of significance either nationally or locally and who have a viable future.  If we recall these criteria I think that anybody would expect that the demands on Fóir Teoranta this year would be greater than at any time in the past.  To find that they are in fact less suggests that too many of our industries, large or small, which are experiencing difficulties at present may be giving up the ghost and not even seeking the assistance of Fóir Teoranta, where special terms are available, including conditions of non-repayment for a certain number of years and special rates of interest.  If firms are not seeking the assistance of Fóir Teoranta this year to the same extent as last year, it would suggest that they cannot see any possibility of survival in the future.  If, on the other hand, it is suggested that they are not seeking this assistance because they do not need it, that does not square at all with the other indicators we have in regard to the situation of the economy and industry in general.  I hope the Minister will be able to throw a more hopeful light on that fact to which he has adverted, that the demands from Fóir Teoranta this year are less than in the past.  It is an extremely gloomy development that that should be so.</P>
    <P>Subject to those observations and the few queries I have put, so far as this side of the House is concerned this Bill is not only acceptable but to the extent that it would facilitate assistance to industries which are potentially viable, but which are at present in difficulty, this Bill is welcome. We are anxious to ensure in any way possible that assistance of this kind is readily available to potentially viable industries going through a particularly difficult time at present to ensure that in the future they will overcome those difficulties and hopefully go on to expand and provide further employment.  It is undoubtedly true that in almost all cases it is cheaper to assist industries to keep going and to continue providing employment, and hopefully to expand in the future while they are in difficulty than to start from scratch with a new <Col N="1038" /> industry to create employment.  For that reason the assistance that can be provided by Fóir Teoranta to existing industries is extremely important and from the point of view of the Exchequer is probably a cheaper and in many cases a sounder investment than the large sums which have to be provided for the creation of new industries.  For all those reasons we on this side of the House welcome this Bill and are anxious not to hold up its passage in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for Deputy Colley's constructive comments on this Bill.  I am able to give him a number of assurances which will help his and the public's understanding of the position.  So far as the fall-off in the demand for Fóir's resources this year is concerned, it is attributable in the main to two factors. The considerable difficulties which were generated throughout 1974 and 1975 as a result of global recession, had the effect of shaking out the weaker firms.  Therefore we are in a position in which we have not as many weak concerns as we had previously. A number of them were very fortunately helped over the difficulties of the recession by reason of assistance which they received from Fóir Teoranta and elsewhere.  Some were unable to survive.  If the recession had not occurred it is possible that a number of those would eventually have failed anyway because of technological changes and market requirements. The serious nature of the recession and its extent brought to a head the crisis in a number of firms that were pointing towards crisis in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far back as 15 years ago a number of firms were identified as potentially at risk in the new environment which was going to develop with advances in free trade, modern technology, market requirements and so on.  Fóir Teoranta must have regard to all these matters whenever they are considering the prospects for any particular firm.  The criteria which are laid down in the 1972 Act are fairly tight, but they are not unreasonable. Fóir Teoranta are not an organisation to preserve jobs at all costs.  That <Col N="1039" /> would impose on the community as a whole a cost which could not be a justified because it would not be a cost which could generate any capacity to repay the very high cost of maintaining jobs.  Fóir Teoranta must ensure as they are advancing money and granting aid at various times that the concern which they are helping will be so structured and operated and have markets available to it, so as to ensure that it will be successful and that it will in due course be able to repay money which may be advanced to it.</P>
    <P>A great deal of Fóir's work is related not merely to money advanced by Fóir but to advising management on better production procedures, managerial practices, marketing and so on, and negotiating on behalf of firms that are in difficulties for assistance from other financial institutions and public and State agencies.  Deputy Colley, on every annual report of Fóir Teoranta, and I on innumerable occasions referred to weaknesses in management, which is one of the principal causes for failure of firms that have come to Fóir Teoranta for aid.  One of the most distressing, disappointing aspects which I referred to in 1973, before we had the trauma of the last couple of years, is the long delay on the part of management before giving warning of their difficulties.</P>
    <P>In order to overcome this, Fóir Teoranta have repeatedly drawn the attention of private banking and financial interests, the IDA and other agencies to the availability of the services of Fóir Teoranta and have encouraged others to advise their clients of the availability of the services of Fóir Teoranta.  We are forever encouraging firms not to leave it until it is too late before seeking the assistance of Fóir Teoranta.  In many cases if adequate warning had been given the saving mechanisms could have been put into operation at less cost and more successfully.  It is not open to Fóir to be an inspector of industries, or to ascertain what firms might benefit from Fóir's intervention and assistance.  Under the aegies of my <Col N="1040" /> colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, there is an early warning committee in operation, with representatives from the various State bodies.  They alert one another as to where they see possible weaknesses and difficulties developing, and so far as it can be done without breaches of confidentiality or without imposing interference where it would not be welcome, this early warning committee and the agencies with which they work endeavour to help concerns. They have been successful in several cases in bringing to the attention of the people concerned the availability of the services of Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>The staff of Fóir Teoranta are mainly seconded from the Industrial Credit Company.  Their decisions have been coloured and improved by their association and experience with the Industrial Credit Company in relation to proper commercial practices.  The code which they observe is the code which is written into the 1972 Act. From time to time I have had occasion to make inquiries, which is the only function which a Minister for Finance can have in relation to the operations of Fóir Teoranta.  The statute confers the decision making power and the management power on the board of Fóir Teoranta.  I think that is right.  It would be undesirable that a political person should be making decisions in areas where business-like decisions need to be made.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta are obliged by their statutory obligations to have regard to the social consequences of closures of industries, and particularly to have regard to the social consequences in the immediate area of an operation.  I am satisfied those criteria have been properly applied.  Indeed, the application of those criteria has been relaxed over the past year or so, and very properly relaxed.  Unemployment rose because of cyclical difficulties and, if the code had been applied as tightly as it had been applied in 1972, 1973 and 1974, it is possible that a number of industries which were helped last year, and which are being helped this year, would not have been helped. Nobody would quarrel with the desirability, <Col N="1041" /> in a time of very high unemployment, and at a time of prolonged recession&mdash;the worst recession the world has experienced in 50 years &mdash;of relaxing some of the rules which might be more appropriate in easier economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>The management services provided and the staff in those units are recruited independently of the ICC. They have been very useful.  They have provided not merely direct control and management for a period while readjustment has taken place in firms, but they have also carried out specific operations for companies which the companies themselves were unable to undertake.  The team is comparatively small considering the very large number of firms Fóir have already assisted.  It may be necessary to expand the team in the future.  For reasons I mentioned in my opening statement, it is not all that easy to recruit and retain management in sufficient numbers and quality.  Fóir like to recruit good management on behalf of firms in difficulties and to located that management in the firms assisted on a permanent basis rather than merely operating temporarily. The management team of Fóir must be free to move around from one place to another and therefore cannot remain in permanent management of particular firms.  The Irish Productivity Committee and Fóir Teoranta work together to recruit management for firms assisted by Fóir.</P>
    <P>I meant to mention two reasons&mdash; I think I only mentioned one&mdash;as to why demands for Fóir's services is less this year than last year.  I mentioned the recession which had shaken out quite a number of weak firms. Now that demand, trade and the economy are picking up again, the weak ones are no longer a burden. Quite a number of firms are not making demands for loan capital.  The ordinary banking system knows that. It is a recurring theme in statements from bank managers about being in a position to advance money but customers being reluctant to take it, particularly customers in the manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> This is attributable to the fact that, because of the recession and the fall in demand both at home and abroad, quite a number of firms built up stocks and, even as of now, as the economy is picking up, and world trade is picking up, and as demand both at home and abroad is improving, firms still have quite an amount of stock on their hands and do not require loan capital to restructure their activities or to have working capital.  As demand picks up and stocks begin to run down, we could have a very significant shift in the situation and just as things may be comparatively quite at present, they could pick up suddenly and demand for loan capital could be quite considerable.</P>
    <P>As of now Fóir Teoranta have £1.5 million committed.  This stretches their present capital to its limit and it is necessary therefore to extend that limit so that they can advance the money which will undoubtedly be required as demand picks up.  I should like to exhort industrial firms to consider that the time to expand, the time to get under way, the time to prepare for the growth which is coming, is now.  I would urge them to start the process of modernisation and expansion now, rather than leaving it until the pressure comes on from all quarters.  We could easily miss the bus because we delayed too long in moving out.  Now is the time to start the process of expansion.  Now is the time to avail of the credit which is certainly there both in Fóir Teoranta and in the ordinary banking system to get the manufacturing industry and all the activities which can be aided by the financial concerns under way again.  I trust this answers the queries Deputy Colley raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The level remains the same.  It is £¼ million.  The number of such sanctions which were necessary was 14 or about three-and-a-half a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 14 altogether to date.  That is an average of about three-and-a-half a year.  As is known from the annual reports of Fóir Teoranta, most of the concerns helped were of modest dimensions.  The need to get sanction has not arisen often and, where it has arisen, it has been in relation to very substantial firms.  For instance, one has received over £2 million.  Any money which has been advanced was worth while advancing. The record of Fóir Teoranta is not, as it is often imagined by the public, one of failure.  It is one of very significant success.  There is a feeling in some quarters that receiving aid from Fóir is something like being in receivership, that it is, if not the death knell, at least a warning that things are very serious.  Difficult they may be, but not serious.  It would be quite wrong for people to get the impression that, merely because Fóir are associated with an activity, that activity is not viable.  Quite the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be viable. It has to have a prospect of success. It has to satisfy the criteria which are very clear.  Fóir are absolutely prohibited from advancing money for any activity which is not going to be a success.  There is no question of Fóir advancing money to a concern which otherwise might be in a state of collapse and gone beyond recovery. Association with Fóir is proof of the viability of a firm and trade in general and the public also, should recognise that and see it is a system which ensures a mechanism whereby firms which can be successful are helped over temporary difficulties in order to meet the challenge and the opportunities of the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister one question?  In his reply he referred to the fact that during the past year the application of the criteria had been relaxed.  Can he give any further information as to the extent <Col N="1044" /> and the manner in which that relaxation has been taking place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not immediately available the exact information but I can give an illustration.  At one time if an industry, say, in a poor rural area was threatened with closure and had a work force of 30 people, it could be regarded as being of substantial social importance to the area. If an industry of that kind was threatened in the same way in a large urban area such as Dublin, for the reason that it would not be regarded as having an immense social impact because of the prospect of alternative employment being available, that would not be considered.  The movements in urban areas have now been adjusted so that even though the amount of employment is comparatively small, because of the growth of unemployment it is considered that even small pockets of unemployment would not be justified and therefore a firm which would not have received assistance would now receive help.</P>
      <P>There are other areas of change in the criteria.  As the Deputy is aware, Fóir are under an obligation to have a look at the owners' capital investment in a particular firm.  Again, because of the current difficulties, the amount of owners' capital which would be normally required has been relaxed because it might be difficult for an individual to finance an operation and Fóir have made larger contributions than in normal circumstances.</P>

    <Title>Superannuation and Pensions Bill, 1976: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to facilitate administration of the superannuation code for established civil servants by enabling changes to be <Col N="1045" /> made by way of statutory regulations and schemes instead of the more elaborate process of enacting fresh legislation every time it is found necessary to alter the provisions.</P>
      <P>The memorandum circulated with the Bill provides a brief explanation of its various provisions.  While I do not propose at this stage to go into these provisions in detail, I would like to comment on what is really the main provision of the Bill, that is, section 2. At present, the superannuation terms for established civil servants are embodied in the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1963, involving, in all, 20 separate Acts.  There are also a number of other enactments which either extend the terms of the Superannuation Acts to cover non-civil service groups or affect the administration of those Acts.  The relevant superannuation provisions are therefore spread over a wide range of Acts, including amending Acts.  This leads to difficulties in administration and, of course, makes it practically impossible for the generality of civil servants to view their pension terms as a whole.  The Bill will enable all such provisions to be brought together in due course in a comprehensive statutory scheme, and any future changes in the code will be done by way of amending schemes as found necessary.</P>
      <P>Initially, schemes will be made under section 2, in respect of the <i>ex gratia</i> and contributory widows' and children's pensions schemes.  The contributory scheme was introduced for the civil service with effect from 23rd July, 1968, while the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme became effective from 1st October, 1969.  The Dáil gave its approval, by means of a Supplementary Estimate, for the financial aspects of those scheme.  The statutory schemes will provide the appropriate legislative cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of embodying superannuation terms in a scheme, rather than in statute, is not an innovation in the public service.  Matters have been arranged on this basis for national and secondary teachers, the Garda Síochána and the Army for a considerable time.  In the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928, there is a provision whereby the Minister for Education <Col N="1046" /> may make schemes for, or in respect of, national and secondary teachers.  A similar provision for the Garda Síochána is contained in the Police Forces (Amalgamation) Act, 1925.  Pension schemes may be made for the Army under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932.  Accordingly, the embodiment of pension terms in a scheme rather than in statute is simply an extension of a principle already widely used in the public service.</P>
    <P>The non-civil servants included under section 2 have civil service superannuation terms already applied to them by specific Acts and their inclusion in the Bill means that any future changes in the civil service code may be automatically applied to them.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another important decision which is contained in section 3, subsection (1).  This enables certain enactments to be amended by regulation so as to provide statutory cover for a number of superannuation improvements, principally those effective from 1st June, 1973, which result from my acceptance in 1974 of agreed recommendations made during the previous year by a joint working party on superannuation. This cover is of a temporary character pending the making of the consolidated scheme under section 2. I might mention that the codification and simplification of the civil service superannuation code will be a long and complex task, but I think all will agree that it is a task well worth while undertaking.</P>
    <P>I am happy to be able to sponsor this Bill and I recommend it to Dáil Éireann for favourable and speedy consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it, this Bill appears to be largely an enabling Bill, enabling superannuation arrangements to be incorporated in schemes rather than in statutes, and to be changed with a greater degree of ease by way of statutory regulation rather than by new legislation from time to time.  In so far as that is the purpose of the Bill, there is no objection on this side.  On the contrary, we support that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> There are, however, one or two matters on which I should like some more information.  One, I should like the Minister's assurance that the Bill, except to the extent that attention has been drawn to it either by him, in his statement, or in the explanatory memorandum, does not alter the terms of existing pensions provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give that assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Two, I note that the Minister accepted a recommendation by a joint official staff-side working party set up under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the civil service that superannuation should be on a more flexible basis similar to that governing pay and other conditions in the service.  I have no doubt this was desirable, but perhaps the Minister could give some indication of why such an arrangement was made.  In other words, what were the difficulties experienced which lead to such a recommendation being made?  Presumably it was thought that superannuation should be put on a more flexible basis because the existing requirement whereby a Bill has to be passed by both Houses was too cumbersome, but, apart from being cumbersome, were there other difficulties which required such a recommendation to change the whole basis of dealing with superannuation in the civil service and in bodies to which the civil service superannuation regulations apply and deal with the position by way of statutory regulation rather than by way of statute.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the bringing together of all the existing superannuation provisions in a comprehensive statutory scheme would be a difficult and complicated task but could the Minister give any indication as to when it is thought likely such a comprehensive statutory scheme may be available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity of adverting to the position of what I describe as <i>ex gratia</i> widows of civil servants.  Can the Minister hold out any hope of an improvement in their situation?  After considerable argument <Col N="1048" /> and discussion, it was agreed by my predecessor in Finance that the widows of civil servants who died prior to a particular date in 1968 would be entitled, without contribution, to a pension equivalent to half that to which their husbands would have been entitled.  Subsequently those concerned agitated very strongly to be put on the same basis as the widows of civil servants who died subsequent to that date.  They advanced some quite cogent arguments in favour of that.</P>
    <P>I, as Minister for Finance, met representatives of the widows concerned and, as a result of my discussions with them, I decided it was necessary to ascertain exactly what would be involved from an actuarial point of view if one accepted the proposition they put forward and I commissioned an actuarial report.  That report became available shortly after the present Minister assumed office and, in reply to a parliamentary question by me, the Minister stated that the report indicated that the cost of doing what was asked would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects to which I want to advert.  The first is that many of the widows are now elderly and quite a number must have died since this situation arose.  Furthermore, the case made was based in general on what they believed to be an injustice and they argued they should at least get an opportunity of contributing in the same way as did those who came after them in order to put them on the same basis.  I confess I was not entirely satisfied with the interpretation of the actuarial report by the Minister and his advisers.  I believe it should be possible to work out a suitable arrangement whereby the <i>ex gratia</i> widows could make a contribution from what would be due to them thereby enabling them to be put on the same basis as the widows of civil servants who died subsequent to a particular date in 1968.</P>
    <P>It would be unreasonable to expect the Minister to deal in detail with this matter at this stage but I am concerned because time is passing.  Many of these widows have died.  Others are getting <Col N="1049" /> on in years and are trying to exist in many cases on quite small pensions. Some resolution of this problem should be achieved without delay.  The matter is mentioned specifically in the explanatory memorandum and I urge the Minister now to reconsider the position he has taken in this regard.  It should be possible to work out a solution which would not cost anything like the sum mentioned by the Minister in his reply to me.  I strongly urge the Minister to review the situation once more to see if a satisfactory solution can be arrived at.  I believe it can.  I do not think it can be arrived at by a strict adherence to the letter of the law but, given a little flexibility in the Minister's approach and in the approach of the <i>ex gratia</i> widows, a reasonable solution could be found.</P>
    <P>Since this Bill is aimed at producing a more flexible approach in regard to superannuation it is appropriate to urge on the Minister a more flexible approach in regard to the superannuation of <i>ex gratia</i> widows.  I am not making this plea with a view to political kudos.  I do not believe there are political kudos in it.  Indeed, if that were my object, I would make quite a different case and refer to things that happened in the past.  I am not doing that.  There is a problem and there is an element of injustice involved in a number of cases.  though not in all cases, and a special effort should be made to resolve the problem before it is resolved simply by the death of the people concerned.  Subject to that and to other points I have made, we on this side have no difficulty in accepting this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The very high rates of all taxes in this country and the very large borrowings which the State has to make are a direct reflection of the cost of maintaining existing services. This is a cause of public anxiety.  In that situation it cannot be reasonably argued that we should improve existing services.  To improve them would require further taxation and further borrowing.  As a community, we will have to accept the reality that our resources are not sufficient to meet the cost of present services, much less the cost of improvements in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1050" /> While the most worthy reasons can be advanced for increasing expenditure on a large number of services, and while humanitarian reasons can be advanced for increased expenditure on a number of services such as pensions for widows, the harsh reality has still to be faced that, while our community are demanding more and more services, they are unwilling to pay for them, and the cost of improving the pensions of pre-1968 widows, if it had to be met in full by the Exchequer, would be another £3,250,000.  I am not aware of a readiness on the part of anybody in this community to make his or her contribution to that fund and all the other expenditures which the public are demanding.  It is not the Minister for Finance who is declining to improve the position of any pensioners. It is our community who persist in complaining about levels of taxation for services which they are demanding. As a nation, we have to overcome that fault.  Until we overcome it we will have continuing community unhappiness, unrest and discontent.</P>
    <P>I dealt at length yesterday, in reply to a parliamentary question, with the possibility of giving pre-1968 non-contributory widow pensioners the same pension as is paid to post-1968 contributory pensioners, and I explained that in equity it could not be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy Colley raised the matter on a previous occasion, but I dealt with it extensively yesterday and pointed out that it involved an extra £3,250,000 to make the concession and that if that concession were made it would mean that those who are at present contributing to a scheme for contributory widows' pensions would press that, as others were now receiving equal pensions without making a contribution, <Col N="1051" /> they who are at present making a contribution should be relieved of the obligation of doing so.  That would cost another £1,500,000.  Therefore, ultimately to grant the concession which has been sought, and which I in my generosity would love to give, would mean an additional bill of £5 million. I also pointed out that I had approached the staff associations concerned to see if they would agree to making a contribution towards the cost of improving the pensions of pre-1968 widows, but I did not receive agreement to make such contributions, so that it is clear the full cost would have to be borne by the general body of taxpayers, including many taxpayers on comparatively smaller incomes than the unsatisfactory pensions which are paid to pre-1968 widows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister examine it from the point of view of contributions from the widows themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes I have, and the actuarial report to which Deputy Colley referred and which incidentally is based on figures of 1972, so that it is not a true measure of what it would cost now, has also been considered. The person who would need most help is the poor widow with the greatest responsibilities and such a person is unlikely to be in a position to make the contribution necessary to qualify for a contributory pension; and if the better-off were enabled to do it, again it would undoubtedly generate greater discontent and a sense of resentment on the part of those who were poorer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as simple as that, as the Minister knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, it comes down to such a simple situation.  The Deputy knows that I am very well disposed, that I am not saying what I say because I am harsh in my approach or heartless.  I have to spell out what the cost is, what the problems are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pay in the public service is a matter which is largely determined by negotiation and arrangement outside of statutory control.  Ultimately, of course, <Col N="1052" /> the bill in relation to any improvements has to be met by the money being voted by the Oireachtas.  The Dáil, very properly, under the Constitution has absolute control over all money Bills and all matters affecting the collection and disbursement of revenue.  However, it seems to me that it would maintain an anomalous position to allow the greater part of the public service expenditure on the pay front to be free of detailed statutory control, while the smaller part which relates to pensions would continue to be subject to the statutory straitjackets contained in 20 different Acts.  The function of this Bill, therefore, is to tailor a new suit for the superannuation element in public pay and to offer the same management of the pension fund as is available in relation to pay.  That is the principal purpose of this Bill, and it will enable a more comprehensive code to be written and presented to the people who are understandably interested in their future income prospects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give an indication of when the comprehensive statutory scheme might be ready?</P>

As the Deputy will appreciate, it is a <i>magnum opus.</i> As we are preparing it, we do not want to leave anything out or put in anything which should not be there.  The Bill is not purporting to make any changes but the mere codification of the very complex superannuation schemes is quite a heavy piece of work. However, I hope we will have it ready next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I should like to reply to an earlier query of Deputy Colley's.  I omitted to reply to that query on Second Stage.  The Deputy asked me to tell the House the main agreed recommendations of the working party which reported in June, 1973.  There are quite a number but I should like to tell the Deputy the ones of most significance.  Before the changes one had to have 45 years' service in order to qualify for one-and-a-half years' salary but now one-and-a-half years' salary gratuity can be obtained on 40 years' service. Secondly, pensionable service which was once reckoned by reference to completed years is now reckoned by reference to completed days for all types of benefit.  At one time an officer who prior to establishment had at any time served in a part-time capacity was allowed to reckon part-time service of 18 hours per week or more on a <i>pro rata</i> basis where that service was given after 1st June, 1973.  Part-time service is now available whether it was worked before or after 1st June, 1973.  Officers who do not enter the civil service early enough to earn full pension at the age of 65 are now allowed to purchase extra years of pension credit to compensate, within certain limits, for the difference.  The minimum qualifying period of five years for death gratuities and pensions under the contributory widows' and children's scheme was abolished and now a gratuity of one year's pay and a widow's and children's pension are payable in respect of established civil servants who die in service, no matter what his period in service may be. There are others.</P>

If extra money is to be provided in the area of higher education, for instance, this means that less money must be provided in other areas of education.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1063" /> The functions of my Department which relate to children in care mainly concern the residential establishments for deprived children and for children referred by the courts under the Children Acts, 1908 to 1957.  These establishments comprise two groups referred to at present as &ldquo;special schools&rdquo; and &ldquo;residential homes&rdquo;.  The following are the main improvements carried out since 1st January, 1974:</P>
    <P>1.  There has been a further decline of about 8 per cent&mdash;from 1,477 to 1,355&mdash;in the total number of children in care in the homes and schools.  This reflects improvements in the health and social services which enable more children to be cared for within the community rather than be taken into residential care.</P>
    <P>2.  The process of replacing the institutional system of residential care by family group homes has continued to the following extent:</P>
    <P>(a)  new purpose-built homes have been completed or are under construction at Drogheda, Cappoquin, Limerick, Killarney, Fethard, Rathdrum, Galway and Dublin (Sandymount). Thirteen homes in all are involved at an estimated cost of £535,000;</P>
    <P>(b)  In addition, private houses have been purchased at a number of centres for use as group homes and substantial works of adaptation and modernisation have been carried out to existing buildings.  State grants for this purpose since January, 1974 have amounted to approximately £122,000;</P>
    <P>(c)  A new special school for boy offenders was completed in Lusk, County Dublin early in 1974 at a cost of £660,000.  This school provides a programme of care, education and rehabilitation for young offenders on modern lines.</P>
    <P>3.  The training of child care staff has received special attention.  In addition to the residential child care course in Kilkenny, a new in-service course for child care staff was started in September, 1974, at St. Mary's College, Cathal Brugha Street, Dublin. This was extended in September, 1975 <Col N="1064" /> to a three-year full professional course. Several in-service courses for senior personnel have also been held.</P>
    <P>4.  A professional child care adviser was appointed to my Department in February, 1976 and is now actively engaged in counselling and assisting the managements and staffs of the homes.</P>
    <P>5.  Two inter-departmental committees on which my Department are represented&mdash;the Committee on Mentally Ill and Maladjusted Persons and the Task Force on Child Care&mdash; furnished interim reports in 1975 recommending further improvements in the child care services.  These recommendations are being considered.</P>
    <P>6.  Under the existing administrative arrangements, the financing of the residential homes is shared by my Department, the Regional Health Boards and the local county or county borough councils.  Some 30 per cent of the homes' current income comes from my Department, 22 per cent from the local authorities and 48 per cent from the health boards.  The replacement of the present capitation system by a budgetary system of financing would not, of itself, improve the financial position of the homes.  The capitation system gives great freedom to the home to develop its own individual approach to care whereas a budgetary system involves very close supervision and control by the State. All the issues involved were analysed in a report on &ldquo;The Financing of Residential Group Homes&rdquo; completed by an officer of my Department in February, 1975.  The various alternatives proposed in the report&mdash;including the question of a salary structure &mdash;are at present being evaluated.  Over the period from January, 1974 to date the rate of capitation grant has been increased from £11 to £15 per child per week and the adequacy of the present rate is at present receiving consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that the residential homes I was concerned with are in my own constituency, particularly in the city end of it, and is he aware that in one case when they <Col N="1065" /> pay their total expenses for the feeding, clothing and medical attention of the children they have in care, they have £10,000 left to pay 13 members of the staff, and would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that 13 members of the staff are expected to live on that salary?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some of the homes have financial problems, but there are two points at issue here. There is the question of deciding whether or not to provide more resources and the other issue is the method whereby those resources may be divided up between the individual homes.  It is in the latter respect that the question of the introduction of a budgetary system as against a capitation system is relevant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any information available to me at present as to whether or not such a request <Col N="1066" /> was received but I think it may have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise it is very unfair that workers in those institutions are not paid a salary?  In my town there are four people involved, two nuns and two lay people. If they run the place efficiently, naturally they will have sufficient money left at the end of the year with which to pay themselves.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to consider having a salary paid to those people who work in such institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at present is that what is, in effect, a block grant in relation to the number of children in a home is paid to each home out of which the expenses of the home, including salaries, are paid. It is a big question to decide whether or not to separate out from that the salaries of individual people working in the homes because then one has to establish different ratios, staff to children.  Also, one has to do a careful study as to the relativities of this salary scale to other salary scales of other people with similar training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary concede that if the position is as seems from the questions put by Deputies that there is inadequate money available to pay the salaries, this is deplorable?  The Parliamentary Secretary seems to be excusing himself by virtue of the scheme of payment on a capitation basis. Would the Parliamentary Secretary accept that these people are entitled to and must be paid for the work they are doing and that it is an obligation on his Department to ensure that they will?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that it is a question for the homes&mdash;once they are paid the capitation grant&mdash;to decide whether they want to use that money to pay staff or to meet other expenses.  They have freedom within the capitation payment to decide on their relative priorities, to give to increased staff or to increases in other forms of expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated in a public statement on 8th June, 1976, that it is proposed to introduce a Bill to amend the Adoption Acts.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that it will be possible to circulate the Bill this week but, as Deputies will appreciate, it is a complex matter which requires a great deal of consideration and it may not be possible to meet this target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that information.  On the other hand, the Minister will accept that the statement to which he referred did, in some way, heighten the anguish, anxiety and expectancy of the adoptive parents in question, and that that makes it all the more urgent that <Col N="1068" /> he should now indicate to them, if at all possible, the precise date on which the Bill will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I take issue with the Deputy's statement that the statement issued by me should have heightened the anguish adoptive parents are experiencing.  There is certainly nothing in the statement that might indicate that.  I do concede that it might have raised expectations of early legislation.  It is my ambition to have legislation at the very earliest possible moment.  I have not ruled out that it may be possible to have it this week and that the timetable I had tentatively hoped for of tomorrow might still be achieved.  But I want to emphasise to the House that this is a complex matter.  It is only when one goes to draft a piece of legislation designed to provide the reassurances that people are expecting that the complexities manifest themselves.  We are not legislating, if you like, for a specific case.  We want to legislate to cover all possible eventualities no matter how remote that might arise in the future and that does raise very serious and difficult issues.  Much preliminary work has been done.  I did not want to mislead the House by saying positively that it will be available this evening for debate tomorrow.  It is my hope that it will.  But it is possible that, in the detailed analysis of the problem, an unforeseen difficulty may still arise and it may be that we will have to postpone it.  Again, there is no point in bringing in legislation to cure a situation if that legislation itself should subsequently turn out to be unsatisfactory.  I sympathise with people who are worried about this.  I want to reassure them again that this legislation is designed to remove all worries.</P>

Certainly, I could bring in a Bill tomorrow but I do not want to bring it in until I am satisfied that it is the Bill to meet the need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>It is intended to erect a new station on the present site in Eglinton Street involving the demolition of the present accommodation in stages.  This is a major project which will not be completed for some years.  In the meantime, proposals for the carrying out of an interim improvement scheme have been approved and the Office of Public Works has been requested to arrange to have the work carried out as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear what the Minister has to say about the improvements.  Is the Minister aware that, in the station at Galway, the day-room facilities in particular are those which are most worrying because the day-room is the area which is used most often in all garda stations and in Galway its dimensions are 13 feet by 11 feet.  In that seven gardaí and up to ten members of the public are supposed to operate at one time, together with a telex machine, two-way radio equipment and several telephones.  Would the Minister agree that that is a totally unsatisfactory condition in any major city, indeed in any garda station throughout the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I agree and, as I have indicated to the Deputy, plans have now been completed to improve the position and the Office of Public Works have been requested to have the work carried out as quickly as possible.  The work will cover the conversion of some old married quarters to provide an enlarged public office and a separate <Col N="1071" /> general office, which would meet the precise point raised by the Deputy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give any indication of a timetable for a new station but I would not expect a new station to be finally completed and occupied sooner than, say, over five years.  That would be a rough timetable.</P>

      <P>While it is possible to generate electricity from wind, the operation is costly and does not guarantee a continuous supply except in conditions where it would be possible to store in batteries, which are very expensive.  In such cases electricity could be stored only for <Col N="1077" /> two or three days.  This method could be used to provide electricity in areas which are exposed and where there is high ground, for instance, but it would be very expensive.

The ESB in conjunction with my Department and the EEC are engaged in studies on wind, solar, wave and tidal energies. The technology for such development is available but at a very high cost and these studies now are aimed at the possibility of generating electricity in this way at a much lower cost so that it would be in competition with power generated by means of oil or natural gases or, as is the case with 25 per cent of the power generated here, by means of peat.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the Protocol for the Third Extension of the Food Aid Convention 1971 which has been laid before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Food Aid Convention, 1971, which is part of the international wheat agreement, was originally established for a period of three years which expired on 30th June, 1974.  Under the terms of the Treaty of Accession to the European Communities, Ireland was obliged to accede to the Food Aid Convention because the original member states and the European Economic Community as such were parties to it.  We did so in June, 1973.  In June, 1974, and June, 1975, with the approval of Dáil Éireann, we deposited declarations of provisional application of protocols for one-year extensions of the convention.</P>
      <P>At their meeting on 31st May/1st June, the Council of Ministers of the Community agreed that it would be desirable to extend the Community's participation in the Food Aid Convention for a further period of two years from 30th June, 1976.  This proposed extension of two years is in accordance with the recommendation of the food aid committee, which is the organ of the international wheat agreement administering the convention. The Community Ministers agreed also that as some member states will not be in a position to arrange for the deposit of full instruments of accession prior to the deadline of 18th June, the Community as such will, in accordance with Article VIII of the protocol, deposit a declaration of provisional application of the protocol.  Given the approval of Dáil Éireann, the Government propose to deposit a similar declaration on behalf of Ireland and to arrange for the deposit of full instruments of accession later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the Food Aid Convention is to carry out a food aid programme <Col N="1081" /> in cereals, mainly wheat, for the benefit of developing countries. The countries party to the convention, apart from the Community, are Argentina, Australia, Canada, Finland, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and the USA.  Under the convention and its protocols, the Community have undertaken to supply 1,287,000 tonnes of cereals as its minimum annual contribution in the form of wheat, coarse grains or derivative products suitable for human consumption.  This contribution is discharged partly by the Community from their own resources and partly by the member states in accordance with a fixed scale.  For the years 1976-77 and 1977-78 Ireland's percentage share is 0.54 per cent of that part discharged by the member states, which amounts to 3,080 tonnes.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the Government allocated a sum of £300,000 in the Vote for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for the discharge of our obligations under the Food Aid Convention. This allocation enabled a shipment of 3,300 tonnes of wheat to be made to the world food programme last November.  In the current year a sum of £600,000 has been provided and it is hoped that this amount will enable us to discharge most, if not all, of our outstanding obligations.  The necessary arrange-</P>
    <P>The provision of a food aid programme in cereals for the benefit of ments are being actively pursued both within the Community and with the world food programme.</P>
    <P>developing countries continues to be of major importance in the field of development assistance.  Unfortunately, food production in these countries falls well below requirements due to a combination of inadequate agricultural development, international economic dislocation and natural disasters.  The international community have however begun to recognise that priority must now be given to increased and more efficient agricultural production in the developing countries themselves. Deputies will be aware that in Rome last week a United Nations Conference established the International Fund for Agricultural Development to which the Government <Col N="1082" /> pledged a sum of £500,000 payable over a three-year period.  It is my hope that this new fund will become operative as soon as possible and will begin to tackle these vast problems of underdevelopment.  In the meantime, however, it is generally recognised that short- and medium-term programmes of food aid are indispensable if many more millions of people in the Third World are not to become the victims of starvation and disease. The Government therefore fully support the further extension of the Food Aid Convention and accordingly I recommend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that this is the third extension of the Food Aid Convention in itself underlines the continuing and real need which the population in the starving countries find themselves because these are the peoples at whom the convention is directed.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, it is important to stress the depth of the misery in most of the countries in which these programmes operate.  In the developed world&mdash;and we belong to that category&mdash;we cannot always grasp the extent of this misery.  About 900 million people in the world at present have an annual income of less than £40.  If we take into account the enormity of the problem we can begin to recognise that, apart from the just call they can make on us as fellow citizens of the universe, even if we were only thinking in terms of our own security, we must continue in a more determined way to help solve their problems.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has rightly said, one of these problems relates to immediate relief by way of short-term food aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will also agree that that is only a small stone laid in the dam against the huge flood.  It is not going to stem the flood of world misery and starvation. Therefore, one has to look beyond it, particularly to the obligations on the developed world to help increase food production in these countries by technological expertise.  This problem can only be solved by a determined commitment on the part of all developed <Col N="1083" /> countries to pool their resources to help these developing countries.  In the meantime, millions die from starvation every year.  Irrespective of what this programme intends to do, in six months time countless millions will have died from starvation.  No Government can be consistent in regard to their obligations at home if they overlook their obligations abroad. Our obligations cannot be limited to what we can see at home.  We must be constantly directed towards the obligations we have to these starving people, an obligation which many Irish people have recognised in various personal services.  Sometimes it is suggested that we should look after ourselves and that some of the administrations of the Third World countries are not such as to attract merited aid from any source.  There may well be malpractices and mal-administration in many of these countries but this cannot excuse our failure to continue to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that our Association for Personal Services Overseas has been doing a considerable amount of work in setting up proper and fair systems of administration and advising on effective government agencies. For that reason, I welcome the contribution which the Government will be making to the international fund for agricultural development.  The extension of these programmes will not keep pace with the crisis.  Mr. Robert MacNamara, President of the World Bank, in his annual address to the Board of Governors in September, 1975, made reference to income and investment levels.  He estimated income and investment levels up to 1980 between the developed and developing countries.  The GNP <i>per capita</i> in the low income countries in 1970 on average was of the order of $105, which is over £50.</P>
    <P>The estimated GNP <i>per capita</i> in those countries at the end of this decade, 1980, will be 108 dollars, an increase of 3 dollars in real terms or less than £2 in one decade, in effect an increase of .2 per cent in the growth rate <i>per capita</i> income related to the GNP.  By comparison if we look at the <Col N="1084" /> position of the OECD countries, in real terms, we find that where the figure GNP <i>per capita</i> in 1970 was 3,100 dollars, by 1980 in real terms it is estimated to be 4,000 dollars, thereby an increase in real terms of 900 dollars, meaning an increase of 2.6 per cent <i>per capita</i> income.  That shows how terrible this problem is, that far from decreasing the gap between the comfortable world and the starving world, at present progress rates, the gap is widening to an extent that is intolerable, to an extent that will not be tolerated, by the developing countries themselves even if tolerated by the developed countries. We may have a very short time to wake up to the seriousness and enormity of this problem.</P>
    <P>In relation to our position, the Parliamentary Secretary will be aware of the fact that the United Nations' target set out, for contribution by way of development aid, by 1979 is .7 per cent of GNP.  That standard was set out by the United Nations as being necessary to cope with the problem as it is at the moment, to prevent the problem from becoming worse.  Very few countries with the notable exception of Sweden, Holland and Denmark are measuring up to that commitment of .7 per cent.  We through the Minister, some time ago, committed ourselves to a target of .35 per cent by 1979.  We have to recognise in the first instance that that .35 per cent represents half of the recommended UN contribution.  Lest it should be thought that this will be a matter of political division between us on either side of the House I am saying that whatever contributions would be made by this Government would have to be honoured and, indeed, extended by the Government that will succeed them. I can say without any doubt that there would be no question of cutting back on the percentage of GNP being applied.</P>
    <P>I have invited the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary on many occasions to propose what one would call a truly bi-partisan approach in this area.  There is grave apprehension at the moment, as the Parliamentary Secretary will recognise, in view of the <Col N="1085" /> fact that it is contemplated that instead of actually contributing .35 per cent by the end of 1979 it now seems that our contribution will be curtailed to .25 per cent.  I would like to have a firm statement from the Parliamentary Secretary to the effect that we will stand by the targets and commitments given by his Minister and by himself.  The Minister on 25th October, 1974, when he was addressing a seminar organised by the Commission for Justice and Peace, made it very clear that there would be no question of any reduction, or of backing out of our increase to the rate of .5 per cent per annum to reach our .35 per cent by the end of 1978.  In the Official Report on the 10th April, 1975, Volume 279, column 1507 I asked the Parliamentary Secretary was he satisfied that we will achieve the commitment aimed at, namely, .35 per cent of our GNP in three to four years.  The Parliamentary Secretary in replying said:</P>
    <P>The increase has been slow this year because of the general economic difficulty through which this country and other countries have been passing, but the commitment remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>I refer the Parliamentary Secretary to an article arising from statements which he made in the winter edition of <i>One World</i> which is a bulletin on world development and justice, published jointly by Trócaire and the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, where various commitments given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs from April, 1974, are quoted, namely, .35 per cent by that year. This was universally taken at the time as meaning that by 1975 we would be giving .35 per cent of our GNP in development assistance. During the 18 months following the target figure was used in various aid projections and was widely quoted on different occasions.  It was with some considerable shock that it was learnt that this percentage which is already 50 per cent below the UN target figure was not correct.  The wording of the original commitment entails reaching a target of only .25 per cent <Col N="1086" /> of GNP by 1979.  In other words, 30 per cent less than everyone had assumed.</P>
    <P>I want the Parliamentary Secretary, when replying, to state finally and ultimately what the Government position is and if he does absolutely and unequivocally nail down the commitment to .35 per cent.  The Parliamentary Secretary will, of course, realise that even then we would be only reaching half of the recommended UN standard.  If it were to be curtailed even by .1 per cent, having regard to inflation and the increasing GNP, it is likely that by 1979 the difference between .25 per cent and .35 per cent of our GNP would be about £6 million in 1979 terms.  For that reason when we talk in terms of .1 per cent we are talking in terms of a very real contribution.  I would be glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary confirm that there is no such going back on any such commitment given more than once by the Minister both in the House and elsewhere and that we will continue on the target that we have set ourselves in the hope that whoever will be in Government will not just aim at that target by 1979 but will really aim at the UN target which is .7 per cent, which is double what we are at the moment committed to.  In the light of the commitments which have been made by the Government we on this side of the House have committed ourselves at least as much to the Fianna Fáil position here.</P>
    <P>I asked this question recently.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell me if we can soon expect a formal, comprehensive policy statement from the Government, if not a White Paper, on the field of development aid?  This touches many areas of service to the developing countries, the personnel service, financial contributions, technological development and a wide range of areas.  It affects many different organisations in this country, voluntary organisations, State-sponsored organisations, the Government, and so on.  They are all operating at the moment, to a certain extent, according to what they see as their own immediate priority.  They are <Col N="1087" /> doing the best they can, but they are doing it in the absence of an overall development aid policy which should be presented by the Government who, if they are to be consistent in their obligations at home, must also be consistent in their obligations abroad.</P>
    <P>I see that as a demand on both sides of the House.  I have already stated on more than one occasion that Fianna Fáil policy will and must include&mdash;not just at election times but at all times&mdash;a concerned and comprehensive policy on development aid. I know discussions have been taking place.  I would not cut off meaningful discussions.  There is an urgent need to set out the framework of how the Government think these various policies should be pursued by the various organisations concerned.  Otherwise, as has happened so often, even the limited contribution we make through voluntary and other organisations will be dissipated because of lack of co-ordination, lack of programming and lack of direction and leadership.</P>
    <P>The Association for Personal Services Overseas and the initiative taken in that direction are to be welcomed. They have given very useful assistance and advice.  They endeavour to assist people in the ordinary administration of Government.  I am not saying&mdash;far from it&mdash;we are a shining example to any country.  It is fair to say that, in the ordinary administration of our public affairs, we have a standard and a level of integrity which derive not just from the character of the Irish people but from a tradition of service and concern.  This can be applied to great effect in these countries.  The role of the Association for Personal Services Overseas could be extended in many of these countries.  I know they have been active.  I do not want to name them.  They are very welcome. Because of the understanding and courage they have shown, the Irish effort has been welcomed in a way efforts of other countries would not be welcomed.  In our assistance there is no implication that we are holier or better than those who are being assisted.  There is great scope <Col N="1088" /> for developing and extending that contribution which is not, in a sense, as financially demanding as contributions such as the one we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>Before this White Paper or policy statement is published I should like to have an opportunity of communicating the views of this side of the House on a comprehensive basis.  One or two things occur to me.  They are not necessarily original ideas of my own.  I have been encouraged by some associations I have had with people working in this area, and with people who have had experience in some of our State-sponsored bodies.  First, Ireland is in a peculiarly strong position to be seen to be a centre of international development policy.  For many historical reasons which we need not go into, we were never in a position to exploit the resources much less the population of any other country. To the extent that we were not, and others of the European countries were, inevitably we enjoy goodwill, which perhaps we in this generation do not merit, in these developing countries which other western European countries do not.</P>
    <P>So much has to be done in this whole area that there is a great possibility of having an international develment aid centre established here.  I am not aware of any such centre in any part of the world.  If we are to tackle this problem on a comprehensive basis.  I cannot imagine a better location for such an international centre&mdash;obviously funded by the United Nations and the various international organisations concerned&mdash; with all the committed personnel and all the resources, technological and otherwise.  The effect it would have on our country and the contribution the Irish people would make to it would be enormous.  This would be a side effect but it would be very welcome at this time.  The Government might consider this in the course of their consideration of an overall comprehensive programme.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in line with that, there could be an international distribution centre here.  People in the Shannon Estuary area know quite a lot about <Col N="1089" /> problems of development at home and abroad.  If we were to see a development of the type being talked about in the Shannon Estuary, this could become the distribution centre for the Third World.  We are half way between the American continent and Europe.  Ireland could become known as a centre very much identified with the international drive to relieve these appalling problems.  This could be done not only to the advantage of Ireland but to the advantage of the whole world because of the historical goodwill we enjoy in those countries.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the groupings of the developing countries, either at UNCTAD or through those represented at the Lômé Convention, one sees emerging, as emerged after the last war, a new political strength and determination on the part of these developing countries.  After the last war we saw the emergence of many international organisations to ensure a new order of peace and justice, the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the European Community.  In a sense they all developed out of tragedy and desolation but not of the magnitude we are talking about in relation to these countries.  These organisations have become, so to speak, the directors of world order at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is very clear that the Fourth World are becoming aware of their political position, their political strength.  They are making it quite clear&mdash;the lessons are there to be learned from the UNCTAD Conference in particular&mdash;they will not settle for half measures.  They will use their political unity&mdash;which they had not previously learned to use&mdash;to good effect to bring pressure on the developed countries of the world who, for one reason or another, do not seem to respond immediately to the need these developing countries are promoting.</P>
    <P>Looking back at the UNCTAD conference in Nairobi, in the first two weeks we were all waiting for something concrete to emerge but the first two weeks were really taken up by the delegations concerned making <Col N="1090" /> long statements of principle at plenary session.  Perhaps that is inevitable. Perhaps politicians and statesmen have to talk in that fashion but for two weeks, in the face of really critical problems, all we got were formal statements as to the positions taken up by the various delegations so that it seemed to those of us there that there was an impatience, indeed a frustration, if not an antagonism, directed against those who did not seem to be prepared to get down to negotiating on the real issues before conference.  It was not until the very last day that agreement was reached and by that time there was a real possibility the conference would break down on the fundamental question of negotiating for the establishment of the common fund.</P>
    <P>In this connection I want to refer to our own position.  Prior to the conference we did not seem to be by any means clear as to where we stood.  I want to quote now a reply given to me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 12th May last.  I asked the Minister:</P>
    <P>if the Government will support in full the proposals of the Secretary General of UNCTAD for approval at the conference to be held in Nairobi, Kenya, particularly those proposals relating to trade and development and the establishment of a common fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply to me was to the effect that the Government were &ldquo;not in a position to support in full the far-reaching proposals which have been advanced by the Secretary General of UNCTAD&rdquo;.  The most critical point from our point of view was the common fund and that was taken to indicate the Government were not in a position to support the proposals on the common fund suggested by the Secretary General.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that we were one of the 16 countries in group B which belatedly, but effectively, agreed to negotiate on the establishment of this common fund.  Had our position before we went to the conference been clearer the evolution might have been <Col N="1091" /> very different.  I am not saying our position would be all that significant, but it was vitally important that our position before we went to the conference should have been clear so that we would not have had to react to the pressures applied by the developing countries.  Having to put the pressure at the last moment is not designed to encourage the goodwill of other countries.  We should be in the van of initiatives.  I say this not by way of criticism.  It is easy to criticise on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government, even belatedly, were one of those 16 countries who did bring about that last minute agreement by changing their stance.  It was late in the day and the outcome could have been very critical if that change had not come about.  Some countries, notably the United States, Germany, Britain and, I think, Japan, expressed some qualification about this last minute agreement and I understand the United States Government has called a conference later this month of the major trading nations to discuss the major trading issues arising out of the conference.  This seems to be at this remove a rearguard action on the part of the major economic powers&mdash;the United States, Britain, Germany and, I suppose, Canada and to a lesser extent Japan.</P>
    <P>The intention is to discuss the major trading issues arising out of the UNCTAD Conference from the point of view of their effect on these countries' trading interests.  The object apparently is to lessen the effect of the agreement eventually reached at Nairobi.  I would be glad if that were not the case, but I am concerned that such a conference should have been promoted.  I am concerned as to why only the major economic powers are taking part.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary inform us as to what our Government's view is on this?  As a member of the EEC are we not going to express a view when some of the other members&mdash;Germany, Britain and possibly France&mdash;will attend this conference which seems to be for the purpose of limiting the obligations <Col N="1092" /> that appeared to have been accepted at the Nairobi conference?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the usefulness of the debate, but the Deputy must not expect me to reply as I would to a general debate on the subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. I welcome the extra couple of hundred thousand being made available through this Food Aid Convention but neither the Parliamentary Secretary nor I are doing anything whatsoever really to get at this problem.  I take the Parliamentary Secretary's point.  He may not have anticipated that I would dwell on this and deal with it on such a broad basis &mdash;Deputy Collins agrees with me&mdash; but I can tell the Parliamentary Secretary that whenever a motion of this kind comes up for discussion here he now has due warning that I may take the opportunity of a broad ranging approach to it.</P>
      <P>It was vitally important, though perhaps less immediately relevant, to note what has happened since the conference.  I was appalled recently on a visit to the United States to find so many things being made issues in the run-up to the Presidential Election in the area of foreign policy, with intervention in Rhodesia thrown in just off the cuff by Governor Reagan, who apparently reached some response from the electorate, and all kinds of initiatives of that sort without any reference whatsoever as to what that great country's position should be in this whole area.  If it is an issue at all it is only on the basis of its being looked upon as a political issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the major economic and political powers of the west and the public are not reminded of just how serious this whole matter is, and if they stand <Col N="1093" /> back, then all of us, or certainly some of us, however puny our efforts, must try to make it an international issue because, if we do not, if we just look at the order of the world as it is at the moment and say there is a starving world and a developed world, a third, and a fourth, and there is us, and we think it will stay like that, then we are very wrong.  If the developing countries do not see a real initiative from those of us more comfortably off, then we may be a lot less secure than we believe ourselves to be.  Time may be running out for us in a way we do not recognise.  Thinking only in terms of our own selfish security we should not just respond but we should promote.  Thinking in terms of justice, we must act with the urgency I suggest.  Neither at home nor abroad &mdash;this may sound idealistic&mdash;should it be a political issue particularly in the light of the world scene between the major powers of east and west.  Where the west fails to make its impact on this problem then Russia or China, as the case may be, will get in.  I do not want to see this happen because it would lead to further divisions and aggravate rather than solve the problem. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give me some reassurance on the question of the level of our aid and our commitment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this convention as another small step in the right direction and I assure the Parliamentary Secretary that any major step that the Government can take here or in the Community or at United Nations level will be supported with absolute enthusiasm on this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with Deputy O'Kennedy in welcoming this motion.  It is good to see the figure being raised this year to £600,000 from last year's £300,000. Not only that, but the stress is now being applied in the right direction when the emphasis will be on these countries becoming somewhat selfsufficient. We have a long way to go before this can be done but we must make a start.  Meanwhile, it is essential to continue some of the <Col N="1094" /> interim and the immediate food aid programmes.  The long term aim must be to make these countries self-sufficient and to build towards that. That will require personnel as well as finance.</P>
      <P>This is one occasion when Deputies have an opportunity to discuss what we can do to help the underprivileged. Very often on various Estimates this aspect is not sufficiently stressed because it may be only a minor part of an Estimate.  In the Estimate of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries we see that the grant-in-aid to Gorta this year is £18,750 an increase of £3,750 on last year.  Is this really sufficient?  I realise that would probably be more pertinent to a Department of Agriculture and Fisheries Estimate; yet, all these things are relevant to the question of whether we are doing enough, whether we are playing a full role, the role the Irish people would like to play and which I feel they would like to see further developed, in helping the less fortunate people in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the general increase all round I find there has also been an increase in the grant-in-aid to Irish workers in developing countries.  Last year it was £115,000 and this year it is £175,000.  It is good to make an effort each year to offer temporary immediate relief by way of food and, to a lesser extent, by way of finance to people in distress but the long-term aim must be to put the expertise into the hands of the people themselves so that they will be able to tackle their own problems.  We must try to spend more money in that direction.  When one sees the amount of money coming from our own people when a distress call goes out from one of our national organisations, possibly a branch of an international body, for help in the face of disaster, one finds that the people give the lead, that they would like to see us do more.  Here, we seem to be merely meeting our commitment.  It is only skimming the surface and I believe we must produce a much better plan involving more finance and personnel in order to play our full part in relieving distress, hunger and <Col N="1095" /> deprivation in various parts of the world.  It is not sufficient year after year to come up with a motion of this nature&mdash;again it is only one of short duration, for a further year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, this year and next year.  But again, it is a temporary provision.  We must face the position that in various parts of the universe there is a great lack of expertise and education and know-how.  We must play our part in this situation not only through programmes of food aid such as this but also through cash, to a lesser extent, and more through personnel and equipment to enable people to sow and reap their own harvests.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Murphy for their contributions.  Their hearts are in the right place on this very important matter.  I do not mind being pressed by Deputy O'Kennedy in regard to what the Government should be doing.  It is only fair to say&mdash;I hope the Deputy will not take it amiss if I say it again&mdash;that it is not the case that this Government have been guilty of a long, lazy run-up to our present inadequate figure for overseas development aid which stands this year at about 0.14 per cent of GNP.  It is not the case that the Government over long years and covering different Administrations have been lazy but it is the case that when this Government arrived we had to produce a vertical take-off in the field of development aid because there was no overseas development programme of a bilateral kind until 1973.  The only contribution we made officially in the general field of development previously was the unavoidable and very minute sum attributable to our membership of the United Nations and, as from our membership of the EEC, a somewhat larger sum to be channelled through Community organs.  We had no programme of our own despite the pressure of various bodies and <Col N="1096" /> politicians until 1973.  I hope I may be forgiven for making that point; otherwise, it might be thought that we were sitting down on something in respect of which others had previously shown more energy.  We are the first and only ones to show meaningful energy in this field.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Kennedy that time is running out.  I made a speech on these lines myself not long ago.  I think that national self-interest as well as charity and justice demand that we throw our weight behind any and every overseas development aid project where possible.  I think Deputy O'Kennedy is absolutely right when he said&mdash;I said it the other day myself&mdash;that the world which is now poverty-stricken will not always be so and when that time comes they will remember their friends and those who turned their backs on them and in some cases battened on them and intensified their difficulties.  If Christian charity and justice and other sentiments in which we were reared did not enforce on us generosity towards the developing world at least it should be enforced on us by our national prudence.  Perhaps those now in the Chamber will not pay the penalty for neglect in this regard but, if we are neglectful, our children and our grandchildren will pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy's very trenchant reminder was well timed because not enough people realise the comparative affluence of this country, despite how poor we tend to think ourselves, if we measure ourselves against the unthinkable misery in which almost half the world's population exist and the relative deprivation of a much larger number still.  He is right to condemn the approach that we should look after ourselves first, that we are not properly developed and should wait until we are before doing anything about those who are much poorer. This country is backward or poor only if you compare it with a very small number of other societies most of them concentrated among the vigorous peoples of northern Europe. We are behind our neighbours in the EEC, especially those at the northern end of it and a few other countries <Col N="1097" /> with similar economies and social structures, but compared with the enormous majority of mankind we are extremely well-off.  We are pampered and we luxuriate I suppose in surpluses which to them are, and will be impossible not merely for the next few years but for generations to come.  The oftener that is said the better and I am glad Deputy O'Kennedy said it so trenchantly.</P>
    <P>I do not entirely agree with him that maladministration is no excuse for going easy on aid programmes.  It depends on the kind of maladministration. A country whose administration is so incompetent that it cannot prevent rats or pigeons from consuming grain in a store or being pilfered from railway wagons ought not to be penalised.  The developed world ought to try to help them in spite of that incompetence.</P>
    <P>There are other forms of maladministration which must impose a different approach.  One of these fell into my own in-tray a few months ago when it was proposed by the interdepartmental committee to send, not a very large sum I suppose, but a helpful sum of money to provide absolutely rock-bottom facilities for a very stricken area which the House will not expect me to identify.  Very shortly before that I read a report in which it was said on what appeared to be good authority by someone who had recently been there that a very large proportion of foreign aid was not pilfered or maladministered but converted into cash and used to buy armaments in order to exterminate the very people for whom the aid was intended.  I had to ask myself whether, if I let this go ahead and somebody on the opposite benches were to ask about it, I could defend it.  I felt I could not defend that, and so that provision was not made.  I think I was right in taking that view.  On reflection I do not think Deputy O'Kennedy would take another view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not even need to reflect to take the view.  We are at cross-purposes of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Mere incompetence or foolishness ought not to be chalked <Col N="1098" /> up against the backward and poverty-stricken people in the administration of aid.  We have tried to tailor the Irish programme, not only to our own very modest resources but to the kind of job with which we have been traditionally identified&mdash;jobs of a humanitarian kind, not of course officially but through religious orders, missionaries, doctors, teachers and so forth, and also to our own peculiar experience over the years since independence. I did not expect, as I told the House a moment ago, to have to debate the question of development aid.  I will give two or three examples of the kind of thing we do which we feel is appropriate to us.</P>
      <P>We hope, for example, to support a programme of training for hotel managers, in collaboration of course with Bord Fáilte, from a very small poor country, Lesotho, which is entirely surrounded by the Union of South Africa, an appropriate thing for us because we had to build a tourist industry almost from scratch, and appropriate for them too because they have very little else there except touristic possibilities.  The question arose of subsidising the development of a sample quantity of an improved strain of drug to fight leprosy and we were able to find the money to produce a sample quantity for testing of this new drug strain.  What is more, we were able to have that done by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  Their skills extended to producing a useful test quantity of this drug.</P>
      <P>The third example is that of administration, which Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned.  It is true that administration is something we ought not to have to apologise for.  Our administration is characterised by integrity and a sense of public duty, and of course we have not overlooked that in the aid programme.  The Institute of Public Administration participates in several aid projects.  One which I remember was a project for training hospital administrators from Zambia.  I presented certificates or something of that kind to people who completed that course up to a year ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am suddenly reminded of another <Col N="1099" /> one which the House might like to know about.  The Department were associated with SFADCo in running an extremely appropriate course for the setting up and running of customs-free zones in airports.  In that course I met 25 or 30 participants from every corner of the globe.  There were some from the poorer countries of Central America as well as from Asia and Africa.  Therefore our programme is modest in scale but its spread is an interesting one and it tends to correspond with the skills and experiences which we ourselves have developed and things that we are good at.</P>
    <P>Above all I might claim a negative value for our programme in that it is not linked to any special benefit for ourselves.  It is true that money spent on having hospital administrators here is money which to some extent comes back into the Irish economy.  It would be foolish to deny that.  It is also true that the aid-recipient countries tend to complain about aid being tied to a method which ensures that the donor country is going to get something out of it as well.  We are trying to get away from that, but at the same time where a programme can be usefully and appropriately carried out here we do not fail to do it that way.  However, we stop far short of what is alleged against some developed countries in the administration of their programmes, namely, that they channel their aid to countries with which they were formerly in colonial days politically associated and are still culturally associated.  In other words, they are conducting a sort of <i>culture politique</i> via their overseas development aid programme.  We do not do that, and could not if we wished to.  We do not leave ourselves open to any such charge, nor do we try to.  It would be an absurdity if we did build up any sphere of political influence through the administration of our programme, so we are free at least of these reproaches.</P>
    <P>The targets which Deputy O'Kennedy spoke rather sharply about, he has perhaps misunderstood. I would have liked notice of his intention to raise this matter so as to put the matter in an extremely exact form. My impression is that he and the <Col N="1100" /> sources he quotes are wrong in attributing to the Government or the Minister the precise figure of .35 per cent by 1979.  What the Minister said&mdash;I am subject to correction on this; I would like an opportunity to be certain&mdash;was to the effect that, taking one year with another, he hoped to build up our bilateral aid programme by .05 per cent of GNP.  In fact the increases which have been made are quite striking.  To give a simple example of what has happened in the last year, in 1975 our total overseas development aid paid for directly by the State was £3 million, which was almost but not quite .1 per cent of GNP.  In 1976 we have authority to spend and expect to spend £5.7 million, which is almost twice as much, and represents .14 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>That is a substantial increase by any standard, I am sure the Deputy would agree.  Of course I recognise that we are very far away from the optimum target.  We are at only the 20 per cent point of the .7 per cent of GNP which is a kind of internationally accepted target.  However, as the Deputy honestly and fairly said, very few countries have reached that target and we are in roughly the same bracket as far as concerns GNP devoted to development aid as several countries which are more prosperous and more developed than ourselves, notably Austria, Finland and Italy. One of them is actually below our level.  The other two are only very marginally above it.  Therefore, while I do not recommend complacency to the House, we have not too much to apologise for either, considering our pretty late start.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I certainly never said that.  The figure of .25 per cent is a completely new one on me.  I do not recall that having been mentioned at any stage in connection with overseas development aid.  It is true I have a a very bad memory particularly for details of that kind, but I certainly do not recall that figure.  Taking one year over another we have promised to increase development aid, not necessarily with clockwork regularity every year but, taking one year with another, over a short period of years, by steps representing .05 per cent of GNP each year.</P>
      <P>I trust I will not be expected to go into all of the interesting matters Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned.  Perhaps I would be allowed to mention before finishing his reference to the Association for Personal Services Overseas.  I was glad he made the reference he did to that agency.  It does excellent work and contains some extraordinarily devoted people, many of whom are extremely successful, busy and render important public service in many other ways but still find the time, energy and will to devote themselves to this matter whenever they can.  It has done excellent work.  In recognition of that the State's allocation of money to that agency in 1976 was substantially increased over 1975.</P>
      <P>I am sorry if I am disappointing the Deputy by not dealing with any of the other individual points he mentioned. I hope we may have an opportunity when the pressure of work is less severe, and the pressure on our time, to have another debate on development aid.  In general I welcome greatly his commitent to it.  I recognise it as completely genuine and thank him for the way in which he has received this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the <Col N="1102" /> Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1976 made on the 8th day of June, 1976, by the Minister for Justice with the sanction of the Minister for the Public Service under Section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1976, which I ask the House to approve, provides for a minor amendment of the Garda Síochána pensions code in regard to the reckoning of service of members who were appointed to the force after the age of 27 and who had prior service reckonable as &ldquo;approved service&rdquo; for Garda pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Under the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1925, members of the force are in general entitled to double each year of their approved service in the force after 20 years for superannuation purposes.  An order made in 1950 provided that in the case of any member serving on 1st January, 1950, who was appointed to the force after the age of 27, each year of service after his 47th birthday should be doubled when calculating his pension; a similar provision in relation to the calculation of the member's retirement gratuity was made in the 1951 pensions order.</P>
    <P>Over the years these special provisions operated to the benefit of the members concerned.  It has happened however that a small number of men, about 15 in all, who joined the force after the age of 27, who had prior service reckonable as approved service for Garda pension purposes and who either retired before reaching compulsory retirement age, or died while serving, would have been entitled to more favourable superannuation payments if their service after 20 years had been doubled, rather than after their 47th birthdays.  The circumstances of these particular cases&mdash; appointment to the force after the age of 27, prior service reckonable as approved Garda service, and early retirement&mdash;were not foreseen when the 1950 and 1951 orders were being made and consequently provision was not made in those orders to cover such cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> The order now before the House provides that in such cases superannuation will be calculated on the basis of doubling service after 20 years.  In effect, this will increase the superannuation payments to the persons concerned.  The order is being made effective from 1st January, 1967, so as to cover all the cases affected.</P>
    <P>Minor discrepancies of this kind produced by the existing provisions of the Garda pensions code in the case of the few pensions involved can be felt by those concerned to be unjustifiable and unfair and I am glad to be able to take the initiative in removing this particular one.  Indeed it has been and will be my policy to examine any anomalies of this kind that come to notice with a view to eliminating them if at all possible.</P>
    <P>I commend the order for the approval of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to increase the expenses allowable to the promoters of sweepstakes held under the Public Hospitals Acts, 1933 to 1940 from 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the net receipts.  The audited accounts of the sweepstakes held in the last two years indicate that the expenses of the promoters have exceeded 30 per cent of the net receipts and they have said that it is impossible for them to continue to run the sweepstakes within the limits of the expenses allowed by the Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> May I remind the House that the Acts authorise the holding of sweeps in aid of the Hospitals Trust Fund by sweepstake committees appointed by the governing bodies of hospitals and provide that the scheme for each sweep must be sanctioned by the Minister for Justice.  The Acts provide that the amount of the net receipts of any sweep which may be applied to the payment of expenses must not exceed 30 per cent or such lower percentage as the Minister for Justice when sanctioning the scheme for any sweepstake may determine.  They provide also that the balance of the net receipts after payment of expenses, prizes and stamp duty must be paid into the Hositals Trust Fund.</P>
    <P>The Hospitals Trust Fund is managed by the Hospitals Trust Board, a body appointed by the Minister for Health, and payments out of the fund are made to hospitals and nursing organisations on the directions of the Minister for Health.  Section 6 of the Public Hospitals Act, 1933, provides that whenever the participating hospitals propose to hold a sweepstake, a sweestake committee must prepare and submit to the Minister for Justice a scheme specifying, among other things, particulars of the prizes intended to be distributed, the date, place and manner of the draw, the price of tickets, the maximum amount which may be expended by way of commission, prizes or other remuneration in relation to the sale of tickets, the proportion of free tickets to be allotted as reward to sellers, the date on which the sale of tickets is to commence, and the name of the chartered accountant who is to audit the accounts relating to the sweepstake.</P>
    <P>Up to 1973 the amount spent on promoters' expenses for each sweepstakes was approximately 25 per cent of the net receipts.  Gradually throughout 1973 that percentage crept up almost to the statutory limit of 30 per cent.  In the first sweep in 1974 the expenses amounted to 29.32 per cent and the promoters, Hospitals Trust (1940) Ltd., indicated that the figure could not continue to be contained within the limit of 30 per cent because of increasing cost of salaries, <Col N="1105" /> wages, stationery, printing, postage and so on.  In 1974 the promoters sought an increase in the price of sweep tickets from £1 to £2 and an increase in the super prize from £200,000 to £400,000.  These changes came into effect in relation to the Cambridgeshire, 1975, which was run in October, 1975, and in the meantime the actual expenses incurred in running sweepstakes in 1974 and in the first half of 1975 were in excess of 30 per cent of the net receipts.</P>
    <P>Figures taken from the audited accounts show that the expenses in relation to the Cambridgeshire, 1974, were 32.46 per cent, the Sweeps Hurdle, 1974, 32.19 per cent, the Lincoln, 1975, 34.44 per cent and the Irish Sweeps Derby, 1975, 35.68 per cent. The expenses in excess of 30 per cent of the net receipts of these Sweepstakes had to be borne by the promoters and this excess amounted to over £440,000 for the four sweeps. The promoters normally receive a fee for managing and organising a sweepstake, but in the cases I have instanced where the expenses were in excess of 30 per cent, this fee was not paid. The Cambridgeshire, 1975, which was the first sweep where £2 was charged for a ticket and a super prize of £400,000 given showed an improvement and the expenses of that sweepstakes were 30.05 per cent of the net receipts.  The audited accounts for the Irish Sweeps Hurdle 1975, which is the latest sweep for which accounts are available, show that the expenses for that sweepstake came to 34.25 per cent of the net receipts.</P>
    <P>In the light of these figures the Government accept that the statutory 30 per cent limitation is no longer realistic.  The alternative to allowing the increase now sought is to see the sweeps go out of business with the consequent loss of direct employment to nearly a thousand people and a loss of a steady source of income to hospitals, as well as a loss of revenue in stamp duty.  The salaries, wages and State insurance of employees now runs in excess of £2 million a year while expenses on such things as stationery, printing, postage, advertising and so on all help to generate <Col N="1106" /> employment and keep people in their jobs.  In the circumstances it seems reasonable to raise the statutory limitations on the amount that may be paid on expenses from 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the net receipts and section 1, subsection (2) (a) of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 1, subsection 2 (c), of the Bill proposes that the amount of the net receipts of a sweepstake that must go to the Hospitals Trust Board together with stamp duty shall not be less than 30 per cent.  This is to replace the present requirement that not less than 20 per cent of the net receipts must be so paid.  When approving the increase in the price of tickets from £1 to £2 and the increase in the super prize from £200,000 to £400,000, the Government made it a condition that this amount should be increased to a minimum of 30 per cent of the net receipts and, accordingly, the proposal in the Bill, when enacted, will do no more than give statutory force to an existing arrangement which has been provided for by me in the scheme for each sweepstake since the price of a ticket was increased to £2.  In this regard Deputies might wish to know that the total amount paid to the Hospitals Trust Fund from sweepstakes up to and including the Irish Sweeps Hurdle 1975, was over £81½ million.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to 1973 it is obvious that the promoters of the sweepstakes were able to operate under the Public Hospitals Acts, 1933 to 1940.  Under the Acts, as they were, the promoters had to come to the Minister for Justice each time a sweep was organised to get a licence for the particular sweep.  The full details of the sweep concerning expenses, prizes and also of free tickets I gather had to be submitted for examination to the Minister for Justice at the time the licence for the particular sweep was sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now told that the situation changed somewhat in 1973 in that the percentage ceiling, which is laid down in the Acts, of up to 30 per cent was not sufficient to meet the expenses of the sweep.  I understand <Col N="1107" /> that until 1973 the expenses were in the region of 25 per cent.  We are told that from 1973 onwards the expenses increased considerably.  We have been told by the Minister today that the Cambridgeshire of 1974 was 2.46 per cent over the limit and that the Sweeps Hurdle of 1974 was 2.19 per cent over the limit.  The Lincoln of 1975 was 34.44 per cent, again 4.4 per cent over the top and the Sweeps Derby of 1975 was the highest in that it was 35.68 per cent or 5.68 per cent over the top.</P>
    <P>I further understand that the trend which it is evident has been in existence from the Cambridgeshire, 1974 to the Sweeps Derby of 1975, did not continue because in the Cambridgeshire, 1975, there was almost a break even situation.  The percentage expenses were 30.05.  The Sweeps Hurdle, 1975, unfortunately, had a dramatic increase from 30.05 per cent to 34.25 per cent.  In terms of money these increases mean a considerable amount. The Cambridgeshire, 1974, which ran at 32.46 per cent increase meant that there was a shortfall, according to the auditors, Craig Gardner, of approximately £80,000.  There was a shortfall in the Sweeps Hurdle, 1974, when it ran to 32.9 per cent, of £67,298.</P>
    <P>The Lincoln, 1975, increased by well over 2 per cent from the previous sweep.  It went up to 34.44 per cent, which meant that in money terms there was a shortfall of £129,287.  As I said earlier, the steepest increase of all was for the Irish Sweeps Derby, 1975.  The increase then was to 35.68 per cent which meant in money terms that the shortfall was £166,834.  It was heartening then to see after such huge shortfalls that for the Cambridgeshire, 1975, we almost had a break even situation for the maximum percentage expenses allowed under the Act of 30.05 per cent, which in money terms is £1,475.  That was a small increase which was not maintained, because in the immediate sweep after that we had a big jump again to 34.25 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand why we have such large fluctuations.  Perhaps the Minister might be able to explain to us why the expenses varied <Col N="1108" /> so much.  I understand as well that there was a shortfall over those five or six sweeps of somewhere in the region of £500,000.  I can readily understand why the promoters of the sweeps have now come to the Minister for Justice looking for an increase in the percentage which they are allowed so that they might be in a break even situation.</P>
    <P>One of our national daily newspapers, in relation to the legislation we are now discussing, was at pains to point out that the expenses, as they thought, being allowed to the promoters in the Bill were to be a blanket 40 per cent.  That is not true.  That is the maximum percentage which can be given by the Minister and only, I am sure, after a proper and thorough examination of the application for the licence for the particular sweep.  It is certainly a big increase raising the limit from 30 per cent to 40 per cent. Another newspaper contributor referred to the increase being only 10 per cent; but for the sake of being accurate at all times it should be pointed out that the increase is much higher than 10 per cent, that it is 33? per cent.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister and the Department will as in the past, ensure that only the percentage which should be allowed will be allowed for each sweep.  It is obvious that for the past five or six draws, the promoters of the sweepstakes found themselves in a shortfall situation so that a contribution had to be made to cover expenses. This shortfall was in the region of £500,000.  It appears that unless this increase is granted the sweepstakes promoters will not be in a position to continue.  Many of us would be sorry to see this happen.  These sweepstakes are the world's largest. They have contributed many millions of pounds towards hospitals and for hospital purposes.  The small numbers of millions given in the thirties and forties might appear little by today's terms but we should endeavour to measure the value of money then compared with its present day value if we are to assess the contribution made by the promoters of these sweeps to the hospitals' programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> Another aspect of this that must be taken into consideration is that between 700 and 800 people are in direct employment in the promotion of these sweeps.  I am sure that many Members of this House as well as people outside have had representations at various stages in connection with employment in the organisation. With all due respect to the organisers and to those who work in Irish Hospitals Trust, many people found jobs in the organisation when they would have had much difficulty in finding jobs elsewhere.  If this new ceiling for expenses were to be refused, it is likely that those 700 or 800 people would be faced with redundancy.  I am informed that something must be done if that situation is to be avoided and that the proposal here is the only way of dealing with the problem.  Having regard to the very high unemployment figure today there is hardly anybody here or elsewhere who would wish to see that figure increased. Many of the people employed in the organisation might be unemployable in other walks of life.  Apart from those who are employed directly in Irish Hospitals Trust I understand that there are, perhaps, another 100 or 200 people involved in indirect employment, people such as suppliers of printing and other materials.  These, too, would be placed in a serious position in regard to their job security if the sweepstakes were to be discontinued.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will be able to explain to us why it was that up to 1973 the amount spent on promoters' expenses for each sweepstake was approximately 25 per cent of the net proceeds but that, gradually, through 1973 up to the present, this figure increased to 35 per cent and more.  Has the increase in prize money been a factor in this situation?  These sweepstakes had a monopoly on the international scene for a number of years but because of financial difficulties many big cities such as New York, and some countries have found it necessary to operate big sweeps.  Has this situation been an element in the decreased income to our sweepstakes in recent times?</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the changing <Col N="1110" /> value of money may have been a factor in this situation.  Certainly, inflation must be responsible to some extent when one realises the increases that have been granted in wages and so on.  However, if we want the sweepstakes to continue with the present employment situation, if we want them to function under licence from the Minister for each draw, with all details being supplied for examination, we must help them in the way proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few observations in relation to the Bill and in relation to some aspects of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes.  The first point I would make is that the nub of the difficulty which one encounters in relation to the sweepstakes lies in section 2 of the Public Hospitals Act, 1933.  This is a short section which sets out how the amount of money described in the accounts as proceeds of the sale of tickets is to be arrived at. The section reads:</P>
      <P>When calculating for the purposes of this Act the amount of moneys received from the sale of tickets in a sweepstake, the value of tickets issued free of charge by way of reward to a seller of tickets shall be excluded from the calculation, and there shall be deducted from the nominal selling price of all other tickets all commissions, prizes, and other remuneration given in relation to the selling of such tickets.</P>
      <P>The effect of that section, which dominates the whole question of the accounts of the sweepstakes, is to enable an undisclosed sum to be deducted, quite legally and lawfully, before the figure as shown in the accounts as proceeds from the sales of tickets is arrived at.  What gives rise to some concern is that, while it is lawful to deduct these figures in this way or to deduct the various expenses which apparently can be incurred abroad, there is no way whereby the auditors or the Minister for Justice can know the amount of such expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expenses we are talking about in this Bill are a completely different set of expenses from the expenses that are incurrable and deductible in <Col N="1111" /> accordance with the terms of section 2 of the 1933 Act.  What we are talking about here today are the expenses of the promoters which are audited by an eminent firm of chartered accountants with whose audits I am totally satisfied.  Let us be clear at the outset that we are talking only about the second and audited set of expenses and not about what it is lawful to deduct by way of commission, expenses, prizes and what the Act refers to as other remuneration paid in relation to the selling of tickets.</P>
    <P>During my time as Minister for Justice one of the aspects of the sweepstakes which caused me concern from time to time was the fact that under section 2 of the 1933 Act I was not aware of the extent of these expenses and neither had I any way of becoming so aware.  I was perfectly satisfied in relation to the expenses shown in the accounts.  Section 2 of the 1933 Act&mdash; I understand that this is a re-enactment of a similar provision in the Public Charitable Hospitals Act, 1930, when the sweepstakes were established&mdash; allows something that is pretty open-ended. I am not suggesting that section 2 of the 1933 Act was abused because I cannot prove that there was abuse, but it is known that substantial payments were made quite lawfully in countries outside Ireland in relation to this.  Nevertheless, one would get a truer overall picture of the financial situation of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes if what the promoters are allowed to exclude by virtue of section 2 of the 1933 Act were made public.</P>
    <P>When I say &ldquo;made public&rdquo; I do not mean that it should be shown to the public at large.  However, I think that the Minister for Justice should know what is intended when he is being asked to sanction payments for the sweepstake, and he should also be given some account of the payments excluded by virtue of section 2 in previous sweepstakes.  My experience as Minister for Justice was that that information was not forthcoming.  There was no statutory obligation that it should be forthcoming as the law stood and as it now stands.  Therefore neither the Minister nor the public can form <Col N="1112" /> a true picture of the overall situation in the absence of this information.  This is the nub of the whole question when one is discussing the financial affairs of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes.  If one is not in possession of the full facts one cannot have an informed opinion in regard to them.</P>
    <P>In relation to the functions of the Minister for Justice in sanctioning these sweepstakes, Deputy Collins and the Minister mentioned that the Minister's sanction had to be obtained in advance. The Act sets out the date on which the sale of tickets can commence.  My experience as Minister for Justice was that the sweepstake in question was already well under way by the time I was asked to sanction the holding of it. When I pointed out that sanction should be given and that the scheme should be signed before any tickets were sold, I was told that it was necessary to sell tickets in the USA and Canada a long time before the running of the race on which the sweepstake was being held and that it would not be feasible to give the scheme to the Minister for sanction at an earlier date. I had some misgivings about that, but I was faced with a situation in relation to that, as I was in relation to other aspects of the Hospitals' Trust: I did not want to interfere because several hundred people were employed in the organisation.  As Deputy Collins said, they were people who would have difficulty, even in those days of comparatively full employment, in finding alternative employment.  Of course, today the position is even worse.  If many of the people who are employed in the sweepstakes did not labour under certain disadvantages they would still find it difficult to get employment today. That is the factor which must permeate our thinking in relation to this Bill and to the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes in general.  If the sweepstakes were discontinued, several hundred people would no longer be in employment and a net figure of about £4 million per year would be lost to us in terms of foreign earnings.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to increase the post-section 2 expenses, the audited expenses, from 30 per cent to 40 per cent.  It is also proposed to regularise <Col N="1113" /> the existing position to give 30 per cent to the hospitals' fund.  This decreases the prize fund from 40 per cent to 30 per cent and, accordingly, there has to be a fairly substantial drop in prizes as a result of this.  I am sure the Minister and the promoters appreciate that this is likely to affect the future commercial success of the sweepstakes. Section 12 (2) (b) of the 1933 Act contained a provision that the expenses of holding the sweepstake should not exceed 7 per cent of the moneys received from the sale of tickets as defined by section 2.  For some reason that I do not understand that was taken out in the 1940 Act, but my recollection in relation to the promoter's fee is that for some time it has been 6 per cent.  I cannot understand why it was decided in 1940, and again now, not to include in this section which is now being inserted instead of section 12 of the 1933 Act, the same limitation that was in the 1933 Act.</P>
    <P>Over the last four or five sweepstakes no organisation and management fee has in fact been earned because the amount of the expenses equalled or exceeded the 30 per cent. This is a phenomenon that has only arisen from late 1973 or early 1974 onwards.  It may have been true of one or two sweeps during the war also, when due to war-time conditions the proceeds were abnormally low, but generally speaking the amount earned by the promoters in organisation and management fee, up to approximately the end of 1973 was a figure slightly in excess of £10 million&mdash;this is apart from any other income that might derive to the promoters from any other aspect of the hospital sweepstake.</P>
    <P>I can recall that a proposal was made either shortly before or after I became Minister for Justice, as to the intention of the promoters to run four sweepstakes a year instead of three.  At that time the income from organisation and management fee to the promoters was very substantial indeed, and would have run at well over £¼ million a year.  The suggestion was <Col N="1114" /> made either by my predecessor or by myself, that if a fourth sweepstake was being run, in view of the three that were being run, it would only be equitable that the management fee or percentage take would be increased because we had a situation at that time that for a very long number of years there had been substantial fees drawn by the promoters, and it would appear that the running of a fourth sweepstake in the year would simply have the effect of increasing further the total amount which they would take.</P>
    <P>At that time discussions were held between my Department and the representatives of the promoters and the representatives of the promoters agreed that it was likely that the holding of a fourth sweepstake would certainly increase their income, but they regarded this as fair, because of the provision in the 1933 Act, as amended by the 1940 Act, that if the expenses were going to exceed 30 per cent they, the promoters, would have to bear whatever losses were entailed as a result of such an excess over 30 per cent in the audited expenses, the post-section 2 expenses.</P>
    <P>After a good deal of discussion it was finally agreed that we would not seek to reduce the percentage to which the promoters would be entitled for organisation and management fee, on the clear understanding that if the sweep ever did run into this kind of difficulty, the promoters would carry the loss.  At that time, in the early seventies that seemed a very remote contingency indeed, but this has happened and the expenses ratio of the audited part of the expenses now exceeds 30 per cent.  In considering the proposition that is put to us now to increase the overall ratio of expenses by 33? per cent, up to 40 per cent, one has to take account of the fact that very substantial sums indeed were drawn up to late 1973 or early 1974 by the promoters over a very lengthy period from organisation and management fee alone.  I do not want it to be alleged that I am in any sense begrudging the promoters of the sweepstake the fact that they were in a position to draw that amount by way of organisation and management fee for <Col N="1115" /> the work they did.  Whatever wealth they acquired from their promotion and operation of the sweepstake it can certainly be said that it was a boon to Irish industry generally.  There was very heavy investment by the families concerned in industrial and commercial undertakings in this country in earlier years when it was less obviously profitable to make such investment as it became in later years, and some of the undertakings when this investment was made were probably very shaky undertakings even though they subsequently became prosperous undertakings.  Nevertheless we are faced with this situation, and we should bear in mind that the amount drawn by way of organisation and management fee over the years by the promoters was very large.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons it was allowed to remain at a comparatively high percentage figure was as an insurance for the promoters against the day that might possibly arise when they would be forced into a situation where they would have to carry part of the expenses. This has now happened.  However, it is reasonable to ask that if the audited expenses have increased fairly dramatically over the last two or three years, as they appear to have, have the other expenses which are not audited and which are allowed by section 2 of the 1933 Act to be deducted before arriving at this figure of proceeds of sale of tickets, also increased in approximately the same proportion? If they have, is the Minister aware by virtue of the fact that he is introducing this legislation, what the approximate amount of such expenses are?</P>
    <P>There was a very extensive and deeply researched article on the whole question of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 21st January, 1973 by Mr. Joe MacAnthony, which caused some controversy at that time, and in the course of that article Mr. MacAnthony estimated that the actual total gross proceeds from the sale of tickets in the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes is approximately one-third higher than the figure which is lawfully returned to the auditors by virtue of section 2 of the Public <Col N="1116" /> Hospitals Act, 1933.  If that is still the case, it would suggest that the gross proceeds of the average sweep nowadays is close to £4½ million.  The latest accounts which I have been able to obtain are those for the Cambridgeshire of 1975 which were circulated on 18th December, 1975.  The Library has no later accounts although I think the Minister referred to the Irish Sweeps Hurdles of 1975, but that is not yet available in the Library.  In that we have the situation where the proceeds from the sale of tickets in accordance with section 2 of the Public Hospitals Act, 1933, before providing sellers' prizes, was £3,382,000 and after deducting sellers' prizes it came to £3,297,230.</P>
    <P>It is worth comparing the figure from the accounts quoted in Mr. MacAnthony's article of 21st January, 1973, for the sweepstake on the Cambridgeshire in 1972.  At that time the tickets cost £1 each, which is half what they cost for the Cambridgeshire in 1975.  The gross proceeds after deduction of sellers' prizes were shown as £3,916,000.  That is a decrease of over £600,000 in the meantime. This would appear to indicate that the number of tickets actually sold and returned for the draw in the Cambridgeshire sweepstake of 1975 was significantly less than half the number sold and returned for the draw in the Cambridgeshire sweepstake of 1972.  The money is over £600,000 less and the tickets cost twice as much.  Therefore, the number of tickets actually sold and put into the draw was less than half the number in 1972.</P>
    <P>It may be because sales of tickets have dropped dramatically over the past few years the ratio of expenses has increased.  Unfortunately we may find ourselves in a kind of vicious circle because the number of tickets sold may decrease further due to the fact that the prize fund will be further depressed as it is being cut by 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>In relation to the prizes there is an observation I should like to make about what is described by the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes as their super prize.  The super prize was originally <Col N="1117" /> brought in some years ago at £200,000.  It was increased last year, I think, to £400,000 when the price of the tickets was doubled.  For some reason which has never been explained to my satisfaction the winner of a super prize never gets £400,000.  I think he gets £75,000 in cash and an annuity is bought for him which will give him a certain annual income for the remainder of his life.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the promoters or those providing the prize, the cost of the annuity clearly will vary enormously depending on the age of the winner of the super prize.  You can buy quite a substantial annuity for an 80 year old man or woman comparatively cheaply whereas, if you want to purchase the same annuity for a 20 or 25 year old man or woman, the cost will be very much higher.  It seems, therefore, there is a great element of luck, so far as the promoters of the sweepstakes are concerned, in who wins.  The cost of providing the annuity will vary enormously depending on the age and the health condition of whatever person is lucky enough to win.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the original intention, and the intention which was carried out when the super prize was £200,000, was that the prize would be paid to the person and he could do what he liked with it.  If he wanted to buy an annuity himself, or to invest it, he was free to do so.  I do not know why that should not now be the case, and why there is a payment of £75,000 and a life annuity is substituted for what is advertised as a prize of £400,000.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting the contrast between the Cambridgeshire of 1975 and the Cambridgeshire of 1972.  Even before the severe contraction of 25 per cent in the prize fund proposed in this Bill, there was already a fairly substantial falling off in the amount paid in prizes.  In the Cambridgeshire of 1972, £1,894,000 was paid in prizes, whereas in the Cambridgeshire of 1975, £1,331,000 was paid in prizes. The figure must now inevitably drop by 25 per cent, assuming the sale of the same number of tickets, which <Col N="1118" /> would be a drop of about £300,000 in prizes.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted&mdash;I do think the Minister adverted to it in his opening remarks&mdash;that, while the hospitals' fund is now being increased to 30 per cent, the hospitals do not get 30 per cent of the proceeds as defined by section 2.  The hospitals get 75 per cent of the 30 per cent of the proceeds as defined by section 2 and the State gets 25 per cent by way of stamp duty. One by-product, if you like, of this proposal in the Bill to ratify the increase to 30 per cent for the hospitals' fund is an increase in the State's take from the proceeds of each sweepstake.</P>
    <P>In the Cambridgeshire of 1975 the amount the hospitals actually got was £741,000.  Those are the latest accounts available in the Library.  Assuming the Cambridgeshire of 1975 is fairly representative of four sweepstakes in any one year that would mean that the hospitals' take for a full year would be in the region of £3 million.  I am not quite sure what the up-to-date figure is for health expenditure. It goes up so much from day to day almost, that one finds it difficult to keep up with it.  Between capital and current expenditure, so far as I have been able to ascertain, the figure for the current financial year, 1976, for total health expenditure is in the region of £260 million.  Therefore the contribution made by the Irish Hospitals Sweepstake towards our total health expenditure is a little over 1 per cent of the total expenditure.</P>
    <P>Approximately £3 million is not a figure to be sneezed at.  At the same time, one should look at the contribution of the hospitals sweepstake in relation to the entire expenditure.  It appears to amount to a little over 1 per cent only.  It is fair to say that in the thirties and the forties, when public expenditure generally was only a tiny fraction of what it is now, the Irish Hospitals Sweepstake made a significant contribution to the health of this country, to the cost of hospital buildings and to the meeting of deficits in voluntary hospitals, and so on.</P>
    <P>The hospital building programme <Col N="1119" /> initiated after the war certainly could not have been undertaken without what was at that time a pretty substantial fund which had been accumulated during the war by the hospitals commissioners from the Hospitals Trust and which became available for spending in 1947-48 and onwards.  A very useful and very valuable programme was carried out for which a high proportion of the credit must go to the Hospitals Trust.  Their contribution now is very much less significant.  There are voluntary hospitals running huge deficits every year, perhaps in the case of some of the bigger ones, approaching £1 million a year.  When one sees the size of the deficits now being incurred by voluntary hospitals one realises that the contribution of the Irish Hospitals Trust, while welcome, is only a fraction of the significance it had for the country as a whole in times past.</P>
    <P>Mr. MacAnthony's very lengthy but interesting article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> is available to anyone who is interested and wants to read it, but I think it is only right that one of the things he provoked, as it were, should be referred to in this debate.  That was a statement issued by a subcommittee of the associated hospitals sweepstakes committee.  It was issued a couple of months after Mr. MacAnthony's article of 21st January, 1973, and it set out the system of running the sweep as provided for in the various Acts and assured the public by and large that the provisions of the Acts were being complied with as were the provisions of the schemes sanctioned by the Minister for Justice.  Nobody denies that and Mr. MacAnthony never suggested the provisions of the Acts, except perhaps in minor ways, such as the timing of the submission of the scheme, were not complied with.</P>
    <P>The matters that have given rise to concern both to Mr. MacAnthony and others who have written about the hospitals sweepstakes are matters outside the provisions of the Acts and outside the control of the auditors.  The committee which dispenses the money when they get it from the promoters after the final audit are all people of the very highest integrity.  Their function <Col N="1120" /> is simply to spend the money given to them by the promoters.  They have no control whatever over the actual running of the sweepstake.  Their function is simply to approve of what is given to them and make arrangements to distribute it in accordance with the directions.  I think, of the Minister for Health.  I believe for the most part the money is given to the various voluntary hospitals to help them to meet deficits.  All these people perform their functions precisely as they should.  They know very little, if anything, more than the ordinary public about the actual running of the sweepstake, about the expenses incurred, and so on, because it has nothing to do with them.  It is not part of their function to know anything about that or to approve of anything. I am quite certain that these people, being persons of such eminence, would not approve anything they believe to be improper and it would be wrong for these people to react to any possible criticism of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes as being in any way a criticism of themselves.</P>
    <P>There are two supervening difficulties in this whole question of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes.  One is that section 2 of the 1933 Act is open-ended and enables one entire set of expenses to be incurred without any supervision by the Minister for Justice, the Oireachtas or a firm of auditors. There is no accountability, public or private, in relation to that set of expenses. The second supervening problem is the fact that there are several hundred people employed and it is very much in their interest, in the interest of their families and in the interest of the economy that their employment should continue.  The Irish Hospitals Sweep brings into the country a figure of foreign currency which unfortunately is not growing but is a figure of several million pounds a year.  These are earnings which would not otherwise be earned because 90 per cent of the sales are foreign sales. The bulk of the sales are in North America, Canada, Britain and Northern Ireland.  These are all export earnings. These are the problems within which we have to discuss the question of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes and, because these difficulties exist, <Col N="1121" /> one is inhibited from being either as frank or as exact as one might be if these difficulties did not exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill seeks to increase the percentage of expenses incurred in the running of the sweeps from 30 per cent to 40 per cent.  One point I should like the Minister to clarify&mdash;I am sure he will give us a satisfactory explanation&mdash;is why the figure of 40 per cent has been chosen when, according to the Minister, the expenses on the audited figures run roughly to 35 per cent.  They have not reached 36 per cent.  In 1974 the figures were 32.46 per cent and 32.19 per cent.  In 1975 they were 34.44 per cent and 35.68 per cent.  That would lead one to the conclusion that an increase to 35 per cent would have been adequate.  I expect the Minister has evidence, remembering the message of gloom, that inflation is here to stay so long as this Government remain in office and we can look forward to a greater increase in costs and expenses. That is why he has chosen the higher level of 40 per cent.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Malley's argument with regard to section 2 of the 1933 Act which provides this extraordinary facility whereby expenses of the kind mentioned by Deputy O'Malley, the distribution of free tickets, the payment of commission and certain prizes do not have to be shown in the audited figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of what Deputy O'Malley has said and in view of the concern expressed in the country regarding this aspect of the finances of the hospital sweeps, I should like to ask the Minister whether he can allay public fears on this point.  The vast majority of Irish people have very great pride in the hospital sweepstakes and see them as a great national lottery raising huge sums for a very worthy charitable cause but very few people have stopped to consider how the sweeps operate.  Those who have sought to examine the operations of the sweepstakes are greatly inhibited through the inadequacy of the published figures.  Certain documents which, under our law, are the audited accounts for the sweep are circulated to Deputies following each sweep but <Col N="1122" /> there remains the feeling that because of section 2 of the 1933 Act these audited accounts, although correct under the law, do not present a true and accurate picture of the manner in which money gathered from the sale of tickets is fully disposed of.  If the figure mentioned by certain newspaper reporters is correct, one-third of the gross receipts are dissipated in the manner allowed under section 2 of the Act, concern must be expressed about that.  When we have the opportunity to air the matter in the House now I should like the Minister who has the full responsibility under the law not only to see that existing legislation is properly carried out but that justice is seen to be done in this land, to say what the position is.  I feel that any citizen who pays £2 for a ticket is entitled to know what percentage of that finds its way into the worthy, charitable cause after which the sweep is named.</P>
    <P>From the limited figures available in the audited accounts and from the large unknown area provided for under section 2 it would seem that a very small percentage of the £2 paid for a ticket finds its way to the worthy cause for which the ticket was purchased, to help in the provision of adequate hospital facilities.  I support fully the manner in which Deputy O'Malley has put this matter before the House.  I should like to have the Minister's assurance that section 2 is being operated to his satisfaction. If the position is as Deputy O'Malley says, that the Minister for Justice is not given the full facts in relation to money spent under section 2 it is time that additional legislation was enacted to ensure that this information will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the years when the percentage of the expenses as estimated in the audited accounts exceeded 30 per cent and he said that expenses in excess of 30 per cent of the net receipts on these sweepstakes had to be borne by the promoters and that this excess amounted to over £440,000 for the four sweeps he mentioned, in 1974-75.  Could the Minister clarify whether future audited accounts will show a repayment to the promoters <Col N="1123" /> of these moneys?  We would like a full explanation on that point because it is being put across here that the promoters have agreed to carry this loss themselves.  The fact that they have so readily carried this loss raises questions as to where the money has been going and the size of the moneys that have been distributed under this national lottery&mdash;of course, it is not national; it is operated to a great extent by a small group of individuals who are privileged to have been given that right under Irish legislation in the thirties.  Whether it is right for us to continue extending that privilege under legislation is a question I would like to pose and I should like to hear the Minister's views on the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill should be seen in complete perspective.  Basically, it is a question in the long term as to whether the activities of the hospital sweeps should continue or not. Having considered the matter, my party have decided not to oppose this Bill but there are certain aspects of the matter that should be adverted to.  I want to advert to them to highlight the fact that we have made a positive decision to support this measure and to avoid implications of damning it by faint praise or otherwise.  That is the basic issue in the long run as far as those of us with information available to us could make out.  Approaching it in this way one would find the reason why Fianna Fáil are supporting the Minister on this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospital sweep is a rather extraordinary activity judged from normal points of view.  It is long-established in the State now and one can well understand the doubt about the whole approach to the matter but for more than 40 years now it has been a tried institution which has brought substantial benefit to the country.  It has brought considerable foreign earnings here over the years and although the yield is very much less now than it was at its peak, it is still bringing in earnings and our present situation is not such that we can despise this.  The second point is that, over the years, Irish hospitals have benefited very substantially <Col N="1124" /> from the activities of the sweepstakes.  I think it is generally admitted that but for the moneys made available in this way progress in the development of our hospital services at certain critical times would not have been possible or would at least have placed a much heavier burden on the taxpayer than was necessary as a result of the inflow of these funds.  I think the Minister mentioned a figure which is by no means negligible even in these days of very high inflation.  Those two considerations give reason for pause when the question of the continuation of this activity is raised.</P>
    <P>However, apart from that one can legitimately ask, apart from the hospitals, where has the other money gone?  There have been suggestions outside this House about the money other than that given to the hospitals, but let us see what the effect has been. First of all, as pointed out, over the years the Hospitals Trust has supplied very valuable employment in many cases to people who were unemployed. It did a national service at one period of our history in being impartial to people who had been antagonistic at an earlier phase and it did a lot to heal the wounds of the civil war.  But certainly the money earned and brought in by this organisation was in that respect <i>pro tanto</i> well applied.</P>
    <P>It has also been admitted in this debate that there has been considerable investment in Irish industry resulting from this activity.  One can safely say that moneys brought into this country by the Hospitals Trust organisation have been well invested in the country, apart from what has been directly given to the hospitals. One could point to specific industries, specific factories, and in one field&mdash; it is very difficult to measure the exact value of it but it is not inconsiderable &mdash;the direct and indirect beneficial effects on the Irish bloodstock industry and on Irish racing.</P>
    <P>The very bringing in and earning of money abroad was equivalent to a substantial export over the years. Assistance was given to hospitals; employment resulted from activity both direct and indirect and there was <Col N="1125" /> investment in industry.  Remember factories were financed with moneys that ultimately came from the profits of this organisation who employ and were employing significant numbers of Irish workers.  Here is a case where money brought into the country was invested in the country and surely in these days when we are fighting hard to stimulate investment there is a case for recognising the efforts made in this direction.  Lastly, then there are the direct and indirect repercussions&mdash;beneficial effects on the Irish bloodstock industry and on racing. These in summary are positive reasons why we accept this Bill.  I found it necessary to say so in case the analyses that are being given should be interpreted otherwise.</P>
    <P>With regard to the expenses, one of the problems here, it should be realised, and a number of people do realise, is that in the very nature of this activity abroad, particularly in states where this type of activity is not recognised and also where there is, as everybody knows now, considerable growth of competition, there must be a certain uncertainty, a fluctuation and need for reticence about these what one might call excluded expenses. Everybody can understand Deputy O'Malley's point here.  He talks with reference to his experience as a Minister for Justice himself.  But I do not think we can go, without a more careful examination, as far as to say that one would have to have a complete public analysis of this aspect in the nature of the thing.  A very simple analogy may be made with ordinary competitive business.  It is necessary in competitive business to keep certain matters confidential not because there is anything wrong but because of the exigencies and requirements of competition. Similar considerations hold in this case but it might be no harm to suggest that the Minister, who after all is an authorising officer so to speak, under the statute, should have available to him more specific information. But then, not having held the office and not having any details of it, I cannot say any more than that.  I could also visualise that the Minister for Justice might be just as pleased not to have all the information in detail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1126" /> However, that is a substantial point in the debate all right, but, as I have said, the reason for my intervention was not to lose ourselves in that detail, which undoubtedly the Minister has taken notes of, but to look at the overall issue in this, which is whether this activity is to continue or not.  In considering this, it is relevant to consider what their record has been and what they have done in the past.  It may be that many people think that the promoters and people of that nature have apparently profited well from this activity.  The question then is if it was worth it to the community.  That is the test.  To resort to any other would be to succumb to an all too prevalent disease in the modern world, the philosophy of envy.  It is a question of objective fact here.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, commend to the Minister the objective analysis of the points that have been made here in connection with some of these things, but to people at large, when all is said and done, unless there is something wrong proved&mdash;and there does not seem to be&mdash;innuendoes are unworthy things. All I would be concerned with would be that the Minister for Justice of the day would have the information to enable him to exercise his own proper control.  With that I should be, and am, satisfied with regard to this Bill, with the organisation and with the purposes for which it is being offered to the House.</P>

      <P>I have to confess to having grave reservations about this Bill.  I feel that to say otherwise would be dishonest.  I am aware of the fact that we are in a dilemma because I recognise that if this is not agreed in this House we may find over 700 people unemployed.  It seems to me, and I must be frank, that it is putting the revolver to my head, that unless I agree to this we will have over 700 people unemployed.  Believe you me, Sir, I have been intimidated by people in the last few months in regard to the Hospitals Sweepstake telling me that unless I voted for this there would be serious repercussions.  I am not happy with the whole operation of the sweepstake.  There is a smell about it. <Col N="1127" /> It has damaged our good name abroad and I do not think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, I have been intimidated by people&mdash;not in the House&mdash;that there would be serious repercussions if I did not vote for this Bill; I would be smeared in my constituency&mdash;this was conveyed to me just two weeks ago, last Sunday week &mdash;that I would be smeared in my constituency and everything done to get me out.</P>
      <P>As I said, I am not happy about the Hospitals Sweepstake.  It has a smell about it.  It has damaged our good name abroad.  I do not think we can be proud of the fact that the sweepstake operates properly.  I have not had time to go over the Minister's speech but I have grave reservations about the whole of the Hospitals Sweepstake.  People abroad are under the impression that the Hospitals Sweeps finance our hospital services. That is the great myth.  Let me quote from the last part of the Minister's speech where he said:</P>
      <P>In this regard Deputies might wish to know that the total amount paid to the Hospitals Trust Fund from sweepstakes up to and including the Irish Sweeps Hurdle, 1975 was over £81½ million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have felt happier had the Minister continued that statement and given us the total amount collected by the sweepstake in the same period. I have not got the exact figure here but £81½ million is a very small percentage of what was collected.  I felt that there should be more State control over the sweepstake.  I feel there should be.  Firstly, the accounts are not available to the public.  The newspapers cannot get the accounts.  They are available only to Deputies of this House and I think that is very wrong. There is not sufficient public accountability. I would like to see the Comptroller and Auditor General peruse and, perhaps, examine them in great detail.  I would like to see details of <Col N="1128" /> the total number of tickets sold.  We are not told that fact.  I would like to see promoters debarred from participation in the sweepstakes.  I would like to see the management fee examined by the National Prices Commission. I should like also, seeing that it is a monopoly, that contributions to political parties be made public.  Finally, I should like to see a five year period only in respect of this Bill so that we might examine the situation again.</P>
    <P>Under those circumstances I would be very happy to support it and feel we would be doing a good job in this House were we to ask the Minister to consider my proposals in regard to the sweepstake.  I do not want to see people out of work.  I do not think the sweepstake is any great example of employment conditions in this country but I am still conscious of the fact that we have a high unemployment rate and that we do not want to make the situation worse.  I should like to see a time in the not too distant future when we may run a national lottery.  I hope this Bill will be but a temporary one, that we will have more control over the sweepstakes and not leave a matter such as this, of such importance, in the hands of the private few where there is no public accountability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our party have decided not to oppose this Bill.  I am one of those, along with others, who have a certain amount of reservation about the whole of the running of the Hospitals Sweepstakes.  I am not at all happy about the accounts.  We have heard Deputy O'Malley, Deputy O'Connell and others speak on it, who are in a position to know, and I am not at all happy that the accounts are given to the Minister.  There may be, as Deputy de Valera said, business reasons why the State cannot get them.  Certainly the Minister of State should receive a full account of the way the money is being spent.  That is something on which he should insist because we here are the people who should be setting the standards for the public.  If there is anything fishy about the sweepstake&mdash;which has State sponsorship behind it&mdash;certainly <Col N="1129" /> people are likely to talk and they are talking.  I can assure the House that they are talking down the country about this and about the amount of profit being made by directors and so on in that organisation.</P>
      <P>I could not let this opportunity pass without expressing my opinion&mdash;and it is the opinion of the ordinary people down the country&mdash;which is that in regard to this increase now being sought there must have been an awful lot of money made down the years. I understand it is not making money at present but in view of the amount of money made they could afford to lose money for a while.  From what I can gather the kitty must be fairly big at present.</P>
      <P>I hope, as Deputy O'Connell said, this will be a temporary measure, that more control will be exercised.  Indeed, Deputy O'Malley, a former Minister for Justice, pointed out that he was not happy at all with the accounts as presented to him.  We must set standards in this House.  We must insist on standards.  There is no point in lowering the standards of this State, particularly of this House.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that he receives a full account of the way the money is spent from now on.</P>

      <P>I want to refer in the first instance to something that Deputy O'Connell said when he alleged that he had been intimidated in regard to this measure by people not in the House and he specifically said that he would be smeared in his constituency.  This is possibly the most serious statement I have heard in this House, and there have been many serious statements made in the course of my comparatively short time here.  I think if a Member of Parliament is subjected to that pressure it is intolerable but it is incumbent, more than incumbent, it is absolutely vital that that Member would make his complaint to the authorities of the State so that criminal proceedings could be taken against those responsible for this intimidation. That is essential and that must be done.  I take it that the Deputy will do it for the protection of <Col N="1130" /> himself, for the protection of this House and for the protection of Members in it.  I am glad to note, however, that no other Member&mdash;and there are many Members here whose views on this subject are known, views that might be deemed to be antagonistic to this particular operation&mdash;has been subjected to this pressure.  Certainly, I have not been subjected to it.</P>

      <P>I may, perhaps, elaborate on this.  I have been subjected to abuse over this and I have <Col N="1131" /> been intimidated and told by people in employment that attempts could be made to smear me in my constituency. I said: &ldquo;I will support the Bill if I think that the extra percentage goes to the workers&rdquo;.  Deputy Halligan was with me on the particular occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that this is an extremely serious allegation and I certainly would welcome its fullest investigation and appropriate action taken against those guilty should their guilt be proved.  I am glad to know that nobody else was subjected to this intimidation, notwithstanding that other views hostile to this particular operation are known to be held by people.  I certainly&mdash;I want to say this here quite unequivocally&mdash;have not been subjected to any pressure nor am I aware of anybody else who has been subjected to any pressure, legal or illegal, of any kind whatsoever.  Because of the uniqueness of Deputy O'Connell's position&mdash;I emphasise its uniqueness&mdash;it demands investigation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins, who opened for the Opposition, asked for an explanation of the difference between the figures for the Sweeps Hurdle, 1975 and the Cambridgeshire, 1975, that the ratio of expenses showed a marked difference between the two immediately succeeding sweeps.  The answer is that the proceeds dropped in the Sweeps Hurdle, 1975 and when the expenses are expressed as a percentage, if the sum of which they are a percentage drops, then they must bear a higher ratio to that sum.  That is the explanation for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a pattern of a fall in income over the years.  This became marked in 1973.  In the Cambridgeshire Sweep, 1973 the proceeds fell for the first time substantially below £4 million and they have not recovered in any sweep since then to cross the £4 million.  In fact, in the latest sweep, we had the experience where the figure dropped below £3 million.  This shows a trend that is disturbing.  It must raise a question mark as to the viability of the operation in the future if that pattern of falling receipts continues to occur.  If receipts continue to fall, then <Col N="1132" /> even the increase in expenses proposed in this Bill will not be adequate and quite clearly the operation will no longer be viable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy wanted to know why 40 per cent was picked.  The position is that the trend of expenses has shown that the actual expenses have crossed 35 per cent, excluding the organisation and management fee.  If that were to be added in, they would be well across 36 per cent, coming up to 37 per cent. The trend is that the expenses are on the increase.  Wages are on the increase and all the other expenses attending the running of the sweep are on the increase.  Consequently, the expenses can be expected to increase and with falling receipts it would be unrealistic to provide for a ceiling of less than 40 per cent.  That ceiling would be reached probably in a very short time indeed.  On the other hand, to provide for a ceiling greater than 40 per cent, to allow the expenses to go to, say, 50 per cent, would mean that we would then have reached the stage where the matter was not viable and another look would have to be taken at the entire operation.  It is quite clear to me that 40 per cent is a reasonable figure having regard to the trend of expenses over the last year or 18 months.  Any more than that would then raise a question mark over the entire viability of the operation.</P>
    <P>I was rather amazed by the tone of Deputy O'Malley's speech.  It was full of hostility to the entire operation and, I regret to say it, full of suspicion.  At one stage he used the expression: &ldquo;I cannot prove that there was abuse&rdquo;.  If he could not prove that there was an abuse in a matter so serious as this, he should not then have proceeded by innuendo&mdash;Deputy de Valera referred to the use of innuendo in this area&mdash;to smear the entire operation.</P>
    <P>I cannot help recalling that he was Minister for Justice for a number of years.  As he said, as Minister for Justice, part of his duty in regard to the sweeps was to sanction the scheme for each particular sweep.  In other words, no sweep can be held until the Minister for Justice signs his name to <Col N="1133" /> a document containing the scheme for that particular sweep.</P>
    <P>He was in that position.  If he felt there was anything wrong in the operation of the sweeps, if he felt he was being denied any information by the promoters, if he felt he was being hoodwinked, if he felt, as he clearly indicated to the House, that there was something happening, that there was money not being accounted for, that the statutory provision for providing for accountability of the proceeds in the way they are defined in the Act was wrong, then he had the remedy in his own hand.  He refused to sign a scheme for the sweep until he got the information he wanted.</P>
    <P>That was his remedy when he had the power as Minister for Justice.  Not merely was it his remedy, it was his duty.  If he was not satisfied with the way things were being conducted, he had a duty to use the power available to him as Minister to ensure that they were conducted to his satisfaction.  If he found he was not being allowed use that power or did not want to use that power or his colleagues in Government would not let him use that power and if he felt there was a serious principle involved here, he also had his remedy.  He did not operate either remedy but he now comes into the House three years after leaving that job and engages in a smear speech.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants to accept the principle that the end justifies the means, no, but if he goes for the principle that the end justifies the means, that is apparently what he was doing.  I wanted information, I requested it and I got it, information of the type the Deputy said was refused to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I insisted on getting it and I got it.  As Deputy O'Malley recognised, and as Deputy de Valera <Col N="1134" /> recognised, there is certain information, which for one reason or another, reasons of competition, reasons of public policy, should remain private but they both conceded it should be available to the Minister for Justice. I have indicated that I wanted certain information.  I have got some information. I also indicated I require more information and I am confident that I will get it.  If I do not get it, I will do what Deputy O'Malley had not the guts to do.  I will not sign a scheme for the sweep.  I will not let the immoral principle of the end justifying the means decide what I do.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley makes play of a newspaper article published three years ago and uses these articles to suggest that in some way vast sums of money are being hidden and not accounted for.  The article in question suggested that the actual sales were one-third greater than the figure declared.  This is an appalling statement from somebody who was Minister for Justice and who was in a position to find out exactly what were the actual sales.  The Deputy confessed that in this critical situation he, as Minister for Justice, was not able to acquire this information although a journalist who has now departed from the Irish journalistic scene was able to acquire the information.  This raises either of two questions&mdash;the figure in the newspaper was an invention or Deputy O'Malley was totally impotent in the operation of his serious office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy said, too, that a fee for organisation and management in respect of a fourth sweep was permitted during the course of his term of office on the understanding that should there be losses, they would be met out of these fees.  In other words, the implication is that the promoters should be expected, for so long as there is a continuing loss on these operations, to foot the bill.  This is totally unrealistic.  To date the loss in terms of money put up by the promoters to meet the difference between the actual expenses and the permitted ceiling has been £440,000.  This does not take account of organisation and management fees which have had to be foregone and which amount to <Col N="1135" /> approximately the same figure so that there has been a loss to the promoters of approximately £1 million on the operation of the sweeps during the past 18 months.  Could anyone with even a shred of common sense expect a commercial operation to continue to operate on that basis?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley raised the question of the amount of the organisation and management fee.  It is 6 per cent on the first £100,000, 5 per cent on the second £100,000 and 1¾ per cent on the balance.  This works out at about 2 per cent on the entire proceeds. To suggest that a firm should continue running an unprofitable enterprise merely because they made profits in the past is daft commercially and is a very odd proposition from a spokesman on Industry and Commerce. The Deputy stated that this concern had received fees of £10 million by way of organisation and management fees since the inception of the sweeps some 40 years ago and he contended that because of that they should continue to bear the losses.  For how long should they continue to bear the losses that are being incurred? Should they continue in this way until the entire £10 million is exhausted or should they be expected to add to this amount and continue to bear the losses for another 40 years?  The proposition is so daft that it merits no consideration whatever.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley said also that the sanctioning of the scheme was only a formality and that, in effect, the Minister for Justice had no option. Again, this is a dreadful confession of impotence in a most responsible job.  Of course, the Minister is entitled to refuse to sanction the scheme and if he does not get it in time, he must demand that it comes in time or he may decide to sign this scheme on the condition that the next one will be presented on time.  To confess that a Minister was so helpless in the face of something about which he was very concerned is a shocking confession and it is made three years after the Deputy left office.  It is an attempt to smear the organisation.  I regret to have to say that.  The Deputy, as <Col N="1136" /> Minister, had the remedy in his hands. I have the power and I have the remedy, too.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley suggested, too, that the prize fund will be reduced by virtue of the percentage available being lessened by reason of the percentage for the expenses being increased. This is true.  However, whether there will be a reduction in cash terms must depend on the continued gross income of the sweepstakes. The promoters have expectations that the slump which has been with them for some time may have bottomed out and there may be an improvement in receipts due to the easing of competition in some of their markets.  Should the income increase, the amount available in cash terms, while less in percentage terms, will be greater and, consequently, the prize level will be maintained at a commercially attractive level.  But should the stage be reached where that situation cannot be achieved there would hang a question mark over the viability of the entire operation. This is something that would become apparent very quickly.  Should it be found that the operation were no longer viable, it would be wound up.</P>
    <P>In talking of the moneys which go to the hospitals from the fund, Deputy O'Malley suggested that we were overlooking the fact that a proportion of the 30 per cent available for the hospital fund contains a large element of stamp duty. This factor was not overlooked. I adverted to it specifically in my speech when I indicated that the amount available under that heading included both stamp duty and money available for the hospitals.  I agree with the Deputy that the amount being paid to the hospitals is comparatively small but that is not to say it is not valuable.  Its continued payment should be secured so far as possible and that is the objective of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy posed the question as to whether the amount payable to the hospitals is too small.  He asked whether it is right to give a continued monopoly to a small group to continue <Col N="1137" /> this operation.  It is my view that it is right to allow this continued monopoly.  If I thought otherwise, I would not be here to promote this Bill nor would I have signed the schemes from time to time to permit the various sweeps.  It is not a question of giving a small group a monopoly. It is using a small group who have the unique knowledge to run a sweep. One does not organise sweepstakes in the same way as, for instance, one would commence the operation of a shirt factory.  There is only one commercial operation in this country capable of running the sweepstakes as constituted presently.  If there is to be a question of a national lottery in substitution for the sweepstakes should they be no longer viable in years to come, that other lottery would have to be organised in a different way.  Its organisation would be a matter for consideration.  The present organisation have the monopoly by reason of their unique knowledge as to how this operation must be run.  That unique knowledge is a valuable commercial property.  We must face that harsh commercial fact.</P>
    <P>It is right to allow the sweeps to continue to be run for the benefit of the hospitals, of the nation and of the people working in the organisation.  I am satisfied that the innuendos and the suggestions that there is a fiddle going on, that there is something wrong somewhere, are unjustified.  I am satisfied, too, that any information I want will be made available because I am a Minister in the Government and it is the Government who run the country and all operations that take place within it.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera put his finger on the motivation behind much of the opposition to the operations of the Irish sweeps.  This has been a singularly successful operation, uniquely successful in that sphere of operation in that since its inception more than 40 years ago, it has been a commercial success.  So far as I am aware, it is the only operation of that kind that has been an undoubted commercial success during all of that time.  One reason for this is that it has been run efficiently.  No commercial <Col N="1138" /> operation can profit and grow for that length of time unless it is run efficiently and properly.</P>
    <P>Much of the opposition is based not on hard facts but on rumour, gossip and innuendo.  Deputy de Valera referred to this envy as being part of that envy which is rampant in the modern world.  Envy is dominant in Irish life today.  So many people are full of envy because the promoters of this operation have become wealthy as a result of running it successfully.  It was properly pointed out that that wealth has been reinvested to create employment for our people.  That is a development to be commended.  When the super prize was increased from £200,000 to £400,000, provision was made for a down payment of £75,000 with the balance by way of an annuity. This was done for tax reasons.  In many countries the recipients of such a large sum of money would have to pay the bulk of it in income tax. Therefore, it was a tax avoidance measure to ease the position of the prize winners.  It is guaranteed that the full amount of the prize will be paid to the winner or his personal representative should he not live long enough to receive the entire amount. If a winner wants the full amount of the prize in cash I have no doubt that he could be accommodated.</P>
    <P>I thank the Opposition speakers who welcome this Bill and who recognised that the Bill is necessary for the continuance of the sweepstakes.  The promoters are not going to run it at a loss.  The arguments in favour of continuing the sweepstakes are strong and must be acceded to.  I felt justified in bringing this Bill before the House to raise the statutory level of the expenses in order to avoid losses in the future and to ensure a break-even operation for the promoters.  If I thought there was anything wrong in the operations of the Hospitals Sweepstakes I would not ask the House to accept this Bill.  I very much regret that Deputies have made allegations and innuendoes without any proof whatsoever.  Deputy O'Malley used the words: &ldquo;I cannot prove that there was abuse ...&rdquo;, yet he continued to suggest that there have been abuses. <Col N="1139" /> He had the remedy in his own hands when he was Minister for Justice.  If satisfactory information was not forthcoming, Deputy O'Malley could have refused to sanction any particular scheme for a sweepstake.</P>

      <P>I have commented on them.  With regard to the question of public accountability I made the point that the sweepstakes are run by a private company, the only company that can run it because of their special knowledge.  To suggest that there can be public accountability over a private company is not realistic.  With regard to the number of tickets sold, this brings us back to Deputy O'Malley's suggestion that hidden funds are being extracted.  I have already got sufficient information to satisfy me that nothing illegal is being <Col N="1140" /> practised.  If Deputy O'Connell is aware that the sweepstakes are making payments to political parties, he should&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 is the Bill.  I was disappointed that the provision for increasing the expenses from 30 <Col N="1141" /> per cent to 40 per cent was allowed.  I was surprised at the attitude and tone of the Minister in dealing with the contributions to the debate on Second Stage.  We made it quite clear that we were accepting the necessity for this Bill, and Deputy O'Malley did express worry in relation to it.  It is rather remarkable that the Minister pointed out that the promoters had found it impossible to stay within this 30 per cent limit for expenses, and in fact were in breach of the existing legislation over the past 12 months.  The situation at present is that according to the Minister's speech the expenses are higher than 30 per cent since early 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing legislation conveys that the Minister's sanction for the running of sweeps is on the basis that expenses cannot be charged over 30 per cent.  Who carries the excess?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at the Minister deciding to attack the former Minister for his difficulty in this regard and at the same time saying that one of his reasons for bringing in this necessary Bill was that the alternative to allowing this increase now sought was that the sweeps would go out of business with the consequential loss of direct employment to nearly 1,000 people and a loss to the hospitals.  I fully subscribe to the idea that this is necessary legislation for the same reason that the Minister attributes to it.  When Deputy O'Malley said that that was his reason for sanctioning former sweeps the Minister said: &ldquo;Oh yes, if the end justified the means, that satisfied Deputy O'Malley&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I made was that Deputy O'Malley sanctioned it being dissatisfied with it.  I sanctioned it being quite satisfied with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things we are talking about here is the accountability of the promoters for expenses. I deliberately came into this House to <Col N="1142" /> give as my solid view that this is a business concern that cannot possibly put its accounts before a Comptroller and Auditor General and cannot basically satisfy the normal requirements in this regard.  I had two American visitors in this House today and traditionally they always bought sweep tickets but they were finding very great difficulty in getting them now.  In this Parliament we have the problem that we are working to promote something which has been going on for a number of years, which has succeeded in raising money to a diminishing extent over the past few years.  The hospitals sweepstakes are running into difficulties in marketing. Those difficulties have to be overcome by increasing hand-outs to try to increase the back-flow of money from the North American continent in particular.  The disappointing thing about the non-disclosure and the non-practicability of disclosure as far as the Hospitals Sweepstakes is concerned is that we never quite know what volume of money is taken in from the Irish subscriber as apart from the North American, the English and others and what our chances of success are from the point of view of bringing off the big money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the gamble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that with the exception of some Irish character from Kildare who won the top prize some years ago, the top prize seems to have gone mainly to Canada.  It appears that the bulk of the tickets are now being sold in Canada, because apparently the Canadian authorities have not got the outlets as choked up as the west have succeeded in doing.  From time to time we read headlines in the papers about captures by the US Revenue, and it is difficult to discuss a measure in parliament where even the Minister mentioned that the reason for the change in format in the top prize was a tax avoidance measure.  We have a situation here whereby the Government and the Minister for Justice have the embarrassment of trying to explain in this House that with their <Col N="1143" /> concurrence a scheme has been worked out with Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes whereby the tax authorities in the US and in Canada are being fiddled.  That puts it in black and white.  If we discuss this at length here, we could find ourselves in the position of subscribing to something that is illegal everywhere else but which we are making laws to determine and to control.  Where you have that type of situation, where it is necessary to have a certain degree of looseness, there is bound to be complaint.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister helped the case today by attacking the contributions that were made on this measure as being a collection of rumour, gossip and innuendo, because where you have that type of situation whereby full public disclosure of accounts cannot be made there will be difficulties.  Deputy O'Connell read out a list of six requirements that he felt should be met.  I sympathise with Deputy O'Connell seeking to get this type of information and I quite appreciate that it could be unwise publicly to disclose that information&mdash;to say that we sold three million sweep tickets in the US for the Cambridgeshire sweep or that we sold ten million in Canada.  It might be &ldquo;chicken feed&rdquo; as far as Americans are concerned but we all know that every Irish American, second, third, fourth and fifth generation, feels that he is supposed to have a ticket in the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes and that there is great difficulty in getting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 is the increase from 30 to 40 per cent.  I appreciate the necessity for this increase but, on the other hand, I think it was very wrong of the Minister to introduce a Bill which is an amendment of the original Act raising it from 30 to 40 per cent.  The Minister says that things have got rough since 1973.  This is rather significant. Internally expenses have gone up.  In this section we are amending a 1940 Act.  Whatever about the former Minister for Justice who was not too happy with the situation, it appears from the Minister's statement that the promoters were able to keep <Col N="1144" /> within the limits until 1973, and this is the significant time as explained by the Minister.  Expenses began to rise steadily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Minister's own statement they were not. The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Figures taken from the audited accounts show that the expenses in relation to the Cambridgeshire 1974 were 32.46 per cent, the Sweeps Hurdle, 1974, 32.19 per cent ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The 2.46 per cent was not taken out of the proceeds.  It was met separately by the promoters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> The following limitations shall apply in respect of the application of the moneys received from the sale of tickets in a sweepstake held under this Act:</P>
    <P>(a)  the amount applied out of such moneys for paying the expenses incurred in holding such sweepstake (other than tickets, commission, prizes or other remuneration given in relation to the sale of tickets) shall not exceed 40 per cent of such moneys or such lesser percentage of such moneys as the Minister for Justice may, when sanctioning the scheme for such sweepstake, determine;</P>
    <P>Do I take it from the subsection that if in 1980 the promoters run a sweepstake and the expenses are 42 per cent, provided the promoters pay the 2 per cent themselves they are not in breach of the Act?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I read it, according to subsection 2 (a) no more than 40 per cent of the money taken in can be paid out by way of expenses. Despite writing that into the Bill, the Minister says if the expenses are 42 per cent everything is all right provided they pay the 2 per cent themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They could treble the expenses if they wanted to, provided they paid the balance out of their own pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>My reading of the section is that they cannot spend more than 40 per cent on expenses.  I am in agreement with the Bill.  I appreciate the difficulty about the reports. I should like an assurance from the Minister that he, as the responsible Minister, will have the full report disclosed to him and that he will be shown the accounts for the tickets and the cash from North America, Britain, or wherever we can generate a market.  If we are being squeezed out of North America we must look for another market.  I agree with many of the comments made on Second Stage.  If we can get money for our <Col N="1146" /> hospitals from outside the country we should try to hold on to that market.  The Minister made a big thing out of having the power and using it.  Is he telling us he will be able to get a full account of the expenses?  Deputy O'Connell mentioned the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I fully accept it is not that sort of book-keeping arrangement.  I appreciate that the sales cannot be disclosed.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to indicate that he will endeavour to see economy is practised to the fullest extent.  Giving a limit of 40 per cent for expenses does not necessarily mean that limit is to be reached in every sweepstake.  The expenses for the Irish Sweeps Derby, 1975, were 35.68 per cent.  I accept that costs are increasing in this business.  The price of the ticket was jacked up from £1 to £2.  With every book of tickets bringing back twice as much money, we might have expected a drop in the percentage of costs as against overall income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some points to which I should like to refer. The Minister may be overlooking the fact that this is a monopoly and so this company is not in the same position as any other private company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Deputy?  If the House is giving a monopoly to the company the company itself is a monopoly because nobody else can discharge this particular operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in the same position as any other private company. It is in an unique position.  It is a monopoly and it has tremendous power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a monopoly in the United States or Canada.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but we are giving it tremendous power.  It is not in the same position as an ordinary private company.  It does not disclose its accounts and I think there should be an obligation on it to disclose its accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General <Col N="1147" /> should be asked to inspect its accounts.</P>
      <P>With regard to tickets sold, the number is not disclosed.  The national lotteries in Germany and Austria publish in the Paris <i>Tribune</i> the number of tickets sold so there is no question of establishing a precedent here.  I do not see any reason why the number of tickets sold should not be disclosed.</P>
      <P>Each sweepstake is run as a separate entity and wages and everything else are paid out of each sweepstake.  There is no reserve fund.  I believe there should be a reserve fund because such a fund would enable it to weather an economic recession or anything else. We do not know when there will be another application for an increased percentage.  That would not be necessary if there were a reserve fund.</P>
      <P>There is a plan to computerise everything.  That will result in a big drop in expenses because fewer salaries will be paid to employees. How many temporary employees are employed?  Some have been temporary all their lives.  I would like to see their employment safeguarded.  We have no guarantee with regard to their employment and my first concern is for the 700 to 1,000 employees.  I hope the Minister will comment on this.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything wrong with the five-year limit.  We do not know what the situation will be like in five years.  This is a precautionary measure.  There is nothing wrong with it and I hope the Minister will not argue that it is unrealistic and cannot be done.  Would it upset the Dáil to have to consider the matter again in five year's time?  We may be in an economic boom and expenses may be considerably reduced as a result of computerisation and an economic boom.  Expenses might not even be 30 per cent.  The sweepstakes never approach us in times of boom when everything is going fine.  We only hear from them when the money is diminishing. I see no reason why there should not be a limit.  I appeal to the Minister to incorporate some provision about accounting.  It is not opportune for me to put in an amendment at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained to Deputy O'Connell that this is a commercial operation and one cannot put a time limit on a commercial operation and be realistic about it.  It must be open-ended so long as it is commercially viable.  I do not know why the Deputy wants a time limit so that we can review the percentage at the end of five years. The accounts are published and they are sent to Deputy O'Connell after every sweep and one can see the percentage of expenses in relation to receipts and Deputy O'Connell, if he is worried, can raise the matter in the normal way in which such matters are raised.  The Bill gives the Minister power to provide for expenses not exceeding 40 per cent or such lesser percentage as the Minister may from time to time determine.  The Minister for Justice can decide, if he thinks fit, that the percentage should go back to 30 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  He does it in the scheme sanctioning the sweep.  Each sweep has a scheme which has to be signed by the Minister.  The details are set out and one of the details is the amount payable for expenses.  At the moment it is 30 per cent.  In the next scheme I will certify the amount at 40 per cent.  In three years' time, if I see the receipts have increased enormously or that the maximum of 40 per cent is not being availed of, then I, or whatever Minister for Justice is there, may certify the expenses at 35 per cent.  To use a slang expression, it is no skin off the promoters' noses to have the expenses high because anything saved on expenses goes into the prize fund.  The expenses consist of advertising, publicity, salaries, wages, lighting, travelling expenses, auditing accounts and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, and I welcome any advance in efficiency subject to safeguarding employment.  I have no doubt the Workers Union of Ireland will see that employment is <Col N="1149" /> safeguarded.  Increasing the percentage for expenses does not mean anything extra going into the pockets of the promoters.  The promoters get their organisation and management fee, which is a percentage of the profits, and they get that as part of the expenses and, if expenses go over 40 per cent, the first thing that abates is their fee so it is in their interest to keep expenses down.  Expenses have exceeded 35 per cent in a number of sweeps in the last year or 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They have gone to almost 36 per cent.  Receipts are dropping and if that trend continues the percentage of expenses will increase proportionately so it would be unrealistic to say 35 per cent when that figure has already been exceeded.  It would be unrealistic to say 38 per cent and so the figure decided on is 40 per cent and, as I argued earlier, if it goes beyond 40, then the whole viability of the operation has to come into question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The increases have nothing to do with the expenses. They are pretty well fixed.  The reason why the 30 per cent has not been adequate is that it is 30 per cent of the proceeds.  The proceeds have been dropping and therefore the 30 per cent available for expenses has been less.  It is a question of the viability of the sweep in its foreign markets and the competition it is meeting.  There are many factors, including, I suppose, the recession; there is less money available throughout the world to buy sweep tickets.</P>

We do not know the proportion of the revenue that comes from this country.  We are not in a position to dispute the fact. To me it is significant that it should coincide with the onset of economic recession, from the Cambridgeshire in 1974, which coincided with the oil crisis up to 1975, when the figure barely went over 35.68.  Therefore I am wondering why we should go to such a high figure as 40 per cent.  It would seem to me that if those concerned had the interests of the sweep at heart they would not be inclined to put up the percentage for expenses; they would bring down the prize money to keep it a viable proposition.</P>

      <P>There was no problem at all with regard to the ceiling in existence up to 1973; it was from then on we got on the slippery slope.  In regard to subsections (1) and (2) of section 1, I would like to hear the Minister saying he has all the necessary information available to him.  This provision reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  The balance of the moneys received from the sale of tickets in a sweepstake held under this Act remaining after paying or providing for the prizes distributed in such sweepstake, the expenses incurred in holding such sweepstake, and any duty or tax chargeable in respect of such balance shall be paid to the Hospitals Trust Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1151" /> (2)  The following limitations shall apply in respect of the application of the moneys received from the sale of tickets in a sweepstake held under this Act;</P>
    <P>(a)  the amount applied out of such moneys for paying the expenses incurred in holding such sweepstake (other than</P>
    <P>And this is the part I want to refer to specifically:</P>
    <P>tickets, commission, prizes or other remuneration given in relation to the sale of tickets...</P>
    <P>I and, I am sure, other Members here, would like to be assured that all information in regard to the working of the sweep would be available to the Minister. I cannot go along with Deputy O'Connell when he says that all this information should be made public. We do not have to spend any time talking about the type of operation the sweep is, that in many countries the selling of tickets is illegal, that there is competition.  Whatever chance the sweep has of keeping going in present circumstances, if they publicise the details of their operation we would not be doing them a favour but we would be doing them a very great disfavour.  However, I would be very pleased if the Minister and his Department had not just the information in regard to the details spelled out in the Bill but all information in regard to tickets, commission, prizes or other remuneration given in relation to the sale of tickets.  I fully understand that this information cannot be made public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With all due respects, may I say Deputy O'Connell may be misunderstanding the situation. I am not well up as to how the German sweep operates, but I think they have a different type of operation altogether from ours.  We have a certain type of operation in which we compete with others in countries where we are not allowed to compete. Tickets are sold second, third and fourth hand.  I am sure the Deputy understands the working of the sweep, as well as I do, perhaps better.  There <Col N="1152" /> are people who hold the view that things are a bit loose in regard to section 2 of the Hospitals Act, 1933, but if the Minister had up to date information in regard to all the items in section 1 (2) (a) to which I have referred I believe everybody would be happy and people would not have anxieties or fears that things might not be as they should be.</P>
      <P>We must make up our minds whether we want the hospitals sweepstake to continue.  I am perfectly satisfied&mdash;and I have not been intimated or bullied or subjected to any influence by anybody&mdash;that we are doing the right thing.  The only small doubt is that which has been raised by a couple of Deputies in connection with section 2 of the Hospitals Act, 1933. Under that section the operators of the sweep are not obliged to give this information, but that does not mean that they cannot, should not or would not give it.  We would all be far happier if that information were in the hands of the Minister.</P>

      <P>When the Minister replied to the Second Stage of the debate he devoted about 90 per cent of his speech to what I had said and he became a bit heated about it.  I thought it was rather a pity, because the debate had been conducted up to that in a low key, and I thought it was generally advisable from several points of view that it should be conducted in a low key without provoking people into saying even a fraction of the things they could say.  For that reason, I regret the Minister took the rather abusively critical line he did. He challenged me to say why, if I had misgivings about certain aspects of the sweep, I did not exercise my power not to sign one or other of the schemes and thereby close down the sweep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was well aware that I had that power and was entitled to exercise it if I wanted to.  I debated in my own mind at some length which would be the greater damage I could do.  Should I throw 800 or 1,000 people, nearly all women, on the side of the street? Frequently, they were women who would not get employment anywhere else.  I had to ask myself should I <Col N="1153" /> throw them all on the side of the street in order to keep my conscience right, as the Minister put it, or, instead of that, should I, under protest, sign the scheme and endeavour, as I did for a long period, to get the promoters to provide the full information I wanted?</P>
    <P>I chose what I regard as the more humane course.  I did not put 800 or 900 people on the side of the street; I did not close down the sweep as I could have done and as the Minister is now suggesting I should have done if I was unhappy with aspects of it.</P>

I would not have said that only I am being provoked into saying it by the tone of the Minister's reply. When I say I did not get all the information I required from the promoters I am not saying that I did not get any information.

I got a good deal of information but I did not by any means get all of it.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw Deputy O'Connell's attention to one of the provisions in subsection (2) (a).  Unfortunately, Deputy O'Connell was not here for the full debate.  Had he heard the earlier speeches he might have been clear on some of the points.  The words in parenthesis to which Deputy Collins drew attention, are very significant because the 40 per cent to which the expenses are limited does not include all the expenses set out in parenthesis. In other words, the tickets commission, prizes or other remuneration given in relation to the sale of tickets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, the percentage of expenses is 40 per cent plus all other things in parenthesis.  What the actual percentage of the gross proceeds is I do not know and I cannot know because I do not know what the gross proceeds are.  We have no way in law of finding out what the gross proceeds are.  The reason we cannot find out is that section 2 of the 1933 Act allows all these things to be deducted before arriving at the figure that has to be provided to the auditors to begin work on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained earlier it is important, and the distinction is not frequently drawn by people who discuss the Irish Hospitals Trust expenses, to realise that there are two sets of expenses, the excluded expenses which do not have to be accounted for and the subsequent expenses which are audited and which I am satisfied are in order. However, the point is that there are two sets of expenses and I tried to make this point earlier.  Unfortunately, I did not get any worth-while response from the Minister in relation to that. There is an unascertained and an unascertainable amount of expenses incurred which need not be accounted <Col N="1155" /> for, quite lawfully and legitimately under section 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Publishing the number of tickets sold would solve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That would immediately disclose it but, unfortunately, the Deputy should be aware that if the number of tickets sold is published and also the accounts of the amount received as defined by section 2 are published one can calculate the difference between these two figures.  That is the sort of ground one does not want to go into.  One knows, unfortunately, what happens there in between.  One knows at least what part of that money is spent on and I can see the promoter's point of view when they do not want that figure disclosed.  If they published the number of tickets sold, and published as they do, their proceeds of the sale in accordance with section 2 of the 1933 Act one knows then that the difference between the two figures are these expenses which are incurred for the most part on the continent and North America, sometimes under circumstances that auditors would not wish to have to inquire into or would not be in a position to certify.  With respect to Deputy O'Connell, there is no point in suggesting that the Comptroller and Auditor General be asked to audit all these figures because he could not do it.  He could not audit some of the payments made in North America.  There is no point either in the suggestion of a national lottery as an alternative to the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes.  There are successful national lotteries in a number of countries but in those countries the population is very big and they can finance lotteries out of their own population but our population is so tiny that the Irish Hospitals Trust, or any other lottery that we would promote on a big scale, would be useless unless we could sell the great bulk of the tickets abroad.  In the case of the Hospitals Sweepstake we sell 90 per cent of the tickets abroad, the great bulk in Canada.</P>

      <P>The Minister made the point that the expenses had not been going up in volume or amount, that the proportion of expenses has been going up because the receipts have been dropping very seriously. That is correct.  I demonstrated earlier that less than half of the number of tickets were sold for the Cambridgeshire, 1975 than were sold for the Cambridgeshipe, 1972.  However, one would think that for the promoters the right approach to that kind of situation would be to try to sell more tickets rather than to have to increase their expenses ratio on a diminishing turnover, on a diminishing return from the sale of tickets.  The number of tickets sold has dropped drastically <Col N="1157" /> The figures show that in the Cambridgeshire, 1975, less than half the number of tickets were sold than for the Cambridgeshire, 1972.  Admittedly, in the meantime, the price of the tickets had doubled but there was still a drop in the proceeds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the figure for the returned tickets as audited by Craig Gardner in accordance with section 2 of the Public Hospitals Act.  As I said earlier, those figures are not complete.  This section does not specifically refer to the fact that the share of the fund drops from 40 to 30 per cent, but by implication it causes that because it uses up 70 per cent of the fund in expenses, payments to the Revenue Commissioners and the hospitals.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that it may well be that in a short time to come the whole question of the viability or otherwise of this operation will be called in question and that is certainly so.  I say this to the Minister, although it is more a matter for the promoters, that decreasing the prize money drastically, as is suggested here, may well sound the death knell on the already declining Hospitals Sweep.  We have seen a huge fall off in support over the last few years and to decrease the prize money further may, unless there is a major improvement in sales over the next few years, actually bring about the demise of the sweepstake.  That is a matter which does not have to be considered by the Minister, but if the promoters want it this way and are prepared to take the risk, that is a matter for them.  If the sweepstakes collapse, I presume they had their eyes open when they made the request that their expenses ratio be increased.  From a practical point of view, it may have this effect.  The operation may to some extent be in vain.  While we are endeavouring on a short term basis to save the sweepstake, the very action we are taking may cause its demise in the longer term.</P>

What is provided for here is merely disbursements and receipts in respect of each sweepstake.  The question of reserves would not arise.</P>
      <P>If it were to do with employment, a reserve would have to be realistic. The figures for salaries and wages in respect of one sweep in 1975 amounted to £½ million and for the period this year to another £½ million. The amount involved in the sweep on the Derby was £½ million and the Lincoln £½ million.  There was an aggregate of £2 million and that is not a figure one could have in reserve for any appreciable time.  The whole operation is not a thing that can be guaranteed for any period.  The thing is that the promoters have met the deficit out of their own pockets.</P>

It is too soon to endeavour to make an average.  There is the additional fact that there are proposals for computerisation. In these circumstances it <Col N="1163" /> would seem to be unfair for the promotors to ask for this increase.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The number directly employed is between 700 and 800. There are also a large number of people in advertising agencies, in printing works, perhaps in transport companies whose employment is indirectly affected by the health of this organisation.  I do not know the number of those who are in what the Deputy calls temporary employment. I presume he means people who come in for a number of months, go out and come back again.  I have no break-down of these numbers but I am sure that information could be obtained for the Deputy.  I shall readily make the inquiries for him or he may prefer himself to contact the Workers' Union of Ireland who would have the full break-down of that information.</P>
      <P>As regards the guaranteeing of employment, no commercial company can guarantee anybody's employment. It depends on the state of the market for the company to remain healthy and viable and so long as it remains healthy and viable it will continue to employ people.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for increased penalties for offences under the social welfare code. These offences relate principally to cases in which employers do not comply with their statutory obligations in relation to the payment of social insurance <Col N="1166" /> contributions and in which persons abuse the benefits system.</P>
    <P>Apart from increasing the maximum penalties for existing offences, the Bill contains one or two new provisions which will enable more effective action to be taken against abuses of the system and which will provide a very real deterrent against offences of all kinds.</P>
    <P>The opportunity has also been taken in this Bill to provide for an easement of the residence test for non-contributory old age and blind pension purposes in so far as it affects non-nationals of this country.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains a number of sections of a necessarily technical nature. I hope that the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill has helped Deputies in their consideration of its contents.</P>
    <P>The actual changes which the Bill proposes are not as far-reaching as the text might, perhaps, suggest.  For clarity and convenience it has been necessary for the draftsman to re-enact existing provisions to a very considerable extent.  As part of this process, the opportunity has been taken where possible to bring similar but not necessarily identical provisions in the various schemes into line with each other with a view to simplification. Where a new offence is being created, or a new penalty provided, this fact is specifically referred to in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>I should also like to say that since the Bill was circulated there have been further consultations with the Attorney General's office mainly regarding those provisions of the Bill which deal with the penalties which could be imposed on conviction for offences following summary proceedings. As a result of these consultations and of the advice which I have received a number of drafting amendments of a technical nature, which, however, in no way affect the principles underlying the Bill, have been prepared by the parliamentary draftsman. I shall be circulating these in due course in connection with the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government's intentions in <Col N="1167" /> these areas were announced in the budget statement on 28th January last. I referred to them in some detail in the course of the Second Reading debate on the Social Welfare Bill in March.</P>
    <P>It was indicated on those previous occasions that penalties for abuse, whether by employers or by those claiming benefit, would be increased. The stated purpose of this move was to reflect more accurately in the penalty provisions of the code the large sums of money which can nowadays be involved in such malpractices. In giving notice of this strengthening of the code, great importance was attached to the likely deterrent effect of increased penalties.  The Government's determination to see that those who abuse the system&mdash;thereby defrauding the State and their fellow citizens&mdash;would be prosecuted rigorously was made clear.</P>
    <P>I believe that a number of basic points need to be made at the outset. I said during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill&mdash;and I repeat now&mdash;that the number of cases of abuse, whether by employers or by those claiming benefit, is relatively small.  I have no reason to think that there has been a sudden upsurge in the volume of abuses relating to the various social welfare schemes, though there is disquieting evidence that the incidence of non-compliance&mdash;that is failure by employers to pay social insurance contributions in respect of their employees &mdash;is on the increase.</P>
    <P>I believe that the number of persons, whether employers or beneficiaries, who indulge in these practices is not large when one considers the very large number of persons who, in one way or another, are now involved with the Department of Social Welfare.  There are, at present, approximately 88,000 recorded employers and about 500,000 claimants of the wide range of weekly payments available under either the insurance or assistance schemes together with some 405,000 families in receipt of children's allowances.  In the context of the total expenditure on social welfare benefits and allowances, which this year will <Col N="1168" /> amount to some £430 million, the amount of money which goes astray in these cases is quite small.</P>
    <P>That fact, however, does not make abuses any less serious or any more acceptable.  These offences are antisocial and quite intolerable.</P>
    <P>Since employers and workers as a whole, as well as the general tax-payer, are contributors to the social insurance fund a failure, for example, by an individual employer to meet his liabilities is not something that simply concerns himself and the Department of Social Welfare.  It is also an offence against other employers.  Such abuses often involve an additional, and reprehensible, element when those who fail to stamp the insurance cards of their employees have already collected money from those employees in respect of their contributions.  Here a form of theft is obviously involved.</P>
    <P>Similarly, a claimant who tries to obtain illegally a benefit, pension or other payment to which he has no right, is defrauding his fellow citizens and workmates no less than he is defrauding the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>If the belief were allowed to become widespread that such practices &mdash;however few in number&mdash;were on the increase and were being allowed to go unpunished the effect could be most damaging for the whole social welfare system.  A climate of opinion could be fostered in a relatively short time which would be hostile to the whole programme of development of social welfare provisions upon which this Government has embarked.</P>
    <P>The objective desirability of such development is beyond question, having regard to the needs of so many individuals and groups in our community.  Success in meeting these needs will depend upon a large measure of generous public understanding and support.</P>
    <P>It is apparent that, in recent months, there has been a very considerable volume of public criticism of aspects of the social welfare system.  This criticism, because of its vocal and sensational nature, has been given a great deal of media <Col N="1169" /> attention which has, I believe, tended to put the whole question out of proper perspective.  I have said on more than one occasion that too many of the critics ignore basic facts and that a remarkably high proportion of those who are prepared to identify themselves are not generally renowned for their commitment to the welfare of the poor and disadvantaged. I stand by that.</P>
    <P>Take just one example.  Again and again critics here assailed the pay-related benefit system and have retailed anecdotes about those who are better off on that system than at work.  That is simply not true, and it requires only a primary-school level of mathematical skill, plus the necessary degree of effort, to know what the facts are.  I have clearly explained those facts in this House and Deputies are fully aware of the relationships which exist between pay-related benefit payments and previous earnings.  Only a minority of lower-paid workers with large families can receive more from pay-related benefit than from their earnings at work.  It has also been made clear that the total number of recipients of pay-related benefit is in the region of 35,000 and that, of that number, as many as 33 per cent are receiving the pay-related supplement in respect of sickness benefit or maternity allowances.</P>
    <P>I have explained clearly, on the occasion of the Social Welfare Bill debate in the Dáil that the changes in wage-stop rules announced in the budget related to the effects of the concurrent operation in certain cases of a number of social and fiscal schemes.  These changes resulted from a necessary and desirable review of the working of the various schemes. What was at issue here was something which is a fairly common occurrence in a period of rapid development of social policy programmes.  As the OECD have recently commented in a report on income maintenance policies in member states: &ldquo;And even here it appears that, <i>prima facie</i>, cases of adverse incentive effects&mdash;such as the existence of the poverty trap&mdash;are often the result of the proliferation of <Col N="1170" /> several distinct programmes operated by different agencies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These facts are known, or could be ascertained with the expenditure of a minimum of exertion, and it is most disquieting that people still distort the position.  I cannot avoid the conclusion that a small group of businessmen, officials of sectional organisations and Press columnists are prepared to continue this process of distortion in order to discredit the social welfare system as a whole.  Their protestations of concern for the old and for widows, as opposed to those in receipt of the alleged &ldquo;cushy&rdquo; benefits for the unemployed, are as dishonest as they are unconvincing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent editorial statement in the <i>Irish Independent</i> which put some recent criticism into perspective. Referring to the latest remarks on social welfare payments by the leading spokesman of the Construction Industry Federation, the editorial spelled out the truth about life for the unemployed.  It said that &ldquo;the plain truth about unemployment is that its effects on most men and women is corrosive ... Quite apart from the effect this will have on his own finances it makes an immediate impact on his morale ... the majority of people have too much respect for themselves to be able to feel that life on the dole is `cushy'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I could not agree more and I find the sort of attacks made on the unemployed and on what is done to help them financially both irresponsible and damaging.  The views which I have just quoted apply equally to the comments of the prominent commercial figure who implied recently that the social welfare is part of a communist plot and who asserted that unemployment benefit is bringing about a complete breakdown in the social fabric.  They could also be applied to the newspaper columnist who regularly suggests that almost all the moneys spent by the Department of Social Welfare on aids for the unemployed are spent on drink.  Such contemptible nonsense deserves to be ignored and I would ignored it if it did not have such a dangerous potential.</P>
    <P>I must say that my major concern <Col N="1171" /> about such present criticism is that it may lead to very negative attitudes towards the social welfare system as a whole and towards the recipients of social welfare benefits and allowances. Particularly at a time like the present when economic difficulties lead to high levels of unemployment it is likely that attitudes to the poor will harden. This may happen for two main reasons.</P>
    <P>First of all, there is the impact of taxation which must be imposed in order to meet the cost of the necessary financial provisions for those who have lost their jobs because of the impact of the economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the psychological impact of the insecurity felt by workers in a period of high unemployment which can result in a tendency to suggest that those out of work are in that situation through their own fault.</P>
    <P>Evidence from the experience of this and of other countries indicates that these reactions are common and indeed understandable in periods of recession.  It would be very wrong to give too much weight to what will be a temporary shift in public attitudes. It would be equally wrong to ignore it.</P>
    <P>Given such potentially harmful public comment and the danger of adverse attitudes towards everything that is being done to expand and strengthen the social welfare code, I regard the protection of that code as a major priority at this time.  The provisions of this Bill are therefore designed to underline clearly the determination of the Government to ensure that abuses of the system will be dealt with firmly.</P>
    <P>In the main the penalties for the kinds of offences to which I have been referring have remained substantially unchanged since 1952.  Since then however the amounts which can be involved either by way of contributions or payments have, of course increased enormously, and even making due allowance for changes in the value of money, there is now so much more at stake.</P>
    <P>The weekly contribution rates payable by employers and employees have <Col N="1172" /> been raised, in line with the very substantial increases in the level of benefits under the social insurance code.  Benefits themselves have been increased, in the past three years, by between 92 and 110 per cent.  Failure to pay contributions due, even for a short period, can lead to a very considerable debt.</P>
    <P>Coupled with this are the economic difficulties and rising costs with which employers have been faced which might lead some to assume, mistakenly, that their problems could be eased or mitigated by evading their statutory liabilities in regard to social welfare contributions.  The temptation for an employer to avoid payment of contributions or for a claimant to take a chance by fraudulently seeking a benefit or other payment to which he has no legal right is now so much the greater.</P>
    <P>The deterrents must therefore be such as will simply ensure that it is not worth while to do such things in future.  I believe that the deterrents provision in this Bill will have the desired effect.</P>
    <P>The penalties normally provided under present legislation are a maximum of £50 or, if the court sees fit, imprisonment for up to three months, or both fine and imprisonment. Furthermore, the Acts provide only for summary convictions in the lower courts.  Such a level of penalties and also the limitation to summary proceedings are now quite inadequate, having regard to the very large sums of money which can be involved by way of unpaid contributions and the relatively substantial amounts which are concerned in the case of benefit or assistance wrongfully obtained.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to deal effectively with these offences by providing a two-tier system in relation to proceedings.</P>
    <P>Where the offence is such that it can be dealt with by summary proceedings in the lower courts a maximum fine of £500 or up to one year's imprisonment, or both, is being substituted for the existing penalties.  The effect of this proposal is that these courts will be able to impose penalties <Col N="1173" /> up to what I am advised represents the full limit of their powers.</P>
    <P>Where an offence is particularly serious, perhaps involving a large number of employees and many thousands of pounds in unpaid contributions and it would be inappropriate that it should be dealt with in this way, the Bill allows for proceedings on indictment.  In this case, the maximum penalties which may be imposed are a fine of up to £2,000 or up to two years' imprisonment or both as the court may decide.</P>
    <P>While deterrents of this kind may be very effective against individual employers, I think that something more is required in the case of limited companies. Under the law as it stands such companies can, of course, be prosecuted for failure to pay contributions or for other offences.  While an employer can have the full weight of the law invoked against him however, including, if necessary, the ultimate sanction of a jail sentence, a limited company obviously cannot be punished in this way.  The Bill makes provision for this by making the directors and officers of a limited company personally liable and punishable for offences committed by the company unless it can be shown that they were unaware of the offence and had taken reasonable steps to prevent it occurring.</P>
    <P>A further weakness in the law so far as limited companies are concerned is that companies which have made deductions from employees' wages towards payment of social insurance contributions often go out of business either without having actually used the money deducted for the intended purpose or having diverted it to some other purpose.  This can also happen in the case of individual employers. That money, which is of course properly speaking the employees' property and not the employer's then frequently becomes swallowed up in the general assets of the company or individual concerned and is lost to the social insurance fund except in so far as it may be partially covered by the limited preferences provided for in the Acts.  The Bill therefore makes special provision to enable money deducted <Col N="1174" /> in this way to be recovered in full in preference to all other debts.</P>
    <P>There is unfortunately disturbing evidence that offences involving already used or stolen insurance stamps are on the increase.  Reports of burglaries frequently include a reference to the theft of insurance stamps or stamped insurance cards.  Another feature in recent years has been the emergence of forged or counterfeit stamps, often of high technical quality.  There are no specific provisions in social insurance legislation under which a person involved in the use of forged stamps can be summarily charged.  It is already an offence to affix an already used stamp to an insurance card.  This Bill makes it an additional offence to use forged or counterfeit stamps or insurance cards&mdash;experience has shown that persons who use stolen stamps frequently resort to forged ones also.</P>
    <P>Such practices must be firmly discouraged and with this in view all offences of this kind are being made subject to the same heavily increased penalties to which I have already referred. Distinguishing between a genuine stamp and a forged one need present no problem to employers&mdash;insurance stamps should be purchased only through a post office in the normal way.</P>
    <P>One of the most effective means which the Department have at their disposal to ensure that the law regarding the payment of contributions is complied with is the power of inspection of premises and documents. The vast majority of employers are prepared to co-operate to the full with my Department's inspectors.  A small minority however is not above using every available loophole to obstruct the Department's inspectors in carrying out their statutory duties.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes therefore to make it easier for an inspector to deal with such cases by widening the definition of the premises or places to which he can gain access in the course of an inspection.  The widened definition will include any premises or places where the inspector has reasonable grounds for believing that insurance <Col N="1175" /> cards or other relevant documents are being kept.</P>
    <P>In looking at this whole area of noncompliance one question arises which is of concern to many workers.  This is the right of the employee to inspect his or her social insurance card in order to ensure that it is fully stamped up-to-date.</P>
    <P>I want to state clearly that every insured person has that right and that an employer cannot legitimately refuse to provide his employees with appropriate means to exercise it.</P>
    <P>However, representations have been made to me seeking the creation of a situation in which groups of employees could entrust their rights in this matter to their trade union representatives.  I am having this matter studied in my Department and I hope that it may be possible to arrive at a satisfactory outcome. It is clearly of great importance that employees should be facilitated in such a fundamental issue of information which relates to their rights, and to their money.</P>
    <P>So far I have only been dealing with offences committed by employers but I would not like it to be thought that this Bill is aimed exclusively at them or that they are the only persons who are guilty of abuses of the social insurance and assistance schemes.</P>
    <P>Though I have stated my conviction that the extent of fraudulent claiming is nothing like as widespread as is commonly believed, the incidence of fraudulent claiming&mdash;for example concurrent working and signing of the unemployed register&mdash;and the amounts of money which can be involved are sufficient to warrant equally severe penalties on conviction.  The Bill will therefore also allow the fraudulent claiming or receipt of any benefit or assistance to be punished by fines of up to £500 or one year's imprisonment or both on summary conviction.</P>
    <P>In an extreme case, where the offence is of a particularly serious nature, the Bill provides for proceedings on indictment, fines of up to £2,000 on conviction and prison sentences of up to two years or both fine and imprisonment.</P>
    <P>As an additional deterrent the Bill <Col N="1176" /> also provides for the application in the case of other forms of benefits, allowances, pensions and assistance of the disqualification, at present applicable only to unemployment benefit and assistance, for receipt of the payment concerned for a period of six months following a conviction.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also making it more difficult for persons to escape prosecution where a benefit, allowance, pension or assistance was paid on the basis of false information.  In such cases it will be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the person concerned knew the information was false and intended to defraud the Department. I think Deputies will agree that this is a reasonable assumption and a necessary precaution, especially since my Department has gone to considerable lengths during the past two or three years, through various forms of publicity, to emphasise statutory rights of claimants.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that people are now more aware than ever before of what social benefits are available to them; of the conditions attaching to such benefits; and of their rights in these respects.  Again it has been made easier than ever before through simplification of forms and procedures for persons to seek their rights.  Unfortunately, making it easier for the ordinary honest claimant&mdash;the great majority I can say&mdash;also makes it easier for the small minority of dishonest claimants so that provision of the kind to which I have referred becomes necessary as a consequence.</P>
    <P>It will also be more difficult when the Bill becomes law for offenders to escape prosecution through lapse of time.  In general the various Acts provide at present that proceedings must be commenced within 12 months of the commission of the offence.  An exception is the unemployment assistance scheme where the period is only six months.  There is provision in both cases however for extending the period by a certificate given under ministerial seal.</P>
    <P>Many of the offences in respect of which charges should be brought through no fault of the Department do not come to notice, however, for long periods after their commission. <Col N="1177" /> For example, very often it is the case that it is not until a claim for benefit is being made that it emerges that cards have not been stamped. Similarly, it may not come to light that used or forged stamps have been made use of or that an employee has been working while drawing unemployment benefit until the cards have been surrendered and examined.  The surrender of cards may be delayed for many months after the year to which they relate.  The ordinary time limit for taking proceedings is, therefore, being extended to two years in all cases, including unemployment assistance. A uniform method of extending this period by certificate under ministerial seal is also being adopted, this being, with a slight modification, the method already applicable in unemployment assistance cases.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, the opportunity has been taken in the Bill to bring about a degree of uniformity among the various schemes where these differ at present, in so far as provisions for offences and proceedings are concerned. For example, the Social Welfare Act, 1952, provided power, in relation to the various social insurance schemes, to provide in regulations for offences and penalties.  This power was also availed of in relation to the assistance schemes which came into being since then.  No similar power, however, exists in so far as the earlier assistance schemes, such as the non-contributory old age pension scheme and the windows' and orphans' pensions scheme and also the unemployment assistance scheme are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides similar power in relation to these latter schemes, though the level of penalties is being confined to those applicable in summary proceedings only, the higher levels being regarded as inappropriate to the kind of offences which would be involved in such regulations.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill includes an amendment which has nothing to do with offences, proceedings or penalties. This relates to the residence test for non-contributory old age, and blind, pensions.  Deputies will no doubt be already aware that this test requires that in order to qualify for an old age <Col N="1178" /> pension a person must have resided in the State for a total period of at least 15 years of which at least five years were subsequent to the attainment of age 50.</P>
    <P>In the case of a person who is not an Irish citizen the five years must have been a continuous period preceding the date of the claim.  For a blind pension&mdash;the minimum qualifying age for which is 21 years&mdash;the pensioner must have resided here for five years since attaining the age of 10 years in the case of an Irish citizen and a total of 15 years in the case of other persons.</P>
    <P>Since 1st April, 1973, following our accession to the EEC, we have been obliged under the articles of accession to afford the same treatment as far as these residence tests are concerned to nationals of the other member states and also to refugees and stateless persons as we afford to our own citizens.  In other words, such persons have been treated the same as Irish nationals for the purpose of these residence tests.  There seems little point, therefore, in maintaining this discrimination against non-nationals but, in any event, the abolition of such a distinction would be required in the context of international conventions on social security.  The changes proposed in the Bill, which I have no doubt will be welcomed by Deputies, have the effect of making the residence tests concerned the same for both nationals and non-nationals.</P>
    <P>These then are the main features of the Bill now before the House. Bearing in mind the contributions made and the views expressed, on all sides of the House, when the question of abuses was discussed during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, I feel confident that Deputies will give this measure speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <P>It is in the interest of everyone who believes in the necessity of continuing improvement of the social welfare system to ensure that any possible basis for criticism of that system is removed.  Equally, it is vital that it should be recognised that offences against the social welfare code are <Col N="1179" /> among the most serious and antisocial of all misdeeds.</P>
    <P>I feel that it is necessary to spell out again the role and the importance of social welfare provision in a modern community.</P>
    <P>What we are attempting to develop is a comprehensive and efficient social welfare system which can cope with the immediate financial needs of individuals and groups in need and, at the same time, provide for the solution of a range of more long term social problems, such as those of the aged, the widowed, the handicapped and the disabled.  Beyond these goals lies the prospect of a system capable of mobilising the resources of society for the task of eliminating the causes of disadvantage and poverty in society.  This will involve a positive redistribution of income as between age groups, occupational groups and regional groups.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, obvious that the social welfare system must be based on a number of intrinsic elements. These include the full recognition of the dignity of every individual; the fostering of the rights of both individual and family units; and the development of absolute openness and accessability in the working of the system.</P>
    <P>Such considerations make the need to bring into the Dáil legislative proposals such as those contained in the present Bill most painful.  There is always a danger that the need to defend and protect the integrity of the code and the money of both contributors and taxpayers will lead to the creation of a negative and distasteful atmosphere in the whole operation of social welfare.  This I am determined to avoid.  But it must be recognised that there is a continual dilemma in designing anti-abuse methods while, at the same time, seeking to open up the system and to improve relations between client and the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I believe very strongly that the eventual balance in this area will depend to a great extent upon the level of public attitudes to social welfare. In introducing this Bill I am reiterating my determination, and that of the Government, to eliminate abuse.  I <Col N="1180" /> can, therefore, ask at this time for two things from the public and from the media.</P>
    <P>Firstly, the success of these new means will depend on public co-operation. There is no point in people criticising the system on the basis of anecdotes and totally unsubstantiated allegations. If individuals or organisations have evidence of abuses of any kind they have an absolute civic duty to inform my Department of all the relevant details.  The time has come to forget the age-old Irish tradition of not helping the authorities while at the same time attacking them for laxness.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I repeat that the facts about the working of the social welfare system are known and publicised. I appeal to all commentators and critics to take the trouble to ascertain those facts before they comment or criticise.</P>
    <P>Naturally, my earnest wish would be that the undoubtedly severe penalties which this Bill provides for would never have to be imposed.  That, I suppose, is to hope for an ideal world in which everyone would act responsibly without such compulsion.</P>
    <P>Failing that, however, I hope that the measure will be taken as a warning by all those who may be engaged in or contemplating practices of this kind, or those who, while they would not, on the personal level, dream of defrauding a business colleague or a neighbour, see no harm in such things just because public and not private money is involved.  To such persons I would say that it is the determination of the Government that the powers and penalties provided in the Bill will be used to the fullest extent.  It is with confidence, therefore, that I recommend the Bill to Dáil Éireann for favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare on the manner in which the Second Reading speech has been drafted.  It is a gem of its kind in the context in which we on this side of the House have been urging the Dáil to introduce comprehensibility and understanding into the legislation which <Col N="1181" /> comes before the House.  Unfortunately, that is where my praise ends because, although the brief is generous in relation to detail and so on, it bears little relationship to the Bill which is one of the most convoluted and confused pieces of legislation ever to come before the House.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told us that people are becoming more aware of their social entitlements but I suspect that if any of those people should read the speech that has been presented to us they would have legislative nightmares.  It is not good enough to say that people are reaching a better understanding of their social welfare entitlements if, at the same time, there is before the House a speech which, to all those Deputies concerned with the area of social welfare, presents a serious challenge in so far as an understanding of the Bill is concerned.  The Parliamentary Secretary rightly apologises for the fact that there is need for a number of drafting amendments and he tells us that these will be tabled before the Bill reaches Committee Stage.  It is not our practice on this side of the House to engage in criticism of parliamentary draftsmen.  These people are not here to defend themselves.  It has always been my view that Deputies should not attack public servants.  Consequently, my criticism in regard to the problems of comprehending the Bill are not directed at these people.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told us that he has had further consultations with the Attorney General's office regarding those provisions of the Bill which deal with the penalties which could be imposed on conviction following summary proceedings.  He went on to point out that as a result of these consultations and of advice he has received the Bill requires a number of drafting amendments of a technical nature.  Before we consider tabling amendments it would be very helpful if these ministerial amendments could be made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that.  There are a number of matters in the Bill in respect of which discussion at this stage would not be proper but I am confident that the Chair will allow me to refer briefly to a couple of matters which concern us on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>This Bill may be considered by some to be draconian having regard to the raising of fines from £50 to £500 in one section, the increasing of the term of imprisonment from three months to 12 months and for conviction on indictment where the offence was not in existence before there is a fine not exceeding £2,000 or a term in prison not exceeding two years or both fine and imprisonment. These penalties are very severe but our real concern is that this may be another piece of law and order &ldquo;sunburstery&rdquo; from this Coalition Government and it poses the question of whether it is an indication of their will and their wish to appear to be all things to all men and women in the law and order sense.  As spokesman on social welfare for my party I was the one who tabled parliamentary questions in May last with this Bill specifically in mind.  These questions are reported at columns 13 and 14 of the Official Report for 25th May, 1976.  The first of these, question No. 10, for that day asked:</P>
      <P>the Minister for Social Welfare the amount of moneys sought to be recovered by way of prosecutions or otherwise by his Department for abuse of the social welfare code for the years 1973, 1974 and 1975.</P>
      <P>Question No. 11 asked:</P>
      <P>the Minister for Social Welfare the number of prosecutions for abuses of the social welfare code for the years 1973, 1974 and 1975; and the number of prosecutions in the years 1973, 1974 and 1975 which were dismissed at the conclusion of the individual proceedings.</P>
      <P>The next question asked:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the Minister for Social Welfare the number of persons fined, and the amount of the fines in each <Col N="1183" /> case, for abuses of the social welfare code for the years 1973, 1974 and 1975.</P>
    <P>Question No. 13 asked:</P>
    <P>the Minister for Social Welfare the amount of moneys recovered, arising from abuses of the social welfare code, for the years 1973, 1974 and 1975.</P>
    <P>The next question asked:</P>
    <P>the Minister for Social Welfare if he will give a detailed statement of the number of prosecutions for abuses of the social welfare code under all the various headings of entitlement for the years 1973, 1974 and 1975.</P>
    <P>The final question in that series asked:</P>
    <P>the Minister for Social Welfare the numbers of persons sentenced to a term of imprisonment for abuses of the social welfare code and the length of the term of imprisonment in each case for the years 1973, 1974 and 1975.</P>
    <P>In his usual courteous fashion the Parliamentary Secretary replied to the questions by stating that with the permission of the Chair he proposed to take Questions Nos. 10 to 14 together and that as the reply was in the form of a tabular statement he would circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and it was much appreciated.  However, the Parliamentary <Col N="1184" /> Secretary will remember from his days in opposition that to reply to questions in this way gives Deputies very little opportunity of asking supplementary questions especially when the detail in the tabular statement is of such complexity as was the case in this instance.  In these circumstances I am sure he will appreciate the necessity to dwell a little on those questions now that this opportunity has arisen.</P>
      <P>The information given in the tabular statement was very frank and revealing. For instance in relation to children's allowances in 1973, the number of prosecutions was nil and neither was there any dismissal.  The number of persons fined was nil and nil was the reply, too, to the questions regarding the number of persons sent to prison and the amount of money sought to be recovered.  For 1974 we were told that the number of prosecutions under this heading was one and that there was no case of dismissal.</P>
