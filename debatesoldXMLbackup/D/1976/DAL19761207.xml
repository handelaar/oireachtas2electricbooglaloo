Further, is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that 40 per cent of the people the association expected to interview had left the area?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the national average of unemployment is 12 per cent but among school leavers in Ballyfermot it is 23 per cent?  I want to know what will be done about this matter.  Will these people be condemned to the dole queues for the rest of their lives?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach and Minister for Defence</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos 3, 4 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with long-established policy, fishery protection is one of the peace-time tasks assigned to my Department. No change in this arrangement is proposed.  The question of the expansion and adaptation of both the <Col N="6" /> Naval Service and the Air Corps so as to meet any increased fishery protection requirements which may arise as a result of the extension of the State's exclusive fishery limits is under consideration at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the proposed development in fisheries and having regard to the fact that at the moment the fishery protection service is more or less a naval operation, will the Taoiseach not accept that it is necessary to have a separate organisation to deal solely with fishery protection? Have the Government given any consideration to this aspect of the fishery protection service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question of fishery protection is at present being examined in the light of the proposed extension of fishery limits as and from 1st January next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I heard the Taoiseach correctly.  Did he say that there were no proposals to have a further extension in the existing operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I said that in accordance with long-established policy, fishery protection is one of the peace-time tasks assigned to my Department and that no change is proposed in this arrangement.  However, the matter of the extent of the protection in view of the extended fishery limit area is under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not accept that there is a necessity to set up a separate unit apart from the naval defence structure we have to deal with fishery protection?  For instance, I would cite what is happening in Iceland where they have a separate coastguard service dealing entirely with fishery protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated, the whole matter is under examination as to how it can best be done. However, there is no proposal to change the fact that fishery protection is one of the tasks assigned to the Department of Defence.  Merely changing the responsibility does not mean it would be any more effective.</P>

    <Col N="7" />
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what has been happening in the last few days with the huge flotilla of boats from EEC countries and from Russia, will the Taoiseach not accept that there is need for some immediate action to deal with this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Foreign Ministers of the EEC considered certain aspects of this matter and agreed on a resolution on 30th October which recognised the need for protection and the necessity for control of the fishing zone.  They agreed that the implementation of available means of surveillance or those to be foreseen must be accompanied by appropriate measures to ensure that the charges for such protection are shared equitably.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that paratroopers have been dispensed with by the German Army since the Battle of Crete and by Britain and America since the Battle of Arnhem is it now proposed that we will develop this out-moded type of approach to the Defence Forces?  Surely the position in relation to tactical training is that troop-carrying helicopters should be purchased to carry out the exercises that might be carried out by paratroopers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will disregard the benefit of board and lodging as means in respect of young people who apply for unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by an applicant, such as free or partly free board and lodging, is one of the items which, under the relevant statutory provisions, must be taken into account by deciding officers and appeals officers in the assessment of means of applicants for unemployment assistance and there is no power to disregard this or any other assessable item in particular cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that so many people are being disallowed simply because they are living at home while waiting for employment, will the Parliamentary Secretary consider introducing amending legislation so that the question of the board and lodgings which they can get in their homes from their parents will not be assessed against them to disqualify them for unemployment assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, this has been the practice for some considerable time.  It is not a new innovation.  Each case is treated on its individual merits so there is no overall approach to it.  Each case is assessed individually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Allowing for the fact that it may have been the practice for some time, I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that the matter has become much more critical because of the number of young people who have to stay at home with their parents while they are looking for employment? Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that it seems to be almost against the concept of what we hold for the family that if a young man were turned out of his home he would qualify?  Because this person stays at home with no income his food and accommodation are assessed as income to disqualify him for unemployment assistance.  Is there not a conflict there?  If this young person was living on his own and turned out of his home by his family, he would be entitled to unemployment assistance but because he is living with his family he is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is not changed.  It is the same as it has been for quite a considerable time.  As I explained to the Deputy, there is no overall approach to this.  Each particular case is assessed individually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Allowing for that, I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will recognise that in a number of cases the actual assessment for board and lodgings is made at £10 or £11 which is in excess of the income and <Col N="13" /> those people are disqualified.  In view of the number of unemployed people who have finished school who are now staying at home&mdash;that situation has changed&mdash;does the Parliamentary Secretary not think it is appropriate to change the statutory provisions so that the benefit of board and lodgings, if not ignored, is assessed as income in some way to allow the person to qualify?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained to the Deputy, there are cases where the deciding officer or the appeals officer would consider it appropriate that only a very nominal sum would be taken into consideration in regard to free board and lodgings, depending on the individual circumstances of the case.  There is no uniform assessment as such.  All the relevant factors of the case are taken into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if it is proposed to alter the social welfare regulations whereby voluntary contributors are denied title to disability benefit, occupational injury benefit, unemployment benefit, maternity benefit and dental and optical benefit; and, if so, when.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>A person can become a voluntary contributor only where he ceases to be insurably employed and has 156 contributions paid as an employed contributor.  Since the coming into operation of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, a voluntary contributor is not entitled to the benefits referred to by the Deputy, except for a limited period after ceasing to be an employed contributor, and the reduced contribution he pays reflects this position.</P>
      <P>If the social insurance system covered the whole working population the need for voluntary insurance would virtually disappear.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the question of extending social insurance to the self-employed is currently under examination in my Department, and in these circumstances I do not propose to alter the existing provisions on the lines suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not think the time has come to alter the system?  Quite a number of the voluntary contributors are still on the books and they are being deprived of these benefits. In fact, I should have framed the question in another way and asked what they are entitled to.  It seems very little is left for them.  Some people are suffering gravely because of this omission from the scheme. Could the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="17" /> tell me approximately when he hopes to be able to announce their total inclusion in the social welfare code? In the budget perhaps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, an examination is being made within the Department into the question of the publication of a Green Paper on insurance for the self-employed.  I appreciate the statement made by the Deputy.  I am aware of the serious curtailment of social insurance coverage.  We have made considerable progress in this area over the past three-and-a-half years.  Some tens of thousands of people have been brought within the code who were excluded prior to that. There is a large problem representing something like 31 per cent of the population who fall into the category of self-employed, and it is desirable that coverage should be extended to them as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together. It is estimated that the scheme will cost the Exchequer about £2 million on capital and subsidy in 1977.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each local housing authority to decide whether or not to provide a supplementary subsidy under the scheme.  If all housing authorities decide to pay the subsidy, the cost in 1977 will be between £50,000 and £75,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the capital for the scheme will be drawn from the allocation for local <Col N="19" /> authority housing, and noting the fact that hundreds fewer local authority houses were built in the first nine months of 1976 as compared with the corresponding period in 1975, would the Minister agree that there will be an even greater fall in the number of local authority houses built in future as a result of the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>My object and the object of the Government is to house people who need rehousing.  It is surprising to hear Deputy Faulkner asking that question.  It is about 12 months since a comment was made from those benches that, in relation to the number of houses we were building, too many local authority houses were being built.  It appears Deputy Faulkner would like to have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would assume that when local authority houses are built they are built for people to live in them.  Will the Minister reply to Question No. 18 which he said he included in the reply but to which he has not replied, that is, if he will state where the local authorities will obtain money to subsidise the low-rise mortgage scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the local authorities will raise the money in the same way as they raise money for anything else.  Deputy Faulkner should be aware of that.  That is the reason we built so many houses; we built nearly 9,000 last year.  Deputy Faulkner must be aware also that the best his party could do was slightly over 4,000.  Therefore, I cannot for the life of me understand what he is beefing about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a rather peculiar reply for the Minister to say that he would assume that local authorities would raise the money in some way or other.  Seeing that the Minister has proposed that local authorities subsidise the low-rise mortgage rates, does he intend that local authorities would raise this money through the rates?</P>

      <P>Yes.

      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that that is a most extraordinary statement because I had no difficulty in getting them.

      <P>If Deputy Faulkner got the information he says he got, I do not know why he put down the question. I can assure him that my officials advised me that it is not possible to get the information.  Since it is not possible to get the information, I cannot give it to the House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The information I received was from a small number of local authorities.  The question I put down here related to all local authorities.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A judgment on this matter would necessarily be strongly influenced by factors other than the family income and I am not prepared to specify a hard and fast minimum income which would apply in all circumstances. In a recent circular issued by my Department in regard to the new low-rise mortgage scheme local authorities were advised that &ldquo;a person shall be disqualified in so far as financial circumstances are concerned unless the local authority has established that persons generally of similar means would not normally have a prospect of a loan at the time from a building society or other financial institution&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the present maximum qualifying income limit for an SDA loan is £45 a week?  Therefore one might assume that, in the Minister's opinion, an income of £45 a week is sufficient to permit a young family to cater for its housing needs.  Might I ask the Minister, therefore, if loans under this scheme will be confined to those with incomes of less than £45 a week.</P>

      <P>If I thought Deputy Faulkner was correct I would not have introduced the new scheme.  It was to deal with exactly the situation to which Deputy Faulkner referred&mdash;because people on low incomes were not <Col N="26" /> able to get a loan big enough to buy their houses&mdash;this new scheme was introduced.</P>

      <P>Following the last revision of Dublin Corporation's waiting list for rehousing, which was completed in November, 1972, there were 5,307 approved applicants on the list. The corporation's progress reports show that they rehoused 10,587 families between the 30th November, 1972 and the 31st October, 1976. Following their adoption of a revised scheme of letting priorities based on a points system, they are now in the process of revising their waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin County Council do not maintain a general approved waiting list for rehousing.  Approved applicants are listed for individual housing areas.  I understand that the total of <Col N="27" /> applicants approved by the council, for rehousing, at 30th September, 1976, was of the order of 2,000.  While Dún Laoghaire Corporation do not maintain an approved waiting list I understand that a total of about 670 applicants has been approved by them for rehousing.</P>
    <P>Information is not available in my Department as to the family sizes of housing applicants in the Dublin area. It is not possible for me, therefore, to indicate, at this stage, how many families in the area would qualify under the low-rise mortgage scheme. Local authorities have been requested, as a matter of urgency, to bring the new scheme to the notice of persons likely to qualify, including persons approved for rehousing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider advising local authorities to extend the waiting list thereby enabling lots of young couples who would not qualify for weekly tenancy houses to qualify under the new low mortgage scheme?  As Deputy Faulkner pointed out, at the moment it is of little help to most people who are pressed for houses.  It will help the people who have flats or houses already but not the people without them.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation feel that so few will qualify for it that they are putting forward a very small amount of money towards it for next year.  The Minister could advise them to open the waiting list to take in people who have no houses at the moment so that the scheme could be of some benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people who have no houses at the moment must qualify under this scheme and even if half of the 2,000 who are listed on the Dublin Corporation list qualify for the scheme Deputy Moore will agree that it is a very good step forward.  While the scheme is not perfect&mdash;it has not been tried yet&mdash;I am quite satisfied that it will be of great help to many people. <Col N="28" /> I would ask Deputies to be a little more considerate and to give it a chance.  It is obvious that an effort is being made to knock the scheme before it gets off the ground.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore and some other people seem to have forgotten that last year Dublin Corporation got £12.7 million to re-house people.  This year I added an additional £11 million to make it £23.7 million for re-housing.  If people leave houses to be re-housed under this scheme houses will be available for others.  Deputy Moore does not seem to appreciate that.  This will be an improvement in spite of all the criticisms which some people in the Opposition are prepared to throw at it.  This scheme is well worth while.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner will have to answer that himself.  It seems to be one of those impossible questions.

      <P>Deputy Faulkner misunderstands the situation.  When people apply for local authority housing a file is opened for them in a local authority office.  Subsequently their applications are examined and it is decided whether they will be approved although the houses may not be available for them.  When houses become available there is an advertisement and they must apply again but they are on the approved waiting list, having applied and having being considered eligible to stay there.  Sometimes they are on that list for up to seven years, as Deputy Lynch said last year, before they are re-housed.  We have pulled that down considerably since, although people, particularly in the Dublin area, are on the list for quite a long time.  Once they are on that file they are considered eligible for loans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if his Department have any proposals to help blind people to use pedestrian crossings and traffic light crossings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the problem of handicapped people in coping with traffic and I am glad to receive suggestions to this end.  The <Col N="30" /> only suggestion made to my Department was that audible signals should be provided in pedestrian lights to help blind people to cross the road where such lights are provided.  Preliminary examination has indicated that while there may be advantages in this system there would also be serious disadvantages.  However, I intend to keep the matter under review having regard to experience of its use in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this involve a &ldquo;bleep&rdquo; signal at these crossings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, in a number of countries various types of signals for blind people have been tried and that is one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say what the success rate has been in the countries where these signals have been tried?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot tell exactly but there have been fatal accidents at a number of them because of malfunctions in the signals while a blind person was on the crossing.  One of the worst aspects is that it may create a false sense of security for the blind person who feels that once the &ldquo;bleep&rdquo; goes he may walk out. Sometimes the buzzer continues to operate while the red light is on.  This happened in a number of cases in one country and caused a lot of trouble. Such a signal would need to be fairly loud and it could be a source of annoyance to residents in the area especially at night-time.  The introduction of this might result in a lessening of assistance being rendered to blind people.  In Ireland, particularly in Dublin, blind people get more assistance in crossing the streets than anywhere else I know of.  However, I will continue to consider it to see if something can be done.  I appreciate the problem but it is not as easy as it might seem.</P>

      <P>Where community halls are shown in the valuation lists by the Commissioner of Valuations as being occupied for charitable purposes, they are exempt from rates.  As to other cases, while the subject can be considered as part of a general review of the rates system, there are provisions in the existing law which enable local authorities to assist in the provision and maintenance of community halls. For example, local authorities have powers of a general nature under the Local Government Acts, 1941 and 1955, and under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, whereby they can assist in the provision and maintenance of community halls.  There are other relevant provisions in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963. It is open to local authorities to use the existing powers available to them in such a way as to ease the burden of rates in whole or in part in appropriate cases.</P>

There are some halls which could be proved to be used for charitable purposes and, consequently, could be derated.  However, this is a matter which must start at local level and be dealt with there but if for any reason the problem cannot be solved at that level it should be taken up with the Department of Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I referred to the fact that the two Members who had spoken on this side of the House on this measure were very much involved in that both Shannon and Dublin Airports were situated in the hearts of their constituencies.  Since then a new Minister has been appointed to the Department of Transport and Power and it is only proper that I should take this opportunity of congratulating Deputy Fitzpatrick on his appointment as Minister for Transport and Power.  He was Minister for Lands since the inauguration of this particular Dáil and in that capacity I never clashed with him and I do not expect I shall have any occasion to do so now.  I wish him well.  I hope the Department will prosper under his direction and I look forward to the Opposition co-operating with him to the fullest possible extent in his endeavours to ensure progress in his Department.  I trust he will be in a position to say more about this measure when he comes to reply than his predecessor was when he introduced the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two Deputies from this side of the House who have already contributed in this debate spoke very much from an internal knowledge of the workings of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta.  I have not the advantage of <Col N="65" /> having the headquarters of either Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta operating within my constituency; nevertheless, I feel I can speak on this measure with some practical experience as a traveller and offering some criticism, look objectively at the position in which Aer Lingus find themselves at present.</P>
    <P>In introducing the measure the then Minister for Transport and Power drew attention to the fact that this Bill is an amendment of the Air Companies (Amendment) Act, 1969, which at that time raised the limit of borrowing from £24 million to its present level of £50 million.  This measure proposes to increase that ceiling by a further £25 million.  The Minister went on to say that the increased borrowing facility that this Bill provides was not required by the air companies immediately but that the measure was necessary because of the unsettled state of the world capital market at present, and that he wanted both Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta to be in a position to negotiate loan facilities as they became available.</P>
    <P>While I accept that this is what we might call permissive legislation, it is wrong for the Minister to say here that he is proposing to raise the ceiling by 50 per cent above the present ceiling without giving the House some idea of the necessity for this capital expenditure.  The Minister gave us a small piece of information when he indicated that one of the things that created the necessity for this provision was that facilities for two other loans, for £6 million and £12,500,000 were now in the course of finalisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> 12,500,000 dollars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am sorry, 12,500,000 dollars.  If we wait long enough it will be the same thing. Roughly that amounts to £14 million. It was remiss of the Minister to assume that the House would know what this money was being spent on.  When the 1969 measure was being introduced the Minister of the day stated that the raising of the ceiling from £24 million to £50 million was necessitated by the anticipitated requirements of Aer Lingus leading towards the acquisition of the two 747s and subsequently <Col N="66" /> the eight 737s.  Perhaps somebody from the Government side could say at this stage that Aer Lingus should never have bought the Jumbos, but the Minister makes no reference whatever to that.  Here we are told Aer Lingus are finalising proposals for spending £14,500,000 presumably in respect of capital development, but we are not told what it is.  Is it another hotel?  I would like the Minister to give us some idea what this money is for.</P>
      <P>Maybe my colleague, Deputy Barrett, knows; maybe the information is contained in the annual report.  I take some time off to read the Sunday and daily papers in an effort to keep in touch with things.  The Minister for Labour was criticising our party leader for trying to keep in touch with things and expressing amazement that Deputy Jack Lynch had time to read the papers.  It would appear that the Minister for Labour spends too much time reading the papers, but that is not relevant to this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the then Minister for Transport and Power should have asked this House on the 11th November to sanction the raising of the ceiling by an additional £25 million without telling us what the projection was.  He did go so far as to say: &ldquo;We do not want it at present.  It is only to enable us to negotiate the loans.&rdquo;  I cannot recall under any previous government an arrangement whereby the House was asked to vote a blank cheque, and technically that is what we are asked to do here.  I hope the new Minister will take the opportunity of informing us in general what are the capital spending proposals of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta. Maybe it is only a minor amount; all the better if it is.  Apparently, we have reached the limit of £50 million and they cannot involve themselves in another £1 million expenditure without having the ceiling raised.  If that is the answer, that is all right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right, but on the second question, I think the House is entitled to know the purpose of the two loans amounting to <Col N="67" /> £14,500,000 which are being finalised. I mentioned a moment ago that an additional £26 million was provided in 1969 for the purpose of increasing the fleet, including the two Boeing 747s.  There was a certain amount of criticism of Aer Lingus earlier this year, and Deputy Burke said Aer Lingus was being wrongly criticised in that they found it necessary, due to slackness at one stage to hire out their own Jumbo and subsequently, when things began to boom, if that is the correct expression for it, to hire a similar aircraft from Alitalia.  It would be improper to criticise them in that regard in view of the fact that the company had net losses of £5 million in each of the last two years. That is alarming.  I accept that we have a world situation but it is alarming that whenever we have a coalition government these world situations are generated.  State-sponsored boards, like Aer Lingus, which were running smoothly suddenly experience a loss. That is a dear price to pay for coalition government and over the last three years we have all had experience of the price we must pay for coalition.</P>
      <P>I find it most upsetting to think that in the booming sixties the UK and continental routes were not as remunerative for Aer Lingus as the North Atlantic route.  The company made most profit on that route.  It is unfortunate that it is that end of the company's business that is now showing a loss.  I can recall an Aer Lingus official telling us in those years of how important that route was for the company. At that time the company was endeavouring to increase the number of landing points in North America. That has changed and we now have a situation where the Minister tells us that these losses threaten the very survival of our Atlantic service.  He has told us that if the loss situation cannot be quickly remedied we would have little option but to terminate or very seriously curtail the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only back bencher from the Government side who contributed to this debate, Deputy Taylor, re-echoed the Minister's sentiments.  That is a dreadful threat to have hanging over <Col N="68" /> the company.  While in government Fianna Fáil succeeded in resisting the pressure put on the nation by the Americans to permit American airlines to fly into Dublin.  Those people who criticised the Fianna Fáil Government for contemplating allowing the country to be forced into accepting this signed the document which allowed TWA fly into Dublin with a proviso that a stop be made at Shannon. We had battled for a long time to prevent this happening.  I should like to know if any investigation has been carried out by Aer Lingus or the Department into the factors involved in the loss on the North Atlantic route.  The Minister informed us that the loss was brought about because of the depressed state of the industry on the Atlantic which was due in the main to a fall in traffic over a number of years, intensive charter competition and uneconomic fares.  I take it that the intense charter competition was not generated by TWA and the question of uneconomic fares is a matter for IATA.</P>
    <P>I am aware that one of the reasons for the fall in traffic was the economic situation in the US but was any of it created by the fact that TWA were given permission to fly to Dublin?  At the time of the signing of the agreement with TWA the American airline committed themselves to spending a sizeable amount of money on generating tourist traffic for this country.  Has that promise been honoured by TWA? I find it difficult to criticise the Government on this agreement because I realise the pressure put on them over a period.  I can understand the Government having to succumb to pressure but if commitments were entered into it is our responsibility to see that the American airline with the concession honours them.  I should like to know whether the commitments have been honoured and if not what action is being taken to rectify the position.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the Minister's reference to the threat to the North Atlantic service.  I wonder if that is the thin end of the wedge.  The Minister has stated publicly that he would endeavour to ensure that Aer Lingus <Col N="69" /> would not withdraw from the North Atlantic but there is a built-in threat in his speech.  I dread the day the Minister for Transport and Power will announce that, due to continuing losses on the Atlantic routes, Aer Lingus have decided to withdraw that service.  I hope the fears expressed in relation to this matter will not be realised.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister found it necessary to talk in terms of a subsidy.  Too many Government agencies have to be subsidised.  The ESB have been endeavouring to avoid this type of situation.  One of our older State companies, Bord na Móna, went through a difficult period but succeeded in pulling themselves up by their boot strings.  I should hate to think that Aer Lingus would have to be subsidised and I agree with the Minister that a Government subsidy would not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the Minister saying &ldquo;We could not afford to pay a subsidy of anything like the magnitude of present losses.  A subsidised airline, with the deliberation that subsidy brings with it, would have far less chance of survival on the Atlantic in its present exacting and depressed state than an airline standing on its own feet fighting for survival.&rdquo;  I have the queerest notion that that paragraph contained a message, not so much for Parliament or the people, but for the board of Aer Lingus.  That statement does not stand on its own.  I do not accept the argument that the airline, as a subsidised airline, would have less chance of survival than it has at present.  I do not understand in what way a subsidy would constrain the airline.  I cannot see how it would be more difficult for Aer Lingus to operate on the North Atlantic.  Somewhere in the Aer Lingus files in the Department of Transport and Power there are a number of alternatives.  It seems logical that one of the proposals submitted is that Aer Lingus could reduce their charges through subsidies.  I can see justification for non-movement by the Government in this regard.  The very minute a decision is taken to subsidise Aer Lingus the floodgates will <Col N="70" /> be opened.  That is an internal matter between the Minister and Aer Lingus. The Minister is responsible for Aer Lingus and he should tell them to solve their problems in whatever way they like but not to attempt to apply for a subsidy.  To highlight the matter in public in order to get the message to the board of Aer Lingus is quite remarkable.</P>
    <P>In the following paragraph of his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that our airline is fighting back.  It is pursuing a strategy based on the retention of the present fleet, increased marketing and charter activity, rigid control of costs and the maximum development of profits from related and ancillary activities.</P>
    <P>As a result of the improvements, things are going so well that, in fact, the company set a target for an operational profit of £1.5 million for the present year which represents an improvement of £3.5 million at operational level in 1975-76.  I am getting bogged down in this.  The Minister finishes up by saying &ldquo;Latest indications are that this target will be realised and possibly exceeded.&rdquo;  I do not know if I am reading this correctly or not but he had talked about a net loss of £5 million. He talks here about an operational profit of £1.5 million.  My ordinary national school education led me to believe, until I got down to the next line, that that meant that Aer Lingus had killed the net loss of £5 million last year and they were going to achieve their target of £1.5 million operating profit, which means that they were going to be £6.5 million better off operationally from last year to this year.  Then he said that that represented an improvement of about £3.5 million at operating level.  That set me back a little.  The sum of £3 million was after disappearing out the window all of a sudden in one line.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister in his speech, or his staff in the preparation of it, would not be more objective and let us get the situation where we can compare like with like. <Col N="71" /> If we are going to do any sort of comparison, that is the way it should be.  The House should not have a foggy presentation of the position.  Here was I thinking that Aer Lingus were doing better to the extent of £6.5 million to find when the Minister did his sums that it was £3.5 million.  I ask the Minister, if we are going to show £3.5 million of an improvement at operational level over last year and we had a £5 million loss last year, does that mean that Aer Lingus, to put it this way, are going to lose only £1.5 million this year or is it that they are going to make a profit of £1.5 million?</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the latest indications were that the target would be realised and possibly exceeded.  Assuming that the target is just about realised, I would like the Minister to tell me when replying whether that means that Aer Lingus are going to be £1.5 million in the red at the end of this trading year or £1.5 million in the black.  This is no small gap.  Whatever way we look at it, the sum as he presents it says that operationally anyway, whatever that means, Aer Lingus are going to operate more efficiently or more successfully than they did last year to the extent of £3.5 million.  To anybody's way of thinking £3.5 million is no small matter.</P>
    <P>There has been a slight improvement. The Minister says further:</P>
    <P>Traffic on the North Atlantic is unlikely to resume the strong sustained growth rates of former years.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I take it that traffic in the Atlantic has not improved to any great extent and this was the thing that was blamed for the £5 million loss last year.  When the Minister replies, I would like him, on behalf of Aer Lingus, to give some idea as to how this £3.5 million improvement was brought about in the present year. The Minister says we were pursuing a strategy based on the retention of the present fleet.  That is not the reason for the improvement.  We have the same number of planes.  Regarding increased marketing and charter <Col N="72" /> activity, I would like to know from the Minister whether this additional £3.5 million operating profit this year has been brought about by greater efficiency in marketing.  That is what I look upon as increased marketing. It has not been brought about by reason of lower or cheaper aviation fuel.  It has not been brought about by any reduction to any extent in inflation; in the rate of inflation maybe, but not inflation.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Aer Lingus may be on the horns of a dilemma in trying to reply to what I am trying to get at, but things are still going badly.  There is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow in this regard. Nothing marvellous has happened, as I see it, in this year as against last year.  We are told that it will be some years before the North Atlantic situation builds up.  There probably has been some little improvement.  I hope that there has been a step-up in the amount of traffic this way across the North Atlantic but to have an improvement of £3.5 million at operational level arising from increased marketing and charter activity in the light of constraints that there are on charter activity is remarkable.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech introducing this was rather short and as I have already indicated, not too self-explanatory. This is why I feel that probably the Minister in replying did visualise that he would be going into some more detail and would be more informative to the House.  Certainly he gave basic information&mdash;I was going to say as to why he wanted an extra £25 million.  He did not do that.  It may be to enable Aer Lingus to start negotiating for loans before things become more prohibitive.  As against that, from the nod of the head that I have got from the incoming Minister a few moments ago, there is nothing big planned in Aer Lingus at present and this is only proper.  They should not be planning too serious a capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>To be frank, I would like a more elaborate explanation from the Minister of this £3.5 million operational improvement which is all credit to Aer Lingus.  Peculiarly enough, I have the idea that, with whatever streamlining <Col N="73" /> has been done which brings about this £3.5 million improvement in operational profit, when maybe the outgoing Minister for Industry and Commerce rapped them on the knuckles at some stage about wasteful operation, they tightened things up and were in a position to transfer at operational level anyway from a £2 million loss to a £1.5 million profit in the 12-month period.  It is something which they must be congratulated on, but one must congratulate them with tongue in cheek.  If that sort of target can be achieved this year, the question naturally arises as to why things were so bad last year. I hope the Minister would check that out.</P>
    <P>The next question I would like to ask is in relation to what I have said regarding the operational profit of £1.5 million.  Again, forecasting must be very difficult for any State body or for any body.  It was difficult to budget last January on the basis of costs at that time in the light of Government promises that things were improving and were on the upturn. Succeeding Ministers and the Taoiseach came into this House and said: &ldquo;We have caught up.  The situation will be such and such, and the gross national product will be so and so.&rdquo;  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce would say &ldquo;We are over the hump&rdquo;.  He has been over the hump each year for the past three years.</P>
    <P>In referring to the Aer Lingus report as recently as the 11th November, the Minister said that the air companies set a target of an operating cost of £1.5 million and, in fact, as on that date, that target would be realised and possibly exceeded.  If Aer Lingus are ahead of target, that means they have tightened things up and improved marketing and general overall operations to a considerable extent, and they must be complimented on that.  What percentage of the target of £1.5 million is represented by inflation?</P>
    <P>Because of the change of Minister I have had to change my script for my contribution to this debate.  The Air Companies (Amendment) Bill and <Col N="74" /> tourism go hand in hand.  Deputy Burke spoke on this measure previously and said that one of the militating facts against the successful promotion of tours and business by Aer Lingus was high hotel charges. Since then we have had the extraordinary statement by the then Minister for Transport and Power, the present Minister for Education, that hotel prices were dirt cheap, they were too low.  That was a remarkable contribution.</P>
    <P>We now have a new Minister with a fresh approach to this Department. We will have to wait some time to see what stamp he will put on it.  I will be very interested in his approach to the question of opening the North Atlantic air service to unlimited charters.  For quite some time a battle has been raging between Aer Lingus and the hotel industry.  The latter are anxious that as many charters as possible come to Ireland.  They do not mind who gets the tourists here.  All they are interested in is that the tourists arrive and fill the bed spaces in their hotels.  Aer Lingus have been accused, possibly wrongly, of interfering with the unlimited movement of charters.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the former Minister and Aer Lingus were at the receiving end of a good deal of criticism from certain elements of the hotel federation, particularly the Munster branch, who were quite vociferous in their condemnation of the Government because they did not open the gates to unlimited charters.  I wonder if the former Minister was very much in opposition to this.  I would be interested in getting the present Minister's views on that point.  I do not suppose a newly-appointed Minister ever had the opportunity this Minister has this afternoon to give the people on all sides in industry, in Aer Lingus and tourism, a blueprint of his plans.</P>
    <P>Although this is a limited debate, the Minister can link tourism with air companies.  I would be interested to hear what he has to say about chartering. This measure enables us to review the operations of Aer Lingus as a whole.  I would like the Minister to <Col N="75" /> detail his views and tell us if he will fall in line with Aer Lingus's opposition to cheap charters.  As I said, the tourist industry is interested in getting the tourists here, irrespective of how they arrive.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Barrett's remarks when he queried the devaluation and decreasing costs so far as Aer Lingus are concerned.  As he said, Aer Lingus are unique and apart from other State-sponsored bodies, because they had the practical opportunity of selling their services for the German mark or the American dollar, and therefore should not have been so affected by inflation.  I hope this Minister will cover these points in his reply.</P>
    <P>I would now like to touch on a point also raised by Deputy Barrett which no speaker who travels by Aer Lingus can afford to ignore and that is &ldquo;Aer Lingus, the friendly airline&rdquo;. My impression is that we are fast losing that name of which we were proud.  Everything possible will be done by the Opposition to nurture, encourage and promote Aer Lingus and Aerlínte.  When Aer Lingus first began operations they were our own &ldquo;back yard&rdquo; airline and certainly everybody was proud of them.  The hostesses went out of their way to be pleasant and established a reputation for friendliness.  Nowadays we do not hear references to the friendly airline or even see them in Aer Lingus advertisements.  It would appear from the Minister's statement that Aer Lingus have made such a success this year of their marketing and charter activities that they have turned a bad operating loss into an operating profit.  It remains for our airline to work hard at getting back the friendly airline image.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to increase the limits of what Aer Lingus can borrow from £50 million to £75 million.  The former Minister, in an extraordinarily short and uninformative speech&mdash;only three pages&mdash;on 11th November did not tell us what these additional borrowing powers were needed for.  We are entitled to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> He told us that at the moment the borrowing of Aer Lingus and their other associated companies stand at £35 million and that they need to borrow £6 million and $12½ million. He did not tell us what the additional borrowing powers were needed for over and above the existing statutory limit.  Particularly he did not tell us what the £6 million and $12½ million were being borrowed for.</P>
    <P>It cannot be for the purchase of aircraft because Aer Lingus have a surplus of airliners and have some of them leased.  We have not been told for what purpose Aer Lingus borrowed money recently.  I am entitled to know that and to ask why I cannot know it because the previous Minister was grossly uninformative in the speech he made three or four weeks ago.  Why should this House be expected to vote further borrowing powers when it has not been told what the money will be used for?  I hope we will have a satisfactory reply to the debate from the present Minister because we had a very unsatisfactory opening to it.</P>
    <P>None of us wants to stifle Aer Lingus's activities and if they need to borrow more for what we consider worthwhile purposes we will encourage them, if necessary by passing legislation, but we have not been told what this extra borrowing power is needed for.  The last time we increased their borrowing power was in 1969 through the Air Companies (Amendment) Act.  The limit was then raised from £24 million to the present level, which has not yet been reached.  At that time the money was needed to buy two 747 Boeings and eight 737 Boeings at a time when Aer Lingus were on the crest of the wave and when they could hardly buy aircraft quickly enough.</P>
    <P>There is a startling contrast between the last Bill and this one.  Aer Lingus now have either been selling aircraft or leasing them all over the world. I should like to say in passing, in relation to the investment at that time, particularly the purchase of the two Boeing 747s, that this country never got greater value for any public money than at that time because Aer <Col N="77" /> Lingus bought the 747s for something less than $20 million and their current value, though they are six or seven years old, is in excess of $50 million.  They have been a wonderful asset to the airline and the tragedy is that they have not been able to use them&mdash;they have been leased to Air Siam, East African Airlines and currently to British Airways.  I hope the day will come when it will be possible for Aer Lingus themselves to utilise these valuable assets now worth two-and-a-half times what they were bought for&mdash;the best and wisest investment that could have been made.</P>
    <P>The reason why I question the need for these extra sums is that I have reason to suspect from the recent annual report of Aer Lingus for the year ended 31st March last that this money is for the purpose of building golf courses in Surrey and equally irrelevant activities, to my mind, for an Irish national airline to be engaging in.  I refer to page 7 of the report which deals with what it describes as hotels and catering service. It refers to the purchase of 14 hotels in the US from the Dunfey Family Corporation.  It does not state where they are situated but when I was in the US I saw from a list of the 14 hotels that 13 are in cities not served by Aer Lingus.  I cannot see what traffic they can generate or what relevance it has for Aer Lingus to provide hotel accommodation in cities not served by Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The London Tara Hotel clearly has not been as successful as one might wish but it obviously fulfils a need and is a valuable part of the Aer Lingus setup because London is the place to which they carry most of their passengers, more than to any other single destination, and it is only right they should have under their direct control adequate hotel accommodation which will generate traffic as well as help to maintain existing traffic.  It is a different matter to acquire 14 hotels when Aer Lingus are not flying into cities in the US in which 13 of them are situated.  If the present Minister can see the advantage there perhaps he will tell us what it is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> The third matter in the report to which I should like to refer is under the heading of &ldquo;Our Leisure Complex at Foxhills Outside London&rdquo;. The report states that it was decided in July, 1975 to provide two championship golf courses which are now available to the public.  Last year Aer Lingus lost £8¾ million, taking the effects of devaluation into account, and I ask this House seriously to consider why in God's name do they want to lay down two championship golf courses outside London?  What traffic will be generated out of Dublin, Shannon and Cork by people deciding they want to play golf at Foxhills, outside London?  Have we not got one of the most outstanding golf courses in the world within five or six miles of this House?  Why should we be taking ourselves outside London to courses which have been built at tremendous expense by the Irish national airline?</P>
    <P>Around our coast there are about six of the leading golf courses in the world.  About six of our golf courses could be classed in the best 50 in the world.  Our golf courses are one of our tremendous resources and we are the envy of nearly every country in the world with regard to this facility.  However, instead of Aer Lingus trying to bring in as many people as possible from Europe, the United States, Canada and other parts of the world to play golf here they are doing the direct opposite.  They are building two courses from scratch somewhere near London obviously at great expense but we are not given any details about the matter.  I cannot see the economic, social or commercial reason for this.</P>
    <P>The fourth item under that heading is the development of a resort complex at Teneriffe.  I am not going to quarrel with that because presumably Aer Lingus are interested in generating traffic to Teneriffe and they are anxious to have hotel and other facilities there under their control. Probably Irish people would go to Teneriffe, particularly in the offseason period, and to that extent it is probably a valuable and useful development by Aer Lingus.  However, these golf courses at Foxhills outside London leave me quite amazed.  I <Col N="79" /> made inquiries from senior officials in Aer Lingus as to the <i>rationale</i> behind the project but I could not discover it in their reply.</P>
    <P>In a Bill where we are being asked to allow considerably extended borrowing powers we are entitled to ask the purposes for which they will be used. Will this borrowing be used to pay for the golf courses I mentioned?  In 1969 the House was told what the money it then allowed to be borrowed would be spent on but that has not happened in this case.  The present Minister for Transport and Power has a duty to tell the House in great detail what these two items of borrowing are for and what the extra £25 million is likely to be used on even though it is obvious it will not all be used for some time.  We are also entitled to inquire about the golf courses and the purchase of hotels in the United States.  We should be told if any of the expensive foreign borrowing by Aer Lingus, which is costing them a great deal of money in terms of devaluation, was used to finance Aer Lingus in these ventures.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the former Minister for Transport and Power in his opening speech did not deal with the fundamental question of the basic conflict of interest that exists between Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte.  It has been the traditional attitude of the Department of Transport and Power, who have ultimate responsiblity for both bodies, to come down on the side of Aer Lingus.  We were told Aer Lingus must be maintained in a solvent condition but that has not happened. We are having the worst of both worlds.  There is fierce restriction by Aer Lingus on the number of people who can be brought into the country from North America but, at the same time, Aer Lingus are losing money very heavily and they attribute most, if not all, of their losses to the North American route.  It is fair to sum up the situation by saying we are now in the position that we have the worst of both worlds.  Aer Lingus are losing heavily on the North Atlantic but they are still stopping tens of thousands of tourists who would wish to come here from entering the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> The official attitude of Aer Lingus to complaints they have received in large volume from Bord Fáilte and from hoteliers in the country is that it is necessary to preserve a national flag carrier on the North Atlantic route.  They say that if large numbers of tourists are allowed to come here by charter, either on Aer Lingus or on other flights, we cannot preserve our flag on the North Atlantic route. I am not certain that is so.</P>
    <P>What particularly worries me about this matter is that the former Minister for Transport and Power in his opening speech here on 11th November when referring to the loss situation on the North Atlantic said: &ldquo;If it cannot be quickly remedied we will have little option but to terminate or very seriously curtail the service&rdquo;. That is a grave comment from a Minister.  We have lost out both ways. In the past five or six years we have kept out tens of thousands of tourists who would have come while, at the same time, Aer Lingus are doing so badly on the North Atlantic that the Minister talks of the possibility of shutting down on the North Atlantic route completely.</P>
    <P>If Aer Lingus are going to shut down on the North Atlantic, at least we will have a free-for-all into the country.  We will have tens of thousands of tourists but on the other hand, it would be unthinkable for Aer Lingus to shut down on this route. The unemployment created would be enormous as would be the loss of prestige for this country.  If the present Minister really applies his mind to trying to balance in the national interest the short-term commercial interests of Aer Lingus on the one hand and the general tourist interest of the country as a whole on the other, surely he can come up with some solution.  The only attitude taken by his predecessor in relation to this matter was to buy the Aer Lingus story all the way; as the Taoiseach puts it, &ldquo;to take their shilling and beat their drum&rdquo;.  That is what the previous Minister did all the way in order to protect Aer Lingus, as he put it, and to keep them viable and solvent.  Look at that organisation <Col N="81" /> now.  Some £8.73 million lost last year alone and that is only making partial allowance for the currency losses that have accrued.  I am quoting from Mr. J.P. Hayes, chairman of the boards, in a report dated 27th July, 1976, page 2.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus have suffered these very heavy losses but at the same time the number of tourists from North America is deliberately kept down by Aer Lingus.  The country has suffered huge losses as a result.  It is very distressing to meet hoteliers, as Deputy Barrett and I did in Limerick earlier this year, and to hear from them about their problems and difficulties. I am talking in particular about hoteliers in north Munster who, more than hoteliers in any other part of the country, were dependent on the North American market, who were geared for it and who had great success with it through the years.  Their hotels are now grossly underoccupied. The market which should be available to them is literally flying over their heads into Europe.  The planes could stop at Shannon if Aer Lingus allowed them.  The justification for that attitude over the years was that Aer Lingus must be kept solvent, that we must avoid a loss situation in that company.  Now the company are losing £8.73 million and we still think the same.</P>
    <P>The country is losing out both ways. We cannot go on like this.  If we are to have an airline which is in serious financial trouble let the country have some benefit.  Let the tourists who Aer Lingus cannot carry come into the country rather than have them fly on to London or the Continent. I do not want to go into details of all the efforts of Aer Lingus in North America to stop charter flights into Ireland.  They are well known.  All I need say is that I have personal experience, as a result of representations made to me by people endeavouring to bring charter flights of 350 people per flight into Shannon, being stopped by Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus relied on the IATA regulations and sent people to book on flights, which they were not allowed to book apparently at the time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> The Minister should debate in the House the problem which arises for the country as a result of the conflict of interests between Bord Fáilte and the tourist industry generally on the one hand and Aer Lingus on the other.  The matter should be redebated now in the light of the very poor financial returns of Aer Lingus during the past two years.  That changes the ball game very considerably. If Aer Lingus feel they have to maintain this attitude the Minister for Transport and Power and the Government should step above them and take a broader view of the whole national interest.  We should ask ourselves if it is worth maintaining an airline in IATA with all those restrictions if it means keeping out of the country tens of thousands of people we very badly need at the moment. Would it be better to take Aer Lingus out of IATA and operate our airline in a completely different way from the way it has been operated and try to maximise the number of people brought into the country?  We should try to fill all the aircraft Aer Lingus have and which they have leased around the world in various places at present.  We should bear in mind that even the small number of aircraft Aer Lingus retain are by no means full either on the Atlantic or elsewhere.  Their occupancy rate is comparatively low.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus are being increasingly forced back on what they describe as subsidiary activities to try to make a profit.  I am glad there is enough resourcefulness in the company to turn to these activities.  They should not lose sight of the fact that they are primarily our national airline.  Their primary function is the encouragement of the maximum amount of travel into the country.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Department of Transport and Power and the board and management of Aer Lingus are entitled to impose any other primary consideration on a national airline. The primary use of other airlines is to that effect and should also be the case with Aer Lingus.  There was a lot to be said about keeping Aer Lingus solvent when they were not in <Col N="83" /> a loss-making situation.  The company are in a very heavy loss-making situation now.  If the arguments had any validity at the time I believe they have no validity now.  In the national interest the Minister for Transport and Power should answer fully and frankly the questions that have been asked so that we can have a fair appraisal of the relevant priorities in regard to our national airline at present and have a useful debate.  No debate can be useful when it is founded on the short statement by the previous Minister for Transport and Power which gave us no details whatever.  The only thing of consequence that was said is that we might have to pull out of the North Atlantic.</P>
    <P>It will be a tragedy if we have to pull out of the North Atlantic.  The fact that Aer Lingus are thinking that there is a possibility of doing that is indicative of their rather grudging attitude towards Shannon airport and the mid-west also.  It is well known that they are not keen on Shannon. They moved most of their servicing out of that airport.  They tended to concentrate everything in Dublin and looked on Dublin as their major airport when in fact Shannon is the international airport for the country as such.  The effect on Shannon and the region generally would be absolutely devastating if what the previous Minister said had to be considered is to be put into operation and if there is a termination or serious curtailment of the North Atlantic service.</P>
    <P>The usefulness of this debate will to a great extent be brought about by the degree of frankness which the present Minister is prepared to show in his reply to the debate, the amount of information he is prepared to give and the indication of his thinking on those very serious and fundamental problems which he is prepared to disclose to us.  I particularly ask, at a time of great difficulty for the tourist industry in general as well as for Aer Lingus, that deep consideration be given to discovering where the real interest and the balance of interest lies for the country as a whole and not just for one company in considering airline <Col N="84" /> policy generally, particularly in regard to the North Atlantic route.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>As a midlander and somebody who has not the broader and more personal interest of the people who have airports in their immediate vicinities I would like to offer a few brief comments on this Bill.  I am sure there is overall approval on all sides of the House for a Bill like this.  The main purpose of the Bill is to increase the aggregate of the borrowings by Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta from £50 million to £75 million.  The Bill also offers us an opportunity of discussing items in relation to our air companies and our air services in general.  It also enables us to discuss our approach to them and what our overall views should be.</P>
      <P>We all wish for a change in the situation which has been occuring in our North Atlantic flights.  We are all disappointed that there has been such a loss in our North Atlantic flights.  The former Minister for Transport and Power in a recent radio interview stated that the Government, in conjunction with our air companies, would ensure that every possible effort would be made to ensure that our North Atlantic services would be retained. He said he would do everything humanly possible to retain those services.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the boards, Mr. Hayes, quoted from a statement by the Minister in this House in November, 1975.  He said he &ldquo;would like to encourage Aer Lingus if they can, within their own resources, to provide money to invest in ancillary activities that will provide them with a profit that they can put against the loss on the North Atlantic so that we can stay on the North Atlantic until times improve and that that will again turn out to be a profitable sphere of their operations.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he was anxious to improve the situation in regard to hotel rooms and hotel services in America.  Mentioned in the Aer Lingus report are the massive increases and the major improvements made by Aer Lingus in regard to our hotel services <Col N="85" /> in the United States.  From 1st January, 1976, Aer Lingus have acquired a long lease on 14 hotels in the United States and the leases are being operated by the Dunfey Family Corporation. They are also managing a further nine properties which will enable our companies to try to ensure that people using our airlines will have those services available to them.</P>
    <P>We have approximately 7,000 hotel rooms available in the United States. It is expected and hoped that this will result in a profit which will alleviate some of the losses on these lines.  That policy is to be welcomed.  There is a serious difficulty in the North Sea airlines. It is not unique to Aer Lingus. Every fair-minded person must accept that it affects all airlines.  In Mr. Hayes's statement in March, 1976, he touched on that problem.  Every airline has been affected in the past number of years.  Mr. Hayes said that &ldquo;the serious difficulties which have confronted the world's airlines for some years did not ease in the past year. The International Civil Aviation Organisation's Annual Report for 1975 shows that the world's scheduled airline industry's operating profit was the worst recorded since 1961.  The net result after interest and taxes is almost certainly the worst in the history of aviation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With inflation and the cost of fuel, and so on, and with the keen competitive nature of the industry, it is very difficult for an airline to show a profit. Even though there has been quite a loss in the North Atlantic traffic, the Minister is anxious to ensure that all those flights will be retained.  We can take heart from that.  There was an 18 per cent decline in our passenger traffic service on the North Atlantic line but we reached an increase of 5 per cent more passengers carried by our airlines in 1975-76.  In spite of all the difficulties, this is a very heartening result for our air companies and one in which they can take justifiable pride.  A genuine effort is being made to ensure that our services are retained at the present level and where possible increased.  The Minister is hopeful that we will turnover a profit in the coming year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> I fully recognise the enormous drains on the Exchequer and the enormous challenges the Exchequer has to meet.  All our Government Departments and semi-State bodies have special demands, but it is absolutely essential that whatever moneys are needed by our airlines to maintain their level of service should be provided. I hope the profit to which the Minister referred is achieved.  It is important to strengthen our air companies from the point of view of tourism. As was pointed out by a previous speaker, we must have efficient and regular flights in and out of Ireland for tourists and also for industrialists. If we are to have growth in industry our airlines must fly all over the world.  Every Irish businessman feels a sense of pride in travelling on his own airline.  In this regard it is essential that our airline be maintained at its present level.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said he was happy to see that our airline was fighting back on the Atlantic market. With proper marketing, effort, planning and co-operation, with its staff ensuring that our airline is maintained not alone on a par with others but that its services are even better, we would be able to offset the loss of revenue suffered on our North Atlantic lines.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill in that present borrowing limits are almost completely depleted.  For that reason the memoranda and articles of association of our companies will be altered to allow for an extra £25 million.  This is a step which will have the approval of everybody in this House.</P>
    <P>There is another matter on which I should like to touch briefly and which is something all of us in this House should bear in mind.  There are quite a number of small, private airstrips in the country.  There are also a number of airstrips being used by local air clubs.  These airstrips are under the aegis of the Department of Transport and Power.  Some further encouragement and incentive could be provided for some of those small clubs.  I believe there is one in Castlebar, Birr, Kilkenny and Wexford.  There is scope for their development which could be <Col N="87" /> of tremendous benefit to industrialists in attending business ventures, perhaps for the moment, in the British Isles only.  But there has been a marked increase in the number of people using these strips and in those flying their own aeroplanes.  Perhaps the development of such airstrips is something to be foreseen in the future but, nonetheless, it is something the new Minister for Transport and Power should examine.</P>
    <P>Speed of communication is all important in this country.  Portion of the Department of Education has been transferred to Athlone and portion of the Department of Lands to Castlebar. We shall probably see further movement in some of our Government Departments.  The midlands have been lacking in services of this kind.  The west lacks the services of a fully equipped airport&mdash;the midlands and the west have been particularly neglected in this respect.  I am aware that in Birr quite a number of people are availing of this service and it is important that it be fully developed.  All of us should examine this aspect of air travel.  In the next ten years I believe we will see a number of industries here initiating their own flights to and from business conferences, factories and so on.  We must seriously consider which airports should be developed.</P>
    <P>The new Minister should take a policy decision in his Department with the full intention of developing certain airstrips in the midlands and west.  Having made such a decision they will have to be fully serviced with runways, control towers, proper customs facilities and back-up services. Such would be of tremendous benefit to our tourists, industrialists and the country at large.  Our road network system is becoming so congested it is making travel for industrialists in the midlands and west to business ventures in Britain and elsewhere almost prohibitive in the length of time it takes to reach Dublin or Shannon Airport.  We shall have to gear ourselves to industry and its development in this respect.  The midlands in particular do not have an opportunity of industrial development to the required <Col N="88" /> extent.  I would ask the Minister to examine this very carefully and decide which airports most need development, something which, if done, would be of enormous advantage to the country generally.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister the same success in his new Department as he has had in the Department of Lands.  I believe he will give his new Department the same dedication as he did his former.  I believe he will be many years there and I wish him many with good health and happiness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan):</i> I want to express my appreciation of the words of welcome to me in my new Department expressed by Deputies Lalor and Enright.  Perhaps it is a coincidence that Deputy Lalor and I entered this House in the same year, he coming directly into the House and I through Seanad Éireann.  Deputy Lalor stated that in my capacity as Minister for Lands he did not have any occasion to clash with me and that he hopes that harmony between us will continue.  It is also my hope that my relations with the Opposition spokesman, Deputy Barrett, and those of the Opposition contributing to debates, will also be of a harmonious nature.  My ambition will be to discharge my duties as Minister for Transport and Power, to the country and to this House, in a proper manner, and I certainly will not provoke any confrontations or any unpleasantness in the House.</P>
      <P>This Bill is mainly an enabling Bill. It sets out to increase the overall limit to which the Minister for Finance may guarantee borrowings by Aer Lingus and Aerlínte from £50 million to £75 million.  Section 6 deals with the salaries payable to the chief officers of the board bringing them into line with current policy.  The Act of 1969, which was introduced by the former Government, raised the limit of borrowings of the airlines which might be guaranteed from £24 million to £50 million and increased the guaranteeing powers of the Minister by £26 million.  This Bill increases those powers by £25 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> Deputy Lalor and other Deputies spoke about the House being asked for a blank cheque.  Presumably they meant to convey that the House was being asked to give a blank cheque to the boards of Aer Lingus and Aerlínte to enable them to borrow freely to the tune of £75 million.  That is not the case and nothing could be further from reality.  There are provisions in the Bill to keep a close check on the borrowings of these companies. Guarantees can be given by the Minister for Finance after full consideration and after consultation with the Minister for Transport and Power. The House may assume that these guarantees will not be entered into lightly, because even if the Minister for Finance were inclined to do so he would have to answer to the House for the guarantees which he gave. There is further protection contained in the Bill, because subsection (4) of section 2 provides:</P>
    <P>(4) The Minister for Finance shall, as soon as may be after the expiration of every financial year, lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement setting out with respect to each guarantee referred to in subsection (2) of this section and given during that year or given at any time before, and in force at, the commencement of that year&mdash;</P>
    <P>Therefore I suggest that this House is retaining the strictest possible policing of the activities of the airlines, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport and Power under this measure.  This measure has followed the pattern taken by the Act of 1969. Indeed, the amount of the extension which is now sought is, comparatively speaking, much less than was sought in 1969.  Even in actual terms, not to mention comparative money terms, the 1969 Act extended the guaranteeing powers of the Minister for Finance by £26 million as against the present proposal to extend it by £25 million.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the nature of this Bill many of the matters raised by Deputies on the other side could be more properly raised on the Estimate of the Department, which covers the <Col N="90" /> day to day and year to year running of the companies.  I am not suggesting for one moment that Opposition Deputies were not entitled to raise these matters.  They were, but perhaps those matters could be more appropriately dealt with in a full blown Estimate debate.  The question of the losses on the North Atlantic line was the main question raised and it has been dealt with at some considerable length.  In relation to the alleged proposal to withdraw the North Atlantic service, there is no question of withdrawing or closing down the North Atlantic service. Charter traffic between North America and Europe has been growing steadily for the last 15 years and it now accounts for over 30 per cent of the total market.  The economics of charter and schedule operations are fundamentally different.  While I recognise the very real benefit which the charter flights can confer and can bring to this country, I am mindful also of the importance, in the national interest, of maintaining at least minimum regular services.</P>
    <P>As Minister responsible for the development of both aviation and tourism my policy is that both should develop in harmony, each serving the other in a complementary way.  Within the aviation sphere, my overall objective is to promote the fair and orderly expansion of the civil air transport services&mdash;both scheduled and non-scheduled&mdash;to and from Ireland. In regard to non-scheduled operations, the aim is to provide the maximum opportunity for participation consistent with maintaining the viability of the scheduled services which are essential not only in the interest of tourism but also to meet the needs of trade and business generally.  Anyone who has given any thought to the matter must regard charter flights as being very important from the point of view of tourism but they must not be allowed to operate indiscriminately or to such an extent that the regular scheduled flights might cease to be effective or to be available.  Both categories of air service can co-exist within sensible regulations embodying reasonable conditions for each type of operation.  The <Col N="91" /> existence and continuation of the economic dilemma in which the air transport industry finds itself on the North Atlantic testifies to the need for agreement on such vital issues as capacity in relation to demand and pricing in regard to the actual cost of operation.</P>
    <P>Charter services are not as strictly regulated as the scheduled services and the tendency is for low-priced charters to be organised which confer short-term advantages on holidaymakers but which have the effect of diverting traffic from essential scheduled services. European States, members of the European Civil Aviation Conference, are striving with the US and Canada to develop a harmonised regime for charters in the North Atlantic which would allow a healthy charter growth without impinging on the welfare of scheduled services.  That would be a happy state of affairs.  The ideal situation would be to have both charter and scheduled services operating in harmony and without interfering unduly or in any way that would be damaging to the scheduled services.</P>
    <P>The air companies have a vital role to play in the promotion of tourism traffic to Ireland.  Our tourism interests are best met in the long run by having a strong national carrier working in that market.  I cannot emphasise that too much.  I am satisfied that the air companies are committed to the improvement of tourism traffic.  Their huge investment in aircraft and in promotional effort abroad are evidence of this.  This summer their charter programme represented an increase of more than 50 per cent of the summer of 1975 and they are planning for further growth next year.  Without their presence on the North Atlantic, we would have no way of ensuring that the Irish market was promoted vigorously by a dedicated carrier or that the type of all-round service necessary for the welfare of the economy is provided.  One Deputy this afternoon said that foreign airlines are interested in carrying passengers but are not very concerned about where they carry them to or from so long as <Col N="92" /> the exercise is profitable from the airline's point of view.  Our national airline, too, is concerned with the business of carrying passengers but with the added advantage for this country that the airline is anxious to carry the passengers to Ireland. It goes without saying that our airline has a better chance of attracting the type of air passenger who wishes to come here, having regard to our long tradition with the US and to the fact that so many of our kith and kin are in that part of the world, some of one generation, some of several generations, but all regarding themselves as having roots in Ireland and looking to Ireland as their second home or, in many cases, as their homeland. That is why I see it as important from a tourism point of view to maintain an air link with North America but we should not delude ourselves about the seriousness of the problem. Any Minister for Transport and Power who would not look at the situation fairly and squarely would not be discharging his duties.  The air companies could not continue to sustain losses indefinitely at the level of the past few years and hope to remain in business without some massive intervention or radical change.  All of the losses are being incurred on the North Atlantic and this holds the key to the airline's future plans.</P>
    <P>Like any competent and responsible management team, the air companies' top executives have been keeping the situation under constant review and have been looking critically at all the options.  Any businessman, at whatever level, who finds himself in a difficult situation or in a situation in which he is not making as much money as he would wish, must consider all options.  In a doomsday situation one of the options would be a total withdrawal from the North Atlantic and, as had been stated already by the chairman of the air companies in the report and accounts for the year ended 31st March, 1976 and repeated again recently, the air companies have considered the implications of such withdrawal as part of the critical exercise of looking at all options.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> However, this does not mean that the air companies are contemplating such action.  They have rejected this option because they regard their interest to be served best by maintaining a real presence on the Atlantic and fighting back.  It is in the vital interest of our tourism trade and industry, of all those employed in the air transport industry, in the Shannon region and in the interests of our overall national wellbeing, that the airline should fight back.  It is obvious that there was never any intention on the part of the airline to withdraw because during the past few years when the economic recession on the North Atlantic was at its worst the air companies managed to maintain essentially intact their North Atlantic infrastructure and they are in the position to expand again when the situation improves.  They have been adjusting their strategy so that they can get maximum benefit from every potential improvement or development.  As my predecessor said in his Second Reading speech, they have planned for the year ending March next to reduce their net loss to about 50 per cent of the 1975-76 figure and the indications are that the strategy they are adopting will enable them to reach this target.  As my predecessor said, too, there has been a big improvement. He dealt with the position during the past few years and stated what it would have been if that position had continued and had deteriorated. But he was glad to be able to report that instead of that the situation is improving.  The airlines are increasing greatly their promotional efforts for next year and are going for real growth and an increase in the market share.  I have confidence that the air companies are bending all their efforts to reversing their present financial position on the North Atlantic and, in these efforts, they will have my full support and, I am confident, the support of the Opposition and the House in general.</P>
    <P>The mood should not be one of complacency, on the one hand, and pessimism on the other.  The approach should be the realistic approach of a businessman looking on the overall <Col N="94" /> situation affecting the operations of our airlines and on what might properly be described as the industry itself.  One aspect cannot be taken in isolation from all the others.  We must look at the overall benefit and this is the way I, as Minister for Transport and Power, propose to look at the situation.  I do not propose to look at the operations of the airlines in isolation. Neither do I propose to look on the income from tourism in isolation. Nor do I propose to look at how these links with the United States of America might affect our efforts here to establish industries and promote job opportunities in isolation.  I propose to look at all three in a package and then do what is in the best interests of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>What is required above all in regard to this particular problem and in regard to overcoming the odds is a commitment by all to work earnestly and unceasingly towards that end.  The odds can be overcome through hard work by all to contain unit costs, improve productivity and efficiency, to stimulate the market through more vigorous selling and improve revenue yield through a system of rational cost-related tariffs for both scheduled and charter services.</P>
    <P>I do not want anyone to come in here doing the bogeyman about closing down this, that or the other.  I affirm here, on this my first day in the House as Minister for Transport and Power, that the last thing I would like to hear would be any talk of closing down our air link with the United States of America and I hope that day will never come.  I believe the indications are that Aerlínte are doing a good job and looking at the situation in a realistic manner.  I believe that, as a result of their efforts, the loss situation which occurred in the extremely difficult years through which we have come will be corrected and a profit situation will emerge.  It will then be clear to all that it is in the interests of the national economy and in the interests of tourism that this link should be maintained.  That is my attitude now and that will continue to be my attitude.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> Deputy Barrett raised a point about the &ldquo;friendly image&rdquo; of our airline and he stressed the importance of maintaining that friendly image.  He argued that we should continue to be known as the &ldquo;friendly airline&rdquo;.  I could not agree more.  He has my full support in this and I am glad to have his.  Aer Lingus are always concerned about the attitude of customers towards the airline and their conception of the Aer Lingus image.  Complaints and compliments are carefully registered and evaluated by the passenger service review committee under the chairmanship of the chief executive. This committee meets at least every month to monitor the quality of service being provided.  Within the airline there is an acute awareness of the need to preserve the friendly image in every aspect of service.  A good example of the airline's approach is the programme specifically directed to improving in-flight and on-the-ground customer services. As part of this programme hostesses and ground staff are subjected during training to what is called in the business &ldquo;typical conflict situations&rdquo; and shown how to overcome the problem in a friendly and personal way. Although engaged in a major costsaving programme, Aer Lingus exclude most of the front line areas from the worst effects of budgetary cuts and research has shown that the usual high standard of service and efficiency have been maintained in those parts of the company which have dealings with the public.  The airlines will get every encouragement from me so far as encouragement is necessary to maintain and improve the &ldquo;friendly image&rdquo; in making passengers feel at home and their flights enjoyable.  Air travel is an experience for many people.  Many people take to it like a duck to water.  Others are not so confident and the friendly approach can be a great advantage. I agree that that image must be maintained.</P>
    <P>It was argued that because a big proportion of the earnings of Aerlínte are received in currency other than sterling it should be much easier for <Col N="96" /> the airline to show a profit and this should be a bonus, so to speak.  That, of course, is only looking at one side of the coin.  A large proportion of these takings are bought in currencies other than sterling, such as interest rates, servicing and the incidental expenses that occur abroad and must be paid for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor was very concerned about the reference by my predecessor to a £5 million loss and to a £1½ million profit.  Interest charges were not taken into account in these figures and the fact is the net loss, after interest and depreciation, is expected to be £3½ million less last year compared with the previous year.  That is a big improvement by any standard.  It is a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I have been asked what this £25 million is required for.  This is a permissive Bill.  In my former Department I put through this House a Bill providing for the issue of £20 million in land bonds.  They will not be required for several years.  This £25 million will not be required for some time to come, and as it is required the purposes for which it is sought will have to be put in black and white before the Minister for Finance.  Before he grants it he will have to be satisfied that, after consultation with the Minister for Transport and Power, the proposed loan is necessary and in the interest of the national airline and in the interest of the country.  He will have to answer to this House on the Estimate and indicate each year the operations under this Bill for the previous year.</P>
    <P>There were other matters dealt with in regard to hotels, golf courses and so on which I think are more appropriate to be dealt with on the Estimate debate.  I am informed that these are ancillary operations engaged in by the airlines and that these operations are either profitable or expected to be profitable, and enable the primary purpose of the airlines&mdash;that of flying aeroplanes and carrying passengers&mdash; to continue.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered the matters raised.  The major point raised was the North American line and I hope I have <Col N="97" /> dealth with that fully and to the satisfaction of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put a question to the Minister, but first of all, I would like to congratulate him on his elevation to Transport and Power.  I suppose one can say that, having left the land, he has now become airborne. During the course of my contribution on Second Stage I referred to a statement about the conference taking place in Singapore that happened to appear in <i>The Irish Press</i> on the particular day we were taking the Second Reading of this Bill.  In order to help the Minister I would like to quote this statement from columns 1623 and 1624, Volume 293, of the Official Report of 11th November, 1976:</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus is planning to drop sterling as the currency for calculating fares and is working towards a special negotiating unit called the IATA unit of value, a company spokesman confirmed yesterday.</P>
      <P>The IATA unit would be based on the system of special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund and would overcome severe complications in fair calculations caused by the steady decline in sterling in recent years.</P>
      <P>The article further states:</P>
      <P>The world's airlines believe that it would be better to drop sterling and to use the dollar alone as the base currency in calculating fares, pending the establishment of the air transport association's own unit of value.</P>
      <P>This does not apply, I presume, to American or other non-sterling based airlines.  The question posed was: could it mean a 20 per cent increase in fares in the sterling area for people booking in Ireland or Britain?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am sorry, I did not deal with that.  It is true Deputy Barrett raised the question whether the proposals by IATA to alter the currency base on which international fares are settled will cause a substantial increase in air fares to and from Ireland.  The answer is no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the moves by IATA <Col N="98" /> to develop a new unit of value for setting international fares and rates is basically to provide a more stable unit in which fares can be negotiated by the airlines around the world.  Up to now the basic units used by IATA, the association of the world airlines, have been the US dollar and pound sterling and the fares so settled are then converted into local currencies for selling.  This system worked satisfactorily while the dollar and pound remained relatively stable.  The system has, however, come under increasing strain in recent years with the wide fluctuations in the value of these two currencies not only as between themselves but <i>vis-á-vis</i> other currencies. The airlines have tried to cope with the situation by a complicated system of currency adjustments but the increasing frequency and degree of such adjustments is creating serious difficulty so that some new and more lasting solution is required.</P>
    <P>The technicalities involved in the proposed new system are complex and are still being worked out, so that it would be another two years or so before it could be implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This section gives the Minister power to guarantee loans including moneys in a currency other than the currency of the State.  This brings us again to the problem of currency adjustment that we had last week with Aer Lingus and that we seem to have with many of our State companies.  I appreciate that the present non-sterling capital repayable in non-sterling currency at 31st March for Aer Lingus was $68.6 million and 50 million Swiss francs.  It is not a very big sum when it is compared with the ESB, for instance, but since it would appear to be more advantageous <Col N="99" /> to borrow in sterling could I ask what are Aer Lingus's chances of borrowing its requirements under this Bill within the sterling area.  Is there an advantage in going outside the sterling area because of having access to these currencies through bookings?</P>
      <P>Since we are discussing borrowing in non-sterling areas, could I ask if Aer Lingus have ever, in their own interest, considered establishing a dollar reserve fund with their dollar revenue by way of deposit in New York banks or otherwise and utilising sterling here at this side for operational costs?  Would this be an advantage to them in their overall budgeting?  I believe it would be a help if they created a dollar reserve in America and at the same time utilised sterling here.  With regard to the borrowings permitted it has been stated that the amount under consideration is similar to that granted in 1969 but there is a difference because in 1969 Aer Lingus purchased jumbos and other aircraft. I presume it is not the intention of the company to purchase any more jumbos at present.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> As the Deputy will appreciate, this section is an enabling section.  It states that the Minister for Finance may, after consultation with the Minister for Transport and Power, guarantee in such form and manner and in such moneys, including moneys in a currency other than the currency of the State, and on such terms as he thinks fit.  Generally speaking, if it was more advantageous to borrow in sterling the company would borrow in that currency but if on the other hand it was not possible to borrow in sterling or was more advantageous to borrow in some other currency the company would borrow in that currency.  It would not be possible to answer the Deputy's question relating to whether the company would borrow in sterling or some other currency because the company, like any good company, is expected to make the best deal possible. It would be in the light of the terms available that the company would decide where to borrow.  I have <Col N="100" /> noted the Deputy's suggestion in relation to the establishing of a dollar reserve in the US and discharging commitments in America in dollars.  I do not know whether that has been considered by the company but it is worth considering.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister give, as his predecessor did, a commitment to the North Atlantic service.  Fianna Fáil are committed to supporting this service also.  It is a very vital operation as far as our national airline is concerned, even though it is losing money.  It is important as far as our country is concerned but, more important still, it is vital to the west of Ireland.  I do not make that statement simply because I represent a constituency which includes Shannon airport but I do so on behalf of tourist interests in the west.  According to statistics published last week, 70 per cent of the passengers travelling from America terminated their journey at Shannon as against the 30 per cent who continued on to Dublin.  I can recall that when the landing rights issue was a big topic in this House we were told that the American airlines would bring thousands of tourists here.  The figure, in fact, ran into hundreds of thousands.  This has not happened and, therefore, we must assume that the promotional activities of the American company were not successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hate to see the day when we would be totally dependent on those airline companies to bring tourists to the west of Ireland.  Some of those companies are only concerned about flying people anywhere.  They are not concerned about flying people to Shannon or Dublin; they simply want to fly people.  We cannot risk terminating operations on the North Atlantic route.  It was very disconcerting <Col N="101" /> to hear the general manager of Aer Lingus state that the question of terminating that service would have to be considered.  Aer Lingus are capable of pulling out of the recession being experienced on the North Atlantic route and the company target forecast seems to indicate that they will do so soon.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, and the company, to consider this whole question of charters which has been a controversial issue for years.  In regard to the charter business, Aer Lingus have been made the scapegoat and wrongly so in most instances.  When you become conversant with the truth this is what you discover.  The Yugoslav airlines have a subsidiary company which deals solely with charter work.  Aer Lingus should consider establishing a subsidiary charter company in order to streamline their charter service to groups in the USA who complain about their charter facilities.  Aer Lingus may not have a sufficient number of aircraft to increase their activities in the charter business and it might be worth considering increasing the fleet to cope with extra charter business.  A definite charter service on the North Atlantic would lead to more co-operation between Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus. The idea seems to be working successfully in Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of training flights in and out of Shannon at present and they are welcomed by the people in the area, the airport authorities and all those concerned with maintaining the airport.  Recently I was told that the training flights are deviating from the established flight paths, particularly at night.  Some people living in the area maintain that there is unnecessary noise at night. Perhaps the Minister would be able to tell me if these training flights are deviating from the established flight paths.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his promotion and hope that he takes a keen interest in the problems of State-sponsored companies, particularly Aer Lingus.  We normally spend our time congratulating everybody concerned with successful ventures.  Aer Lingus have <Col N="102" /> been outstandingly successful but in recent times they have been taking things for granted.  The service which distinguished Aer Lingus has deteriorated slightly.  Those of us who are used to air travel do not worry about it but, as the Minister said, many people travelling by air for the first time appreciate the kind word and the friendship which are not always as evident as they might be.  There have been times when the remarkable service for which Aer Lingus is noted was not evident.  Most countries have established their national airline and it is questionable whether many of them will ever be viable services.  The result is that the State has to carry the can and for that reason we should ensure that economies and proper management are the order of the day without impairing the service of the company or their reputation for safety.</P>
      <P>Every precaution should be taken to maintain the good safety reputation which Aer Lingus enjoy.  It could be said that our airline is a status symbol. Even if the airline was not viable, we, as an island country, should be anxious to maintain it as a contact with the outer world.  Ethnic groups, particularly in North America, expect to see the homeland having this connection. There is a ready made market for our tourist industry and our airline in the great numbers of our people abroad, whether first, second or third generation.  They like to see the plane with the shamrock and are proud of the airline's reputation for safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without digressing from references to the lack of co-operation which has been covered by other speakers, and I do not want to be repeating too much, there is a very important job to be done.  If the country has to come to the rescue in making up deficits or losses by the airways, either in the payment of interest or the guaranteeing of loans or direct payments from the Exchequer, no matter what form this takes there is a bonus to be gained in that we co-operate to the fullest to ensure that the tourist industry, one of our largest, is assisted in every possible way by the co-operation of the airways.  A lot more could be done <Col N="103" /> in that respect and enough has been said about it to have the hint passed on that from now on we would expect to see much more co-operation than we have in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus, to put it broadly; in other words, between the tourist industry and our airways service.  This in itself would make up somewhat a bonus for the losses incurred by the airways to the extent that they have to be maintained in the difficult situation which they are facing.  I do not want to go into a political tirade on it, but it is true to say that Aer Lingus would do much better in the tourist passenger service if the climate for tourism in the country was better than it is. Tourism is an industry which was developed tremendously in this country, and it has been only marking time or even going back in recent times.  There were slight improvements indicated here and there which were only symbolic of what the increase should have been.  Our tourism should have been double by this time, but there are prices for everything. Sometimes one wonders that so many tourists do arrive when one considers the markets available to them.  There is a huge task to be done here.  Absolute co-operation is essential if it is to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred to the number of passengers who disembark at Shannon and the satisfactory record since other airways have been permitted to fly into Dublin.  Unfortunately, that service does not suit the north-west of the country as much as we would like.  This is because of the pattern of our transport routes, with everything converging on Dublin.  It is much easier to get from Dublin to Donegal, Sligo, Mayo or Cavan than it is to get to these places from Shannon.  I wonder whether the Minister has covered in any statement the extent to which internal spur lines will be developed or are likely to be developed in the future.  Nearly everywhere you go in the country, particularly <Col N="104" /> in the north-west, people say, &ldquo;We would want an airstrip; we would want some airstrips&rdquo;.  I know what is involved.  The 50 or 100 passengers that may come now and again would not justify an airstrip at every crossroads, but we have reached the time when the north-west must have, if not a scheduled service, certainly facilities to enable flights of accommodation&mdash;I will not call them charter flights&mdash;to come in at suitable times.  This would tremendously help the economy of the area and make people feel that, coming into Shannon or Dublin, they could get to the end of their journey in reasonably good time.  A very common comment in Donegal is that if you convey some of your friends to Shannon to get the plane to America, as happens so often, they will be in New York before you will get back home.  That is an indication&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an indication of the hazard.  The transport service and our road structures are such that they are not directly suited to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the few remarks that I would like that the Minister, in taking on his new portfolio, would turn his attention to.  If he can in his time contribute to the improvement of the service along these lines, then he will have left some little monument by which we may remember him for whatever length of time he may be in charge of that portfolio.  We wish him well.  I would also like to know&mdash;perhaps he has given this information&mdash; the assets of Aer Lingus and those of their associated companies, and the total amount of their pay-roll.  They are very big employers, which is another reason why their continued existence is justified.  In respect of the difficulties of bringing them to the state of viability, it would be interesting to know what the total payroll is. It would be interesting to know the exact number of people employed in the airways; that would include the different companies.  These things would help to balance our thinking <Col N="105" /> against the losses that we see occasionally having to be met as the result of the year's working.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I will conclude by saying that this country has been proud of its airways and of the reputation they have earned.  We think the Minister should ensure&mdash;the onus is on him more than on anybody else now&mdash;that there should be no deterioration in that service, that there be no diminution of the reputation, the prestige, which Aer Lingus have built up in their parent company.  They are to some extent at a stage where&mdash;I want to put it fairly&mdash;it might be wise to ensure that nothing will happen in that direction.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> First of all, although I do not think it necessary, I want to repeat, and I think it is now accepted by Deputy Barrett and the other Deputies opposite, that there is no question of withdrawing the North Atlantic service. Neither my predecessor, Deputy P. Barry, nor myself ever suggested it.  I read Deputy Barry's Second Reading speech, and unless you took one half of a paragraph out of it and then burned the rest of it you could not arrive at any such conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I know, but some people did.  Deputy Barrett fairly said that he was glad to hear that both myself and my predecessor had given that assurance directly.  I want to repeat that and to say that as long as I am Minister for Transport and Power I will look at the performance of Aer Lingus, Aerlínte, Bord Fáilte and the IDA as one package, because I think they are all related to each other in one way or another and have a lot to do for the country and can do a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in an earlier contribution this evening, I believe that nobody can sell Irish tourism in the United States or any other foreign countries better than an Irish airline.  As long as we have the airline operating between here and North America, they will, I hope&mdash;and they will be exhorted <Col N="106" /> to&mdash;spare no effort to fill their aeroplane seats.  When they are canvassing for and filling those seats, at the same time they will be filling the beds of Irish hotels and selling Irish hospitality to the tourists.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus and Aerlínte have a common objective.  That is recognised, and it could not be more forcefully recognised than by pointing out that the same Minister is charged with responsibility for the policies of Bord Fáilte and the airlines.  It will be my objective and my desire to see that both these boards co-operate in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat surprised and concerned to hear from Deputy Brennan and others that our image as a friendly airline is in danger of being damaged.  I hope that is not so; I have no evidence that it is.  I will be very concerned, as Minister for Transport and Power, to see that our airline continues to be known as the safe and friendly airline.  I could not emphasise that point enough.  As Deputy Brennan said, flying is an experience for some people.  Some people feel about getting into an aeroplane as they do about getting into bed.  They are not concerned about flying.  Others treat it as if they were getting into a dentist's chair.  These people need to be put at ease, to feel at home and to hear a friendly word.  I would be very concerned if I thought that that image was being damaged or was in danger of being damaged.  There are many things I have to read about and study in connection with the various boards which come under my control, but it does not take much reading or studying to know that the point raised by Fianna Fáil is important and that no effort should be spared to ensure that our image is not damaged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett raised the question of training flights at Shannon and suggested that occasionally they go off the flight path.  These training flights are a very lucrative operation engaged in by the Irish airline and I hope they continue and the business expands. The points raised about planes going off the flight path is important and I will have it looked into.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> Deputy Brennan raised the point about spur air fields or airports.  That is something I am sure will come but we must concede that it cannot be a top priority.  That would be an ideal situation.  It is a luxury the Opposition can indulge in and it is something I would like to see.  We have air strips at Farranfore, Castlebar, I think there is one under way in Sligo and also in Aran.  It can be said that people who travel from Donegal to see their friends go to America often find that the friends have arrived in America before they get back to Donegal.  It is true to say that it takes twice as long to travel 100 miles on a good road than it does to fly from London or Birmingham to Dublin.  If we had not aeroplanes it would take much longer to get from any place in Britain to Ireland.  We must keep these points in mind.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Opposition for giving me all Stages of this Bill this evening.  I also want to thank the Deputies, in addition to Deputy Lalor, who extended a welcome and their good wishes to me.</P>

      <P>Ba maith liom fáilte mar Aire Tailte a chur riamh an Teachta Ó Donnagáin.  Initially I should like to welcome Deputy Donegan in his new capacity as Minister for Lands.  I hope he will find that role, which gives him jurisdiction over pastures and forests, woodland and waterland, fauna and flora, refreshing and satisfying and that he will be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend covering the ground which has already been covered in respect of this amendment.  On the <Col N="108" /> other hand, I should like to say briefly and succinctly to the new Minister that this section refers to the production and presentation of the report envisaged in this Wildlife Bill. Section 7 refers to the report but envisages the report being presented to the House in harness with the report which, under the 1946 Act, requires the Minister for Lands to report on matters connected with land, land acquisition, land settlement and resettlement, migration, land bonds and a whole mass of detail on which he must report in his capacity as Minister for Lands.  In that report to date we also have reference to forestry and wildlife.  In respect of wildlife I suppose we could see an affinity and perhaps some justification for the reports appearing in the same harness but if we are to accept the importance of the legislation, if we are to accept as we should the need that the report, if it is to be any use at all, must be different from anything which has been produced to date, it must be a new look, an attractive, inspiring, live report.</P>
    <P>It should also appear at a time when its content would be relevant.  I do not propose covering the same ground again but it is not asking too much that the report should be made available within 12 months of the year to which it refers and this is what my amendment seeks.  There are similar requirements in other legislation.  I am thinking of a requirement in the Gaeltacht Industries Act which requires of Gaeltarra Éireann, an agency which covers a very wide area of industrial activity and is the umbrella for hundreds of companies, to produce a report within a year.  I do not see the use, the relevance or the need for this report unless it will appear separately from the report on lands and unless it is made available within 12 months of the year to which it refers.  I am hoping that the new Minister will view this&mdash;as he can and as he should&mdash;in a different light from that of his predecessor.  I know that he is a man of independent thought and in this case I should welcome the application of his independence to the acceptance of my amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4a:</P>
      <P>In page 9, after line 25, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(z) where it is proposed to vary conditions or revoke any licence under this section, the licensee, shall be so advised at least seven days before the commencement date of same&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When we were discussing section 9 on Committee Stage the Minister made it quite clear that he envisaged a situation where he would be applying the terms of that section in relation to varying the conditions or revoking any licence other than one issued under the new section 28.  He was asked whether or not the licensee would be notified of such revocation or amendment. He indicated that he thought he or she would be.</P>
      <P>I believe any licence is based on a certain confidence.  Before granting a licence any Minister or any authority must be assured that confidence in the person to whom the licence will be granted will not be misplaced.  I accept that in respect of all licences provision must be made for human frailty, that what would be <i>bona fide</i> justification for the issue of a licence today might change tomorrow and that the Minister or any other authority should be empowered to revoke or alter such a licence.  I also think that it is incumbent on the Minister, before he varies or revokes the licence, formally to advise the licensee of his intention and that such a person gets an opportunity at least of appealing to the Minister and expressing his reaction to what the Minister proposes.</P>
      <P>Section 9 gives the Minister power, first of all, to call in a licence and secondly, to revoke it.  The only intimation that a person gets of such change is a notification that the deed has now been done.  Perhaps this is not a very major consideration but the least any person to whom a licence has been granted is entitled to is that before it is recalled or altered in any appreciable way he or she is so advised.  Accordingly, I have tabled this amendment and I hope the Minister will see fit to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I cannot see my way to accepting this amendment. The question of varying the conditions of a licence is usually to meet changed circumstances brought to notice by the licensee.  In those circumstances, prior notice by the Minister would not arise. The revocation of a licence would arise where there is a clear breach of the conditions by the licensee.  To give seven day's notice of revocation would give the defaulting licensee a golden opportunity to compound his breach of the conditions.  Therefore, I cannot see my way to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's newness to his position.  I do not think he entirely believes what he has said and I do not think he has given his personal attention to it.  I do not accept that by giving seven days' notice to the licencee of the Minister's intention to revoke or to vary the licence it would <i>ipso facto</i> give the licensee the opportunity or the motivation to compound the alleged defect. I rather think that by doing the licensee the courtesy of so notifying him he would accept this as his opportunity of proving to the Minister that first, perhaps the original basis for the revocation was not well based and secondly, if he were living in hope of it being restored it would be a basis for him to live and behave himself in such a fashion as to encourage the Minister to restore the rights he initially enjoyed.</P>
      <P>It is an easy answer to say that by giving him seven days he is automatically being given an opportunity of worsening his position but it is not acceptable to me.  I do not think that is what would happen.  It may be taken as justification for rejecting the amendment but I do not think it is in accordance with what is best in respect of this legislation.  What the Minister has told me is in conflict with what his predecessor told us in Committee. We were told that when a licence was called in it did not necessarily mean it would be varied or altered.  If one takes the logic of the Minister's comment on the amendment it means that from the very moment the licensee receives intimation that his licence is being called in he will proceed to compound the alleged offence.  That is quite illogical to me and it is not in accordance with what I hope would be the recognition we would give to any person holding any licence other than a licence granted under section 28 of this legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4b:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 33, to delete &ldquo;a function&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the duty&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> Section 11 is to me the very <i>raison d'tre</i> of what the previous and subsequent sections are all about.  That is the kernel of the reference by the Minister's predecessor.  It is the core of the work which has gone into the preparation of the updating of legislation last introduced in 1930 in respect of game preservation and wild bird protection.  If the legislation is to succeed, it must appear to all concerned that the Minister has a serious intent. I would hope that, in respect of an area for which to date there was no statutory responsibility, it will now be known to all and sundry that henceforth the Minister for Lands is the man upon whom rests the duty and the responsibility for nature conservation.</P>
    <P>Section 11 (1) provides that it shall be a function of the Minister to secure the conservation of wildlife.  In reply the Minister will probably indicate that &ldquo;function&rdquo; is defined and provides for duty and responsibility. There is circumvention there, an ambiguity and an uncertainty which weakens the Minister's position.  As I said, this is the kernel of the legislation. It should be stated here, not ambiguously, not in any fashion which would show the Minister was apologetic or over-sensitive about the duties and responsibilities which devolve upon him in this area but in a crystal clear fashion, that this legislation imposes on the Minister the duty of conserving wildlife, flora and fauna.  By stating it with such clarity, we would remove the attitude which, unfortunately, is present to some extent in this House and elsewhere that nature and wildlife conservation is secondary and relatively unimportant.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I was surprised to hear the Minister's predecessor refer to his sensitivity for other people, his regard for what he called bread and butter factors, his regard for not trespassing in any way into the area of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Department of Local Government, or the Commissioner of Public Works.  It seemed he intended to conserve wildlife on a delicate tightrope and that his concern would be not to annoy or <Col N="115" /> antagonise other people, rather than carrying out the duties which this legislation imposes on him.</P>
    <P>What we are discussing here will have an increasing relevance and importance in the future.  When the young generation of today are as old as we are, they will be very critical of us who, in our desire to satisfy what might be regarded as more material matters, had such little regard for wildlife conservation.  I know there are hard economic factors which cannot be overlooked.  I know that, in the application of moneys today, a case can be made for providing jobs rather than being concerned about the preservation of any particular wild bird, any habitat, or any nature reserve or on the expenditure of money on something which might seem unnecessary and superfluous to some people.  A statement was made recently by the American ambassador to Ireland about how people in other so-called advanced countries have realised at this late stage the damage &mdash;in some cases the damage which cannot be remedied&mdash;which has been done to nature, wildlife, flora and fauna.  We should be thankful we have not reached a stage where the position cannot be rectified.</P>
    <P>We make no apology for this legislation. I do not think its importance will be challenged by anybody.  I hope we will not look on matters of conservation as being appropriate only to elderly tweedy ladies and gentlemen, but as being vital to all our people.  I hope it will be clear to the personnel of other Departments that in respect of the duties which devolve upon the Minister under this legislation he does not feel obliged to cloak them in any way.  In that regard the substitution of the word &ldquo;duty&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;function&rdquo; in subsection (1) will serve that purpose.  It is with some hope I submit this amendment to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Deputy's amendment is unnecessary. The word &ldquo;functions&rdquo; is defined in section 2 as including powers and duties.  Section 11 (a) of the Interpretation Act, 1937, provides that <Col N="116" /> every word importing the singular shall import the plural and <i>vice versa</i> unless the contrary intention appears. The Minister for Lands has already several functions in relation to the Land Commission in respect of forestry.  What section 11 (1) of the Bill does is to make wildlife conservation just another function of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As I feared, the Minister took refuge in the definition to which I referred.  I was hoping he would not do that because I could see it as being the only thing he could do, at least technically.  I am accepting then that what we are about here is not that which we believe we are doing at all; that this legislation is a form of veneer, outward demonstration of a concern, obviously held at a very shallow level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret to say that I do not have any great familiarity with other legislation. Nevertheless I would be surprised if, in respect of other Departments or State-sponsored bodies set up, their duties had been specified in the manner indicated here.  The Minister made some reference to what is accepted by legal men as the equation of the singular with the plural.  That has not any great relevance except perhaps in circumstances in which we were discussing whether or not the word should be &ldquo;functions&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;function&rdquo;.  The amendment requests that the word &ldquo;function&rdquo; should not be there at all and that in its stead the word &ldquo;duty&rdquo; would appear.  If the Minister thinks there is <Col N="117" /> no difference between &ldquo;function&rdquo; and &ldquo;duty&rdquo; then I could believe him, but I know he does not think that.  He knows as well as I do that to anybody reading or interpreting this Bill &ldquo;function&rdquo; carries much less weight than the word &ldquo;duty&rdquo;.  I was hoping that the amendment would serve to strengthen the Minister's hand.</P>
    <P>Here I repeat something I said to his predecessor: that especially in respect of this Bill I do not consider the term &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; appropriate at all.  I have heard in the past, and was always slow to accept, that the purpose of an Opposition was to oppose, full stop.  I do not interpret that as being my function here.  On the contrary, I would hope that we would complement what is there already and strengthen the Minister's hand in areas, especially in those relative to the preparation of this legislation where we know that certain bureaucratic and departmental sensitivities have been expressed and, apparently, linger on.</P>
    <P>We could understand, and perhaps accept, that the Department of Lands would show concern and sensitivity and that in the application of what we know as civil service strategy in the course of preparation of this legislation, they agreed and promised that certain words would appear.  But I have very little concern, nor should any Member of this House be unduly concerned about the quiet, friendly rivalries of different Departments. There is no obligation on us to continue to substantiate in any way promises made or understandings reached unless we are assured that it is in the interest of the preservation of wildlife. That is the only matter with which I am concerned.</P>
    <P>In that regard my amendment would strengthen the Minister's hand, remove any ambiguity and any danger of misinterpretation that might exist.  Certainly it would help to remove, because I have other amendments in this regard, any doubt about the preservation of wildlife.  While we would welcome contributions from any Department, we will not, and should not, accept any undue interference or any impediments being placed in the way <Col N="118" /> of what we are about.  If the Minister thinks on that rather than on the presentation of the case, which understandably and traditionally devolves on him through his able civil servants, he will appreciate the basis of my amendment and might have second thoughts about it.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 37, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;body, agency, organisation or institution&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We will probably get a repetition of the similarity of the equation in law as between the singular and the plural. Even if we do, it will not satisfy or justify the irrelevance or the absence of any need for the amendment which I have proposed.  We are still dealing with section 11 and subsection (2) (a) gives the right, duty and function to the Minister of giving assistance or advice to any person on the matter affecting wildlife.  That is much too confined.  When we think of wildlife our thoughts must stray beyond that of any one person.  It encompasses the country, and all persons.  It refers to land, sea and sky and affects many organisations, institutions and agencies.</P>
      <P>I had hoped that we could in this legislation involve all those organisations. I hope that the Minister will propose to give advice or assistance not just to any person or persons but to clubs, organisations and Departments if necessary.  I do not see that subsection (2) (a) makes provision for the assistance and advice which I think is necessary and which is indispensable if this legislation is to succeed and, accordingly, I have extended the limit placed upon the Minister in the subsection and I suggest that the Minister's purpose will be better served and the success of the legislation will be better guaranteed if provision is made for his advising beyond that which is stated in subsection (2) (a).</P>

      <P>I wish to support this amendment in the name of Deputy Tunney.  We will shortly be dealing with the various provisions and bodies set up under this legislation.  If we are going to have a workable wildlife advisory council, we must give due recognition to the various voluntary bodies who are making such a contribution to the conservation of wildlife. The various game councils throughout the country and the gun clubs have already been referred to. If we are going to confine this section just to a person we will have legislation which is very vague and which will be in danger of being abused not, perhaps, by the present Minister but, perhaps, at a future date.  There will be more teeth in this section if the words &ldquo;body, agency, organisation or institution&rdquo; are included.  A certain amount of conservation is being done at the moment by the game councils, the gun clubs and by farmers particularly in the west of Ireland.  I know places where farmers have got together to prevent certain areas particularly where lakes are involved from being overshot by foreign tourists.  This legislation should be a help to that conservation.  The big stick should not be used to prevent or discourage conservation that is taking place.  When we were discussing the definition of &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; we had a very worth-while amendment in <Col N="120" /> the name of Deputy Tunney, which the Minister's predecessor did not accept and that amendment included some of the bodies I have mentioned. I would ask the Minister to have those bodies included at this stage in this section and to give due recognition to the good work being done in the conservation of wildlife.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his new appointment.  In support of this amendment, the Minister should include all the organisations mentioned and particularly the owners of the lands.  Wildlife cannot be preserved without the goodwill and co-operation of the people and if these organisations are not included the legislation cannot work.  I ask the Minister to accept the wording of Deputy Tunney.  The Minister should know that the owners of the land are doing very good work.  There is a certain amount of conflict between land reclamation and preserving wildlife and a balance must be struck between them.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>If that which is in subsection (2) (a) is already provided for in subsection (c) why do we have to have it at all?  Surely subsection (2) (a) is different from subsection (2) (c)?  It is obvious that subsection (2) (a) provides that the Minister can give assistance and advice.  As I said earlier, the assistance and advice which he can give under subsection (2) (a) is limited to such assistance or advice being given to a person.  The purpose of the amendment was to provide for an extension of this provision. The Minister's defence of maintaining the present position was based on his premise that under subsection (2) (c) there could be such extension. I do not think that is so because this paragraph of subsection (2) empowers the Minister to enter into an agreement with another person, to participate in a scheme, undertaking or project for the conservation of wildlife.  For the purpose of such scheme, undertaking or project he is empowered to perform any one or more of the functions assigned to him under the Act.  How can that be said to be identical with what is envisaged <Col N="121" /> in subsection (2) (a)?  I do not think the Minister was correct in his reply to the case I made.  While there may be a connection between the two there is no similarity.  However, if subsection (2) (a) were identical with subsection (2) (c), why have two different provisions in respect of the same power, the same duty or the same responsibility?</P>
      <P>If the Minister thinks that subsection (2) (c) gives him the powers that I would like him to have under subsection (2) (a), I am happy but I do not think that is the case.  Perhaps on reflection the Minister will realise that in this respect at least the case I am making is the correct one.  I am taking it that it was subsection (2) (c) to which the Minister referred.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is confused. The power lies in section 11 (c) of the Interpretation Act, 1937.  This amendment is not necessary by reason of the terms of that section of the 1937 Act because the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; extends to corporate and unincorporate bodies of persons as well as to individuals.  In reply to Deputy Kitt I said also that my predecessors have given assistance and advice to organisations as well as to individuals. Such organisations could be gun clubs, game clubs or organisations such as An Taisce that might be interested in conservation.  The Deputy may be assured that the power he is seeking to have included resides with the Minister for Lands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> In page 10, line 7, to delete &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;desirable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Again we must be concerned with the interpretation of words.  In subsection (3) (a) we read that the Minister may either directly or in association with or through the agency of another person carry out or cause to be carried out research which he considers necessary for the performance of his functions.  I have visions of the Minister being in conflict with some of those agencies, institutions or Departments to which I referred earlier.  I could foresee the Minister before a court justifying his actions, his functions and his duties under this legislation.  I should hope that in every case the Minister would act in accordance with the spirit of the legislation but I could see him having difficulty in proving that what he had done or what he contemplated was necessary rather than desirable.  I am anxious that in framing this legislation as much freedom as possible is given to the Minister and that as many inhibitions or restrictions as possible be removed from him.  Inevitably, though, the Minister must find himself more restricted with the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; than would be the case if the word &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; were used. In subsection (2) (b) the word &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; appears as being the appropriate word but I wonder why it is found necessary to use the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; in subsection (3) (a).</P>
    <P>I do not think this is a major amendment but I would like the Minister to accept it as an indication of our concern that he have as much freedom as possible so that he can administer and justify this legislation. I do not know what importance the parliamentary draftsman or the Minister's advisers attach to the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;.  Perhaps the respective merits of both words were discussed but I do not think it was a question of balance on their part that they decided that having inserted &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; earlier on they would insert &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; here.  I am convinced their attitude was more serious than that but I am at a loss to understand why they would place on the Minister <Col N="123" /> the burden of proving that what he proposed to carry out was necessary rather than desirable.</P>

      <P>We graciously accept this move by the Minister to meet a point of view we put forward in Special Committee.  Subsection (4) in the section as originally drafted gave grounds for believing that it was not considered carefully enough.  The Minister for Lands in the exercise of his functions under this Bill would have had to procure the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Where finance is concerned there necessarily would have to be the consent of the Minister for Finance.  That is more or less a standard provision in all legislation but we could not agree that in the carrying out of his normal functions, functions which would have no financial implications as often as not, the Minister for Lands should seek the consent of the Minister for Finance and we suggested the deletion of this subsection.  We gratefully acknowledge the fact that the Minister has seen our point of view and is now proposing its deletion and we gladly agree to the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5a:</P>
      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 16 to 19.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is again based on the concern in all the amendments I have <Col N="124" /> submitted so far.  I do not want to repeat but the opportunity must not pass without reminding the House of the vital importance of conservation and preservation.  Opposition in this country is traditional and Joseph Tomelty in some play or other talks about the Irish people being the most conservative in the world.  He was not too far from the truth.  Constituents make requests to me about, perhaps, the reconstruction of a roadway.  I attend to those requests and when I ultimately tell them that the corporation propose to reconstruct the roadway they seem to be quite happy. However, from the moment the reconstruction starts I get various expressions of sentimentality and concern because of the removal of something that was familiar.  There is a certain attachment to the familiar and there is a kind of reluctance to be parted from it even though it can be clearly shown that the new situation will be infinitely preferable.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is the section giving muscle to the Minister in the implementation of this Bill.  Subsection (5) of section 11 provides:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section shall restrict, prejudice or affect the performance by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries of any function which could have been performed by him immediately before the commencement of this section.</P>
    <P>Though the Minister for Lands could demonstrate that what he proposed to do was in accordance with the spirit and the letter of this Bill, indispensable to conservation and preservation, if that impinged in any way on any function hitherto performed by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, then the latter could veto what the Minister for Lands proposed, even though the proposition could be deemed absolutely necessary for conservation or preservation.  For the life of me I cannot understand why such a restriction should be imposed in this Bill.  Again I am afraid it refers to the in-fighting, the friendly rivalry that exists between Departments.  What we are seeing here is a product of, I do <Col N="125" /> not want to say horse trading but of the bartering and bargaining which took place before this legislation was introduced.  Where hitherto the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, has been giving grants to a farmer for the provision of piggeries and where it can be shown that the slurry which emanates from that piggery is doing untold harm to wildlife in the area, how could any Minister with responsibilities for the preservation of wildlife agree that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries must be allowed to continue to do that?  Surely what the Minister for Lands should be saying here is that, where it can be shown that a person, institution or Department are doing anything which is in conflict with the terms of this legislation, they must be stopped.  The damage which is being done must be indicated to them.  Where it is possible to negotiate, to get agreement from consultation, that should be done, but if the Minister for Lands has a case and can show that the continuance of any exercise by anybody is prejudical to this legislation, then that operation, whatever it is, must stop.</P>
    <P>Somebody else can argue the merits of the piggery and the dependence of the farmer on it.  If that were put to me at another time, I could so argue. However, as far as the Minister for Lands is concerned, with this responsibility on his shoulders, he should not hand over this power of veto to any other Minister.  In the years that lie ahead of us and in the changes which are envisaged in respect of the intensification of agricultural activity, one can see many areas where not just native farmers but farmers from outside, whose sole concern will be the mighty dollar or the sick pound, will have very little regard for conservation.</P>
    <P>Are we, too, in those circumstances to accept that because, as the Minister's predecessor would have said, these are matters of bread and butter, we cannot touch them.  I do not think so.  I appreciate that what I am saying now might be misinterpreted by people who would say Deputy Tunney is more concerned about the preservation of the partridge and the woodcock or more concerned that we should have <Col N="126" /> bullfinch and pheasant and nature reserves, than that we should have a thriving bacon industry.  Anybody who is mean enough to misinterpret what I am saying in that way is welcome to it. I can argue equally well as to the value and importance of conservation which, as I said earlier on, will be growing in a way which will demonstrate to all that what we have been engaging in here in Committee is not something which is superfluous or superficial but which is as relevant and important to the lives of the people as the bacon industry or any other industry.</P>
    <P>If one is to stay with the matter of industry, I can develop my side of the argument to show that perhaps ultimately, and maybe not so ultimately either, that in respect of economic matters conservation and preservation could&mdash;in relation to tourism, for example be as good a moneyspinner as the bacon or any other industry.  I am only saying that by the way.  What I am really concerned about is that the Minister for Lands should have agreed to this state of affairs.  Maybe it was done under duress; I do not know. However, I know that in other areas there is a recognition of the importance of our having due regard for the position of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the OPW and the other agencies which are vitally connected with the lives of the people.  Nevertheless there is no need whatsoever for the assurance we are giving in this section to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>I am not too sure that the farmers would wish the Minister to have this assurance.  Maybe we are treating too lightly the proven interest which farmers have in wildlife.  I am quite sure that if approached in the correct fashion, as will be necessary, the farmers will be as appreciative and as responsive to requests which will be made to them in the interest of wildlife as anybody else and that this subsection here does not represent the true wishes of the farming community. Apart from that, I think it puts upon the Minister for Lands restrictions which he could not tolerate and it reduces the whole of this legislation to little more than a pious aspiration.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tunney has put the case for the acceptance of this amendment very well.  This matter was discussed at length at the Special Committee and the Minister seemed satisfied with our arguments.  I should like to know if the former Minister for Lands had any discussions with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries on this matter.  It seems that such discussions took place and that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries won out.  As a result we are back to where we started.  In my view the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries can now run counter to the Minister for Lands because of this subsection and can do things which are completely at variance with the policies of the Minister for Lands. During the discussion on this section at the Special Committee I mentioned that boards of fishery conservators pay a bounty for the destruction of otters and that these boards are controlled by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  However, while such boards offer bounties for the destruction of otters the Minister for Lands, in this Bill, seeks to preserve otters. That is an example of how the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would be running counter to the policies of the Minister for Lands.  I appeal to the new Minister for Lands to accept Deputy Tunney's amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to support my colleagues in urging the acceptance of this amendment by the Minister.  Our seeking the deletion of subsection (5) of section 11 can be related to the other amendment which we have to subsections (5) (b), (c) and (d).  In general, as Deputy Tunney has stated, our approach to this Bill is to try to make it an effective piece of legislation.  Throughout the debate we are seeking to strengthen the hand of the Minister for Lands as our conservation Minister.  We do not want this legislation to become a piece of useless paper.  We do not want the Minister for Lands to have to pay lip service to the ideals of conservation.  We want this to become practical, workable legislation with the Minister for Lands capable of exercising real <Col N="128" /> power and capable of acting positively, definitely and constructively under the provisions of the legislation. The Minister has already agreed to delete subsection (4), a provision which would have been a ridiculous constraint to place on the Minister for Lands in his attempt to implement these provisions but the existence of subsections (4) and (5) in the original Bill does give great credence to the proposal of Deputy Tunney and Deputy Daly that there was departmental in-fighting in the production of this legislation.  In effect, these two very powerful Departments, the Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries and Finance, said &ldquo;You can have your wildlife legislation but, as far as we are concerned, we are going to carry on exactly as we always did.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The fact that these two subsections are there indicates that there is a great deal of truth in our allegation. Subsection (4) has gone but we want to get rid of subsection (5) also because it is too naked in its provisions. It takes the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries totally out of the ambit of the legislation and puts him aside. It creates a situation where the Minister for Lands with all the goodwill and good intentions in the world could be striving to conserve wildlife and could pursue the policies envisaged in this legislation while the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would have no regard for his efforts and would, in fact, be of no assistance to him.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in many instances would act prejudicially to what the Minister for Lands would be seeking to achieve.</P>
      <P>At this stage I should like to join with my colleagues in welcoming Deputy Donegan to this new ministry. We all know that his predecessor, Deputy Fitzpatrick, was very keen on this legislation and I am certain that the present Minister as an individual with his association with rural life will be equally keen.  I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the wording of subsection (5) which is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing in this section shall restrict, prejudice or affect the performance by the Minister for <Col N="129" /> Agriculture and Fisheries of any function which could have been performed by him immediately before the commencement of this section.</P>
    <P>One might go along with the first word, &ldquo;restrict&rdquo;.  In other words, in pursuance of his onerous and heavy responsibilities to our farmers the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries could not be restricted in his powers but it is going too far to include the words &ldquo;prejudice or affect&rdquo;.  One must recognise that it would completely nullify some of the desirable provisions of this legislation if certain things the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has been doing up to now would not be affected in any way.  We do not want to take the powers away from the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries; we do not want to deprive him of powers and functions he already has but it is going ridiculously far to say that the performance of those functions shall not be affected in any way by this legislation.  That is equivalent to saying that as far as the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and his Department are concerned this legislation will not exist.  None of us intend that to be the case.  We want the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to pursue his duty and carry out his functions in the best interests of the farming community but at the same time we all want him, in doing his job, to have regard to the requirements of conservation and to have regard to the provisions of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands will not be able to argue that it is necessary to keep subsection (5).  All the powers, duties and obligations which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has at present will remain; they will not be interfered with by the deletion of subsection (5).  Deleting subsection (5) will mean that he must take cognisance of the purposes and objectives of this legislation in the way in which he carries out his duties and functions.</P>
    <P>One particular aspect of this matter which I want to draw to the attention of the Minister and the House is that the subsection refers to the Minister <Col N="130" /> for Agriculture and Fisheries.  One would be inclined to accept that on its face value and think it is simply a matter of the Ministers for Lands and Agriculture and Fisheries having a discussion about some particular aspects of policy and deciding which of them should take precedence or whose views should prevail&mdash;whether the basic needs of farmers and agriculture should prevail over the needs of conservation and wildlife.</P>
    <P>I would be prepared to accept the situation of two Government colleagues coming to a reasonable compromise. When this subsection refers to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries it means every officer of his Department&mdash;every inspector, every official in the field and in the confines of the Department.  It would mean, in effect, that every member of the staff of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the county committees of agriculture and so on could completely ignore the provisions of this legislation in going about their daily business.  There is no doubt that the effect of the subsection would be that any inspector or field officer of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries would be entitled to pursue his activities without reference to this legislation.  He would be entitled to say: &ldquo;That does not apply to me.  I can discharge my duties as I have always discharged them, as the terms of section 11 (5) remove me from the effects of this legislation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should not think exclusively in terms of one Minister in relation to another.  We should realise that this extends to the extremities of the activities of both Departments.  It is not difficult to conjure up a whole area where the activities of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, if they were to be carried out without regard to the provisions of this legislation, could be inimical to conservation and wildlife. Deputy Tunney referred to piggeries and the effluent from them.  There are countless other instances where it would be likely that a zealous field officer of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries would feel obliged to pursue his particular objectives in a <Col N="131" /> one-track way without regard to any legislation.  There is everything to be said for deleting subsection (5) and bringing about a situation where the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would not be deprived of any power or would not be restricted in the carrying out of his policy and objectives but would have to have regard to the existence of this legislation and not be placed totally outside it, as he will be if subsection (5) remains unaltered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This was debated at length in Special Committee and an undertaking was given to have all the points raised examined.  This has been done and I am satisfied that this provision is necessary and will not inhibit in any material way the functions of the Minister for Lands under this section.  In as much as the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries also has research and other functions in relation to wild animals in respect of disease, it would be untenable to interfere with these functions.</P>
      <P>The restrictions in this subsection apply only to the provisions of section 11 and not to the measure as a whole. I am surprised that Deputy Haughey, who held the office of Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, should not realise that a Minister is not what he would wish to be.  When he accepts the portfolio, he accepts the good and the bad.  Whether the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries likes it or not, he has the responsibility of signing international veterinary certificates. As well as that he must try to stop the spread of disease.  These matters mean that there is a criss-crossing of the duties of two Ministers. If we lived in Heaven, it would be possible not to have such criss-crossing, but as we live in a valley of tears it is, unfortunately, a fact of life that such criss-crossing in practical terms will occur.  Therefore, the way out of the situation is that the content of subsection (5) applies only in respect of section 11.  If Opposition Members look at section 12, they will see that there is a way to ensure that there is no dereliction of the rights of wildlife or the desire to propagate wildlife.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the Minister's explanation in regard to deleting subsection (5).  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has authority over the Minister for Lands and can say: &ldquo;You must do this&rdquo;, or &ldquo;You cannot do that&rdquo;.  The question of consultation does not enter the case.  Deputy Daly referred to the bounty paid on otters.  This is a situation in which conflict could occur. The Minister has given us an example in respect of disease.  If that is the case, why not confine the subsection to disease eradication?  This subsection relates to any function undertaken by the Minister for Lands.  All these functions would be affected. Nothing that would affect the performance of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would be affected by this subsection.</P>
      <P>The Minister should accept that both the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Lands should be equal partners in their policy-making as regards their different Departments, two very important Departments might I add.  There is no point in talking about goodwill because we are talking here about statutory provisions.  We can have consultation between Ministers, although with the Minister for Lands in Castlebar and his partner, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, elsewhere, it might be difficult to have consultation.  Remember that a great delay in taking steps to remedy any dangers to the environment or to wildlife could be detrimental to the conservation of wildlife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask one other question. One wonders why the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is the only Minister mentioned in the section. Surely one could mention half a dozen other Ministers whose Departments and functions may be affected, other Ministers who would have authority over the Minister for Lands in his duties.  The Minister for Lands should be an equal partner in this policy-making and decision-making, <Col N="133" /> and I am asking the Minister to have this subsection deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that it has not been possible for the Minister to accept this amendment.  I take from the Minister that, since Committee Stage and resulting from what was indicated there, representations were made to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and his Department in the hope, presumably, that their acceptance of the inhibiting nature of this subsection would have been obtained.  For reasons best known to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries they continue apparently to insist that, as far as the land of Ireland is concerned, they have an interest which is superior to all else. Perhaps it is that or, indeed, some other reason, that explains their obstinacy. If that is the case, the Department of Lands should indicate the position as being such and indicate to the House that they are not entirely happy with the position they find themselves in <i>vis-á-vis</i> this legislation and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
      <P>I venture to suggest to the Minister, as I did earlier, that this is the important section of the whole legislation. Section 11 (1) says:</P>
      <P>It shall be a function of the Minister to secure the conservation of wildlife.</P>
      <P>That is his function which we have learned since the debate began.  It is also his duty and his responsibility to secure the conservation of wildlife. There are subsequent subsections which refine that and indicate the manner in which he is obliged and committed to carry out that duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been said by Deputy Haughey and other Deputies, subsection (5) nullifies the whole lot because we are told in section 11 (5) that nothing in the section restricts the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and so on.  We do not have to consult any legislation dealing with interpretation or definitions to know what the word &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; means.  I think there is acceptance from all as to the meaning of the word &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;.  So, in short what the Minister for Lands is <Col N="134" /> telling us is that even though he can do nothing which will affect, restrict or prejudice the performance of duties by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, he is happy nonetheless that he can perform the duties and functions which rest on him under this legislation.  Personally, I do not and cannot believe it and nobody else believes it.  I am sure the Minister himself does not believe it because the contradiction there is quite obvious.  If the Minister is obliged to pursue his responsibility as required of him under section 11 with one eye over either shoulder looking for and worrying about the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, then he is not going to be in a position to discharge his duties under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about correspondence crossing between Departments and the interest but I venture to suggest that the interest of the two Departments must represent the interest of the people of Ireland.  The land of Ireland belongs to and is held in trust by the farmers of Ireland for the people of Ireland.  I know that the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have responsibilities and that they are engaged and act in a fashion beneficial to the farming community and to the people generally.  However, as I said earlier, I do not think that the Minister has demonstrated that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will be acting in the best interests, in the long term certainly, of the people of Ireland by preventing the Minister for Lands from carrying out his duties in respect of securing the conservation of wildlife.  In so far as the Minister has indicated the position, I feel that the case I am making is fairly hopeless as the Minister has not now the opportunity of replying any further. However, I want it on record that what we are agreeing to here is, by its very nature, putting a serious brake on what it is hoped to do under this legislation.  Anybody looking at it must see it in the same light.</P>
    <P>I appreciate, too, that there can be no departure from what is here.  I am mindful that it is 46 years since we last had legislation dealing with the conservation of wildlife and it may be <Col N="135" /> that 46 years will pass before we deal with it again.  Meanwhile, we are at the mercy of civil servants.  In saying that I do not want to castigate our civil servants in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>While the responsibility rests with the Minister, we know that his civil servants, his able, industrious, efficient, conscientious civil servants are renowned for what is written in statute.  That is the nature of their calling.  I am not blaming them for the damage that will flow from this but rather ourselves, we who are making this legislation. When this legislation leaves here it will be interpreted by the civil servants in the way that is indicated here.</P>
      <P>What we are saying to the Minister and his officials is that in any area, on any occasion, when what they propose in the interests of securing the conservation of wildlife can be shown to affect, or to be prejudicial in any way to functions hitherto performed by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, they may not proceed. Could there be anything as prohibitive or as restrictive on any Minister hoping to carry out his functions under any legislation?  I do not think that on the Statute Book of this or any other country any Minister has accepted an impediment or inhibition of that nature.  For my part it reduces any contribution I may make to this legislation to a very insignificant level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, perhaps the interest which the Government are showing in this legislation is reflected in the fact that since this Minister took up his new position he has not had the companionship or the voice of even one member of the two Government parties.  Perhaps there is an eagerness to shove through this House legislation which will be known as the Wildlife Act and they can claim at the next election: &ldquo;It was I who introduced and carried through the Wildlife Act&rdquo;.  For any ephemeral honour that might go to any Minister <Col N="136" /> for such a boast, I say he is welcome to it.  Time will show that this legislation is not what was hoped for or promised in consultations between the Minister's Department and representatives of different organisations, clubs and associations, especially voluntary organisations, who have a sincere and genuine interest in the conservation of wildlife.  This is perfect evidence of that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to pursue this any further except to say to anybody interested in the preservation of wildlife, and I know there are thousands of people who have a genuine interest, that I do not want to supplant Old Moore, but I will be prophetic and say that this House will rue the day we did not remove subsection (5) from section 11.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5b:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 42, to delete &ldquo;is&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 12 is a very important section and is related to the area we have been discussing in our attempt to delete subsection (5) from section 11.  This section seeks to set out the lines of demarcation between the Minister for Lands, exercising his functions and authority under this legislation, and the various other Ministers and institutions of State.  To that extent this is a very crucial section and one which has a very important bearing on the very basis of the operation of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not difficult to envisage the provision of section 12 becoming of critical importance to the Minister for Lands in the exercise of his functions. Various suggestions are made from time to time by people interested in <Col N="137" /> the area of the conservation of wildlife and associated areas, that there should be a Minister for Conservation. One Minister should be charged solely with the responsibility for the preservation and protection of our environment.</P>
    <P>This legislation impinges on that area.  It does not set out to make the Minister for Lands our Minister for the Environment, but it sets out to give him very important functions in the area of the preservation and protection of our natural environment. Therefore, it is very important that this legislation sets out as clearly as possible where the demarcation of authority will be and what say the Minister for Lands will have in the exercise of his powers under this Bill over the actions and policies of his colleagues and other State and semi-State bodies and agencies.</P>
    <P>We are dissatisfied with section 12 as it stands.  We do not think it gives the Minister for Lands sufficient standing to enable him to discharge his functions satisfactorily.  Unfortunately, the section does not go far enough and in amendments Nos. 5b to 5e we seek to strengthen the section and to ensure that the Minister for Lands will have some degree of authority over his colleagues and the general machinery of the State in the interests of wildlife conservation.</P>
    <P>The first of these amendments proposes to delete &ldquo;is&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  It should be quite clear why we have put down this amendment. Section 12 at the moment, in subsection (2) (a), stipulates that &ldquo;before determining any matter or doing anything which is, in his or their opinion, or is represented by the Minister to the other Minister of State, or the authority or body to be likely or liable to affect, or to interfere with, the suitability for a nature reserve or refuge&rdquo;, and so on, a Minister for State other than the Minister, and every authority or body to which the section applies, shall consult the Minister as regards the avoidance or minimising of such effect or interference. The amendment would broaden the scope of the provision because as it is the subsection would be <Col N="138" /> very restricted.  It should be beyond doubt a matter in which wildlife conservation would be involved.  We want to ensure that where any of these people or bodies are of the opinion that what is about to be done might impinge on the conservation of wildlife, the provision of the subsection will come into effect.</P>
    <P>If paragraph (a) is studied it will be seen why this amendment is necessary. At the moment the subsection confines its operation to cases in which the Minister or State agency or body might interfere with the suitability for a nature reserve or refuge of land to which an establishment order, a recognition order or a designation order should apply, and so on.  That is restrictive.  It means that before the provisions of the section can come into operation, what the other body or person or Minister is about to do must impinge on all of these things. We want to broaden that and to make it the position that where what the Minister or authority or body are about to do would affect or impinge on wildlife conservation generally, this provision shall apply and not just in regard to particular restricted areas.  That is a reasonable expansion. Section 12 at the moment is limited to the point where it would be ineffective if its provisions are to apply to the particular things.</P>
    <P>In Chapter II, section 15, the Bill sets out to have a number of new situations.  It deals with the establishment of nature reserves and the management of lands owned by the Minister or by the State.  Section 16 deals with the establishment of nature reserves on private lands.  It deals with the direction of the Minister for Lands that certain private lands should be refuges for fauna; and section 17 deals with agreements about the manner in which certain lands are to be used.  That is a fairly confined segment of the activities of the Minister and of his performance in regard to this legislation, confining itself to State lands, private lands to be regarded as reserves and private lands which will become the refuges of fauna, as well as lands in relation to which agreement is reached between <Col N="139" /> the Minister and the owners. In effect, we want to say that where any Minister or other body is about to do something which in their opinion may impinge on wildlife in general, and not on these particular lands, the provisions of section 12 will have effect.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 5d we seek to amend paragraph (b) of subsection (2). As it stands at the moment the paragraph stipulates:</P>
    <P>take all practicable steps to avoid or minimise such effect or interference.</P>
    <P>That leaves the situation very wide. Who is to decide what the practicable steps are to be&mdash;the Minister, the commissioners or the statutory body?  Is the decision to be left to them or any one of them?  As the section stands it is. Any of these bodies or any Minister could, first of all, unilaterally decide whether the actions would impinge and also decide what practicable steps should be taken.  Our amendment seeks to delete &ldquo;all practicable steps&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;such steps as may be indicated by the Minister to be necessary&rdquo;. Our aim is to strengthen the section by inserting in it the provision that the steps that are to be taken to avoid the ill-effects of any action by these bodies would be decided by the Minister for Lands and that it would not be left at large to be decided by the person himself or somebody else.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5e sets out to change the whole impact of subsection (3), which removes from the operation of subsection (2) various things, first of all anything done in an emergency. That is all right, but the subsection also removes the functions of the Minister for Local Government or a planning authority under sections 3 and 4 of the 1963 Planning and Development Act, or Part V of that Act other than sections 47 to 49.  It removes the Minister for Local Government as planning Minister and it removes planning authorities from the provisions of subsection (2).  They can proceed to do what they like without any reference to what effect their action will have on the conservation of wildlife or on the nature reserves and refuges established <Col N="140" /> by the Minister, if this section is to remain in its present form.</P>
    <P>As it stands, subsection (3) would exempt from the operation of subsection (2) the functions of the Commissioners of Public Works under the Arterial Drainage Acts, 1945 and 1955. That is a ridiculous situation.  Section 12 would be largely inoperative if the Commissioners of Public Works could proceed with their arterial drainage schemes without any regard to the impact of those schemes on the nature reserves which this Bill goes to great trouble to enable the Minister to establish.</P>
    <P>The effect of amendment 5e would be to restrict the operation of subsection (3) to cases of emergency.  Subsection (3) would then read:</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of this section shall not apply in relation to any determination made or anything done in an emergency.</P>
    <P>In other words, the provisions of subsection (2) would be operative except where there is an emergency.  All these other people would have to have regard to the provisions of subsection (2) if they were doing anything that, in their opinion or in the opinion of the Minister for Lands, might affect nature reserves and refuges as the Bill states at present, and also the conservation of wildlife in general as we would like it.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not taken too long over that.  I considered it necessary to explain that the four amendments must be taken together.  Their overall purpose is to make section 12 worth while and meaningful and to ensure that in future where a local authority, the Commissioners of Public Works, a State body or any other Minister is about to do something which in their opinion might impinge detrimentally on the conservation of wildlife or on the nature reserves or refuges established by the Minister they shall have to have regard to this legislation in what they are doing and shall have to take whatever steps the Minister for Lands considers necessary to minimise the effect of their actions.  The only exception would be where any of the <Col N="141" /> bodies do something in an emergency situation.  In that case we are exempting them from the necessity to consult with the Minister for Lands and to take whatever measures he lays down.</P>
    <P>Taken together, these four amendments considerably improve section 12 and make it worth while.  As it is the crucial section to the whole administration of this legislation, I urge the Minister to accept them.  I do not think that he can on reasonable grounds object to our strengthening section 12 in this way so far as he is concerned.</P>

      <P>With respect and in friendship, I think it is a lot more elegant than the Opposition proposal. With regard to amendment No. 5c, this section is related specifically to special areas of particular wildlife value which have been established as nature reserves and refuges.  It would be unreasonable and impracticable to extend the restrictions of the section any further.  In the circumstances, I am not prepared to accept amendment No. 5c.</P>
      <P>I regret I am not prepared to accept amendment No. 5d.  In the interest of maintaining a proper balance in this legislation, I am satisfied the existing wording should be retained.  I am satisfied that the consultative arrangements provided will afford adequate safeguard for the interests of wildlife.</P>
      <P>The effect of amendment No. 5e would be to delete subsection (3) (b) and (c).  I am not prepared to agree to this because in deleting paragraph (b) theoretically every planning application in a planning authority area that contains nature reserves or refuges would have to be vetted by the Minister for Lands and this would be totally unreasonable.  I am satisfied that the Minister for Local Government and the planning authorities are fully conscious of their responsibilities with regard to the natural environment in determining planning applications.</P>
      <P>The subject matter of (3) (c) is adequately covered in section 41 which obliges the Office of Public Works to consult the Minister in relation to land drainage which might affect special wildlife areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I have the same faith in planning authorities as has the Minister.  A planning authority are obliged at quinquennial periods to prepare draft plans and that is the basis for their assessment of any application that comes before them.  I do not think they are at liberty or that they feel compelled to have regard to the conservation of wildlife or nature reserves unless that is indicated in their plan.  So far as local authorities are concerned, they take pride in the fact that they will not depart from what was accepted in the draft development <Col N="143" /> plan.  I do not know how the Minister can assume in respect of provisions not made in the plan that he can count on their co-operation with regard to this legislation.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 5b the Minister is on extraordinarily delicate ground when he bases his rejection of the amendment on what might be regarded as grammatical grounds.  He indicated that the alteration envisaged by the substitution of &ldquo;may&rdquo; for &ldquo;is&rdquo; would require three other alterations.  When queried he gave one example of where he thought the changing of the initial &ldquo;is&rdquo; would weaken subsequent phrases.  I note he did not proceed beyond the one example which I think he realises was not a very forceful one and was not a very soundly based one.  If that is the only basis on which he is rejecting it he might have second thoughts about it.  I am not conceding the point made by the Minister but whether we should be over concerned about the precision of the paragraph is a matter about which I have no doubt.  Everything in legislation should be as perfect and as precise as possible.  Before agreeing to submit this amendment I had the normal layman's regard for how the substitution of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; might affect or influence the remainder of paragraph (a) of subsection (2).  I convinced myself that nothing would derive from the initial alteration which would affect in any way what already appeared in relation to the English language.</P>
      <P>I assume the grounds on which the Minister based his rejection of the amendment are as delicate as the grounds on which he based his concern for the English language.  Perhaps if he were pushed a little further on amendment 5b he might yield on it. I see the Minister shakes his head in disagreement.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister made a case in that regard. One might be inclined to stay with it if he advanced some other argument. The case he made in that respect is a fairly flimsy one, to say the least of it.  In relation to amendment 5d you can get a presentation of balance invariably from the person who is benefiting from it.  I do not think we can assume the proper balance to which the Minister refers and that it will come as readily as he indicates.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Haughey said, and I repeat, all these amendments have been submitted with a view to our strengthening the hand of the Minister and giving to this legislation the teeth which we believe it has not got and without which it will be rather ineffective. If the Minister will not budge beyond his over-regard for the English language, his faith in planning authorities which I do not share and his acceptance of the proper balance, to which he referred, I suppose I would only be wasting whatever sweetness I have by staying any further on these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not get involved in the difference between &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;is&rdquo;, as this has already been covered.  The original explanation which was issued regarding section 12 states that it is intended to ensure that other Departments of State and certain other public bodies would consult the Minister before taking decisions on projects or undertake activities which might affect adversely the wildlife values in nature reserves. This is very desirable.  The Minister comes along and exempts the commissioners <Col N="145" /> under the Arterial Drainage Acts.  The Minister's reply seems to say that this is covered under section 41.  I do not think so.  This section is very limited and confined.  What we are trying to do here is most desirable.</P>
      <P>Why should the commissioners be exempted?  Arterial drainage has done damage, especially in fisheries, up to now.  If consultations had taken place beforehand, this could have been avoided.  It would have avoided the cost which the commissioners have had to bear of restoring spawning beds which need never have been removed. Spawning beds which were removed during drainage had to be replaced at enormous cost when the drainage had been completed.</P>
      <P>The Minister will strengthen this section if he does what we are asking him to do.  I appeal to him to reconsider the amendment we have submitted about the functions of the commissioners under the Arterial Drainage Acts.  It is most desirable that this amendment be included.  I do not think the argument the Minister gave&mdash;that section 41 strengthens his hand&mdash;is good enough.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this amendment before we move on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the argument made by Deputy Tunney and Deputy Daly in regard to the amendments we are discussing together.  I cannot understand why the Minister will not accept the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in amendment 5b.  We are talking about Ministers other than the Minister for Lands.  I believe if the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; was included here we would have better legislation because it would be open to these Ministers to be advised and receive more consultations concerning their functions.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5c proposes to insert &ldquo;the conservation of wildlife&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;with&rdquo;.  After all, this is what the Bill is about, the conservation of wildlife.  It relates to the conservation of wildlife on land and in the sea.  It is hard to understand why the Minister cannot include this provision in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) (a) deals with various reserves and refuges.  It is important <Col N="146" /> to realise that shortly we will be discussing under sections 15, 16, 17 and 18 the establishment of nature reserves on State lands as outlined in section 15 and on private lands as outlined in section 17.  Sections 17 and 18 deal with the measures to safeguard wildlife habitats and to make agreements with landowners for the management of the land in the interests of conservation.  For that reason section 12 is very important.  It is important to have teeth in this section because it bears on the other sections with which we will be dealing. Subsection (2) (b) provides that a Minister of State other than the Minister and every authority or body to which this section applies shall take all practical steps to avoid or minimise such effect or interference.  The Minister for Lands will be directing the steps to be taken.  He will have the authority and the power to exercise his functions with regard to wildlife.</P>
    <P>I support what Deputy Daly said about the exclusion of the functions of the Minister for Local Government and also the functions of the Commissioners of Public Works.  We had a long discussion about drainage at the Special Committee.  We had further discussions on section 43 as it then was.  I made the point, which was supported by Deputies from rural areas on the Special Committee, that there was a need to tackle the drainage problem in rural areas, and particularly in the west.  We were given to understand that the hold up in these drainage schemes was due to lack of finance.  We were informed that the hold up in a number of those schemes, particularly in Dunkellin drainage scheme, the river which flows through a great part of County Galway, was that the wildlife sanctuary was situated at Rahasane near Craughwell.</P>
    <P>I believe drainage could be carried out in a way that would be consistent with the aims and the wishes of the great majority of people to have conservation included.  As other speakers have said, it is true that damage was done in the past.  It is very important that there should be consultation between these bodies and the Minister.  How do we know <Col N="147" /> they will consult with the Minister? If they do not, what does the Minister do?  He cannot force them to consult with him about the drainage of an area.  I am sure I speak for many other Deputies when I say there is a big problem of drainage in rural Ireland.  I believe it can be carried out consistent with the aims of this Bill and the aims of conservation generally. If the amendments we propose to this section were accepted, the Minister would have more power and more authority to promote conservation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot but be a bit depressed by the Minister's reply to the arguments we put forward in favour of these amendments.  It seems to me that his attitude to our attempt to improve section 12 was very flatfooted. In effect he said &ldquo;I do not think this is a good amendment and I am not accepting it&rdquo;.  He did not attempt to argue at all the merits of the proposal we put forward.  Let me first of all deal with his rather niggling and mean little suggestion that we were guilty of grammatical carelessness in amendment No. 5b.  My colleague and I studied subsection (2) (a) carefully. I do not think the Minister who is responsible for the section in its present form can attack anybody for slovenliness in attempting to amend it, because it is a particularly awkward piece of phraseology as it stands.  It provides:</P>
      <P>...before determining any matter or doing anything which is, in his or their opinion or is represented by the Minister to the other Minister of State, or the authority or body to be likely or liable to affect, or to interfere with, the suitability for a nature reserve or a refuge...</P>
      <P>&mdash;and so on.  It is very complicated inelegant language as it stands.  We carefully considered whether it would be necessary to change any of the rest of the wording as a result of our substituting &ldquo;may&rdquo; for &ldquo;is&rdquo; in line 42.  We came to the conclusion that it was not and that it would read perfectly well with the alteration which would read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> ...before determining any matter or doing anything which may, in his or their opinion, or is represented by the Minister to the other Minister of State, or the authority or body...</P>
    <P>&mdash;and so on.  I do not think there is any point in the argument put forward by the Minister.  He ignored our principal argument which connects these four amendments together, that is, to try to ensure that the other institutions of the State, whether they be Ministers, or State bodies, or whatever, in going about their normal activities would have due regard to the provisions of this Bill.  If they were about to do anything which in their opinion could conceivably impinge on conservation of wildlife generally as well as the reserves and refuges, they would have to consult with the Minister for Lands and take whatever steps he indicates were necessary to minimise any damage that might be done.  That is a very reasonable proposition.  If our four amendments are accepted, that is the way the section would stand.  At present it is so effete in its terms as to be practically useless.  First of all, the planning authority&mdash;no matter what the Minister may say about the responsibilities and outlook of planning authorities&mdash;is removed from the provisions of section 12 by paragraph (b) of subsection (3); so are the Commissioners of Public Works.  Those are two very important institutions.  Their removal from the ambit of the section makes it a very ineffectual section indeed.</P>
    <P>What does paragraph (b) of subsection (2) mean as it stands?  It means that the other Minister of State, or the other body, if satisfied after consultation with the Minister for Lands that what they are about to do would be detrimental, should take all practical steps to avoid or minimise such effect or interference.  I submit that that leaves the decision to them and that that is not good enough.  It should be the Minister for Lands who should decide what practical steps are to be taken to minimise the detrimental effects of the action involved.  It is quite absurd to leave it to the offending body themselves to take that <Col N="149" /> decision.  It is also quite absurd to restrict the operation of section 12 to the reserves and refuges.  That is not sufficient.  These Ministers and bodies carry out activities all over the country.  In fact the occasions when their activities would impinge on the reserves or refuges would be very few; they would be minimal in relation to their overall activities.  What we are trying to achieve is that when activities they are about to engage in in any part of the country would interfere with, threaten or impinge on the conservation of wildlife, then they would have to consult the Minister. Surely that is reasonable.  Section 12 would be a very artificial and ineffectual one if left in its present form.  The overwhelming portion of the activities of Ministers and of these bodies would be in circumstances completely removed from the reserves and refuges about which we are speaking. We want to say that the section would come into effect where anything these people were thinking of doing would affect the conservation of wildlife in general and not just the reserves and refuges.  That is eminently reasonable.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply, suggested that section 41 takes care of the problem in regard to the Commissioners of Public Works carrying out arterial drainage.  Section 41 does not.  The only way the Commissioners of Public Works, in carrying out arterial drainage, could be controlled in so far as conservation of wildlife is concerned is to include them in the provisions of section 12.  It is a serious omission to leave paragraph (c) in subsection (3) and exempt the Commissioners of Public Works from the provisions of section 12.  It could do untold damage to the conservation of wildlife throughout the country because, if the Minister has his way, the Commissioners of Public Works, so far as arterial drainage is concerned, will only have to consider reserves and refuges and will not have to consider the overall effects of their activities in regard to wildlife outside those reserves and refuges.  Surely that is not acceptable to any of us.  In fact, bringing the Commissioners of Public Works into the picture so far as arterial drainage <Col N="150" /> is concerned in regard to reserves and refuges is the least important aspect because those reserves and refuges will have the attention of the Minister's Department, skilled management, expert advice and so on.  To a large extent they will be protected anyway.  The Commissioners of Public Works in their arterial drainage would probably have a minimal effect on them because of the way they are run and organised.  But it is the activities of the Commissioners of Public Works in so far as the general country is concerned, outside of these reserves and refuges, that are important. That is precisely what the Minister is exempting from control under section 12.  That is why we put down amendment 5c&mdash;to ensure that the Minister for Local Government, the planning authorities and the Commissioners of Public Works all have a responsibility to consult the Minister for Lands about the conservation of wildlife generally in so far as the general ambit of their activities is concerned.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Tunney said earlier, one is swimming against the tide here.  This is Report Stage.  The Minister has spoken and cannot speak again.  He has indicated that he is not a bit impressed by these amendments, so that no matter how forcibly we put our argument to him it will not avail us anything.  At least we are doing what we can to make this Bill workable and effective.  Section 12 is a key section from that point of view.  As it stands, it is of no particular significance.  Let us face it.  It will not really achieve anything.  It is a sort of whitewashing provision.  It purports to attempt to make these other people consult the Minister for Lands.  But, so far as the important people are concerned, they are exempted from that provision and, in so far as the others are concerned, it is only idle consultation in regard to a very limited aspect of their activities, namely, the reserves and refuges.</P>
    <P>We have pressed these amendments as strongly as we can and we shall have to leave it at that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 15 deals with an important provision in this Bill which provides for the establishment of nature reserves and refuges on Government lands.  Everybody appreciates the need for and the merit of that section.  One is at a loss to understand why subsection <Col N="153" /> (2) requires that the Minister must consult with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and with the Minister for Transport and Power and need not necessarily consult with the Minister for Defence who is responsible for and holds an amount of land in this country.  I realise that I am not at liberty on Report Stage to make specific reference to the section itself, so I will confine myself to the terms of the amendment.  This section requires the Minister to consult with the Commissioners of Public Works before making an order to establish a reserve and to consult with other Departments on whose lands such a reserve might be established.  Subsection (7) indicates that:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall, as soon as may be after it is made, cause a copy of an order under this section to be sent to the Commissioners and to any planning authority within whose area the land comprised in the nature reserve, or any part thereof, is situate.</P>
    <P>We have the situation that this shall be done where in the opinion of the Minister, having consulted with other Ministers and other agencies, the view is held that it is vital to the conservation of wildlife that there should be an establishment order designating a certain area as a nature reserve or refuge.  All these consultations will have taken place and there will be an agreement, I understand, as to the need for the order.  The order cannot be made without that agreement.  Nonetheless, subsection (7), which is the last subsection of section 15, requires only that a copy of this order be sent to the commissioners and also to the local planning authority.  One might inquire what it is in aid of, why are we sending it?  One knows the destination of an order or any such document which might be sent, unless it is incumbent or required of the recipient to do something about it.</P>
    <P>As I see it, here we have yet again an example of the apologetic and useless exercise which we are indulging in in respect of this legislation.  We are making apologies for what we are doing, formally notifying people that <Col N="154" /> we have done something, as a result of our consulting with them and as a result of the acceptance of the desirability of designating this area as a nature reserve, and finally we are sending it to them just for the record. In sending it to them we should require them to have due regard for what appears in it.  The Minister will probably say it is understood that the commissioners and the planning authority will know that when they get it they are expected to have regard for it and to respect it.  My answer is that the commissioners and the planning authorities have respect for anything which they get in accordance with the law that governs it.  However, if they are not required to have respect for it, such respect will not be forthcoming and the copy of the order which the Minister has made may find itself in the wastepaper basket.  That possibility must be provided for.</P>
    <P>It is much more positive, direct and more in the interests of conservation that we throw from ourselves this cloak of subservience which we seem to have towards everything and anything, and that we have respect for what we are doing and that we recognise the importance of what we are doing.  As I said earlier in respect of amendment No. 5e, what guarantee have we that any local authority will have regard for what we send to them unless we enshrine it in legislation?  I am a member of a local authority and of a planning authority, and many documents and occasionally requests come to us.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the planning authority to these is &ldquo;What is required of us as a planning authority?  What action should we take on this?&rdquo; If, as was said of the jarvey and the traveller years ago, it is a case of &ldquo;I will leave it to yourself, sir&rdquo;, I do not think we will achieve much or that the order which is made will benefit to any great extent.  Accordingly, my amendment would require that the commissioners and every such planning authority shall have due regard in the performance of their functions to the existence of such order.  That is a very reasonable position.  It must be included if we <Col N="155" /> are to show the earnestness with which we are applying ourselves to the legislation before the House.  Otherwise, the subsection is an example again of what I referred to earlier&mdash; a pious aspiration.  We can operate it today as our credo but that will not of itself bring any worthwhile recognition.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will indicate his acceptance of the strength which this provision would add to the legislation.  There is nothing confusing about the amendment.  It is not controversial and is not framed in the type of difficult verbiage of earlier sections or, perhaps, of earlier amendments. It is in the form of a simple statement which contrasts with that other simple statement in subsection (7).  I suggest that when the Minister has a second look at subsection (7) he will realise that on its own it is a fairly useless provision.</P>
    <P>I refer again to the legislation which exists in respect of draft development plans.  The Parliamentary Secretary would be more conversant than I with that area.  These plans are agreed every five years.  There is a certain period during which objections may be lodged but once the plans have been agreed they stand for five years.  I know that there is provision for appeals to the Minister.  From this year these appeals will be to An Bord Pleanála but the commitment of the local planning authority is to what has been agreed and to what appears in the plans.  There is no point in saying, half-way through the plan &ldquo;Send it to the planning authority and let them see what we have done&rdquo;.  It would not even appear before the committee unless some member of that committee were interested enough.  In such case he might make some inquiries and might advocate that regard must be had for whatever order was involved. However, unless there are many sympathisers on the committee I would not be too hopeful as to the reaction which the placement of the order might receive.</P>
    <P>I see a much better and more positive line in our indicating to all planning authorities at the appropriate <Col N="156" /> time that these orders have been made, that we require that in the making of the authority's draft development plan due regard must be had to this fact.  Otherwise, as Deputy Haughey said in relation to section 12, we are merely window dressing, we are basing legislation on a certain optimism and on certain hopes that that for which we have responsibility will be provided by somebody else on whom there is no such responsibility.</P>
    <P>As the person on whom the duty falls the Minister must be prepared to advance the case in respect of orders which he makes.  No progress will attend the type of attitude which would involve him going no further than saying &ldquo;Look, boys, do the best you can with this&rdquo;.  I trust that the Minister will realise the wisdom, the prudence and the practicality of the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Tunney in relation to amendments Nos. 8a and 10a.  There is a simple net issue here.  Again, we come back to the question of whether we want this Bill to be an effective operative piece of legislation, or whether it will be to a large extent an empty formula or whether it will be real live practical legislation dealing with the situation and with the problems with which it is intended to deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding amendment 8a, we are concerned with the question of nature reserves which are to be created on lands owned by the Minister or by the State.  We had a fair amount of discussion on section 15 when we asked what was the need for this section, and, since the Minister owned these lands why is he not already in a position to do everything he wants to do with lands he holds or some other Minister holds.  In the Special Committee the Minister thought he should have these powers set out in section 15.  Then, in section 16, the Minister is taking power to designate certain private lands as refuges.  In regard to both of these the Minister is obliged by sections 15 and 16 to send an order to the planning authority and to the Commissioners of Public Works and, <Col N="157" /> so far as the Bill is concerned, that is the end of the matter.  He is not obliged to do anything more.</P>
    <P>What is the reality here?  Surely the reason for sending these orders to the planning authority is to ensure the authority takes cognisance of them, is aware that these reserves or refuges exist and that they should do something about them.  Otherwise there is no point in sending these orders to the planning authority.  Is it not only commonsense to place a statutory obligation on planning authorities compelling them in the performance of their functions to have regard to these orders?  If that is not done then the sending of the orders is a meaningless exercise.</P>
    <P>The same argument applies to the Commissioners of Public Works.  Why send the orders to the commissioners unless the Minister wants them to take the orders into account in the performance of their functions?  If cognisance is to be taken of them then the only sensible thing to do is to give statutory effect to what we propose.  The orders should be sent for a specific purpose and that specific purpose should be that the planning authorities and the Commissioners of Public Works should have regard to them in what they do and that should be a statutory obligation.</P>
    <P>For the life of me I cannot understand why the Minister will not accept this provision.  It is obviously intended that the planning authorities and the Commissioners of Public Works should have regard to these orders but, unless there is a statutory obligation on these bodies to do something, they are not going to do it.  The obligation would not be a very onerous one.  We are not asking for something unattainable. Both sections refer to very restricted areas, nature reserves on the Minister's own lands and refuges created by the Minister on private lands.  The activities of both bodies concerned in relation to these areas would be minimal.  All we are asking is that these bodies take cognisance of orders and be aware of them and take the existence of reserves or refuges into account when discharging their functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied both the commissioners and the planning authorities will pay full regard to formal notification from my Department of the establishment of nature reserves and refuges under these sections and I see no reason for imposing, as the Deputy suggests, a statutory obligation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by Deputy Haughey and Deputy Tunney.  These are two very important sections, one dealing with nature reserves on State lands and the other dealing with the creation of refuges on private lands.  It astonished me that the Minister had to bring in this section in regard to his own lands.  It seems he is not actually in full possession of his own lands.  The section dealing with the creation of refuges on private lands is very important.  In both cases it is imperative that orders should be given due regard.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that this subsection differs from section 12 in that the Commissioners of Public Work and the Minister for Local Government and planning authorities are excluded from their obligations as regards nature reserves and refuges. As this section stands we are asking the planning authority and the Commissioners of Public Works to have due regard to the order.  There is no mention here of the Minister for Local Government as there was in the other section.  Therefore, under the section the planning authority need have no regard whatsoever to this order which will be sent to them.  For that reason it is very important that our amendment would be accepted so that they would have due regard to the order if they were performing a function which affected conservation of wildlife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I regret to have to express disappointment at the Minister's curt dismissal of the two amendments. The Minister said he was quite satisfied that the commissioners and the planning authority would have due regard to this order.  The Minister was never, to my knowledge, a gullible or presumptuous man, but in view of what he has stated I must assume a <Col N="159" /> change in his nature and again a change that is not for the best.  The Minister must know as well as I do that unless there is a statutory obligation on the commissioners or on the planning authority to have regard to an order they will not adhere to it out of deference to him or wildlife or anything else.</P>
      <P>The Minister has dispelled the hopes I had that after a period of some hours we might now be looking at this legislation and this amendment through his own clear eyes and applying his own well-known experience especially in the field of local authorities. The Minister was a member of the Louth County Council and the council were the planning authority. He knows that a communication from Dublin to the Louth County Council or to any other county council which has nothing attached to it accept the fact that it has come from Dublin will not get a very warm reception.  How, therefore, can the Minister expect to convince me that the planning authority will have due regard to this legislation?  From my experience of them&mdash;and it gives me no pleasure to say it&mdash;I know they will not, and our legislation and our hopes and desires will be all the poorer for it.</P>
      <P>The position is unsatisfactory in that, first of all, the Minister was not with us on Committee Stage.  If he had been, I think many of the weaknesses we see in the legislation would not be there now, because I think he would have applied himself determinedly to it and would not have been as sensitive to other areas as his predecessor was. As we are not concluding the Report Stage tonight, I am hopeful that when we come to other amendments the Minister will be more familiar with the legislation and will be much happier in applying his own judgment to it rather than entirely accepting, as most Ministers do and, generally speaking, very wisely, the brief that comes from the advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am utterly convinced from the experience I have that subsection (7) of section 15 will be proven to be absolutely useless.  If it were not there at all the provision would be as <Col N="160" /> effective.  The subsection requires no more than that the order be sent.  The botheration attaching to make a case when Standing Orders prevent it being accepted is very frustrating. On the other hand, it does give me an opportunity of placing my views on record.  I hope that, in the interests of wildlife, my views will be proven to be erroneous, and I am hoping there is no foundation for my distrust&mdash; that is a fairly strong word but I know it will not be misinterpreted&mdash;of the mere forwarding of a communication to any institution, whether it is a local authority or the Office of Public Works, for the implementation of something which we are not prepared to state in legislation.  Certainly if it happens that way, I will be very much surprised and overjoyed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;16.&mdash;(1)  Where a person who is the occupier of land satisfies the Minister that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the land includes a habitat or part of a habitat or an ecosystem described in paragraph (a) of section 15 (2) of this Act,</P>
      <P>(b)  the interest of the person in or over the land is such as to enable the person to establish and manage a nature reserve on the land, and</P>
      <P>(c)  the person can, in accordance with any conditions which the Minister sees fit to impose, use or manage the land so as to establish and maintain, or maintain, as may be appropriate a nature reserve on the land,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> then, subject to subsection (2) of this section, the Minister may, by order (in this Act referred to as a recognition order) recognise the land as a nature reserve and the recognition shall continue for so long as the order is in force.</P>
    <P>(2)  Before making a recognition order the Minister shall consult the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the Minister for Transport and Power, the Commissioners and any planning authority within whose area the land to which the proposed order relates, or any part of such land, is situate.</P>
    <P>(3)  A recognition order shall state the Minister's reason for recognising the land to which the order relates as a nature reserve and indicate the objectives for which the land is to be used or managed as a nature reserve.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Minister shall not revoke a recognition order unless he considers that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the objectives indicated in the order have not been attained or are not being properly maintained, or</P>
    <P>(b)  for any other reason, it is no longer appropriate for him to continue to recognise as a nature reserve, by virtue of the order, the land to which the order relates.</P>
    <P>(5)  The Minister shall, as soon as may be after it is made, cause a copy of an order under this section to be sent to the Commissioners, to the Board and to any planning authority within whose area the land to which the order relates, or any part of such land, is situate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The basic purpose of these provisions is to enable the Minister to grant formal recognition to nature reserves on private lands.  I am informed that the owners of these private reserves are very anxious to have such formal status.  The provisions were opposed during Committee Stage on two issues: first, that there should be a proviso in subsection (5) that planning authorities <Col N="162" /> should take cognisance of the existence of private nature reserves formally recognised by the Minister under the section and, second, that there should be other incentives provided for in the section to attract owners of private reserves to the provisions of the section.</P>
    <P>These two points are now reflected in amendment No. 9a put down by Deputy Tunney.  As regards the first point, I can only say that I do not consider it necessary to provide an amendment on the lines suggested.  I am satisfied that planning authorities will have full regard to the formal notification from my Department of the existence of any such private reserves without my having to detail it in the Bill.  Indeed, it is entirely within the spirit of sections 42 and 46 of the 1963 Planning and Development Act and section 40 of the new Planning and Development Act for planning authorities to have due regard to such areas.  These sections provide for the making of amenity orders and conservation orders by planning authorities in their own areas.</P>
    <P>I might just add that I am providing in subsection (5) that copies of any orders made under this section will also be sent to An Bord Pleanála as I consider this reasonable.  On the second point I must say that I cannot agree that insufficient incentives are being provided for owners of private nature reserves.  The section must be considered in conjunction with other sections.</P>
    <P>Apart from the powers contained in section 11 (2) enabling the Minister among other things to give assistance and advice to any person or any matter affecting wildlife, to join by agreement in the management of private lands in the interests of wildlife, to participate with others in wildlife projects and to give grants or loans for such purposes, the formal recognition of a private nature reserve will mean that any offence under the Act committed in such a reserve will be regarded much more seriously and will on conviction attract much heavier penalties up to a maximum of £500.</P>
    <P>When we come to discuss amendment No. 22 it will be clear that the <Col N="163" /> section referred to in that amendment will bestow the additional benefit of enabling the Minister, by agreement with the owner, to regulate access to and use of a private nature reserve. I accordingly strongly urge the adoption of this amendment.</P>

      <P>No doubt my ability will persuade the Minister to accept the new section 16 as framed by us.  He has given a very fair resumé of the developments in regard to this matter, but he is on very weak ground when he asks the House to accept his new section 16 instead of ours.</P>
      <P>Because of the dilatoriness of some of the members of the Coalition in their attendance at the Special Committee, we were able to delete section 16 from the Bill as it was put before us.  We did not do that because we did not agree with the general purpose of section 16 as then framed; we fully support the general purpose of section 16.  I will call it section 16 because that is what it was in the Bill we had before the Special Committee and that is what it will be again, whether the Minister's proposal or ours is accepted. If I may I will refer to it as section 16 although there is a different section 16 in the Bill now before us.</P>
      <P>We are dissatisfied with section 16 as it was put before us.  We agreed that the idea was a good one, that what was proposed was desirable, but we did not think it went far enough.  Because we could not persuade the Minister in the Special Committee to change the section along the lines we suggested, we had no option but to vote against it and have it deleted so that we could come back on Report Stage and have another go at it.  That is what we are doing now.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined quite clearly what is intended in section 16 where a public spirited person who has suitable lands would like to have them changed into a reserve.  That can now be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> We questioned the Minister very closely in the Special Committee as to what would follow once private lands were designated by order into becoming reserves.  He had to admit, in effect, that nothing would happen. The only thing he could hold out to us by way of advantage was that if other persons committed offences on these lands the penalties would be heavier.</P>
    <P>That reminds me of what an Irish solicitor told a client who was thinking of going to France on a visit and was asking about the traffic regulations. The solicitor summed up the French traffic laws by saying &ldquo;If you get killed on a pedestrian crossing, it means that whoever knocked you down and killed you has to pay the funeral expenses&rdquo;.  That was a gross over-simplification of the position but it is much the same as the defence which the Minister is trying to put up here for the section 16 as he puts it before us.</P>
    <P>In effect, it would really be of no significance that one of these orders would be made in respect of private lands.  It would confer on the lands some status, but that would be all.  It would be of no practical significance. We think it is desirable that as much land as possible be brought within the scope of section 16 and turned into official reserves.  This would be a very important and beneficial step from the point of view of the conservation of wildlife.</P>
    <P>We want something done to encourage people to do that.  We want to encourage as many people as possible to come forward and say to the Minister &ldquo;I want my lands treated in this way.  I want you to make an order under section 16&rdquo;.  Will anybody do that under section 16 as framed at present, when the only thing the Minister can say to such a person is &ldquo;If you have this order made anybody poaching on your lands will be subject to a heavier fine than otherwise&rdquo;?  That will not get us anywhere.  We have brought forward our new section 16 which would enable the Minister in cases where he makes an order in regard to private lands, turning them into natural reserves, to provide assistance <Col N="165" /> for the better management and running of these reserves.  That would be a very natural thing to do.  If the Minister is going to enter into an agreement with a private citizen in regard to turning private lands into nature reserves, he should be prepared to make skilled management and other services available for the running of such reserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the regrettable accident in which Corporal Michael Rouine lost his life, I should like to extend my sympathy to his family.</P>
      <P>The reply which the Taoiseach gave me today can only be described as waffle.  There are a number of questions to which we need positive answers.  We have been told that a court of inquiry is to be held.  Is it to be held because of this question? What is the purpose of this training? The Taoiseach gave a number of indications in his reply, but before dealing with them I want to know why the training was taking place in Peterborough. This question is uppermost in the minds of a number of people as a result of the corporal's death in Peterborough Parachute Centre.  What is the purpose of sending members of the Defence forces to England for training?  Are members of the British Army trained at this centre?  Will this training be extended in relation to Border contacts and are members of the SAS trained there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said today that he was speaking about parachuting, not paratroopers.  I mentioned paratroopers in my supplementary question. Parachuting indicates a person, civilian or otherwise, jumping from a plane, and paratroopers are military personnel.  I wonder why the Taoiseach <Col N="166" /> made the distinction in his reply today.  In his reply the Taoiseach said that these people were being trained as instructors.  Who were they being trained to instruct?  Why was a member of the Signal Corps chosen for this training instead of a member of the Air Corps?  Are we establishing a special service for the training of parachutists?</P>
    <P>I believe in Army efficiency and adventure training, but it must have a productive result.  To jump out of a window on to a mattress only proves that a person can jump from a first or second storey on to a mattress.  If there is no productive end, it is a useless exercise.  Perhaps the Taoiseach has bigger things in mind in relation to parachuting, or will it be just another club, such as the Sub-Aqua Club or the Parachute Club in the Curragh? Were the parachutists in the Curragh not competent to train the corporal who died in Peterborough?  I should like to know where the centre&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>These questions were not answered by the Taoiseach.  He did indicate that the Director of Training lays down guidelines for the courses.  If guidelines have been laid down I should like to have a copy of the directive that is issued each year by the Director of Training.  I should also like to know when the Director of Training was advised on this issue by the Army Council.  There are other places in which parachutists could be trained; indeed, they could be trained here.  Why spend public money abroad unless it was a secret mission? There was no indication given beforehand that parachute training would <Col N="167" /> take place in Britain.  Was the equipment that was used by the corporal the property of the Defence Forces or the property of the Peterborough Parachute Centre?  There are many questions to be answered because of the widespread unease in regard to the corporal's death.  Perhaps the Taoiseach can tell us where it is intended to locate the instruction base and the type of equipment to be used there.  If this training is of military value there may well be some effort to develop it on a large scale.  I do not think that is practical or necessary.  There are other matters more important in relation to our own problem of security.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is clear. a Cheann Comhairle.  It is a statement of the circumstances under which he lost his life and it is reasonable to ask why.  In asking why one must probe into other factors than the fact that a parachute did not open.  It is reasonable to ask the questions I put to the Taoiseach.  Maybe there is an explanation for all these questions.  It is necessary and desirable that they be cleared up at the earliest possible moment without hysteria and with the greatest possible speed so as to allay the fears that might be in some minds, the fears that I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion I want to say that members of the Defence Forces themselves feel that it may be the development of just another club within the Defence Forces.  There is the Parachute Club in the Curragh.  Is this to <Col N="168" /> be another club that would be singled out for special mention and special praise in relation to this activity?  It is on the cards that it is not going to have the widespread effect that other types of adventure training would have that would be of lasting military value and could be passed on to the great bulk of the personnel who will participate in adventure training of one type or another.  It would be interesting to know why the Air Corps was not selected and what would be the base.</P>
    <P>Again, I ask the Taoiseach if he could make available this directive from the Director of Training that would specify that this training be carried out on the advice of the Army Council.  Could he tell us when the Army Council last met and if they so advised him as indicated in the Taoiseach's reply to the supplementary question?  Possibly the Taoiseach may be misled.  Maybe my feeling is wrong but I feel that the Army Council had not advised.  I would like to see the directive and I would like the matters I have outlined cleared up at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to say that the Minister for Defence expressed his sympathy to the parents and family of the late Corporal Rouine on the tragedy which occurred and resulted in his death.  I would like to echo that sympathy because it is always a source of regret when a member of the Defence Forces is either injured or suffers, as in this case, death.</P>
      <P>There is no mystery whatever about this course.  Deputy Dowling on a number of occasions said that there was a mystery about the fact that Army personnel were sent on a course to Britain and implied that there was in that decision some mystery or some unexplained circumstance that, according to him, caused concern to him and some unnamed persons outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been a fact since the establishment of the State that certain members of the Defence Forces have gone abroad on courses.  In the 1920s they went abroad to the United States and, <Col N="169" /> I understand, also to Britain.  In the 1930s and 1940s they went to Britain. The Deputy will be aware that during a considerable portion of that time there was a Fianna Fáil Government in office, and Army personnel went abroad on these courses and there was nothing about it other than the fact that it had been the practice on a number of occasions to send Army personnel on courses in the places I have mentioned.  Some, I understand, went on courses to the Continent as well.</P>
    <P>This training course was approved by the Army Council for adventure training.  I quote here from their report of a meeting held on the 28th November, 1975:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Parachuting.</i> There are now two qualified instructors in the Army, but as there are three clubs, there is a need for a further four instructors... There is also a grave shortage of equipment....  Both these matters will impose restrictions in training programmes this year.  Nevertheless it is hoped to run an Army course in CTC midyear, and details of this course will be forthcoming later.</P>
    <P>The military authorities state that the attendance of the personnel at a parachute course would have the two-fold benefit of providing the Defence Forces with a measure of independence from civilian instructors and enabling the Army to train their own instructors in the future.  Sanction for this was provided in the general sanction which was given by the Minister for Finance on the 18th April, 1957, for the assignment of officers and men of the Permanent Defence Force to courses and visits, subject to the appropriate provision of the Vote for Defence not being exceeded in any year.</P>
    <P>Pursuant to that general approval, and in line with the recommendations of the military authorities on foot of the information which I have given that there were insufficient parachuting <Col N="170" /> instructors available, three Army personnel were sent on the particular course.  This course is provided under the sealed orders given to the Chief of Staff by the Minister which provides for the fighting efficiency and training of Defence Forces.  Such schemes or courses may provide, as I have mentioned, for training outside of the State.  One such course was that to which Corporal Rouine was detailed in Peterborough.  Adventure training also includes canoeing, mountaineering, and orienteering, and it is undertaken under the general direction of the Director of Training who, as I mentioned earlier, is advised by the Army Council on these matters and he is responsible to the Chief of Staff.  The military objective of adventure training is the development of such military qualities as initiative, resourcefulness, endurance and leadership.  Generally speaking, the persons who undergo an adventure training course abroad do so so that they can instruct members of the Defence Forces, and it was for the purpose, as I have mentioned, of increasing the number of instructors in the Defence Forces that the personnel concerned were assigned to this course.</P>
    <P>There is no mystery about it.  It has been common practice from the establishment of the State to send at intervals personnel of the Defence Forces and it has happened over the years under different Governments at different times.  There is nothing unusual in this.  It is deeply regretted that it resulted in the death of Corporal Rouine, but risks of this sort are part and parcel of Army life.

      <P>Should he now renew his claim, however, he would, because of the increased rates of unemployment assistance at present in force, be entitled to a small weekly payment on the basis of his means as already assessed.
