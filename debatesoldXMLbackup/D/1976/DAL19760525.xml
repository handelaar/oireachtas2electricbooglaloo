    <P>1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the deficiency in forward social, physical and economic planning as a result of the failure to hold a national census this year and in the light of the serious unemployment situation, he will authorise the holding of even a limited census, confined, if necessary, to centres of high population, which will provide necessary statistical information and temporary employment, particularly for school and college leavers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that it would not be possible to mount a partial census, confined to centres of high population before April, 1978. A partial census confined, say to Dublin and Cork, and thereby involving a large proportion of the total population, would be a costly operation. <Col N="2" /> It would be held only three years before the 1981 census for which an EEC regulation specifies the timing.  It would not be justifiable to undertake two such comprehensive and costly operations only three years apart.</P>
      <P>The lack of census data will not, in any case, lead to any serious deficiency in forward social, physical and economic planning.  As I indicated in replies to previous parliamentary questions on 22nd October, 1975, and 12th May, 1976, to which I would refer the Deputy for details, a great deal of other data is available as a statistical base for planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to demographic data, the 1975 labour force survey which was conducted on foot of an EEC regulation and the results of which will be available towards the end of this year, will provide estimates of the total population and labour force for <Col N="3" /> the country as a whole and for planning regions.  Consideration is being given at present in the EEC to the question of conducting a further labour force survey in 1977 and, in this context, the possibility of adapting the survey to provide estimates of the total population and labour force for counties and individual large urban areas, is being examined.</P>
    <P>I would add that the efficacy of forward planning in the various spheres is not primarily a matter of having precision in the statistical base but rather of devising and implementing policies that will promote growth in output and an expansion in employment. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that there is no need for a partial census as envisaged in the Deputy's question.  Such a census would create only very limited job opportunities for school and college leavers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the reply that by implication the Taoiseach seems to suggest that there will not be any other census on a national scale until 1981?  That was a question which the Taoiseach was unable to answer specifically when I raised it on another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch:</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously this is forced upon the Government by our accession to the EEC, otherwise we might not even have a census in 1981. I suggest, in view of the obvious difficulties that this Government are having in any forward planning, that the Taoiseach will now admit that the failure to have a census in this current year was an obvious blunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that. The Deputy will appreciate from this reply, as well as from earlier replies, that it is not considered necessary to have a census because the actual numbers of the population are only one of the facts taken into account, and the information available in the labour force survey indicates generally the situation and any extra statistical information is not essential for any forecasts that I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="4" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that there is now, and has been for a considerable time, growing concern amongst people at the lack of statistical data in this country which I believe is at the lowest possible ebb compared with any other European country, certainly any country that wishes to make economic progress.  Not only is there such a concern amongst the people but amongst local authorities as well.  That concern is reflected by small local communities carrying out a census themselves&mdash;the kind of census which the Taoiseach says is now impossible and too expensive.  In that connection, I bring to the Taoiseach's attention the most recent one of these which I observed which was in a small suburban village of Ballincollig in County Cork last Sunday.  These people thought it so important to the future of their growing community that they had, in the absence of a Government census, to undertake it themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1975 labour force survey will provide estimates of the total population and labour force for different planning regions.  There is no evidence to suggest that the information available is not adequate for any forward planning that is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch:</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the labour force which is a very important statistic to have, are there not other vital statistics which are vital in the widest possible context of the word, such as animal population, milk production, age groups, school leavers, levels of education, rates of marriages and numbers of children being born? Are not all these statistics vital and necessary, and in their absence the Government, whatever Government will be in power, will be all the poorer in their forward planning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistics of animal population are compiled annually by the Garda.  This has been the practice and will continue.  In addition, the local authorities have information available and keep it up to date in respect of the numbers in families in their respective areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest to the Taoiseach that these surveys and <Col N="5" /> Department studies are now totally inadequate, thereby leaving this country in a very poor position statistically especially since we are not to have a comprehensive survey until 1981?  May I remind him again that by the time this survey is completed it will be 1982 and that it would not be possible before 1983 to enact legislation arising from it, for example, the legislation to revise the constitutencies? Is this not another attempt by the Government to fire-proof themselves against the next election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept the pessimistic conclusions of the Leader of the Opposition.  I am sure he will agree that only on one occasion in 50 years have a party other than Fianna Fáil revised the constituencies.  This was hardly too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch:</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not dodge the constituencies requirement as this Government have done.  We had a survey every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The party opposite did not revise the constituencies until after they had been taken to court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>Seven of the establishments covered by the Central Statistics Office's production inquiries manufacture blankets, either on a regular or on an intermittent basis.</P>
      <P>These establishments manufacture substantial quantities of other textile products besides blankets.  Total employment in the seven establishments was 490 persons in March, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the real concern and fear being expressed by people engaged in the blanket manufacturing industry, would the Parliamentary Secretary, through the Taoiseach, convey to the Minister for Finance the necessity for having the 20 per cent VAT rate on blankets reviewed as a matter of urgency with a view to helping the continuance of the unemployment of the more than 400 people engaged in the industry?  Has the Parliamentary Secretary heard my question?</P>

      <P>The waiting period for such operations in the Eastern Health Board normally is from four months to one year, but in some cases can be as high as three or four years, depending on the waiting list of the hospital or surgeon to which the patient is referred.</P>
      <P>As I have mentioned on previous occasions, the success of this type of operation has led to a build up of demand which is reflected in the work load.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>When introducing the Estimates for the Department of Health on 29th April, I said that I proposed to discuss with the Government the question of setting up <Col N="8" /> machinery for examination of the health board system.  I referred to the options for ways to carry out the review and suggested that Deputies might give me their views during the debate on the Estimate on the manner in which such a review should be undertaken.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>

      <P>No. As I said in the reply, I was interested in the various comments from Deputies and would be objective in my approach.

    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if persons in receipt of full non-contributory old age pension will be automatically eligible for medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to a medical card depends on whether a person is unable without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for himself and his dependants.  The normal criterion used in determining eligibility is whether the income of the applicant falls within the income guidelines which have been fixed by the chief executive officers of the health boards for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> In the case of applicants who are in receipt of pensions or allowances which are subject to means tests which are more stringent than the guidelines for medical cards, the chief executive officers have adopted the practice of regarding such persons as eligible without subjecting them to any further means testing.  Non-contributory old age pensioners were in this category, but it has recently come to the notice of the chief executive officers that the holder of such a pension could have an income which would place him outside the medical card guidelines.  In the great majority of cases, however, persons who are in receipt of full non-contributory old age pensions are clearly within the medical card guidelines and are accepted as being eligible for medical cards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that the vast majority of those in receipt of the full old age pension are entitled to medical cards.  However, a husband and wife can have £12 per week and yet qualify for the full non-contributory old age pension which is more than £20, thereby bringing their total income to about £32, whereas the guideline set down by the Western Health Board in respect of a medical card is £28.25 for a married couple.  Is this not putting them outside the point of eligibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's figures are accurate.  It is possible for a married couple to qualify for a pension of £35 per week and this would put them outside the guideline in regard to eligibility for a medical card since the deciding figure is £28.25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have understood that anyone in receipt of a full old age non-contributory pension was entitled to a medical card but that is not so in practice because a couple could have an income of £3 more than the guideline.  I am endeavouring to indicate why the guideline is so wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>This situation arises as a result of the improvements in the social welfare code, particularly in relation to the means test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the introduction of this measure as a means of economy may very well be a form of false economy, that if everything were taken into account the former practice of granting these people medical cards automatically would be the most economic way of proceeding because it would avoid further investigation of cases which have been investigated fully already by officers of the Department of Social Welfare?  Would he not agree that, perhaps, it would be not only more humanitarian but also better economy to resort to the former practice and to abolish this niggling economy he has introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice to which the Deputy refers applies to two health boards, the Western Health Board and the South Eastern Health Board. As I pointed out to Deputy Callanan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>The only information I have is to the effect that this is operated by the Western Health Board and by the South Eastern Health Board.  Again, may I point out to the Deputy that it is possible&mdash;in very few cases&mdash;for a married couple's income to exceed the guidelines?  Income is income no matter what way one takes it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>

      <P>Payments from public funds are made available to voluntary organisations such as Cheshire Homes in respect of services provided by them for entitled patients referred for care by health boards.  Payment is made at present by health boards by way of capitation payments.  From time to time further payments have been made by the health boards towards revenue deficits, after full account was taken of other income of the organisations, including payments by private patients.</P>
      <P>I have been considering the position of the Cheshire Homes generally and, in view of the special difficulties arising from deficits accumulated for past years in some of the homes, I have found it possible to make special additional funds available towards these deficits.  The homes have been notified accordingly and detailed negotiations will shortly take place on the payments to be made.</P>

      <P>A widow's non-contributory pension at a reduced rate was awarded to the person named by the Deputy on the 10th May, 1976.  The award took effect from the 8th September, 1975, the day following the death of the applicant's husband.</P>
      <P>The delay in processing the claim was due partly to difficulty in correctly establishing the applicant's means, and partly to pressure of work on the local investigating officer.  I very much regret the delay in dealing with the case.</P>

      <P>Unemployment assistance is not payable to the person concerned on his application of 26th November, 1975 as his weekly rate of means, as assessed for unemployment assistance purposes by a deciding officer and subsequently confirmed by an appeals officer, exceeds the maximum weekly rate of assistance which would be payable in his case.  His means for unemployment assistance purposes consist of the estimated <Col N="13" /> value to him of free board and lodging on his father's holding of about 100 acres, the rateable valuation of which is £69.75, and which carries a considerable mixed stock.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan) Patrick S. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 16, 17 and 18 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> Recruiting to the Permanent Defence Force is continuing.</P>
    <P>Defence Force regulations prescribe the reasons for which members of the force may be discharged and the reason is specified in every case.  One of the prescribed reasons is &ldquo;His services being no longer required&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>During the period of two years ended 30 April, 1976, 247 members of the force were discharged for the reason &ldquo;His services being no longer required&rdquo;.  Ten of these members, including the man referred to by the Deputy, had home addresses in the Six Counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister, perhaps, answer one of the questions he has lumped together, the question where I specifically asked whether he would explain what the term &ldquo;His services being no longer required&rdquo; means?  Secondly, would he answer the first part of the first question, that is, is recruiting still going on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may dispose of the last question first.  Yes, it is still going on and, at the point in time when we feel that further advertising <Col N="17" /> is necessary, we will have that further advertising.  But we have, very satisfactorily I think, passed the figure of 14,000.  On the 30th April, 1976 we had, including 137 cadets, 14,108 in the Defence Forces, the highest figure for 25 years.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second supplementary question, the position is that under Defence Forces regulations the question of a discharge of a soldier is one for the military authorities.  They specify reasons for discharge.  They give that reason on the discharge given to the soldier.  That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister still try to explain to me what is meant by the phrase &ldquo;His services being no longer required&rdquo; if, in fact, public money is being spent recruiting replacements for such people let go?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan:</NameTxt>
      <P>At this point in time no public money is being spent on advertising recruiting but, in respect of our successful recruiting, the money already spent is having its effect.  The position is that if the military authorities feel that a person's services are no longer required, then that is the position.  Under the Defence Forces regulations they have the power, in law, and that is what was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister whether he would cease to waffle in regard to a specific question as to what the phrase means which has been given to the discharge of a number of ex-members of the Defence Forces, namely &ldquo;His services being no longer required&rdquo; in cases in which I feel the Minister must be aware that the services rendered by those same members of the Defence Forces were exemplary for two years and 10 months, in one case&mdash;with only two months to go?  Secondly, might I ask the Minister why those members of the Defence Forces are given no opportunity whatsoever to answer any allegations that may have been made against them; why, while giving this waffle about &ldquo;His services being no longer required&rdquo; new recruits are being taken in daily?  Thirdly, would the <Col N="18" /> Minister please bear in mind that the blackening of the name of an ex-member of the Defence Forces whose home is in the Six Counties can be a very dangerous thing so far as that member is concerned?  Fourthly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It may be a fault of mine but, if it is, it is a fault of many others here.  At least when I repeat myself I am usually saying something rather than merely waffling.  Fourthly, might I ask the Minister particularly will he ensure and insist, by a thorough personal investigation, that ex-members from the Six Counties have not been discharged on information laid by informers in the Six Counties through their Special Intelligence Branch?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have informed the Deputy, the position is that ten members only&mdash;during the two years ended 30th April, 1976&mdash;whose home addresses were in the Six Counties were discharged from our Defence Forces.  The position is covered by military discipline and by Defence Forces regulations.  I am satisfied that the persons discharged knew very well <Col N="19" /> why they were discharged at the time of their discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>A final supplementary, if I may.  Will the Minister please look into this matter in a serious manner and ensure that, even if it involved only one ex-member of our Defence Forces, his life is not endangered by being discharged on the say so of the touts of the SIB in the Six Counties, and cannot return to his home because of being blackened by the army he served well and honourably here and carrying an honourable discharge in his hand?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the plans, if any, his Department have to improve the existing fishery protection service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>Improving the fishery protection service is a matter which is kept under review in my Department in the light of needs and resources.  The construction of a second all-weather fishery protection vessel is proceeding at present and delivery is expected in November, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are eight helicopters in the Air Corps.  They will, as heretofore, carry out &ldquo;sweeps&rdquo; of particular areas from time to time at the request of the Naval Service, but it would not be feasible to have any of them <Col N="20" /> permanently engaged on fishery protection duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that because Iceland is seeking a 200-mile limit and because we may in the near future have a 50-mile fishing limit, it is necessary to increase the present strength of the naval force to protect our fishing grounds?  Can he tell the House what steps he is taking to ensure that they will be adequately protected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the probable situation mentioned by the Deputy.  We are taking every possible step that can be taken.  At the moment we are studying what will be the eventual result, which is not known to anybody, because the Law of the Sea Conference broke up and will be resumed in August.  At the same time, we are doing our forward planning and seeing what we can do.  As I have told the Deputy, we hope to have a new fishery protection vessel to augment our fleet in November, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister again consider the possibility of having patrol boats of the type used in Norway for this kind of work?  It would be possible to have such a boat at a much cheaper cost.  Such a vessel would be sufficient to carry out this type of work and we could afford to have a greater number of them employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice given to me by the Naval Service is that, because of the size of modern trawlers and their very great strength against heavy seas, the only way that policing can be fully done, and done well in the future, is by means of all-weather fishery protection vessels. This is highly expensive but it is in accordance with the advice given to me.  Small vessels cannot withstand the degree of heavy weather that the all-weather vessels can and, therefore, the advice is that we should concentrate as far as boats are concerned on all-weather fishery protection vessels. We are doing this at a cost of £4 million in respect of the new vessel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the type of boat I refer to is capable of going out in a force 10 gale and would be suitable for fishery protection off our coasts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the type of boat the Deputy talks about is suitable to go out in a force 10 gale it probably costs more than £4 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals from Donegal County Council regarding a protective sea wall at Inver before my Department at present.  I am not, therefore, able to comment on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the question put down to the Minister which is only subsequent to other efforts through his Department to get certain information regarding this matter, has he made any effort to find out what the exact position is in Donegal in regard to this item which is a very serious one, as he understands, for the people concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>Donegal County Council apparently were considering the question of execution by direct labour of protection works at Inver at a relatively small figure, to be borne by the rates, and they apparently decided not to proceed with it on the grounds that the protection required does not concern council property.  That is all I know about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Donegal County Council, in view of the urgency of doing this piece of protective work and in view of the unlikelihood of it being done under any other agency in sufficient time to save many houses, the roadway and property, unanimously decided to provide £24,000 to do this job?  Is the Minister aware that they were told subsequently by their manager that he was advised that legally they could not and <Col N="22" /> were not entitled to spend money on this job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very surprised if that was the case.  The figure was not £24,000 but £2,400.  This is the amount of money which they had been considering spending on it and they would do it from the rates.  There is no question they could not do it.  Even if there was no council property involved they would be entitled to do it if they desired.  They did not, apparently, decide they would do it. The information I have is that they decided they would not do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The £24,000 is in fact the correct figure.  The £2,400 could be another figure for a fiddling job.  Am I reading the Minister correctly when taking from his last reply to me that he said the council were entitled to spend money on this work even if it did not involve public property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority have power under section 2 (3) of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, as the Deputy is aware, to carry out relief or protection works in their functional area where they are of opinion that damage from flooding, landslides, subsidence or other similar occurrence has been sustained or is likely to be sustained, that it is in the public interest to afford relief or protection from the damage.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from Kildare County Council that these houses were not included in the October, 1973 sales scheme made by the local authority because the houses were not completed at that time and the all in cost was not established until January, 1975.  The authority have no record of the receipt of applications or inquiries from the residents relating to the purchase of their houses prior to the deadline of 31st March, 1975 set for the acceptance of applications under the 1973 scheme.</P>
      <P>Some months ago, the Highfield Park Residents Association represented to me that a number of tenants had made inquiries relating to the purchase of their houses prior to the deadline.  In the circumstances, I recommend to the association that, in order to enable the local authority to examine the matter further, the tenants who indicated to officials of the authority prior to 31st March, 1975, that they wished to purchase their houses might submit an appropriate statutory declaration to the authority.  It is understood from Kildare County Council that a substantial number of statutory declarations were received recently and that these are now being examined.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will arrange to have displayed at all frontier posts for the benefit of the public, a suitably large hoarding carrying relevant general information as to what travellers, entering or leaving the State, may bring with them and including any useful information to make their journeys less intimidating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) (for the Minister for Finance):</NameTxt>
      <P>A poster listing the principal goods liable to import duty and the principal prohibited or restricted goods is displayed at frontier posts and notices on various matters relevant to cross-Border travellers are freely available at these offices on request.  It would not be practicable to arrange for the display at such posts of a hoarding carrying all the general information on customs matters which might be considered relevant to travellers entering or leaving the State. I do not accept that the present customs procedures at frontier posts for dealing with travellers are intimidating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>While I fully appreciate that all the various bulletins, books, pamphlets, leaflets and explanatory memoranda the customs officials must peruse would not be capable of being put on a hoarding stretching half a mile either side of the Border, nevertheless I ask the Minister to examine whether the people coming and going, on holidays in particular, could be given some little guidance?  This is done at various airports throughout the world.  Why can this not be done at our frontier posts to the benefit not only of the local travelling public but very particularly of tourists who are intimidated by all the paraphernalia and their ignorance of the regulations which, as I say, would take them a year to study and when they have <Col N="25" /> studied them they will still not know what they were all about?  That is the type of intimidation I am talking about, not the physical kind we get when we cross to the other side a little further on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>A poster is displayed which lists the principal goods liable to import duty and the principal prohibited or restricted goods, which is the kind of essential information which can be readily displayed. The Deputy referred to what is done at airports.  There is a different position there.  Where there are red and green channels for customs clearance, there are notices which list the baggage allowances permitted. They would not be sufficient for land frontier purposes where the type of crossings are different from a passenger on an aircraft or leaving a ship. At a frontier crossing a passenger could be carrying goods in his car. Therefore, what is appropriate in an airport is not necessarily appropriate at a land frontier crossing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind the additional confusion that has arisen as a result of joining the EEC, and the new regulations which enable goods to a certain value to be freely taken across frontiers from one member state to another, would the Minister have this examined because that has added to the confusion of what we may or may not do legitimately? Could I leave this with him and ask him to have it examined with a view to seeing if something could be done to sort out this problem and make it easier for the long suffering public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will pass it on to my colleague but I am not quite clear what additional information, beyond what is on the existing poster, the Deputy thinks desirable.  If he would like to make any practical suggestions to the Minister for Finance privately, I am sure they will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister through you, Sir, and the House, if he is aware that the only information displayed at our customs posts in <Col N="26" /> the normal course of events during the day, not even at night, is a big sign saying &ldquo;Stad&rdquo; or &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;? Surely we can go further than that to help the public and make their journeys a little less difficult?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy were correct that would be a disastrous situation.  My information is that there is a poster listing the principal goods liable to import duty and the principal goods prohibited or restricted displayed at frontier posts.  If the Deputy is aware of a particular frontier post where the poster is no longer on display, I am sure the Minister for Finance would be glad of the information. If the Deputy has suggestions as to how that poster might be improved to give additional useful information, but without making it so long and complicated as to make it no longer useful, that help would also be gratefully received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the poster the Minister is talking about is not visible to the passing motorist, because it is probably in the customs building, would he bring to the notice of the Minister for Finance the desirability of having this poster blown up in size and displayed along the roadways on the approach to the customs post?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Deputy says but it would be quite impracticable to have a poster which would be in sufficiently large type to be read by a motorist without getting out of his car and which would contain the information of detail that is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance (a) the total national debt; (b) the annual cost of servicing it; (c) the total amount of the debt in currencies other than the pound sterling; (d) the total annual cost of servicing the amount at (c); and (e) the increase in cost at (d) caused by the falling value of the pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>The national debt as at the 31st December, 1975, was £2,650 million.  The cost of servicing the national debt in 1976 is estimated at £355 million.  The amount of the debt as at 31st December, 1975 denominated in currencies other than Irish pounds was £471 million.  As at 30th April, 1976, this figure stood at £640 million.  The estimated cost of servicing existing foreign debt in 1976 is £65 million.</P>
      <P>If the Irish £ had maintained its 31st December, 1975, value the estimated cost of servicing our foreign loans in 1976 would have been about £60 million, £5 million less than the present estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be better if I gave the Deputy the actual figures because the figures I gave related to the situation at 31st December, 1975, and 30th April, 1976. The figure for foreign debt at 31st December, 1975, was £471 million and at 31st March, 1974, it was £167 million. I am not quite sure what figures the Deputy wants but those are perhaps relevant to his question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch:</NameTxt>
      <P>Foreign debt at 31st March, 1974, stood at £167 million and it now stands at £640 million.  Is that not a disgraceful increase which reflects on the financial and fiscal responsibility <Col N="28" /> of this Government, if they have any?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only this country but other countries&mdash;other than the oil producing countries and a very small number of other countries &mdash;have had to increase their debt, in particular their foreign debt, substantially. The increase arises from those circumstances and it was in the context of a total debt increase which is significant but is not of the same percentage order of magnitude.  The foreign debt share of the total debt has increased, of course, in the period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that as well as the increase in the amount of the foreign debts that has accrued in the last two or three years they are for about half the term that applied to foreign debts before this Government came into power, in other words, the date of maturing is about seven years from the creating of the debt instead of about 15 as happened four years ago?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch:</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of servicing that is roughly £350 million, and this represents about 30 per cent of our total tax revenue and 10 per cent of our GNP.  Will he agree that for any well managed economy these figures are dangerously high?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are certainly high, higher than we would wish and higher than in the past.  But in the exceptional circumstances of the last few years this has been an inevitable feature.  If our economy is to be kept afloat and moving ahead, extensive borrowing was necessary. The alternative to that would have been cuts in expenditure on a scale that would have massively increased the present unemployment, as the Deputy is aware.</P>

In the three short years this Government have been in power they have moved us from the position of being a strong international creditor nation into being an international debtor.

      <P>(2)  a Community loan, consisting of part of the proceeds of the loans raised by the EEC in March and April, 1976.  The money issued was on-lent to Ireland as follows:</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to protect the members of the family of a vindictive spouse from having their home sold or otherwise disposed of by him over their heads.  The Bill is also directed towards actively encouraging spouses to place the family home in joint ownership, by the abolition&mdash;in section 13&mdash;of stamp duty, court fees and registration fees on transactions transferring ownership of the home from one spouse to both spouses jointly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, thirdly, proposes changes in the present law so as to give a spouse greater opportunity to clear off mortgage or rental arrears that the other spouse may have accumulated.  Finally, the Bill provides for a wide-ranging <Col N="55" /> protection for a family against the improper sale or removal of household chattels.</P>
    <P>The main feature of the Bill is, as I have mentioned, the protection of the families of vindictive spouses from having the family home sold over their heads.  I should, incidentally, mention at the outset that although the Bill is drafted without discrimination between the sexes, I propose for convenience to refer in my remarks to &ldquo;the wife&rdquo; and &ldquo;the husband&rdquo; in cases where it is more likely that one or the other would be involved.</P>
    <P>The question of what is the most suitable legal machinery for giving effect to the policy of protecting families from vindictive sales is not an easy one to resolve.  Although there are a number of possible approaches towards solving the problem, each with its advantages and drawbacks, two types of approach would appear to have the most to be said in their favour.  These are, firstly, a registration system, whereby a wife who registers a charge or caution against her husband's property will be protected, and, secondly, what may be called a &ldquo;consent&rdquo; system, whereby the consent of the wife to the sale of the family home by the husband will as a general principle be a precondition of the validity of the sale.</P>
    <P>For reasons that I will mention presently, the Bill has adopted the second solution, of requiring the wife's consent. However, I believe that, at the outset, I ought to explain why the Bill has not adopted the registration system, which admittedly has a number of beneficial aspects.  That system has been adopted in England by legislation in 1967 and was recommended&mdash;in a particular context to which I will refer later&mdash;by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in their very valuable Report on Desertion and Maintenance.</P>
    <P>The registration system has, as I have said, a number of beneficial aspects.  It is relatively simple.  It presents few conveyancing difficulties.  A woman who has been advised by a <Col N="56" /> solicitor will be able to protect her position by registration of a charge and rest assured that the home will not be sold over her head.</P>
    <P>However, the registration system has weaknesses that I believe render it an insufficient solution to the problem of vindictive sales.  Firstly, the wife's protection is entirely dependent on her taking the positive step of registering a charge against her husband.  Quite clearly, as between a husband and wife, registration would be at best an unfriendly and in most cases a positively hostile act.  Where the spouses were getting on well together it would be unusual for a wife to register a charge.  Moreover, even where the relationship with her husband had deteriorated, a wife might hesitate for a long time before taking the step of registration, which could very easily damage their relationship still further and could even be the final factor leading to a separation.  It is necessary to keep in mind that registration, if it is to serve its purpose at all, must be open to be seen by anybody&mdash;and, therefore, by the husband.  She might, accordingly, decide to hold back from taking such a step.  On the other hand, under this system, so long as the wife does not take the step of registering, she is given no protection, and there is a danger that she will wait too long in a number of cases.</P>
    <P>Secondly, a registration system will not provide any protection in cases where the husband literally walks out of the home, having secretly arranged for its sale behind his wife's back.</P>
    <P>The weaknesses of a registration system have been commented upon by a number of writers, among them Professor Bromley, in <i>Family Law</i> (4th edition, 1971) at pp. 393-394, Professor Khan-Freund of the University of Oxford, in an article in volume 33 of the <i>Modern Law Review</i> p. 601, at p. 614 (1970), and Mr. Cretney, also of the University of Oxford, in <i>Principles of Family Law</i> (1974), at p. 174. Cretney makes the point&mdash;which I think is a good one&mdash;that the protection afforded by a registration system &mdash;[and I quote]</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> would be more generally effective if it were a matter of routine to register a charge in favour of the wife whenever a matrimonial home is bought.  If relations remain good no one would suffer.  If there were discord the wife would be adequately protected without the necessity of taking a step which may be practically difficult, and will be seen as a hostile act.  This is not the present practice.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if we were now to introduce a system relying on registration we would find the same thing, that is to say, the registration of a charge would not be arranged as a matter of routine&mdash;and, when one thinks about it, that is not surprising because if a couple, at the time of their marriage, were disposed to bother to register the charge on the matrimonial home, why should they not take the more straightforward step of having the home in their joint names?</P>
    <P>The basic weakness in a registration system has been concisely expressed by Professor Crane: &ldquo;In an apparently successful marriage there may not seem any need to register until too late&rdquo;.  The quotation is from The Matrimonial Homes Act 1967, 32 Conveyancer (New Series) p. 85, at p. 95 (1968).</P>
    <P>For the reasons that I have outlined, therefore, the Bill does not base the protection that it affords on a system of registration.  Instead, it adopts the more direct solution of providing, by section 3 (1), that where one spouse, without the consent of the other, purports to convey any interest in the family home, such a conveyance is to be void.  This general principle is subject to two conditions that I will mention in a few moments.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, if a man wishes to sell the family home, he will have to obtain the written consent of his wife before doing so.  In most cases&mdash;indeed, almost every case&mdash;this will present no problem.  The decision to sell will be a joint decision and the wife will readily give her consent.  However, there will be cases where the wife refuses to give her consent.  As a general rule, I think it is fair to say that these are <Col N="58" /> cases where the relationship between husband and wife is already a bad one. It may be a case where, for instance, the wife has already been virtually deserted by her husband and he may be offering her significantly less attractive accommodation in place of the home in which she is residing.  If the wife refuses to provide her consent, the Bill proposes&mdash;in section 4&mdash;that the husband may apply to the court requesting it to dispense with her consent but the court is to do so only where it considers that it was unreasonable for her to withhold consent. In determining this question, the court is to take into account all the circumstances of the case, including the needs and resources of the spouses and their dependent children and, where the husband is offering alternative accommodation, the suitability of that accommodation in comparison with the home that the husband is proposing to sell.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (2) gives protection to a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for full value who proves that he has taken all reasonable steps and made all reasonable inquiries in regard to the purchase from a husband who turns out to have sold the home without his wife's consent.  This protection is necessary since otherwise, in many cases, purchasers would always have a cloud of uncertainty hanging over their title.  They might have taken all reasonable steps to check the matter but they could never be fully satisfied about the security of this title.  In a case where the vendor appeared to be a bachelor there would always be a chance that a wife might turn up&mdash;perhaps from abroad&mdash;sometime in the future.  In the case of an apparently married man who was selling a home with his wife's consent, the purchaser could have no guarantee that the woman with whom he was living and who provided her consent was, in fact, his wife, since the man might be bigamously married.  Moreover, if one looks at it from the point of view of a vendor who is in fact a single man or a single woman, it will be obvious that serious problems could be created because the vendor would be called on, in effect, to prove a negative, namely that he or she is not married and the difficulties of proving that negative could be so <Col N="59" /> great that some would-be vendors could find it very difficult to sell their homes since would-be purchasers might tend to buy from married couples where the question of consent would be less likely to cause difficulty.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, as I have said, <i>bona fide</i> purchasers are protected under the Bill, but only where they have provided full value and can establish that they have taken all reasonable steps and made all reasonable inquiries in relation to the purchase.  I would emphasise that the onus of establishing that this was so will be on the purchaser if the matter is challenged. I suggest that this is the correct approach as a precaution against collusive sales and because a purchaser who was in fact <i>bona fide</i> would find no particular difficulty in satisfying the court to that effect.  Because of this provision, I think we can safely assume that the chances that a husband could successfully evade the provisions of the Bill would be very low indeed but as a further safeguard, which should reduce evasion virtually to zero, section 14 makes it an offence with a possible sentence of imprisonment for five years for the husband to give false information to a purchaser.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken of the weakness of a registration system as a protection for a wife, but the weakness derives not from the system itself but from the fact that many women would be unlikely to avail themselves of it.  This, however, is not a reason for excluding registration as an option and section 11 enables a wife to register on the title of her husband's property the fact that she is married. By doing this, she will ensure that the defence of <i>bona fide</i> purchase can never be sustained against her.  Still further protection is afforded by section 5 of the Bill, which enables a wife to obtain a court order similar to an injunction where her husband is intending to sell the home over her head, and which entitles her to seek financial compensation against her husband for herself and the children if her husband actually succeeds in disposing of the home.  I will be saying more about these sections shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> An exception to the requirement of consent is covered by section 3 (2) which provides that the wife's consent will not be required in relation to a conveyance that is made pursuant to an enforceable contract to make the conveyance where the contract was made before the marriage.  The most important case covered by the section is where the man, before the marriage, has contracted to sell a home.  Clearly, the law could not provide that his fiancee's consent would be required at that stage.  Equally clearly, however, the man could not be relieved of his contractual obligations simply because he had married before the formal conveyance had been effected, and to allow such a thing to happen would be more likely to result in collusion between husband and wife, against the interests of the purchaser, than to result in <i>bona fide</i> protection for the wife.  This is especially so when it is borne in mind that the question would be likely to arise, if at all, only very shortly after the marriage.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect to the question of legal protection against vindictive sales that I think ought to be stressed since it might otherwise tend to be overlooked or misunderstood.  This is the question of compulsory disposition of the family home.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will have noted, what is prohibited by section 3 is any conveyance of the family home by one spouse without the consent of the other. &ldquo;Conveyance&rdquo; is given a very wide definition&mdash;in section 1 (1)&mdash;so that, for example, where a husband wishes to mortgage the home or, more usually, where he wishes in the first place to purchase the home by means of a mortgage, he will have to obtain the consent of his wife.  In practice, of course, in all but a very small minority of cases, his wife will give her consent for the very same reason as he himself seeks the mortgage arrangement, namely that, for the great majority of couples, unless a mortgage is obtained, they will have no prospect of purchasing the home.  However, if a husband is seeking to create a mortgage on a home that he owns outright or if he is seeking to obtain a second mortgage, the position is different in that the purin <Col N="61" /> pose for doing so will not be to acquire the home but rather to retain it in the face of financial pressure or else to raise money for some business or other purpose.  In the latter type of case, a wife's consent may not be so readily forthcoming, and indeed may not be forthcoming at all, and this too, I believe, serves to demonstrate the value of the Bill.  The husband may, for example be seeking to raise a mortgage for reasons that may be frivolous or worse&mdash;he may, for example, be attempting to finance a gambling debt or drinking spree.  In such a case the wife may put her foot down and refuse to give her consent inviting her husband to appeal to the court if he considers that she is being unreasonable.  By this means the wife will have quite a considerable veto even over what I might call incipient steps that could, over a period, lead to the loss of the family home.</P>
    <P>Whilst the consent of the wife must be obtained for the creation of a mortgage on the family home, her consent will not, of course, be required where, in cases of default in the mortgage payments, the mortgagee seeks to exercise his statutory powers of possession or sale of the home.  The Bill does propose changes in the law designed to assist the wife in cases where there has been default in payments. I will be discussing these in more detail shortly.  It would, however, be anomalous&mdash;and, as I shall mention in a moment, detrimental to the interests of the great majority of couples seeking to purchase their own home&mdash;if the law were to say, in effect, that while a mortgagee could exercise his statutory powers against one of the marriage partners, the other partner could veto the exercise of that power.</P>
    <P>The reason the Bill permits the mortgagee to exercise the present rights of possession and sale is that to restrict or remove this right if the wife refuses to give her consent would make a mortgage an entirely unsafe if not indeed a worthless security on which to advance money since the obvious consequence would be that the wife would virtually always refuse consent in the joint interest of her husband and herself.  It <Col N="62" /> would, in effect, mean that money would not be advanced for house purchases since there would be no protection for the mortgagee if the husband should default.  The result would be that couples seeking to buy a home would find it far more difficult, if not indeed impossible, to raise the money for the purchase price.</P>
    <P>The same principles apply in regard to landlords of rented property.  If a landlord, when a tenant defaults on the rent, were required to obtain a wife's consent before he could give an effective notice to quit, he would not want to rent in the first place to married couples, since he would, in effect, be creating a tenancy terminable by the tenants&mdash;nominally the wife but in practice by both jointly&mdash;but not terminable by the owner.</P>
    <P>That this is a valid analysis is shown by experience elsewhere.  In England for example where, as I have mentioned, a registration system of protection operates, the wife will in almost all cases postpone or release her statutory rights in favour of a mortgagee.  As Cretney has observed, &ldquo;in practice no mortgagee would lend money on a property subject to a...charge&rdquo; in favour of the wife &mdash;Principles of Family Law, at page 169.  Cretney also points out, at page 175, that to give the wife protection against a mortgagee in such cases or against creditors of her husband if he goes bankrupt would&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>imply a policy of throwing the social cost of housing deserted wives onto individual creditors (rather than society as a whole) whose implications would be very far-reaching.</P>
    <P>I am aware that arguments have been advanced by some commentators that a matrimonial home should be specially protected against creditors and there is, in some countries, a certain limited protection &mdash;which, however, a number of those countries seem very reluctant to extend in any substantial way, a point which I think has its own significance. Be that as it may, I do not believe that it is possible to argue a case of this kind without reference to what I might call the social context in which <Col N="63" /> the arguments arise.  We have to keep constantly in mind that mortgages are a means of acquiring homes in this State and that a law that might appear to be&mdash;or indeed that might in fact be&mdash;beneficial to one particular husband or wife, or to both jointly, could, by reason of its being on the Statute Book, make for difficulties for a great number of other couples.  Perhaps the best way to sum it up is to say that what this Bill sets out to do&mdash;in the sections we are now speaking of&mdash;is to protect a wife against a vindictive husband; any argument about protecting either or both of the spouses against execution by creditors is one that raises issues far beyond the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;family home&rdquo; proposed by the Bill may require some explanation.  Section 2 (1) provides that the expression means primarily a dwelling in which the couple ordinarily reside.  However it also extends to a dwelling in which a spouse whose protection is in issue&mdash;in the ordinary case, the wife&mdash;ordinarily resides, as well as a dwelling in which the wife ordinarily resided before leaving, if she has left with just cause.  I will give a couple of examples of cases which may make the position clearer.</P>
    <P>Where the couple are living together there will generally be no problem: the house in which they are ordinarily residing will be the family home.  This will be a question of fact in every case. It is worth nothing, in passing, that there may be more than one family home in that sense in certain exceptional cases, in which event the protection afforded by the Bill will cover both of these dwellings.  If a wife is living apart from her husband&mdash;for example, where he has deserted her&mdash;the home in which she is actually living will be a &ldquo;family home&rdquo; for the purposes of the Bill. This, of course, is essential.  It would totally defeat the purposes of the Bill if protection were not to extend to the case where it might be most likely to be required, namely, the case where the husband has left his wife and is looking for cash&mdash;by the sale of the house&mdash;in order to set himself up in a new relationship.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> The third type of home covered by the definition is one in which the wife formerly ordinarily resided before she left with just cause.  Thus, for example, if a wife left the home on account of her husband's violence, her consent would be required before he could sell the house that she left.  Moreover, if she moves to a house in which her husband has a legal interest, the house will also be a family home for the purposes of the Bill and will be afforded protection accordingly.  Technically, if one reads the definition by itself, it will be seen to apply even if the husband has not a legal interest but it is only where he has that the question of the conveyance of such an interest could arise.  A situation could arise however in which the wife had gone to live in a house in which the husband had no legal interest but had an interest in the household chattels. The Bill extends protection to the chattels in such a case.</P>
    <P>The question may arise in certain cases as to what exactly comprises the physical limits of the family home. Subsection (2) of section 2 defines &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; so as to include a building, structure, vehicle or vessel that is:</P>
    <P>occupied as a separate dwelling and includes any garden or portion of ground attached to and usually occupied with the dwelling or otherwise required for the amenity or convenience of the dwelling.</P>
    <P>Whilst no difficulties will arise in the case of a suburban semi-detached home, for example, it might not be so easy in certain cases to say where the family home ends and where, for instance, a farm or a business premises begins.  In practice, the question should not give rise to major problems, since it should be easy to identify what should be regarded as &ldquo;going with&rdquo; the residence.  In the overwhelming majority of cases, of course, the question is not even going to arise since a wife will be perfectly willing to give her consent, if required.</P>
    <P>Returning to the central provisions of the Bill regarding the consent of a wife, may I invite the attention of Deputies to an important provision contained in section 4 (3).  The subsection, <Col N="65" /> in effect, provides that where the wife is in desertion, the court is to dispense with her consent.  &ldquo;Desertion&rdquo; here includes constructive desertion, which would arise where the wife had so seriously mistreated her husband as to justify him in leaving her.  It would seem to be only fair that a wife who is in desertion, and who, accordingly, is not entitled to be maintained by her husband, should not have the right to veto an intended sale by her husband.  However, it will be the task of the husband to establish to the satisfaction of the court that his wife is in desertion before he will be permitted to sell the home.  I may mention that a minor drafting amendment will probably be necessary to copperfasten the position in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (4) proposes that where a wife is suffering from mental disability or cannot be found, the court is to give its consent to a proposed sale by the husband if it considers it reasonable to do so.</P>
    <P>I turn now to section 5, which I have already mentioned briefly.  The purpose of the section is to give a wife a legal remedy in two cases.  The first, which is a dealt with by subsection (1), arises where the wife establishes in court that her husband:</P>
    <P>is engaging in such conduct as may lead to the loss of any interest in the family home or may render it unsuitable for habitation as a family home with the intention of depriving the wife or a dependent child or children of their residence in the home.</P>
    <P>The classic type of case that we are envisaging here is where a vindictive husband, thwarted by section 3, which requires his wife's consent to the sale of the home, devises some plan to get her out of the home by indirect means. He may, for instance, suffer a judgment in collusive proceedings brought by a friend.  The ultimate result would be that the home would be sold to satisfy the judgment and the wife would be turned out.  Another approach, more directly intimidatory, might be for the husband to interfere with the structure of the house or to <Col N="66" /> remove the slates so as to make it uninhabitable and to force his wife out. These types of intentional conduct whereby the husband intends either to engineer the loss of an interest in the home&mdash;&ldquo;interest&rdquo; being broadly defined in section 2&mdash;or else to make the home effectively uninhabitable&mdash; are covered by section 5 (1).  The wife, if she is aware of her husband's intentions, may obtain from the court what in effect is an injunction, the scope of which may be very wide since the section permits the court to &ldquo;make such order as it considers proper...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 5 is concerned with cases where the husband has already deprived the wife or children of the residence in the home by conduct that either resulted in the loss of any interest in it or by having made it effectively uninhabitable.  In such a case the court may order the husband to pay to the wife such amount as it considers proper to compensate her and the children for their loss or order him to restore the home to a habitable state.</P>
    <P>The courts are thus given a wide discretion, and I believe that they are likely to exercise it in a fair and sensible manner.  However, as I mentioned in the debates during the passage of the recent Family Law Act, when discussing new provisions relating to maintenance and exclusion of a violent spouse from the family home, only time can tell how the courts will discharge their new functions.  Some time it may be necessary to amend the provisions that are proposed in section 5 of the Bill, but I hope and believe that this is unlikely in the foreseeable future and that the section will be both adequate and reasonable in its practical effect.</P>
    <P>Taking all these sections together, I am fairly confident that this machinery of protection will effectively solve the problem of vindictive sales.  Although it involves the creation of a wide-ranging mesh of legal rights, the practical effects will be likely to be negligible in relation to the overwhelming majority of married couples.  The most that it will normally involve is <Col N="67" /> the addition of the wife's written consent to the conveyance of the family home, a matter that will be of little significance to either spouse where the relationship is in any way reasonable. However, in cases where things have gone wrong, the wife will have effective remedies with which to protect the interests of her children and herself.</P>
    <P>I turn now to sections 6 to 8 of the Bill, which provide assistance for a wife whose husband has defaulted on mortgage or rental payments.  Under present law the mortgagee or landlord, as the case may be, is not required to pay any attention to the position of the wife when taking proceedings for possession or sale of the family home. This is not to say that mortgagees have in fact tended to ignore the position of the wife and children.  Indeed the general experience in this country has been quite the opposite: mortgagees have gone to considerable lengths not to stand on their legal rights if there are any reasonable prospects that the defaults will be paid off by either spouse.  However in strict law the wife's position is not strong.  Accordingly section 6 proposes that where the wife's makes payments on the mortgage or lease in discharge of her husband's liability the mortgage or landlord must accept the payments.  Under present law he is not obliged to do so.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 6 is a technical provision designed to ensure that the fact that the mortgagee or landlord has treated the payments as having been made by the husband will not have any effect on a claim by the wife against her husband in respect of these payments for a beneficial interest in the home.</P>
    <P>If I may be permitted to digress slightly at this point from my description of the major provisions of the Bill, may I reiterate what I have said on previous occasions in this House and elsewhere in regard to the harm that is done to the interests of wives by statements to the effect that a wife who continues to make the mortgage repayments on the family home when her husband deserts her acquires no beneficial interest in the home.  This is not the case at all, and <Col N="68" /> I repeat that some cases have come to my notice&mdash;and there must be a number of others in fact&mdash;where wives have been led to overlook their legal rights as a result of this mis-statement of the law.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, while I think it right to stress that the law as it stands provides this protection, I do not mean to imply that the way in which this right is expressed is not capable of being expressed more clearly and more fully.  I intend in fact to look further at this point with a view to seeing whether an amendment could usefully be made.  If it appears on further examination that such an amendment would be desirable, I would hope to introduce it on the Committee Stage of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>To return to the provisions of the Bill: sections 7 and 8 propose that in proceedings for sale or possession of the family home by the mortgagee or landlord, where there is a prospect of the wife's being able to pay off the arrears or repayments within a reasonable time as well as being able to pay the current payments as they fall due, the court may adjourn the proceedings to see whether she is able to do so.  If she is, the court may by order make a declaration to this effect, and if it does so any term in the mortgage or lease that would have the effect of making all sums due become immediately payable as arrears, in addition to the actual arrears themselves, will be of no effect.</P>
    <P>I now turn to section 9 of the Bill. This is the section that introduces a system of protection in regard to the household chattels.</P>
    <P>I should say at the outset of my remarks on this section that I thoroughly endorse the observations of the Ontario Law Reform Commission in its Report on Family Property Law, 1974, page 146, to the effect that&mdash;and I quote:</P>
    <P>Where a marriage is sound, property rights in the household goods, as between the spouses, are, generally speaking, irrelevant.  It is only during that critical period when the spouses are no longer able to adjust their differences by agreement and <Col N="69" /> compromise that the owner of the household goods might consider asserting legal rights, and pursue self-help courses of action based thereon.</P>
    <P>This is an area of the law where the common law jurisdictions, in contrast to the civil law countries, have been slow to afford protection.  In France, Scandinavia and Germany, for example, there are legal prohibitions on the sale of household goods by one spouse without the consent of the other. The same is true in some of the eight states of the United States that have a community of property regime: reference in this context may be made to de Funiak and Vaughn's <i>Principles of Community Property,</i> at p. 288, 2nd edition, 1971.</P>
    <P>The only common law country in which similar protection is actually on the statute books appears to be New Zealand.  There, a provision introduced by legislation in 1968 prohibits the sale, disposition or removal of furniture from the home where proceedings for a separation order are pending, unless the permission of a magistrate or registrar is given.</P>
    <P>I believe that the provisions contained in section 9 of this Bill afford protection that is justified and at the same time sufficient.  I think they are based on principles of common sense and fairplay.  Once again, I stress that they have no relevance in the vast majority of cases but, in regard to the small minority, this section should, by its existence on the statue book, serve to lessen at least some of the tensions and anxieties that afflict spouses when their day-to-day relationship gets into difficulties.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 9 prohibits the disposition or removal by a husband without the consent of his wife of any of the household chattels when matrimonial proceedings between the spouses are taking place.  Where a wife refuses to give her consent the husband may apply to the court for its approval of the proposed disposition.</P>
    <P>The definition of matrimonial proceedings includes guardianship proceedings and proceedings under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses <Col N="70" /> and Children) Act relating to joint ownership of the household allowance, or property acquired out of the allowance, as well as proceedings under that Act for the exclusion of a violent spouse from the family home. These may reasonably be expected to be proceedings that in some cases may occasion a degree of vindictiveness likely to tempts a spouse to take somewhat desperate steps.  As Louis Nizar has observed:</P>
    <P>There is no limit to the blazing hatred, the unquenchable vengefulness, the reckless abandonment of all standards of decent restraint, which a fierce matrimonial contest engenders.</P>
    <P>The quotation is from <i>My Life in Court,</i> page 154, 1944.</P>
    <P>While the common law already affords some protection to the wife in cases where her husband molests or intimidates her family or herself, by enabling her to obtain an injunction against her husband, the criminal sanction has been included since it is likely to constitute a more immediate and effective deterrent.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) enables a wife in cases where her husband has actually sold or otherwise disposed of such a number of chattels as to make it difficult for her and her children to remain in the home without undue hardship or where he has committed an offence under subsection (2), to apply to the court for compensation. The court may order the husband to return the chattels or it may order him to provide a substitute for them or money in lieu.</P>
    <P>In the normal case such an order will only affect the husband, but where the wife has informed a third party in writing that she intends to take proceedings in regard to the chattel, then the court in making an order under the section will be entitled to affect the interests of the third party.</P>
    <P>I turn now to section 10 of the Bill. This section is concerned with the question of jurisdiction.  It provides that generally the Circuit Court and the High Court are to have concurrent jurisdiction, but that over certain <Col N="71" /> maximum monetary limits specified in subsection (4) the defendant in proceedings that have been taken in the Circuit Court may require that they be transferred to the High Court. Subsection (3) provides that, where either spouse is a person of unsound mind and a committee of his or her estate has been appointed, the jurisdiction is to be exercised by the court that appointed the committee, subject to subsection (4), which I have just mentioned.  The District Court is given jurisdiction to deal with disputes regarding the household chattels where the value of the chattels in dispute does not exceed £1,000.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that proceedings under the Bill are to be heard otherwise than in public.  The same course was adopted in relation to proceedings under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, which has recently become law.  Whilst there are arguments both ways on the question of the desirability of privacy of proceedings, I believe that, on balance, it is better that proceedings under the Bill should not be heard in public.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to section 11.  Its purpose is to enable a wife to register on the title to her husband's property a notice of the fact that she is his wife.  If she does so, no purchaser from her husband will be able to establish title in derogation of her interests since the purchaser will be unable to show that he has taken all reasonable steps in regard to the purchase. The section, however, makes it clear that there is no obligation on her to register such a notice.  If she does not do so, the purchaser is not entitled to assume that there is no wife.  This is the essential difference between the system proposed by the Bill and the general registration system that I discussed earlier.  Registration in the Bill is proposed as a subsidiary support for an anxious wife who fears that her husband may try to sell the home behind her back.  The primary protection is afforded by section 3 which requires the husband to obtain her consent as a general precondition of the validity of a sale.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> Section 12 is a technical section designed to blend the provisions of the Bill with the Registration of Title Act, 1964.  Section 13 is an important provision in the Bill.  It proposes that, in future, no stamp duty or registration fees will be payable on any transaction creating a joint tenancy between spouses in a family home where the home, immediately before the transaction, was owned by one of the spouses or by both of them other than as joint tenants&mdash;as tenants in common, for instance.  This provision is designed to encourage spouses whose family home is owned by one of them to place the home in joint ownership.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to say that my information is that in recent years there has been a strong and growing trend amongst married couples setting out to buy the family home to place it in joint ownership.  A similar trend is clearly discernible in England as is disclosed by Todd and Jones in Matrimonial Property, at page 77-83 (1972).  One factor&mdash;I do not say it is the only one&mdash;that has influenced this is that lending institutions have shown a willingness to co-operate in such arrangement by raising no difficulties about lending to both spouses jointly.  As far as I know, this was not the case in earlier years and it is reasonable to assume that many couples who did not feel they had any real option in the matter when contracting to buy their house perhaps ten, 15 or 20 years ago would wish to transfer to joint ownership if the cost of doing so was not significant.  I am therefore very glad to be able to introduce this provision whereby the State will do its part by waiving all revenue duty and court and registration fees.  There will be no doubt some cost involved as the transactions will normally be arranged by a solicitor but the fees for a transaction such as this would I hope in most cases be small.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is the criminal provision to which I have already referred.  It makes it an offence punishable by up to five years imprisonment for the husband to hide from a purchaser the fact that he has a wife&mdash;or, for instance, that the premises he is selling <Col N="73" /> are a family home.  The section makes no reference to a fine because the ordinary law would permit a court to impose any fine it thought fit without being expressly authorised to do so. The section is without prejudice to any other liability, civil or criminal&mdash;proceedings based on fraud, for example. The maximum penalty therefore, is severe and I think that is as it should be since it is easy to see that the circumstances could be such that a grave or even irreparable wrong could have been done to a wife and it is therefore advisable that the maximum penalty should take account of that possibility.</P>
    <P>This concludes my outline of the major provisions of the Bill.  I would now like to mention briefly why the Bill differs somewhat from certain other solutions that have been proposed.</P>
    <P>First, I wish to refer to the Nineteenth Interim Report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice Walsh, entitled &ldquo;Desertion and Maintenance&rdquo;.  Most of the recommendations in that report were incorporated in the recently enacted Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act and the House will not need to be reminded how helpful the report was in that connection.</P>
    <P>One of the reports recommendations was to the effect that the protection of the family home should be secured, where the spouse against whom a maintenance order has been made is the legal owner, by the registration of the maintenance order as a <i>lis pendens</i>, the effect of which would be to prevent a sale in such a case without leave of the court.  However, as I mentioned during the debates on the maintenance legislation, this proposal was made in the context of the committee's terms of reference which were concerned with maintenance proceedings.  The problem of the sale by a vindictive spouse could, though, arise even in cases where there has been no failure to maintain and that is why the Bill proposes a more farreaching protection.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation in regard to the sale of the family home was made by the Commission on the <Col N="74" /> Status of Women in their report.  The commission recommended that a system of community of property be examined but, no doubt as a shorter term idea, they recommended the introduction of a system of protection against vindictive sales that would require the husband to consult with his wife before disposing of the home.  If the wife did not agree with the proposed sale she would have the right to apply to the court within a specified time and the court would be given power to veto the proposed disposition if it considered that &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo; would be caused to the wife and children.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will appreciate, that proposal bears a resemblance to that proposed by the Bill, the important difference being that it placed the onus on the wife to go to court if she objected whereas the Bill proposes that the onus shall be on the husband, that is on the spouse who seeks to disturb the status quo.  I do not believe that a system that required the wife to go to court in order to protect her interests in this area would provide a sufficient protection.  The economic, social and psychological pressures on her would be too great in many cases.  A somewhat similar recommendation in England, which would have put the burden of taking protection on the wife, has been criticised by commentators.</P>
    <P>On the broader front, Deputies will have noted that the Bill proposes wide-ranging protection for the families of vindictive spouses rather than proposing a general regime of community of property between the spouses or, more specifically, compulsory joint ownership of the family home.</P>
    <P>The immediate reason for adopting the approach in the Bill is one of practicality.  The urgent social problem in this area of the law is that of the husband selling the home over the heads of the other members of the family.  This problem, I believe, the Bill will resolve in a comprehensive and sensible manner.  To have deferred publication of the Bill until such time as the very great legal complexities of community of property or <Col N="75" /> joint ownership had been analysed satisfactorily would have been unjust to the families who are at risk, all the more so because when all the analysis had been done and perhaps published as a basis for public consideration and debate, there is certainly no guarantee that the public would want to adopt either a community of property system or a system of compulsory joint ownership.</P>
    <P>To put this in better perspective, may I say that the necessary preliminary investigation, if done properly, could take years, as both the English Law Commission and the Ontario Law Reform Commission have found.  For us in this country to have produced a Bill, therefore, without the necessary painstaking ground-work would have been irresponsible. The Bill that is before the House deals &mdash;successfully, I believe&mdash;with the major human problems in this area.</P>
    <P>This does not mean that I am opposed to joint ownership of the family home.  The whole tenor of the Bill makes it plain that I favour it enthusiastically.  However, the much more wide-ranging questions of whether a compulsory system of joint ownership or a system of community of property would be desirable or acceptable are questions for another day.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I take this opportunity to say that I believe that the present law relating to the ancillary orders in respect of property that may be made in matrimonial proceedings may be in need of some change.  This is, of course, a matter that is outside the scope of the Bill and that will have to be examined separately, I mention it only as a point of interest.</P>
    <P>If I have spoken at what might seem too great a length on this Bill it is because I believe that it is an important piece of legislation.  I look forward with interest to hearing the views of Deputies on the proposals and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews:</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, recognise that the Minister had an obligation to speak at great <Col N="76" /> length&mdash;as he described it&mdash;on this very important and, if I might respectfully say so, very complex Bill. The principle of ensuring that the family home cannot be disposed of without the consent of the other spouse is an excellent one.  The spouse here includes the protection of the children of the marriage.  The Bill very clearly alludes to that specific.  Deputies who have concerned themselves with family law&mdash;I believe the vast majority of Deputies are concerned in this area&mdash; know of quite a number of cases&mdash;I believe they are on the increase&mdash;of family homes having been sold over the head of the spouse.</P>
      <P>We should not engage in any pretence that spouses, effectively, are the wives of marriages, the women, in the context of this Bill.  The Minister, whether intentionally or otherwise, averted to this in his opening speech. This Bill is about the protection of the wives and children in the final analysis.  This side of the House has been calling for a Bill of this kind for a number of years and we are now glad to welcome the Family Home Protection Bill, 1976.  We welcome the intentions and the desirable objectives sought in this Bill.</P>
      <P>When the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party spoke on the legal status of women in Ireland at a seminar organised by the Cork Federation of Women's Organisations to mark the International Women's Year on 26th April, 1975, he stated in his lengthy and comprehensive address in relation to the whole area of women and the law:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An area in which we need to introduce legal reform is that dealing with the ownership of the matrimonial home.  At present, very often because the house is in the husband's name, there is a possibility that the courts would recognise that the wife's equitable right to be regarded as joint owner of the house by reason of her work in the home or what she may have contributed to by way of dowry or by way of her work after the marriage. I believe there should be an express enactment by the Oireachtas that she has such a potential right to <Col N="77" /> joint ownership in the house so that it could not, for example, be sold without her consent.</P>
    <P>That was a clear call by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party to bring about a piece of legislation like the one which the House has under discussion. Our worry in regard to the legislation before us is that it may cause more problems than it seeks to solve.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that few, if any, in our society will contend against the desirable end to protect the married woman and her children from hardship caused as a result of unhappy differences with her husband. Nobody will quarrel with the absolute obligation of protecting dependent children under circumstances arising from such unhappy differences to which the children, because of their tender years, are not a party.  The Fianna Fáil Party have no desire to countenance hardship.  We have always been prepared to consent to proper steps being taken to alleviate the burden of hardship in this field.</P>
    <P>My contribution at the outset is geared effectively to point out the anomalies and difficulties which may arise in the application of this legislation. We cannot overstress the need for the intent of this legislation.  We welcome the opportunity to discuss it. We accept the Minister's <i>bona fides</i> in his desire to protect the spouse against the sale of the house, without his or her consent, and the contents therein, the chattels so called in legal jargon. Anything we say in our contributions will be to ensure the better effectiveness of the legislation which we are now discussing.  Article 43.1.1º of the Constitution acknowledges that a citizen, in virtue of his or her rational being, has the natural right, antecedent to positive law, to the private ownership of external goods.  Subsection 2º states:</P>
    <P>The State accordingly guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath and inherit property.</P>
    <P>Article 43.2.1º provides that the State recognises that the exercise of the <Col N="78" /> rights aforementioned ought in civil society be regulated by principles of social justice.  It also provides in subsection 2º that the State may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of these rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>I believe that the function of the Oireachtas, both the Dáil and the Seanad, is to steer a course which gives effect to the whole of Article 43 of the Constitution of 1937.  We must be careful, keeping in mind the people we are trying to protect in this legislation, before we interfere with the free buying and selling of property which is part and parcel of a free society. We recognise ourselves as being a free Society.  The Minister has paid tribute to the mortgagees, lessors and others who are involved in the buying and selling of property.</P>
    <P>In the main, the majority are anxious not to do harm to people from whom they are buying or to whom they are selling property.  We must ensure that this and other legislation does not discourage lessors or building societies from letting houses to married couples or couples proposing marriage, or providing the necessary capital by way of mortgage to provide a matrimonial home.  The legislation by any measure must not muddy up the title or impose a gratuitous burden on lessors and lessees who in a free society cannot be required to let a house or advance money.</P>
    <P>Having studied this Bill in considerable depth and being concerned about its efficacy, legal and otherwise, one must come to the conclusion that the parliamentary draftsmen must have had many sleepless nights when drafting this Bill.  I say that in dispensation of the draftsmen because they are given instructions and then draw up the Bill.  This is in no way a criticism of them.  The legal implications&mdash; which I will continue to pursue in outline&mdash;in this legislation for the people we seek to protect may be far-reaching in their consequences.  That is why this legislation may have been of concern to the draftsmen.  We want to produce a legislative product which is good and unassailable.  It is a concern <Col N="79" /> and worry to us that some sections of this Bill may be assailable, constitutionally at any rate, by those who may wish to challenge it on constitutional grounds.</P>
    <P>This Bill may be suffering from legislative flabbiness.  I have doubts in this regard because I do not want to impugn the integrity of those who drafted the Bill, quite the contrary.  It would be unfair and cowardly to do so.  The Bill might have been hastily put together without any real thought being given to the wider implications in the field of the right to own personal property and dispose of one's goods, which will have the effect of creating hardships for those it is intended to protect.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the law, as interpreted by the court, does not stand still.  As early as 1957, the Fianna Fáil Party then in Government enacted the Married Women's Status Act. Section 12 enables the High Court or, in certain circumstances, the Circuit Court on application by either the husband or wife to determine any question between them as to the title to or possession of any property.  It is becoming increasingly clear that a wife, by reason of her marriage contract&mdash; the Minister has very fairly alluded to this in his very lengthy contribution&mdash; obtains special rights in relation to the matrimonial home and in the disposition of property.  When a judicial separation is decreed, the court has power to leave the wife and dependent children in the matrimonial home and even to deny the husband access to the home.  This was copperfastened by the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>A fundamental concern in relation to this Bill may be that in a desire to deal with cases of hardship it has placed a general restraint and alienation, even in cases where no restraint is necessary.  For our part we would have no objection to the extension of section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, to give specific power to the court, on the application of a spouse, to restrain the disposition of a family home by the other spouse.  This would clearly meet any cases of hardship <Col N="80" /> which might arise while maintaining at the same time in normal circumstances the right of an owner of a premises to sell or otherwise dispose of property.</P>
    <P>The question of legal costs will arise. While section 11 deals with the abandonment of certain fees in relation to the Land Registry and registration in the office of the registry of deeds, the Minister&mdash;we feel he might deal more specifically with it in his reply&mdash; did not deal with the whole question of legal costs in relation to this legislation.</P>
    <P>The question of legal costs does not affect the matter to which I have just adverted.  A careful reading of the Bill makes it quite clear that the extent of possible actions in the courts for the purpose of applying this measure are as follows&mdash;I do not pretend the list is exhaustive&mdash;first, an application by the spouse to the court to dispense with the necessity for consent.  Second, an application to the court restraining the other spouse from disposing of certain household chattels.  Third, an application by a spouse to the court in relation to mortgagee suits. Fourth, an application by a spouse to the court in relation to proceedings for ejectment by a landlord.  Fifth, an application to the court against a third party in respect of property bought by him when the purchase is called into question on the basis of his alleged failure to make inquiries or affecting the value of the property sold.  Sixth, an application to the court for an injunction alleging conduct on behalf of the other spouse which may lead to the loss of any interest in family home or render it unsuitable for habitation. Seventh, an application to the court in relation to a third party who has taken possession of certain or all the chattels.</P>
    <P>Where will the money come from to enable these proceedings to be made?  Court proceedings are expensive, as the Minister knows arising out of his own extensive practice as a solicitor.  People who practice law must admit that court proceedings can be expensive.  If the only asset of a marriage consists of the family home, furniture and other contents there in, how can applications be brought <Col N="81" /> under the Bill by either spouse without that spouse running the risk of incurring substantial costs?  If one spouse succeeds in the application the costs will come from the other person and this means that the value of the property is abated.  There is no use in giving rights unless the person concerned is given the wherewithal to enforce the rights without fear.  That is a reasonable proposition in logic, if not in law.</P>
    <P>We recognise that if it were proposed to exclude any jurisdiction vested in the courts in respect of many matters in the Bill the Bill could not stand measured against the Constitution.  It is not enough to say in a general way that the husband will pay when he may not have the means to do so even though there is an order of the court in force.  It may be that paying the cost severely limits the funds available for the upkeep of the husband, his wife and dependent children.  This would defeat the object of this very important Bill.</P>
    <P>We contend that, legislatively speaking, this is a loose Bill.  This becomes clear when one considers the sweeping nature of section 3 (1) which states:</P>
    <P>Where a spouse, without prior consent in writing of the other spouse, purports to convey any interest in the family home to any person except the other spouse, then, subject to section 4 the purported conveyance shall be void.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister considered what might happen if it was proposed to acquire land, including the family home, for the purposes of the Housing Act, 1966?  Deputy Esmonde might help in this matter.  In particular, I refer to paragraph 4 of the Third Schedule which provides that notice of acquisition shall be served on every owner, lessee and occupier. It is only they who are entitled to make objections to confirmation of the compulsory purchase order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal owner has a title to the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would listen to my contribution and, <Col N="82" /> no doubt, he will challenge it when he rises to speak.  I have already referred to the provisions of paragraph 4 of the Third Schedule.  It is only the owner, lessee or occupier who is entitled to make objections to confirmation of the compulsory purchase order by the Minister.  Neither in the Bill nor in the Housing Act is there any provision that allows a spouse to object although the compulsory purchase of the premises will deprive her of her rights to the matrimonial home.</P>
      <P>One further example which springs to mind concerns the compulsory acquisition of land by the Land Commission. This acquisition may include the family home and there is nothing in the Bill that will enable the spouse who is not the owner to object to this alienation by operation of law.  I am sure that if this Bill becomes law many more anomalies will come to the surface in the course of time. Society has been geared to the proposition that in regard to compulsory acquisition it is only the owner who is concerned and who must be dealt with.</P>
      <P>For these reasons alone we ask that the Bill be referred back to the parliamentary draftsman to reconsider all the points made.  We ask that between now and Committee Stage the parliamentary draftsman would have another look at the Bill, for which the Minister will not deny responsibility. In the final analysis, it is he who must carry the legislation through this House.  The Minister and this side of the House have in common the fact that we are concerned that the people we seek to protect are properly and thoroughly protected.  We do not want this legislation to become a bonanza for lawyers or a lucrative paradise for them.  Probably I say that against those who engage in this aspect of the law.  We ask that between now and Committee Stage the parliamentary draftsman examines in detail the ramifications of these proposals.  This Bill is well intentioned but there is the fear that it will cause a great deal of legal uncertainty and litigation not only between spouses but with many other persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> Section 3 (3) imposes burdens on the purchaser and it may prove unworkable. Again, it may affect the people it is intended to help.  The relationship of vendor and purchaser is a sensitive one. For instance, how would a purchaser know if the written consent of a spouse had been obtained by undue influence, by fraud or by forgery?  Can the buyer be sure that in buying the property he or she is not buying a lawsuit in regard to property that the buyer bought <i>bona fide</i> for a decent price?  Such property may be taken away from the purchaser as a void conveyance at the suit of the spouse.  The purchaser, having regard to the law, is entitled to fixity of tenure just as much as our forefathers became so entitled.  The matter is made worse in that section 3 (3) provides that if a question arises in any proceedings whether the conditions specified in this subsection were fulfilled, the burden of providing this shall fall on the purchaser.</P>
    <P>That may not be what one might call taking the correct side in the context of current social thinking but, nevertheless, as legislators we have an obligation to ensure that our laws are applied equally and that they have applicability in equal measure to all. Does the Minister seriously think that the building societies or other lending agencies will advance money on such a title?  If these agencies lend such money and if the sale is avoided at the suit of the other spouse their security will then disappear and they will be left with such remedy as may be open to them against the purchaser.  We can envisage many circumstances where, if the matter is put to the test, the purchaser no matter how well he acted in good faith and had tried to fulfil the provisions under the Act may find it impossible to discharge the burden of proving same and then would be left with the doubtful privilege of trying to get back from the owner-spouse the moneys paid by him to that spouse for the purchase of that house.</P>
    <P>Throughout this contribution the thread of concern for the people whom this legislation is intended to protect is foremost.  If I advert to that fact it is clearly to instil in the minds of those <Col N="84" /> who may think that in some way I am taking the side of building societies or lending agencies against the people we hope to protect by this Bill, that we are trying to perfect what we consider to be impure legislation.  That is the reason for acting as devil's advocate in the context of the legislation before us. It is extremely important legislation and its effects are far reaching and important to those whom it will affect and benefit.  It will be important in the main to the wife and children.  Consequently, this contribution can be seen as intended to protect the spouse and children and their position in law and not to have this legislation become a plaything in the hands of those who would wish to opt out of their legal, moral and social obligations.</P>
    <P>It is now necessary to consider a matter touched upon earlier, the position of a lessor and the position of a mortgagee.  It is not fashionable in certain quarters to say anything good about either a lessor or a mortgagee but it is not yet suggested that a lessor does not own the property proposed to be let and that the mortgagee does not own the money.  Leaving aside what one's views may or may not be concerning lessors and mortgagees it will be necessary to look upon the hard facts of life on the grounds that this bears repeating, that a lessor does not have to let and a mortgagee does not have to advance money.  While the question of title has already been dealt with, sections 6, 7 and 8, as we understand them, may attempt&mdash;again, the Minister may confirm that it is not so and if he does we will accept his statement without reservation&mdash;to circumscribe the rights of lessors and mortagees notwithstanding specific provisions contained in existing letting agreements and mortgages freely entered into for the benefit of the lessor or the mortgagee.</P>
    <P>The constitutionality of the Bill is very doubtful but it appears clear that the proposals contained in these sections may amount subject to what the Minister may say, to an invasion of the right of private ownership of external goods protected under Article 43 of the Constitution.  If that situation is a matter of constitutional. <Col N="85" /> fact the Minister has an obligation to bring it back for amendment to give it the effectiveness so desired by this House.  We want the Bill to be effective and to protect the spouse and children in the event of the irretrievable breakdown of marriage by way of constructive desertion and in many other ways alluded to in the Bill.  We want, unequivocally, the rights of the spouse and children protected absolutely. That is the reason I have raised these points.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (2) is of far-reaching importance in that it invades the right of a mortgagee to have a provision in the mortgage deed providing for the capital sum as a whole becoming due in default of payment.  This provision is common to practically every mortgage deed and has always been found necessary to protect a person who advanced money by this method.  It has always been held that unless this provision is in a mortgage deed all the mortgagee can do is sue for such arrears as had occurred prior to the date of his proceeding and he or she can never bring proceedings for the return of that money from mortgagors in arrears.  The same considerations apply to leases.  It probably is socially desirable that relief should be given in this way but has the Minister considered the effect this will have on persons with properties to let and societies or bodies having money to advance to people who are newly married or about to get married?  We have to recognise everybody's right in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Until we reach a stage that a lessor will be obliged and directed to let his house and a building society will be obliged and directed to lend their money such persons and bodies will not do so.  The Minister is probably aware that money is difficult enough to obtain at present for house purchases for persons intending to marry without adding retrospectively this substantial difficulty and making the procuring of an advance of moneys infinitely more difficult.</P>
    <P>I should like now to turn to the question of chattels.  It is wholly wrong for one spouse to denude the house of chattels.  However, we feel <Col N="86" /> that the High Court has sufficient powers at present in this regard and section 9 of the Bill may, again subject to what the Minister may say, not be altogether necessary.  The courts in proceedings have adequate powers in relation to chattels in the matrimonial home and in section 9 (6) there is an important amount of furtiveness in dealing with chattels whereby if one spouse secretly disposes of a chattel to a third party without selling the other spouse is not entitled to get it back. In the ordinary practice of human affairs this emphasis on information in writing is quite unreal.  Suppose, for example, the other spouse does not know the identity of the third party or cannot find it out even by the most thorough investigation, that spouse is in a wholly different situation from a person who is informed by the other spouse that an open sale is about to be made of chattels or a chattel in the house.  This section may draw no experience from ordinary human behaviour.</P>
    <P>The Circuit Court as presently constituted, as we understand it, is totally unsuitable for matrimonial cases.  It is a civil bill court, as the Minister knows, except in special stated circumstances. The proceedings must commence by civil bill with a defence being entered.  This contrasts unfavourably with the special summons in the High Court which provides that the matter comes via the Master of the High Court to the court directly and each person's point of view is stated on affidavit.  This is in the absence of family courts.</P>
    <P>I have alluded to the party Leader's speech, already quoted, in Cork on 26th April, 1975 where he called for the examination of the setting-up of family courts but in the meantime this was the procedure.  It is important to point out that it is rarely that circuit court jurisdiction in respect of persons of unsound mind is invoked as this procedure is too cumbersome although the Circuit Court undoubtedly possesses such jurisdiction and if a concurrent jurisdiction is given to the Circuit Court special rules will have to be enacted so that the proceedings <Col N="87" /> can be really conducted in a summary manner.</P>
    <P>It can be gathered from what I have said that this side of the House is not opposed to this Bill&mdash;far from it; we welcome the intention and the principles behind the Bill.  This party are not opposed to the protection of wives in distress or difficulty but we feel that if this measure is tested constitutionally there may be some doubt as to its efficacy in that respect.  God forbid it will be so tested.  Nevertheless, we have a duty, if we are serious in respect of the people about whom we are concerned, to state these facts. All Deputies will be anxious to ensure that the legislation in respect of the people we seek to protect will be good legislation and does not end up in a quagmire of argument and counter-argument, expense and counter-expense, hardship and counter-hardship. That is why I felt it incumbent on me to express in this debate these views for which I make no apology.</P>
    <P>The constitutionality may be in some doubt.  Some spouse, almost certainly a husband, may challenge its constitutionality.  If some wealthy husband considers himself badly done by under the terms of this Bill&mdash;one must look at the extreme cases&mdash;no doubt he will challenge it.  The Minister rightly said in his speech, and used a fascinating quotation in that it is absolute truth and it is worth repeating:</P>
    <P>There may reasonably be expected to be proceedings that in some cases may occasion a degree of vindictiveness likely to tempt a spouse to take somewhat desperate steps.  As Louis Nizar has observed &ldquo;There is no limit to the blazing hatred, the unquenchable vengefulness, the reckless abandonment of all standards of decent restraint, which a fierce matrimonial contest engenders&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of fact that if a situation arises in marriage where the husband and wife are at daggers drawn&mdash;it does not always happen, but hopefully they will have their blazing rows away from their children and that these are not a party to such <Col N="88" /> bitterness as a breakdown of marriage &mdash;where there is a complete breakdown, brought about by deep hatred between one female human being and one male human being in circumstances where, say, the male partner feels that he is badly done by, he will go to the ends of the earth to bring about continuing hurt to his marriage partner.  This is a matter of fact and that is why I say that one must examine the possibility, if not immediately at least in the not too distant future, of a constitutional action arising out of this Bill.  It is a source of great worry to this side of the House&mdash;and the Minister and his parliamentary draftsman must also have been aware of it &mdash;that the Bill could be tested constitutionally and found unconstitutional. I hope this does not arise as the Bill is well-intentioned and the Minister made a fair contribution in his Second Reading speech.  He is well aware of the problems which exist in regard to full desertion or where a person is in desertion&mdash;constructive desertion&mdash;and where the marriage has irretrievably broken down.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to talk of important pieces of legislation of this nature, family law reform; it is family law reform in a piecemeal fashion but important because it deals with specific areas, but it does not deal with all areas and in that way is defective. The Minister may have been in error in not at least touching on the situation where marriage irretrievably breaks down and one or other spouse may wish to remarry and&mdash;I will not put a tooth on it&mdash;obtain a divorce. The Minister has avoided the word in his contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind being diverted, it is a subject which we are deeply concerned about.  The Minister in his speech in Salthill stated that he was for contraception, but that he would not introduce a Bill in relation to this until the Fianna Fáil Party would allow a free vote thereon.  That is what I would call avoiding the issue. In the first instance, the Minister said that the Minister for Health was really responsible for matters on contraception but later on admitted that the Department of Justice are responsible for the main area of contraception and divorce.  That is symptomatic of the lack of leadership in the Fine Gael Party and in the Coalition generally. The Minister has asked am I in favour of divorce.  The Minister should give his views on the subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is in a position to introduce legislation in relation to this area of family law, which in the final analysis, and sometime in the future, will have to include divorce.  I feel obliged to give a final illustration in relation to the anomalies which arise on this Bill. Suppose a third party, having made such inquiries as he thought were necessary to purchase property, gets married and suppose his transaction is attacked by the other spouse and he, being unable to discharge the onus of proof, finds himself with a void conveyance, what is he to do?  He has now a family home and his interest cannot be alienated without the consent of his spouse.  Litigation originally <Col N="90" /> between three parties at least, if one is to exclude the lessor and mortgagee now attracts a fourth party, namely the spouse of the purchaser.  When all this exercise is over, the parties will no doubt have the satisfaction of having received a decision, but under the present state of things the inroads made on the assets by this proposition will create hardship for those whom this Bill is intended to protect.  It seems desirable to question whether or not legislation should intrude into areas of family life in such an intimate fashion, when it could be argued that statute laws should do no more than provide protection for either spouse where all the other normal remedies are inadequate.  It is important to remember that the Succession Act of 1965&mdash;an admirable piece of social legislation&mdash;provides that a widow should have a legal right to one-third of the estate of her husband where he dies leaving an estate, and one-half of the estate where there are no issue. Why could this principle not apply between the parties while they are alive, so that the wife would, in effect, have a charge of one-third interest in the family home in her own right and a charge for such further share as may be appropriate if she has children, such right arising in her capacity as trustee of the infants' entitlements?  This would do away with the necessity of consent, and at the same time protect the position of both wife and child.  The charge to which a wife would be entitled would be greater where she has made financial contribution towards the purchase price of the family home.</P>
      <P>The definition of family home requires a careful explanation.  It might be considered that I am raising a hare in this respect.  For instance if a man buys a publichouse with accommodation annexed to it where the family resides, is the spouse's consent necessary for the sale of the publichouse portion of the premises or is her right exercisable in relation to the living accommodation only?  This Bill refers to the family home as a dwelling in which the married couple ordinarily reside.  I have already dealt at considerable length with constitutionality and its possible attack on those grounds by a vindictive and bitter spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> It is fair to say that the male farming community who are traditionally slow to marry are hardly likely to burst into a gallop towards the altar if it means that the farm which has been in their family for generations will, in effect, pass out of their control completely in the event of their getting married.  It is important to realise that the effect of this Bill is more far-reaching than the Succession Act of 1965 which in effect introduced the charge system.  The result of this Bill may be to place a total embargo on sales of family homes, and may cause considerable difficulty in the future for the spouses and children whom it seeks to protect.  We welcome without reservation the intention behind this legislation but we feel it is our duty to point out that we are concerned about its legislative purity and effectiveness.  We accept without reservation that the Minister brought forward this Bill with the best of intentions but having said that it is well to point out that the views expressed were geared towards ensuring that in a family breakdown situation a spouse, usually the wife, and the children would not have to suffer the hardship of uncertainty in relation to the disposal of the family home and its contents.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasised an important principle in relation to section 10, that is, the provision whereby proceedings under this legislation are to be held otherwise than in public.  This aspect of the Bill cannot be challenged. Because we live in a small society it is likely that many people will be aware of difficulties in a marriage but if the partners in that marriage reach a stage where they must have recourse to the legal process it is well that their emotions be kept private so far as possible.  This is why we welcome this statement of the Minister.  The same course was adopted in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act. The Minister said that while there are arguments both ways on the question of the desirability of privacy in proceedings, he considers that on balance it is better that such proceedings should not be heard in public.  In the <Col N="92" /> context of balancing one argument against another we would agree with the Minister in that regard.  Marriage difficulties are the immediate business of no one but the parties involved and the tragedy of the ending of a marriage should be kept as private as possible and not become a tool in the hands of those who were not concerned with the relationship even when it was going smoothly.  Such people are only interested in having somebody else's difficulties to talk about and they can be quite injurious in relation to those with whom they purport to be concerned.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister again to consider the suggestion that the Committee Stage of the Bill be taken within the next two to three weeks so as to allow the parliamentary draftsman in the meantime to have a look at the points we raised. However, if the Minister can give assurances in relation to these points, I have no reason to doubt that such assurances would be acceptable to us, in which case that would be the end of the matter but if he cannot give these assurances he might examine the various points raised and ask the parliamentary draftsman to consider the questions I have raised regarding some effects which may result from this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be a Member of this House on the occasion of the introduction of this Bill because for a long time, both in a personal and in a professional capacity, I have sought legislation of this nature, having regard to my experience of dealing with matrimonial cases.  It should be remembered that the human race has been very slow to rid itself of the bonds of feudalism in relation to property rights as between husband and wife.  Moves in this direction did not occur until the Married Women's Property Act of 1882 after which the matter seemed to fall into the doldrums and there was no further legislation to improve on the disparity that existed between husband and wife in relation to property until the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, which gave a married woman certain rights against her husband in relation to disputed property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> It is extraordinary that there has been such a long delay, virtually centuries and generations, before we have begun tackling the situation of the difficulties that arise in relation to the family home.  This Bill deals with two aspects.  One is the rights and relationships as between spouses and, secondly, the rights as between spouses and third parties.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer the House to Article 41, 1, 1º of the Constitution which states:</P>
    <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2º of the same Article states:</P>
    <P>The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    <P>When that Article became part of our Constitution it was criticised severely in that it was regarded as being an empty formula.  It is interesting to note that in it the word &ldquo;Family&rdquo; appears in capital letters, as if to add emphasis to what the Article was directed at. It will be noted that the family has rights that are inalienable and imprescriptible and antecedent and superior to all positive law.  One example of positive law could be rights given by statute passed by Parliament, some Act positively made by the Oireachtas. In this Bill we are providing the answer to the criticism of that Article in our Constitution in so far as we have removed the criticism of the empty formula, the pious platitude, because we are providing machinery to make certain that the principles, in some limited way, in respect of family property and the family home are protected and safeguarded so far as we can do so as legislators in this House.</P>
    <P>It is new and novel legislation.  The fact that certain difficulties have been referred to by the Opposition spokesman <Col N="94" /> should not deter us or give us undue cause for concern because, while the Constitution states what I have read out, up to now it lacked the machinery to implement the principle therein enshrined.</P>
    <P>I note also that in the drafting of the Bill the Minister, his Department and the legal draftsmen have been very careful to recognise that any legislation introduced to protect the family home must not also, at the same time, be used as a vehicle that may damnify the interests of other people intimately concerned with the proprietary rights in that family home, by reason of transactions or some other event.</P>
    <P>The Minister has rejected the point of view which said that the family home can be protected by means of registration.  My view is that the Minister was absolutely right in taking that view though he does in the Bill allow for the option of registration as an added protection if any spouse wants to avail of it.  But, for the reasons given, the Minister has been perfectly correct to take that decision because when difficulties arise in a family unit, they are usually behind the scenes&mdash; nobody knows about them at the beginning&mdash;and a lot of damage could be done in relation to the right of the family to remain residing in the family home if the whole matter of protection had to rely on registration.  It would have meant virtually the compulsory registration of every matrimonial home in the country.  I do not think our people would wear that type of legislation. Quite apart from that is the good, commonsense approach adopted in this Bill, namely, that the person who has the proprietary right of ownership of the property&mdash;if he wants to avail of his rights as an owner&mdash; must also, at the same time, observe his moral obligations to his family. The onus is placed on that person, be it the husband or wife who happens to be the owner.  This is a very sensible and well-balanced approach to this very delicate and difficult area which cannot be faulted.  The Minister and his Department are much to be complimented on their approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to a few <Col N="95" /> matters mentioned by Deputy Andrews. I came in in the middle of his dealing with a matter concerning compulsory purchase orders being made which might affect the family home.  I think he was making the case that the wording in paragraph 4 of the Third Schedule of the Housing Act, 1966 does not allow&mdash;say the husband is the owner of the property&mdash;for the wife's interests, as provided for under this Bill, to be taken into consideration; that part of that Act, which refers to those who would be served with notice and who would have the right to appear, are the owner, a lessee or an occupier, I cannot conceive of any circumstance arising in which a wife would not be regarded as an occupier in that sense.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>That she would not be allowed to appear, possibly as an objector to it.  The word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; is probably the widest term one could use, because it is somebody who is in possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is synonymous but I do see another point here.  I think also that the word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; need not necessarily be taken as physical occupation, in the sense of a person physically sitting on the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill recognises that in certain circumstances where the wife may have been forced to leave her home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that she would be an &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; in the family home and she would be entitled to appear on a CPO, in those circumstances, to protect her interests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  The Deputy was perfectly right to raise the point.  My answer to it is that I think the word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; does cover that category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="96" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews:</NameTxt>
      <P>Lawyers will go to court about it.  That is the difficulty I foresee.  One says one thing and somebody else says something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to our principles of jurisprudence and our methods of doing things here, one cannot preclude a person going to court about anything.  That is a fundamental right of the Constitution and even before the Constitution a person had that right.  It has been well established that one does not even have to point to an Article of the Constitution to give one the right to go to court; one has got the right anyway. It is one of those rights that is antecedent and superior to anything that is positively written down on paper as being a right.  One has that right.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I might deal further with the question of &ldquo;occupier&rdquo;.  My recollection is that the word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; has been interpreted that a person may not be physically actually in possession of the property.  I think occupier's rights have been allowed for, in compensation cases, where the person is residing away from the land and has not used it at all.  But, because of some local circumstances, he cannot use the land and he has been given compensation.  I think there is decided authority to that effect.  That is my recollection but I am subject to correction on that.  I think the same position arises in respect of the Irish Land Commission acquisitions. We all know that when there is a list published the person whose land is being acquired has the right to go in, object and be heard as an objector to the acquisition.  Certainly, the Land Commissioners are very careful to investigate the family circumstances of a case.  While it may look that under the section this is a proper case for acquisition, the commissioners always take the family circumstances into consideration.  That is inherent and written in anyway.  If the commissioners did not observe that, there would be a very short, quick trip to the appeals tribunal and that would be the end of the acquisition if those rights were not recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present we have only the <Col N="97" /> general principles stated in the Constitution. In this Bill we give teeth to those principles.  Also the word &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; has large and important connotations.  People should bear in mind that this Bill is not concerned only with the case of a vindictive husband who may want to sell the property and leave the wife and children without a roof over their heads.  There are various methods by which a man can do away with the proprietary rights or convert them into money.  One of the simplest and most obvious methods is to take out a mortgage, pocket the money, disappear and leave the wife and children the house with nothing to pay for the mortgage.  This is an all too common occurrence.  I am glad to say that the attitude of most, if not all, Irish building societies is to be very understanding in those circumstances. Sometimes one could describe their attitude as giving unusual latitude to try to assist the unfortunate spouse who is left in that situation.</P>
    <P>I want to point to another matter that has been cause for concern and complaint.  I refer to the case where there is a judicial separation and a weekly, monthly or whatever period it is, sum is provided as alimony and the husband does not pay.  If he disappears and leaves the country, It is virtually impossible to recover that money from the defaulting husband. The unfortunate deserted wife has got her order for divorce a <i>mensa et thoro</i>.  Her order for a weekly payment is a pyrrhic victory.  She has nothing except a house if he has not mortgaged it too heavily.  All she can do is allow the weekly or monthly payments to build up.  She then has to get a judgment against her husband and against his property in the home.  She has to try to realise the home after that in her capacity as mortgagee.  In other words, she has to sell the home. That is her only method of getting any redress or help.</P>
    <P>This has been a common ground for complaint.  In most of these cases that I have had experience of the husband has already heavily mortgaged the property so that when <Col N="98" /> she comes to realise the small few instalments of her alimony she finds that whatever money is obtained for the house has to go to pay off the mortgage.  It is fair to say in those cases, particularly where the husband was an alcoholic, that debts have been incurred and judgments have been obtained against the property for the non-payment of the usual household bills.  In such cases the husband has got a mortgage, there is nothing left and the wife can do nothing.</P>
    <P>The same applies in relation to chattels.  Rural Deputies know of cases where husbands have sold off the cattle by degrees for drink and there is practically nothing left.  Under this Bill the unfortunate wife of a large family has the machinery to prevent those things happening.  I am not sure what happens where cattle are concerned but so far as goods and chattels in the home are concerned she can do something about it.  She can also prevent her husband from raising a mortgage on the family home to the detriment of the ultimate residual value of the home.  A provision like this has been long overdue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews quite rightly said that the situation in relation to a fraudulent transaction can occur.  One cannot guard against fraud because the ingenuity of the criminal mind is always there.  One cannot wipe it out by legislation.  The only think one can do is give adequate and fair protection to the purchaser of what was the family home, put the onus on the owner to tell the truth and if he does not there are sanctions in the Bill. He is liable to up to five years' imprisonment on indictment.  One should also bear in mind that this Bill is so drafted that it is not a new code of law in relation to property.  Its prime purpose is to protect the innocent spouse from the vindictive conduct of a vindictive spouse.  We should not lost sight of that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews also referred to the question of lessor and mortgagee and he referred to sections 6 to 8 and stated that these sections as drafted might have unconstitutional implications. He referred to Article 43 of the Constitution.  The creation of legal <Col N="99" /> rights under the Succession Act was also open to the same criticism and nobody has been advised that that is not constitutional.  If we go back to the Article I referred to originally, the State recognises the family as the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of society.  I hope we will be able to keep it that way and strengthen the family unit.  There was some mention of divorce and contraception in the House but my view is that if we spent more time in public debate in strengthening the family unit and paid due regard to its position in society instead of finding easy ways out for those who are not prepared to make a go of family life, we would be a little bit more constructive and would achieve something.  There is an undue amount of talk by all in the media on these problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">

      <P>I remember there was a decision made in Galway on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quite rightly pointed out that certain people were more interested in obtaining contraceptives than anything else.  We should get our priorities right.  The priority is the family unit.  A couple get married to rear a family.  That is their function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are others but the contraceptive pill is not the be all and end all of married life.  It never was and never will be, please God, in Ireland.  Section 8 (2) deals with lump payments that are provided for in a deed or document, be it a lease or mortgage.  Deputy Andrews expressed some concern that the effect of section 8 (2) would be to preclude that remedy to a lessor or mortgagee.  On his part, to be fair to him, there was a slight misreading of the situation. It should also be borne in mind that before section 8 (2) comes into effect one has also got to have a look particularly at section 7 (b).  When the court has to make a decision on these matters it must be just and equitable in the circumstances before an order <Col N="100" /> can be made which virtually wipes the slate clean.</P>
      <P>One must bear in mind that a person who lets property is interested, first of all, in obtaining an income and, secondly, in having security that his property will repay its value.  Likewise, a mortgagee is interested in obtaining repayment of the loan with a profit and security for the loan.  One has got to look at the matter in the light of that situation.  I do not see anything in section 8 (2) that does away with those principles or requirements. All it does is say that if the arrears are paid up, if there is fair assurance that the annual, monthly or periodic repayments, whatever they are, will be continued the court will say: &ldquo;Right, everything is paid off up to date.  Let us wipe the slate clean and leave the family home there.&rdquo;  We must remember at this stage that the lessor and the mortgagee have been paid what is owed to them.  Clauses where a lump sum comes in are usually either by virtue of a penalty or a forfeiture clause.  They are basically <i>in terrorum</i> clauses to make certain that the lessee abides by his obligation on the lease and the mortgager abides by his obligations under the mortgage.</P>
      <P>It is quite right that this should be written into this legislation because I know in practice where there have been payments by a wife to a building society and where the society has moved for sale of the premises by virtue of breach of a condition or clause of the mortgage because there has been non-payment of an instalment. When the court hear that the payment has been made and the building societies say they have been paid to date, and they are not interested in selling off the property, the slate is virtually wiped clean.  There is nothing in law to show that it is absolutely of no effect.  There has always been a niggling doubt that the building society on a future occasion could go back to the original omission of payment and say: &ldquo;This happened on such and such a date and out you go.&rdquo;  It is well that this point has been cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the same kind of approach to breaches of covenants under the Reversionary Leases Act.  It is good <Col N="101" /> to have legislation to clear up areas of doubt which have been in legal minds as to the exact position where time has been given.  This is a common occurrence.  All one has to do is walk into the Dublin Circuit Court on a Monday morning at motion time to hear cases of unfortunate wives trying to save the family home because their husbands had deserted them, did not send any money home, and left them with the mortgage and the rearing of the family.  These unfortunate people have come to look for time. Very often a helpful friend or relative will give them the necessary money to pay off the arrears.  My experience, acting on both sides of the fence, has been that building societies always try to avoid selling the family home. One could say that to a certain extent this is recognition of an unchartered authoritative procedure that has been adopted in our courts.  Now we have legal sanction for it and this is as it should be.</P>
    <P>I find myself in disagreement with Deputy Andrews when he says that the Circuit Court is unsuitable for matrimonial matters.  My experience, and the experience of others, has been that the idea of having to go to the High Court for everything matrimonial has been a deterrent to people seeking their fair legal rights where a matrimonial dispute arises.  While it may not be such a hardship to somebody residing in Dublin where the High Court is more or less in permanent session, it is quite a different matter when a person living 100 miles or more from Dublin has to come to Dublin for a hearing of their case.  Everybody should have the right to go to a court in their local area.  If it is easy for a person in Dublin to avail of the proximity of the court, it should be the same for provincial dwellers. Therefore, the Circuit Court should be allowed for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews mentioned the definition of &ldquo;family home&rdquo; which appears in section 2.  He posed the question: what is the situation where there is a licensed premises with dwelling accommodation?  Has the wife's consent to be obtained to dispose of the licensed premises?  No, because <Col N="102" /> the dwelling accommodation of licensed premises has to be separate and distinct from the licensed premises under the licensing code and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts, Therefore, it is possible to sell the licensed premises without selling the dwelling accommodation.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that although a spouse may object to the sale of the family home, there is provision under this Bill for the person who has failed to obtain consent. One must bear in mind that the person who sought the consent from the other spouse may very well be the person who is in the right about selling the family home.  It may be that the spouse who is being difficult in refusing to give consent is in the wrong.  Deputy Andrews in my view is seeing unreal objections.  Knowing him, I doubt if he is pressing that point.  As he has made that point in this House, and as I have got involved in some of his points, it is only right that I should meet it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to certain matters that will require teasing out on Committee Stage.  I will not delay on them now, but it might be helpful if the position in regard to wards of court and bankruptcy was clearly set out and if it was stated how it will impinge on the operation of the Bill.  I know the bankruptcy area is a difficult one and we have a report of a commission but there has not been any legislation following on that.  The position of wards of court might have to be provided for although it is possibly included under the section that provides for recourse to a court of law for an order absolving a person from obtaining consent.  It should be possible to provide some procedure in that case to avoid the necessity of actually going to court.  There might be some provision whereby the registrar or president of the High Court might have authority to grant a certificate without a formal application.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise another matter on which there may be some queries.  In advisory and placatory tones I am asking the Minister to clarify the position in relation to <Col N="103" /> rights being registerable and non-registerable burdens?  That point does not appear to be too clear.  Possibly it is clear; I may not have read the Bill correctly.  We know that certain burdens have to be registered and others do not have to be registered.  As far as I know, these are burdens that affect all property.  There has been a tendency on the closing of a sale to obtain a statutory declaration that certain burdens do not affect registered lands.  I think the statutory declaration deals with those that are not compulsorily registered; in other words, they affect registered lands without being registered.</P>
    <P>I have had the unfortunate experience, possibly shared by many other practitioners that some of these statutory declarations are done in a rather easy-going manner without due regard to the statutory declaration. This might be an area of abuse in relation to the family home where there is possibly a smouldering dispute.  The ingenuity of the human mind is such that a person who wants to be vindictive possibly will not let the other party have any inkling of the plans that are afoot.  One has to be careful to see that there is not a cute way of avoiding obligations under the legislation. I would be grateful if the Minister would direct his attention to that, either in his closing speech or on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the principle behind this Bill which sets out to protect the wife and family from having the family roof sold over their heads.  I say &ldquo;wife&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;.  This Bill sets out to protect both spouses but in the Irish context it will be generally directed at protecting the rights of the wife and family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been questioned in this debate whether the Bill is going against the property rights of the Constitution. My view is that when a man marries and has a family, in view of the responsibilities he has taken on automatically he forfeits&mdash;or should do so&mdash;some of his property rights <Col N="104" /> under the Constitution.  No man should be able to leave his wife and children without a home.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to protect the legal rights of the family but a major problem arises with regard to the costs that will be incurred.  It will be necessary for a wife to go to court in order to claim her rights under this Bill and here she takes on legal costs. In this country most of the family solicitors are picked by the husband and most of the legal affairs in the family are dealt with by the husband. When a problem arises in the marriage and the wife has to protect herself under this Bill, as well as suffering the trauma of the breakdown of the marriage and of the husband trying to sell the home over her head, she will have the added difficulty of finding a friendly solictor to act for her.  In most cases family solicitors are reluctant to get involved in rows between a husband and wife.  The wife is then faced with the financial cost of getting a solicitor to appear for her.</P>
    <P>The Minister having introduced legislation regarding legal protection should go further and give some assistance towards the legal cost of any action which a wife may have to take to protect the family home for herself and her family.  In most cases the wife normally looks after the children at home and she is not in a position to have money to instruct a solicitor to protect her rights.  This is one area where free legal aid and advice is essential.  In matters of family law, in particular in regard to this Bill, I would ask the Minister to introduce on Committee Stage a section that would extend free legal aid to the wife and family in their attempt to protect their rights.  To bring in a law without making it easily and readily available to the people we are seeking to protect defeats the object of the exercise.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out by Deputy Andrews, there are many anomalies in the Bill, although we agree that the principle behind it is excellent.  For example, the Bill refers to the family home and the protection of the spouses.  One of the anomalies in the present law in Ireland is that Church annulments are becoming <Col N="105" /> much more readily available than annulments by the State.  What is the situation of a husband who got a Church annulment?  Is he still legally bound to get the permission of his wife, whom in the eyes of the Church he never married but to whom in the eyes of the law he is still tied.  Would the Minister clarify that point? Another anomaly I see in the Bill is in relation to the definition of &ldquo;family home&rdquo;.  Section 2 states:</P>
    <P>(1) In this Act &ldquo;family home&rdquo; means, primarily, a dwelling in which a married couple ordinarily reside.  The expression comprises, in addition, a dwelling in which a spouse whose protection is in issue ordinarily resides or, if that spouse has with just cause left the other spouse, ordinarily resided before so leaving.</P>
    <P>The problem in this regard arises in the case of a building which is half residence and half business.  For example, the case of a public house or a shop with residential accommodation overhead or a farm with a house on the land.  The Minister, on this subject, said:</P>
    <P>Whilst no difficulties will arise in the case of a suburban semi-detached home, for example, it might not be easy in certain cases to say where the family home ends and where, for instance, a farm or a business premises begins.  In practice, the question should not give rise to major problems, since it should be easy to identify what should be regarded as &ldquo;going with&rdquo; the residence.</P>
    <P>I do not think it will be as easy as the Minister thinks.  Greater clarification is needed or otherwise there will be problems involved in the sale of premises used for business purposes and private accommodation.  The Minister said that in the overwhelming majority of cases the question would not arise since a wife would be perfectly willing to give her consent if required.  The whole point of the Bill is where the wife does not give consent. The Bill does not deal with the problem cases.  This section will become a lawyer's paradise unless it is further clarified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>(iii) The Bill provides that where a mortgagee or landlord of a family home brings proceedings because of arrears of repayments or of rent due by a spouse, the other spouse may, in effect, apply to the court to be given the opportunity to clear off the arrears and to take over the responsibility for future payments;</P>
    <P>I accept that the protection is there but what about the high legal costs involved?  A wife seeking protection under sections of this Bill will have to consider the cost involved.  It is possible that such a person would have a family and would not be working.  Her husband may take off and leave her with the mortgage. Where is the money to come from to continue paying the mortgage? In theory, the home is protected but a wife may not have sufficient money to meet the repayments on the home. In such a case there is little point in leaving her the home.  For that reason there is not sufficient protection. The theory is all right but where is the money to come from to continue the repayments on the mortgage?</P>
    <P>Dealing with section 4 (4) the explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that where the spouse whose consent is required is incapable of consenting by reason of unsoundness of mind or other mental disability, or has not after reasonable inquiries been found...</P>
    <P>What is meant by &ldquo;reasonable inquiries&rdquo;?  The Minister told us that this applied where a wife was suffering from mental disability or could not be found and the court could give its consent to a proposed sale by the husband if it considered it reasonable to do so but I should like to know how long a court or a husband must wait before the sale can go through on the basis of a wife not being found?  If a wife has gone abroad and cannot be found, will it be months or years before a husband can sell the house?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> An important feature of the Bill is that a wife is protected against a husband selling furniture from the home.  I welcome that section.  One of the most important sections is that which deals with the hearing of any legal battles in chambers.  It is wrong and undesirable that family quarrels should be fought out in open court. If family quarrels must go to court to be sorted out, that should take place in privacy.  Section 13 is another important section.  It states:</P>
    <P>No stamp duty, land registration fee, Registry of Deeds fee or court fee shall be payable on any transaction creating a joint tenancy between spouses in respect of a family home where the home was immediately prior to such transaction owned by either spouse or by both spouses otherwise than as joint tenants.</P>
    <P>While the State has removed responsibility for stamp duty and fees involved in such a transaction, the solicitors' fees involved might be very high.  In this regard I should like to refer the Minister to the legislation which gave the opportunity to householders to buy out their ground rents. Experience showed that the legal fees in many cases were up to five times greater than the actual cost of the purchase of the ground rent.  I would be afraid that the same thing would happen under this section.  That could prove a deterrent.  The Minister could have written something into the legislation concerning new purchases, that from now on all purchases of houses should be in joint names.</P>
    <P>The Minister argued quite reasonably against a registration system in favour of a consent system but while recognising there would be a problem in regard to existing ownership of property, for couples starting off from the date of the passing of this Bill, all dwellings should be in the joint names of husband and wife.  This would avoid legal problems later on, having to go to court, getting letters of consent and trying to find a spouse and so on.  I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of having a section to make it binding that houses purchased <Col N="108" /> from now on would be in the names of both husband and wife.  In Dublin County Council, of which I have the honour to be a member, when a house is allocated to a family we insist that it be in the joint names of husband and wife.  This is very desirable and over the years I think such a provision would remove the type of problem the Minister is seeking to resolve in this Bill without necessitating court action which I fear this Bill will give rise to.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted Louis Nizar as saying:</P>
    <P>There is no limit to the blazing hatred, the unquenchable vengefulness, the reckless abandonment of all standards of decent restraint, which a fierce matrimonial contest engenders.</P>
    <P>If, in this House, we can protect a wife and family from this type of situation we will have done a good day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the unanimous welcome of the legislation now before the House.  It is a very essential piece of social legislation and another step forward in the improvement of the position of women in our society.  As others have said, while in theory it applies to both husband and wife we know that in practice its benefits in the main will go to the wife.  It provides an elementary civil right for wives, the right to a roof over their heads and over the heads of the children of the marriage.  It is surprising that recognition of such a right should have taken so long to find expression in our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The struggle for basic civil rights for women has been long and frustrating, fraught with all kinds of difficulties. Tradition had given a superior right in all spheres to the male. He has dominated economically and socially and his dominance has been given the force and protection of the law.  Efforts to change this state of affairs were met with opposition, were often misunderstood and were met with a wall of prejudice.  Acceptance of the fact that women are human beings with basic rights and entitled to be treated as such has been very slow in coming.  The pace has quickened in the past couple of years <Col N="109" /> and for that the Minister and the Government generally can take credit. Women's associations can also take a great deal of credit.  They intensified their campaign in the last couple of years for social justice for women and we can at last say sincerely that their voices are being heard.</P>
    <P>We all know cases of women who had contributed most of their lives and labours to setting up a home and who, perhaps, even purchased the home with their savings and who had that home sold over their heads or had to endure threats of having it sold, without any rights under the law.  The Minister in his speech, which was rightly commended on both sides of the House, showed his deep concern and the amount of thought that he has given this matter.  In that speech he said that in strict law the wife's position is not strong.  That is an understatement. Up to very recently in our society the wife had very few rights until legislation that the Minister brought before the House gave her such rights.  There were rights for the wife and for the successors and children under the Succession Act but while the husband lived, up to the introduction of the present Bill and the Family Law (Maintenance) Bill, the rights of the wife and family were negligible.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will be welcomed by the associations pressing for the rights of women, particularly by AIM and ADAPT, those associations concerned with deserted and alone parents.  It is a chastening experience to listen to problems of members of that association and to hear graphic accounts of the humiliation and degradation they have had to suffer in their married lives without any right under the law, abuse and battering in extreme cases and in cases where the disagreement with their husbands did not reach the extreme of battering, they were subjected to humiliation by constant reminders that they had no right to the home in which they lived.  Definitely, this legislation will be welcomed by them and by all interested in the promotion of rights for women.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill are <Col N="110" /> very worthy ones.  I agree with those who say that the ideal is joint ownership of the family home.  This is essential to the partnership that exists in marriage, to the dignity of both parties to the marriage and essential to basic justice.  The Minister said this was an interim measure and that he is also looking at the question of joint ownership and community of property as the ideal.  I am very glad to have heard the Minister make that statement and, therefore, I wholeheartedly support and welcome this interim measure.</P>
    <P>The main provision in the Bill here is that a spouse who owns or has an interest in the family home may not sell or otherwise dispose of it without the consent of the other spouse.  I am happy with the definition of family home, the home in which the couple ordinarily reside which is the normal definition of a family home.  There is also the question of the wife whom the husband has deserted.  As the Minister said, this is the usual case one comes across where the husband seeks to dispose of the home to meet financial commitments of his own. We have, too, the case where the wife has to leave the family home with just cause.  It is important that these three specific instances should be written clearly into the Bill.</P>
    <P>On the question of a wife having to leave the family home with just cause, I should like to mention, though this may not be entirely relevant on this Bill since it is not a function of the Minister for Justice, the importance of providing shelter for such a woman. Some women who have had to leave their homes, with just cause, spend their nights in shelters and their days roaming the streets.  There is need for shelter for such people.  Such shelter is not available at the moment except that provided by voluntary organisations. I draw attention to the need in the hope that something will be done to meet the situation in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with restriction on the disposal of household chattels. Chattels are defined as furniture, bedding, linen, china, earthenware, glass, books and other chattels of ordinary household use or ornament <Col N="111" /> and also consumable goods, garden effects and domestic animals.  The wife may get an injunction from the court to prevent the husband disposing of the home or of the essential chattels in the home.  Seeking an injunction will naturally involve expense and for the most part we are dealing here with people with no means whatsoever, people whose labour is not rewarded in the normal way in which labour in other spheres is rewarded. These women are totally dependent and, therefore, totally penniless.  On an earlier Bill, the Family Law (Maintenance) Bill, it was argued that free legal aid should be available to these people.  Free legal aid is vitally important in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to proceedings being held in private court.  This is a very sensitive area and I agree that such proceedings should not be held in open court.  Section 13 deals with the creation of a joint tenancy in the family home and exemption from stamp duty and fees.  The stamp duty involved was represented as a deterrent to joint ownership.  I have no doubt the Minister has had representations made to him about this and I am very pleased, indeed, that he has chosen to abolish this deterrent.  It is a welcome provision.  The other deterrent of five days' imprisonment for a husband who breaks the provisions of the Bill is one essential if the Bill is to operate as we would wish it to operate.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the ideal of a community of property is something at which we should all aim and I am glad the Minister referred to that in the course of his speech today.  In the meantime, the wife's interest will be protected by this Bill.  There are other matters in relation to the Bill which can be dealt with more effectively on Committee Stage.  I certainly welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue and I would reiterate my request that, allied to this and other measures aimed at improving the position of women in the home, free legal aid and advice should be made available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I whole-heartedly agree with the general principle of the <Col N="112" /> Bill.  It is a complicated Bill.  I agree that free legal aid should be provided because the people mainly affected would not be in a position to meet the costs involved.  I am in favour of joint ownership of the family home and the absence of it has, I believe, led to some discontent.  Where a husband has no care for his wife and children he could turn around and sell the roof over their heads.  That is a situation that must be corrected.  I see a problem in defining what exactly is the family home in the case of a business premises.  Complications could arise.  However, this is really a Committee Stage Bill and we can discuss these matters on Committee Stage.  I believe local authorities when giving out houses should give them in joint ownership of the husband and wife.  That would go some way towards solving the problem when there are broken marriages and disagreements.  Whether we like it or not, these things occur and we must make provision to cope with the situation. This Bill is only for those who do not agree.  For the husband and wife who live happily together there is no occasion for this legislation.  Unfortunately, however, in the society we live in the question arises.  Down through the years there was no legislation to deal with it.</P>
      <P>There are cases of disagreement where the husband sells the home, and it can happen the other way round as well.  Joint ownership is the ideal way to have a home.  Nowadays many people are getting married very young. Nine cases out of ten the marriage will be all right but there will be the odd case where the young fellow did not know what he was letting himself in for.  The marriage breaks up, and in these cases there must be legislation such as the Minister is introducing to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>There will be a great deal of legal argument in the implementation of this Bill, and I would be slightly worried about the cost to the State if free legal aid is given.  There will be many things which will be hard to define, for instance, in determining the owner of the home.  Two people could be living in a house and they might not be legally married at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> We all agree with the principle of this Bill but many matters remain to be resolved on Committee Stage.  If it does anything to protect the wife from the type of husband who would sell the home on his wife and children, and, <i>vice versa,</i> protect the husband from the wife who would own the house, it will be a worth-while measure. This Bill is not as simple as it looks.  It will involve a great deal of legal argument across the floor of the House, and part of the Minister's speech I was able to get through in the short time I had it, recognises the difficulties involved.  It is one thing to stand up in this House and recommend that legislation should be brought in and that such-and-such a thing should be done, but another thing to overcome the many snags in changing the law.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House on this Bill.  I am not an authority on law.  I might talk about agriculture or other matters, but not about law. However, there is a legal man beside me and another legal man on the opposite side who should be arguing out how this Bill can be implemented to the benefit of the husband and the wife and to ensure that no married people lose out.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree that such cases should be dealt with privately.  Family affairs should be settled behind closed doors.  If the case has to go to court it should not be on the front pages of the newspapers.  In conclusion, I would issue a note of warning that the implementation of this Bill will not be as easy as it looks on paper.  However, like everybody else, I agree with the Bill in principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my few words of welcome to this Bill. I do not see it as a legal Bill but as a continuation of this Government's excellent policy in the field of social welfare and social security.  Why did we have to wait until 1976 to have a Bill such as this which gives a wife the guarantee that her husband cannot throw her out on the side of the road? This Bill should have been on the Statute Book long ago.  A great deal of credit must go to the Minister for bringing it in in 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the benefits, <Col N="114" /> the allowances and assistance schemes which were there before we came into office in 1973, but since we came into office I have personally experienced a great sense of caring on the part of this Government for the underprivileged and the people who cannot fend for themselves or shout for themselves as loudly as, say, the IFA or trade unions.  This is a Government that cares for the weaker sections of society, and I fully support their policy.</P>
    <P>Such an approach was not there in the term of office of the last Government, and I was in this House from 1969 to 1973.  The same interest and involvement in tackling modern sociological problems such as this Bill tackles was not there in the last Government. It is in this Government. This will be borne out in the years to come and will be understood by the people of Ireland at the next election.  I am very pleased that we brought in such an allowance as the deserted wives' allowance, the prisoners' wives' allowance, the unmarried mothers' allowance, and the single women's allowance.  These were all steps forward and should have been taken years before we came into office.  We are not getting credit from the Press or from the public for it, but we have in a very serious way tackled a number of vital areas of social problems.  This Bill continues that excellent policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech, which was very thoughtful, adequately covered the philosophy behind the Bill.  There will be no disagreement on the far side of the House in relation to the principles involved in the Bill.  I feel that a wife is most certainly entitled to have her interests and her family's interests in a house protected, and the method as accepted by the Minister, where written consent must be given by a wife or by a spouse rather than by way of registration of an interest is, on balance, the proper approach.  The Minister rightly pointed out, and I agree with him, that the registration method would have been a bit odious and might only make worse an already bad marriage, whereas the method adopted in the Bill, where the written consent must <Col N="115" /> be got by the husband to sell the family home, is a very sound method of approaching the problem.  I am pleased to see that there is a substantial penalty for the giving of false information by a husband in this respect.  A number of legal problems are involved which no doubt will be discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The question of joint ownership has been raised and dealt with very favourably in the Bill, and I am pleased to note that the question of paying stamp duty will not arise when joint ownership is being established.  Every encouragement should be given to have joint ownership, because it is the easiest way of protecting a wife and of ensuring that a house will not be sold over a wife's head.  When this Bill becomes an Act, what means will the Minister take to ensure that the rights of a spouse are there and that she can take certain steps in certain circumstances?  It would be unfortunate if the Bill, when it becomes law, was just a law.  I would like to see an agency being involved, so to speak, in advertising the Act.</P>
    <P>I am very much aware of the dedication and involvement of local assistance officers under the health boards in marriages which are breaking down and which present the problem of income for a deserted wife.  The assistance officers play a very important role in such cases.  Is there any method whereby they could be brought into being involved in this Act in some kind of an administrative way, because it is to a certain extent social welfare type of legislation, although I appreciate that it is under the Department of Justice?  The assistance officers would be of benefit in propagating the Bill to people in trouble.  They should be made aware of it and they should be actively told to implement the Bill where possible.  The assistance officers' main role is providing income for wives who have had the bad experience of having been deserted or who have been battered by husbands or who are not being kept properly by their husbands.  They are doing excellent work.  This is really an extension of our approach to tackling this vital area in our society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="116" /> It only relates to houses which are actually owned.  It does not tackle the question of houses which are rented or where the families are just tenants of local authorities.  Tribute must be paid to the housing officers, because, certainly in my constituency, the approach adopted by housing authorities is one of utter generosity of spirit and I am not aware of any case where a deserted wife has been put out on the roadside.  Indeed, I do not think the council would tolerate such an attitude in this day and age but that is something that is not dealt with in this Bill.  This Bill is confined to the legal aspect where you have a house owned by one spouse or the other, usually by the husband.</P>
    <P>The question of giving the option of registration to spouses has also been included in the Bill.  That is a fair point, that a wife may add her name as an interested party in the house. It, therefore, allows the registration system to operate if a wife so wishes. It will certainly protect her against a sale over her head, or against an illegal sale by a husband, who might be vindictive enough to try to outwit the law and his wife.  The wife should be encouraged to put her name to the lease or the deeds of the house, because it protects her, even at an earlier stage than when it might be necessary for her to come in again and have to fight by refusing to give consent to sale.  In this way her husband would be aware of what was involved in regard to the sale of the family home at any future date.  Therefore, this section might be promoted and used by a wife early in the marriage. In cases of breakdown it would be in the wife's interest to have taken steps early in the marriage before the unfortunate position of the breakdown had arrived.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's total failure to honour its own undertaking of February 1973 &ldquo;to control and stabilise prices&rdquo;; notes with deep concern <Col N="117" /> the huge increase in the price of virtually every commodity since 1973; and deplores in particular the major contribution which the Government itself has made towards bringing about in Ireland the highest rate of inflation in Europe which is leading to the gradual destruction of our economy.</P>
    <P>At the outset it would be well for me, in relation to this matter, to refer to that somewhat infamous document published on February 7th, 1973 setting out the Coalition's 14-point programme under the heading &ldquo;There is An Alternative&rdquo;.  Indeed, there was an alternative to the stability, the progress and the prosperity that this country was experiencing at that time and, tragically, that alternative was chosen. In relation to prices this document stated that the immediate economic aims of the new Government would be to stabilise prices, halt redundancies and reduce unemployment under a programme of planned economic development. It is hardly necessary to comment at any length on the question of the stabilisation of prices when one realises that many commodities today are costing twice the amount they cost in 1973.  Certainly, it is not necessary to comment on the reference to the halting of redundancies which are running at umpteen times the rate at which they were running at that time in 1973.  Neither is it necessary to comment on the question of unemployment which is now almost double what it was then.</P>
    <P>The document goes on to say that it is essential to control prices if these important economic aims are to be realised, that, therefore, the Government would introduce strict price control. Further on the document says that the Government would regard the control of price inflation as indispensible to the continuance of the national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>These statements were believed by a significant number of the electorate, a number that was significant enough to bring about a change of government although in that election Fianna Fáil increased their first preference votes by 30,000.  Of the 14 points, all of which are equally jocose now, with the hindsight of three years <Col N="118" /> of Coalition government the one at that time in 1973 which made the greatest impact was this pledge to control and stabilise prices.  I recall canvassing as a candidate in that election and on several occasions during the campaign people expressed to me their belief that prices would not increase after February, 1973 if the Coalition came to power.  It would not be within the rules of order for me to express the views of those people today because their views are expressed volubly and somewhat indecorously by those who were codded and who now admit freely that they were fooled into believing that there was some element of truth in that wretched document and in that idiotic promise in particular.</P>
    <P>We turn now to the present situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> February, 1973.  The consumer price index has risen between February, 1973 and February, 1976, the latest date for which it is available, by 63.2 per cent.  Inevitably there will be a further increase of several per cent up to mid-May this year but that figure will not be available until some time next month. Assuming that there is an increase in the region of 4 to 5 per cent in the quarter to mid-May, it is not unreasonable to say, given that the vast increases from the 1st March will be included, that the increase in the consumer price index and the overall increase in all commodities in the three years since this Government came to power is 65 per cent.  On average, every item is costing two-thirds more than it cost on the day that we had this solemn promise to control and stabilise prices.</P>
    <P>In discussion that one hears nowadays about prices I observe, as many others observe, that a certain degree of fatalism is surfacing in relation to the whole situation.  There is now an absolute belief that this Government are totally incapable of doing anything or of even attempting to do anything in relation to price control and because they are not making an efforts in this regard, some members of the public at least may get the impression that the alternative to this Government will not be able to succeed in this area to any great degree. <Col N="119" /> There is general agreement that we would succeed in regard to prices to a much greater extent than has been the case with the present Government but that we would not have the sort of success that the public would like. I shall endeavour to disabuse people of that belief and to consider the situation in regard to inflation generally and to prices in particular.</P>
    <P>Increases in prices are the chief symptoms of inflation.  The situation was expressed well by the National Prices Commission in their November, 1972 report when they said that inflation would not be curbed or stopped by deploring its symptoms&mdash;price increases&mdash;that its pace would be reduced only by attacking its causes in so far as these lie within the control of the Irish community.  In their March, 1973 report the NPC set out what they considered to be the six main reasons for price increases here and I should like to consider briefly each of those reasons.  They were: increases in import prices, increases in export prices, increases in indirect taxes, increases in money incomes, growth in Government expenditure and the accommodating nature of monetary policy.  They dealt with each in some detail <i>vis-à-vis</i> the situation in March, 1973, the month in which the Coalition came to power.  They pointed out that these six factors or a combination of them were the causes of inflation here and they considered in some detail what control we have in so far as these situations are concerned. Much of what they set out is no longer pertinent.  It is outdated in the changed circumstances of today but if I might comment briefly on each factor and on its relevance to the present situation, we might get to the root of the causes of inflation, at least to some extent and, consequently, to the root of the appalling price increases situation that we have experienced during the past three years, an across-the-board increase of 65 per cent.</P>
    <P>The first is increases in import prices.  The commission say that import prices have risen for three main reason&mdash;inflation in the countries from which goods are <Col N="120" /> imported, the devaluation of the Irish £ in terms of currencies other than sterling and increases in world prices of basic commodities.  In the view of the commission they were three valid reasons at that time.  I have no doubt they were valid at that time.  Two of them clearly are not valid today.  They are the rate of inflation in countries from which goods are imported by us because, almost without exception, the rate of inflation in all countries from which we import goods is considerably lower than ours.  Therefore, that factor has no influence whatever today.  Similarly, increases in world prices of basic commodities have no relevance whatever today, although they had in 1972 and 1973 because, if one examines the graph for the London commodities market in 1975, there is an enormous decrease. Recently there has been something of an increase in the price of some basic commodities but it would not yet have had any effect here. What would have effect is the enormous decrease in world commodity prices during 1975.</P>
    <P>That leaves us with the only point which is still valid in 1976 under the heading &ldquo;increases in import prices&rdquo;, that is, the devaluation of the Irish £ in terms of currencies other than sterling.  That was something of a problem in March, 1973.  I need hardly say it is very much more a problem today because the rate of devaluation of sterling as of yesterday and consequentially of the Irish £, as against the basket of other world non-sterling currencies was the astronomical figure of 38.8 per cent.  Obviously, this must have a serious effect on our costs because it is driving up the cost of our imports to a significant degree.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that this is not a matter that the Government can wash their hands of, saying: &ldquo;That is all happening in London and we have no control over it because our £ is going down with the £ sterling&rdquo;.  I believe that with our inflation rate projected to run in 1976 at approximately double that in Britain it is out of the question for us even to contemplate breaking the link with sterling.  But I would suggest we can begin to take steps, <Col N="121" /> and should have done so over the past year or two when it became evident that sterling was getting into the most serious difficulties to reduce our inflation rate by control of the domestic factors contributing to it and which I will suggest later now cause 80 per cent of domestic inflation.  By bringing our inflation rate below that of Britain &mdash;and this should have been done over the past two years&mdash;we could now he in the situation that we could, with safety, and with great profit to ourselves, break this much talked about link with sterling.  At present if we were to break it&mdash;because of the fact that we are projected to have a 20 per cent inflation rate in 1976 as against 1 to 10 per cent or 11 per cent in Britain&mdash;we would be in the position, at the end of 1976, that instead of being stronger than the £ sterling the Irish £ would be considerably weaker.  Therefore, it is not correct to say that the factor called &ldquo;increases in import prices&rdquo; is one totally outside the control of our Government, although it is one over which, obviously, they have less control than in relation to a number of the other items to which I shall come later.</P>
    <P>The second one is the question of increases in export prices.  That does not have a great influence on domestic costs and prices.  The one example one could give of where it did have a bearing was when, in late 1972 and early 1973, the export price of meat at the time of our accession to the EEC rose very substantially. That forced up the domestic price of meat.  Paradoxically enough it is not a factor of any great significance now particularly because of the devaluation of the £ sterling which enables Irish exporters to get proportionately more without having to increase their export prices in real terms.  Therefore, the influence of export prices on domestic prices is not nil but is fairly negligible.</P>
    <P>The third factor is &ldquo;increase in indirect taxes&rdquo;.  This is the first of these various heading where unquestionably our Government have an enormous influence on what will be our inflation rate and, accordingly on prices. The last part of my motion reads:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> ...and deplores in particular the major contribution which the Government itself has made towards bringing about in Ireland the highest rate of inflation in Europe...</P>
    <P>I suggest&mdash;and the figures are there clearly to prove it&mdash;that we have a situation in which, by the imposition of higher indirect taxes, such as higher rates of VAT, the Government have deliberately driven up the consumer price index.  By deliberately driving up the consumer price index they have caused higher and higher demands to be made for wage increases which, in turn, have driven up costs and, consequentially, prices.</P>
    <P>We had a situation in January, 1975, when a new national wage agreement for a 12 months period was just beginning to be negotiated.  At that time Deputy Colley, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, strongly urged the introduction of food subsidies in order that price increases and the consumer price index would be kept to a minimum, so that in turn the national wage agreement might be arrived at, at the most reasonable figure possible, enabling this spiralling, vicious circle of inflation, at long last, to be broken.  There was an opportunity then.  But, instead of introducing those subsides and keeping down inflation at that time, the Government increased indirect taxes, and taxes generally, to cause a 4 per cent rise in the consumer price index in January, 1975.</P>
    <P>The national wage agreement was concluded in April, 1975, and ran until the 31st March, 1976.  Needless to say, the national wage agreement was unnecessarily inflationary because the demands of the unions and the workers were made much higher than they need have been had the cost of living not been driven up by 4 per cent by the Government themselves in the budget of January, 1975. Then, when the damage was done, when the national wage agreement at an unnecessarily high level was entered into, in June, 1975, the Minister for Finance came along with another budget in which he introduced food subsidies which this party had been advocating since October, November and December of the <Col N="123" /> previous year and immediately by so doing reduced the consumer price index by 4 per cent.  It was of no value to the economy as a whole to do so at that time because the damage was done in a national wage agreement being entered into and ratified which was no higher than was essential from the point of view of the workers at that time but which need not have been anything like as high if those subsidies had been brought in in the January budget rather than in the June one after the agreement was over.</P>
    <P>All of that was pointed out to the Government at the time by various speakers from these benches.  But, lo and behold we have the very same thing happening again this year except that it is even worse because, in the budget introduced by the Minister for Finance, in this House on the 28th January, 1976, the huge increases in VAT, duty and excise on a large number of commodities caused the cost of living index to rise by 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>We are stll endeavouring to get a national wage agreement.  It seems very problematical whether or not one will ever materialise now; it has dragged on and on for months.  But a tentative agreement had been arrived at until the Government claimed the right, some weeks ago, not to be bound by it and get out of paying the increases that would arise under it.  Apart from that fact, the increases which were agreed to in that agreement, subject to the various subsidiary matters which have not been agreed subsequently, were very large.  There is no question about that.  The percentages in regard to some people were as high as 20, and more, when there was, at the same time, a wage agreement entered into in Britain where the increase was kept down to 4 per cent.  The reason it was possible to get a 4 per cent agreement in Britain and totally impossible to get it here was because of the sensible approach to the whole problem by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in his budget in March, when there was an incentive given to the workers to moderate their demands and when it was made quite clear to them that it was in their interest and in the <Col N="124" /> country's interest that they should do so.  It was also made clear to them that it was worth their while to do it.  They have agreed.  The other major difference between what has been done in Britain over the last few months and what has not been done here is that the British Government played a major role all the time in the negotiation of that national wage agreement.  Here we have a situation in which in one budget the Government deliberately increased the cost of living by 5 per cent.  How in the name of goodness can that Government come along a few weeks later and say to workers: &ldquo;You will have to moderate your wage demands; we cannot have any wage increases in the country this year?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Last February that is what the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach were saying.  By March and April they had totally changed that point of view and were seeking to defend a national wage agreement which gave increases as high as 20 per cent.  The whole thing would be laughable if it were not dragging the country down and down, dragging the economy down and down, and pushing our inflation rate upwards at the very time every other country in Europe, including Britain, is showing a marked decrease in the inflation rates they had and which for the most part, apart from Britain, were considerably lower than ours.  We have the awful mistake of 1975 repeated to a more damaging extent in 1976.  It is sheer hypocrisy on the part of the Government to ask trade unionists even to contemplate a pay pause when the Government are doing a great deal more than anybody else to drive inflation, costs and prices up.</P>
    <P>The fourth heading under the list of six given by the prices commission was increases in money incomes.  I believe I have dealt with that situation because it arises directly from the imposition of higher indirect taxes, higher costs on the part of the Government which are driving money incomes up and creating further inflation to add to the inflation the Government's own efforts is creating.</P>
    <P>The fifth heading is growth in Government expenditure.  It is perfectly evident, not alone from the quantity <Col N="125" /> of growth we have had in Government expenditure in the last few years, but, even more important, from the nature of the growth in that expenditure and what it is being spent on, that this must have a most serious inflationary effect.</P>
    <P>This in no sense is an imported factor. This, like the last two headings I have been talking about, is entirely within the control of the Government. If they not alone fail to control inflation under these headings but actually cause it to increase still further then nobody but the Government can be blamed.  When that inflation exhibits itself in the symptom of price increases nobody but the Government and the foolish economic policies they have been pursuing over the last three years can be blamed for these price increases.</P>
    <P>We have had growth in Government expenditure on a huge scale which has two particular characteristics in the last three years that growth in Government expenditure before never had.  One of those is that growth in Government expenditure over the last three years was almost entirely financed out of borrowing, a high proportion of which was foreign borrowing, which is the most inflationary type of borrowing where we are repaying not just what we borrow but a huge additional premium in non-sterling currencies to those from whom we borrow.  The second characteristic of increased Government expenditure over the last three years was that a great deal of this increased expenditure, which was borrowed, was not being expended in the fashion in which prudent Government previously expended it, that is in capital projects which generate their own repayment.</P>
    <P>We now have the situation, as was very clearly pointed out by the Minister for Finance in his speech on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill which was recently before the House, in which an enormous proportion of that borrowing is paying current expenditure, such as wages to civil servants, the Army, the Garda and so on and paying social welfare benefits. There is no question of a capital investment of that money at all that <Col N="126" /> would generate its own repayment.  We have, therefore, directly and deliberately, an enormous growth in Government expenditure making a huge contribution to the rate of inflation we have here and thereby a huge contribution to the price increases we have seen during the past three years.</P>
    <P>The sixth and final heading, which the commission refer to, is what they call the accommodating nature of monetary costs.  That is less important now than what it was then.  I believe what the commission had in mind was the making available by the banks of fairly large sums, of fairly heavy lending both to the public and private sectors. While there is still very heavy lending by the banks to the public sector, unfortunately, for all of us, lending by the banks to the private sector nowadays, particularly for industrial or other productive purposes, is very limited.  The banks acknowledge the fact and are worried by the fact that they are seriously underlending.</P>
    <P>The House will have seen that of the six factors the three most important are Nos. 3, 4 and 5, all of which are directly under the control of the Government, increases in indirect taxes, increases in money incomes and growth in Government expenditure.  The Government, in each of those three instances, as a matter of deliberate, fiscal and economic policy, have gone out of their way to let inflation rip and to cause it to rip further than it would if they had a neutral policy in regard to this and very much more than if they had made a reasonable or prudent effort to try to control inflation.</P>
    <P>It has been calculated by economists of note in the country that the imported element in our inflation in 1976 is 20 per cent.  In other words, 80 per cent of our inflation and our price increases today arises from domestic factors which, as I have demonstrated, are all factors which come directly under the control of the Government, in which the Government can say yes or no, which they can increase or decrease as they see fit.  They have seen fit to allow the situation to come about nowadays in which the imported element in our inflation rate is only 20 per cent and the domestic element in it is 80 per cent.  This is not just my <Col N="127" /> opinion.  The Taoiseach has made statements on more than one occasion in the past six months or so to the effect that domestic causes are by far the predominant causes of our inflation today and, consequently, of our price rises and so on.  Those domestic factors are factors entirely within the control of the Government.</P>
    <P>It is worth nothing the increase in the VAT rates from 1972, when VAT was introduced at 5.26 per cent, to the present situation since the 1st March this year when it is 10 per cent at the low rate, an increase of almost 100 per cent.  How it could possibly be argued that an increase of that magnitude&mdash;even though I agree foodstuffs are no longer subject to VAT&mdash; in a comparatively short time can be anything but deliberately inflationary is beyond me.  It is worth nothing that our lowest rate of VAT is 10 per cent.  The standard rate in Britain is 8 per cent and the only other rate in Britain is now 12½ per cent while we have 20, 30 and 40 per cent rates as well.  We appear to have the highest rates of VAT in the EEC and some of the highest rates, if not the highest rates, of indirect taxation in the world.</P>
    <P>People sometimes criticise the National Prices Commission as if they were not doing enough to keep prices down.  The commission acknowledge this.  Their powers are extremely limited.  Basically, there is very little they can do.  They can monitor applications made to them, but the number of applications which have been made is quite small.  People do not realise this.</P>
    <P>The Prices and Charges (Notification of Increases) Order was made within the past few weeks by the Minister which exempts from price control a large additional number of manufacturers and other people who had previously been controlled.  The attitude of the commission was set out in their early days.  They said in their November, 1971 report that where enough firms were competing with each other or were facing competition from imports, market forces could be relied upon to keep prices from increasing <Col N="128" /> out of line with increases in costs and would ensure efficiency in goods and services.  They said that they envisaged that their main interest would be in cases where there was one firm, whether in the private or public sector, or a few dominant firms in an industry where competition from imports was absent or limited or where competition for any reason seemed to be restricted.  When those guidelines were laid down in 1971, inflation here was 8 per cent. The Government were keeping it down to that figure and were pursuing economic policies which would ensure that there would be no increase above that figure.  They succeeded at that because the rate in 1972 was 8 per cent, having been 9 per cent in 1971.</P>
    <P>While that kind of approach may have been adequate for the National Prices Commission in the prosperous days of 1971, I would suggest that they are not adequate in these days of appalling inflation and terrible economic degradation in Ireland in 1976. We have approximately 120,000 people officially registered as unemployed, plus tens of thousands of others who are not registered.  We have an appalling situation where major State companies have informed their employees that they will not be able to pay their wages this autumn.  The Government are going as an employer to the talks which are taking place in relation to the national wage agreement saying that they will be seeking to avail of the clause which allows smaller and weaker private firms to get out of what would otherwise be their obligations under the national wage agreements in the past.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of economic situation we have today.  The fairly easygoing guidelines that the National Prices Commission laid down for themselves in 1971 should be more strictly enforced rather than less strictly enforced, which appears to be the tendency now in the light of the order recently made by the Minister and his proposal to ameliorate further the whole price control situation from the point of view of firms who hitherto had to apply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> However, because the National Prices Commission are only concerned with the symptoms of inflation and because they can do nothing about the actual causes of inflation, I think it is unfair to criticise whatever shortcomings they may have.  One hears criticisms from time to time; they do not have enough staff; they do not go into applications deeply enough; people are applying for unnecessarily high increases in the expectations that some of what they are applying for will be granted and they frequently end up in the somewhat embarrassing situation of getting an increase way above what they want.  There may or may not be some basis in these criticisms, but the commission's role in this whole area is very limited, one in which they can only do a small amount of what they would wish to do.</P>
    <P>The real control of inflation&mdash;and I want to emphasise this&mdash;lies in the hands of the Government of Ireland, in the same way as it lies in the hands of the German, French, Belgian or English Governments.  These Governments suffered difficulties at the end of 1973, as we did, but in each and every case, they have overcome them very successfully.  Inflation rates in many of these European countries now are as low as 4 and 5 per cent.  Our projected rate for this year is 20 per cent. That projected for Britain is in the region of 10, 11 or possibly 12 per cent.  We have suffered, in the last quarter for which we have figures, an increase of 7.3 per cent which, on an annual basis if it were to be repeated in three further quarters, which I sincerely hope it will not, would give us an annual inflation rate in excess of 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>I raised a number of questions about the prices of specific commodities in this House in recent weeks.  I asked for a comparison between the Northern Ireland and Republic prices of exactly similar priced products.  One was concrete blocks.  I quoted the figures which had been given to me, were checked and were accurate, that a certain quantity of concrete blocks could be bought in Northern Ireland for £10 and a similar quantity of exactly similar blocks can be bought in <Col N="130" /> the Republic for £22.  We have a situation nowadays where many detergents which were at one time manufactured here are now manufactured in Britain and imported here.  The retail price in Northern Ireland of these detergents &mdash;and they are at least as far from the factory as we are&mdash;is significantly lower than it is in the Republic, although they are all made in the same factory in Britain.  Similarly, there is the situation in regard to the price of drugs.  Like the other matters I raised, the Parliamentary Secretary announced that he proposed to refer it to the National Prices Commission.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that.  The price of drugs here, for example, is way above the price in other countries although they are manufactured in the same place.  We are allowed to labour under the disadvantage of having to pay vastly higher costs for them because the Government have little interest in seeking to decrease the prices.</P>
      <P>I started off to talk about the promise made in the infamous 14-point programme in February, 1973.  In the history of Irish politics no promise has ever been so dishonoured.  The fact is that prices and price control are now so unimportant in the eyes of this Government that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has divested himself of all responsibility or interest in the matter.  He has handed over the whole question of prices and price control to the most junior Parliamentary Secretary associated with the Government.  I do not want to be critical of him personally but that is the situation.  There is no member of the Government who wishes to concern himself any more with this vitally important question which is sapping the life blood of our economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;approves the measures being <Col N="131" /> taken by the Government to control the prices and charges for goods and services, and to subsidise the price of certain essential items.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy dealt at some length with the 14-point programme.  I should like to point out that the National Coalition in publishing that programme said that the stabilisation of prices was one of their immediate economic aims.  I am sure it is true that the stabilisation of prices at any time is one of the economic aims of any Government but to say that any Government can promise to stabilise prices is manifestly nonsensical other than in an economy controlled entirely by the Government.  In no other economy could a Government make such a promise in the proper meaning of the term &ldquo;promise&rdquo;. The Government can state their aims in a free economy but they cannot impose their wishes in the economic field so long as we have the mixed economy that we have and which we will continue to have.</P>
    <P>In the 14-point programme the Government indicated the means they proposed to adopt towards the aim of stabilising prices.  These included stricter price control which was implemented, and the removal of VAT from food which was implemented to the opposition of Fianna Fáil.  The Government's aim to stabilise prices would have been successful because in the first two quarters after the Government took office there was a significant decline in the rate of inflation by comparison with the last quarter of Fianna Fáil rule when there was a rate of increase of 4 per cent.  That rate of increase in prices was the highest quarterly increase then recorded.  In the first two quarters of the Coalition Government the rate was substantially reduced.  However, in November, 1973, the oil crisis broke on the world and this was accompanied by very substantial increases in other commodities as well as oil.  This led to a situation in which no Government in a mixed economy could have stabilised prices.  For the Deputy unctuously to talk about promises being dishonoured in this context is <Col N="132" /> something which I do not think even he believes.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Government faced particular problems in this matter, not only with regard to increases in oil prices but with regard to increases in the domestic rates of wages.  Of course these are reflected in the goods produced by the workers concerned and ultimately in the prices. It is interesting to show the way Irish wage rates have moved in recent times.  I am quoting from the report of the National Economic and Social Council.  This showed that between 1973 and mid-1975 our hourly earnings went up by 64 per cent as against 54 per cent in the United Kingdom, 46 per cent in France and 24 per cent in the United States. If our hourly rates of earnings are to go up by a rate substantially greater than in other comparable countries, obviously the prices of what we produce and consume will increase.</P>
    <P>There has also been the accompanying problem of the decline in the value of sterling.  Between January, 1973, and 20th May, 1976, sterling declined by 23 per cent as against the dollar, by 34.9 per cent as against the Dutch guilder, by 38 per cent against the German mark and by 48.7 per cent as against the Swiss franc.  It is important to recognise the effect the devaluation of sterling has on domestic prices within the country.  I think I can illustrate this fairly well by talking about a German car which is on sale on the Irish market and the price of which contributes to our consumer price index and is included in it.  If such a car was on sale in Germany at a cost of DM 7,587, at the exchange rates then prevailing it would have been available for sale in Ireland at £1,000. Assuming that in the intervening period German prices increased by 20 per cent domestically, that car would now be on sale on the German market at DM 9,104.  If the exchange rates which we had in 1973 in the sterling area with the German mark remained at the same level, we should have been able to buy that car for approximately £1,200.  However, solely because the value of sterling has declined, through no direct fault of this Government, that <Col N="133" /> car would now cost us £2,000.  The same is the story for any commodity we are importing from outside the sterling area, with the possible exception of something we are importing from the lira area which currency has depreciated by comparison with sterling. This is a factor that is contributing to our inflation and which is not within the control of the present or any Government. I have shown that the rate of wages has increased substantially and this is another factor that must be considered. There are also particular problems created for us by the rate of increase in oil prices.</P>
    <P>The basic policy of the Government has been to shift the burden of inflation away from essential commodities to the relatively non-essential commodities. The objective of the Government could be summed up as trying in very difficult circumstances to keep to a minimum the prices that have to be paid by a typical old age pensioner.  I think we have been reasonably successful in that matter.  The first measure we took was to remove VAT from food.  An old age pensioner can do without alcohol and probably does not have a car but he must have food.  If the price of other commodities is increased in order to reduce the price of food on balance one is helping the old age pensioner. That is what we did when we removed VAT from food.  In that move we were opposed by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>In the June budget of last year we introduced very substantial subsidies on certain basic essential food items which loom large in the budget of an old age pensioner.  The result is that the maximum price of a pint of milk is now 7p as against 8p on 1st April, 1975.  The maximum price of 1 lb. of butter is now 48p as against 47p.  I accept that is an increase but it would have been far greater had the subsidies not been introduced.  The maximum price of a kilo of plain white flour is 18½p as against 22½p on 1st April, 1975.  The 800 gramme wrapped loaf is now 18p as against 21p on 1st April, 1975, while the unwrapped loaf is 16p as against 20p in April, 1975.</P>

If it had not been the policy of the Government to remove VAT from essential food items and introduce subsidies the position would have been a great deal different.  I should like to give the House some information about what prices would now be in the absence of those Government measures. If we had VAT on food and no subsidies the price of ½ lb. of tea would be 31p as against 28p which it is at present.  The price of a 2 1b. packet of sugar would be 26p as against the present price of 23½p.</P>

      <P>The Government are preparing further legislation to extend the prices legislation.  Amongst the measures which will be included in this legislation are the imposition of on the spot fines and the taking of powers to reduce both margins and prices in relation to particular commodities where this is deemed necessary.  It is also proposed to take powers to control the margins of large retailers.  I am also glad to announce that as part of the programme for the protection of consumers a new retail prices beverage in licensed premises order will be made in the next few days effecting certain changes in the existing order.  In addition to the list showing the prices of all drinks sold in licensed premises, which is required by the existing order, the new order will require the display in all premises in which drink is sold for consumption on the premises of a list showing the price of the nine most popular drinks. So that this list may be easily read by the customers the letters must be at least 2.5 centimeters&mdash;one inch&mdash;high. The new order will also provide that where wine is sold for consumption <Col N="137" /> on the premises by the glass or carafe the price list shall indicate the quantity of wine in the glass or carafe.</P>
      <P>An additional provision in the new order will apply to deposits charged on returnable bottles.  Two prices will now require to be shown, one including and the other excluding the deposit. The existing order requires detailed lists of all drinks sold in the bar or lounge to be displayed.  This list will remain as a useful reference but because of the length and detail of this list&mdash;in fact it was not very useful to the consumer and was rarely referred to&mdash;the new supplementary list will contain in large type the price of a small number of the major drinks such as the pint of stout, the small whiskey and a glass of orange.  As is already the case in many continental countries the new list will enable the public to see at a glance on entering the premises its major prices.  It is hoped that by having this more effective display of prices in licensed premises it will be possible to promote more accurate competition in the licensed trade.</P>
      <P>The National Prices Commission also has major studies in hand at present in regard to certain enterprises that have been responsible for increases in prices.  There is under way for instance, a major study of Radio Telefís Éireann, of the Post Office, of barristers' and solicitors' fees.  A major study is being undertaken at my request in regard to spare parts for tractors.  A matter which is being studied by the prices commission also is the cost&mdash;again at my request&mdash;of repair jobs by garages for insurance companies, comparing the charges made in these cases with charges made in normal repair cases to see if there is a substantial discrepancy which ultimately leads to higher insurance premiums.  I have also asked the prices commission to carry out a study of drug prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A feature which frequently leads to increased prices is the cost of paper-work imposed on businesses by various Government Departments requiring them to keep one set of statistics for the Revenue, another for the Central Statistics Office and other statistics for different State agencies.  In many cases, these enterprises have had to employ <Col N="138" /> extra staff merely to comply with the statistics-keeping requirements of the Government.  These extra costs are ultimately reflected in the prices charged by firms for their goods and services.  I have asked the National Prices Commission to see if the paper-work requirements of Government Departments imposed on industry and business can be rationalised so as to reduce the burden involved.  I anticipate having this study available in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The performance of the Government in regard to inflation should be judged against the problems they faced which, as I said earlier, were considerable and as against the expectation expressed by independent people as to what could be achieved.  The National Economic and Social Council in their report to the Government in June, 1975, said that given the terms of the 1975 national agreement, existing policies and likely development of the world economy, the prospects for 1975 were for a rise in the consumer price index of 25 per cent or more.  As a result of the June budget and the policies subsequently adopted by the Government the rate of inflation is not the anticipated 25 per cent but in the latest period for which figures are available, the year ending February, 1976, the rate of inflation is down to 16.1 per cent which is significantly less than the 25 per cent anticipated.</P>
    <P>There is also a sign of improvement in the situation in the volume of retail sales which is, if you like, the consumers response to the prices being charged&mdash;the amount they buy in a given situation is the most eloquent testimony as to what they think of the prices they are charged.  In the last quarter of 1975 retail sales, in volume terms, were 8.5 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 1975.  There is evidence that this trend is continuing in 1976.  The figures available to me indicate that in February of this year retail sales in volume terms were 14 per cent higher than they were in February of last year. That indicates an improvement in consumer costs and an ability on the part of the consumer to buy goods, many of them Irish goods, and so create more employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> I listened carefully without interrupting&mdash;except on one occasion to clarify a point&mdash;to what Deputy O'Malley said and his speech was an interesting exercise in wisdom by hindsight but&mdash;this is something to which everybody should pay attention &mdash;there was no inkling of what Fianna Fáil's policy on prices would be.  All we heard was an expression of admiration on his part for the British Chancellor of the Exchequer but there was no indication of what the Deputy's party would do if they had responsibility in this field.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor:</NameTxt>
      <P>When I came into the House for this debate I was extremely interested to see what would emerge from the Government side arising out of the amendment which had been submitted by the Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy O'Malley's motion. I wondered what the Parliamentary Secretary, on behalf of the Government, might pull out of the hat in order to justify the amendment he has on the Order Paper and which he moved that Dáil Éireann</P>
      <P>approves the measures being taken by the Government to control the prices and charges for goods and services, and to subsidise the price of certain essential items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After three years of Coalition Government I am completely unaware of any action by the Government that would justify the claim that measures were taken by them to control prices.  The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of subsidisation and painted pictures which I think were to a great extent imaginary of what today's prices for certain goods would have been if the Government had not removed VAT from food.  The people in late February and early March, 1973, were promised that the new Government, made up of Fine Gael and Labour in coalition, would stabilise prices if elected.  I have taken the opportunity of looking at one section of the papers from the time the election was declared and, looking at <Col N="140" /> the headlines and the observation of the politicians, I could go on at some length quoting from the statements made by Government Ministers and their backbenchers as to the interpretation of the solid promise made by them on platform and over television and radio, a promise that certainly gave people the impression that prices would be stabilised at the point at which they stood at that time.  Unfortunately, the Parliamentary Secretary rebelled against interruptions from this side when he was quoting present-day prices, prices which are certainly in conflict with the prices published by his own Department on behalf of the National Prices Commission. It is difficult for us to accept that the Parliamentary Secretary could be so badly briefed and, from my knowledge and experience of the officials of his Department, I cannot understand how he could have quoted the price he did for back rashers. Right across the country the price of back rashers is 108p per pound.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned a figure of 37p per half lb.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>I did not say back rashers.  I was referring to streaky rashers.  I did not specify them.  The Deputy was quoting a high quality rasher and I was quoting a low quality rasher and the price I gave was 37p per half lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from the only source from which I can quote. It would be wrong for me to go to the daily papers to get figures when I have the figures from the Parliamentary Secretary himself, figures scrutinised by the National Prices Commission.  I have the official figures in black and white in the March report.  This exercise in projecting what prices would be were it not for the wonderful budget last year and the great concessions given by the Government <Col N="141" /> is desperately unfair in relation to this motion.  We are not dealing with the slide downhill of the economic situation over the last 12 months.  The motion deals with the failure of the Government to honour the promise made in February, 1973. Agreed things are getting worse and worse.  There is a snowball effect and we are going downhill now at a far faster rate.  In the first 12 months of this Coalition Government there was a general feeling of satisfaction among the people.  The Government were enjoying spending the money and the credit which had been so carefully built up by successive Fianna Fáil Governments over the previous 16 years and had the Taoiseach at the end of that 12 month period jumped on the bandwagon and made some excuse for going to the country, following the passage of the gerrymander Bill by the Minister for Local Government, the Coalition would have swept back into office because they were on a popularity wave.</P>
      <P>The situation is different now and the Parliamentary Secretary comes in here tonight and refuses to accept that the Government are responsible for their outright failure to honour their commitment in regard to prices and he falls back on the hackneyed excuse that it is the oil crisis which has brought about the present situation. He quoted figures.  He referred to the fact that the Fianna Fáil Government, replaced on 14th March, 1973, had the degrading experience of an inflation rate over the previous three months of something in the region of 4 per cent.  I regard the present Minister for Industry and Commerce as having a fair share of audacity.  But I am surprised&mdash;I always gave him credit for having a certain amount of courage&mdash;that he should have the audacity to send in here tonight his unfortunate Parliamentary Secretary to cover up for him.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Minister will be speaking tomorrow night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he will have something more concrete to say than the Parliamentary Secretary had.  The <Col N="142" /> Minister, realising apparently that he is flogging a dead horse, sends in his Parliamentary Secretary, his Parliamentary Secretary who has enough trouble in the Department of Education coping with transport.  I regard that as definitely unfair.  Why should the Parliamentary Secretary have to justify the Minister's complete failure in the region of price control?  It was unfortunate that the Parliamentary Secretary should refer to the 4 per cent increase in the cost of living in the last quarter of 1972 remembering that we have had a 7.3 per cent increase in the cost of living in the first quarter of this year.  I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will not suggest that that 7.3 per cent increase is due to the oil crisis.  Everybody knows it is due to the successive inflationary budgets of the Minister for Finance with the full backing of his Cabinet colleagues.  It is recognised that the Minister for Finance is the greatest failure from a ministerial point of view this country has ever had, but it is unfair that he should be singled out while other members of the Government are equally responsible for supporting these budgets.  It is unfair they should escape, just as it is unfair for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to send in his Parliamentary Secretary here tonight to talk about inflation, an inflation generated by Government policy and not by something outside the country.  He referred to the price of cars manufactured in Germany and the inflation rate in Germany between 1973 and 1976.  In 1973 a German car would cost 7,587 Marks and only 9,104 Marks now.  That would represent an increase to someone buying in this country, ignoring duty, tax and so forth, of 100 per cent.  The Parliamentary said the position would be the same everywhere else, except in the lira area.  He said the lira was in an even worse state than the £.  The impression I got was that we should be buying Fiat cars cheaper than they were in 1973, but I do not think that is the position.  I hope the Minister will tell us tomorrow who is making all the profit on Fiat cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were actually talking about food. The Parliamentary Secretary talked about benefiting the less well-off sections <Col N="143" /> of the community.  I found myself wondering how that argument could stand up.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary is like myself where drink is concerned.  Perhaps he believes old age pensioners do not need little luxuries.  Not many share that view.  I might have that view, but I know there are a great number of old people and a small one is an essential to them.  Again, the old age pensioner needs his pipe of tobacco.  Even in the case of food I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary's argument stands up.  The Parliamentary Secretary drew comparisons and said butter was now only 1p dearer than it was 12 months ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor:</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be in or about 12 months.  He was dressing up the tale of the wonderful job done by the Minister for Finance and in his own way he was justifying the line taken pretty well by our Minister for Finance before the last election.  Deputy Colley pointed out that the promise to take VAT off food had its dangers and pitfalls and he said we were not in favour of that move.  The Parliamentary Secretary said we opposed it.  If he checks the records he will find that we were conscious of the fact there were a great many other things the old and the less well-off need and these people are now discovering that the failure of the Government to control prices far outweighs the removal of VAT.</P>
      <P>I have here the prices that obtained in March, 1973.  Let us compare them with the prices obtaining in March, 1976.  These are the official figures published by the National Prices Commission.  There is a new chairman now, a very eminent gentleman.  I have here the monthly report of the National Prices Commission, No. 16 of March, 1973.  Butter was 27p per lb That was in one store.  It was less in another store.  At the latest date for which we have figures, which is February, 1976, the price of butter is 42.5p per pound.  Cheese is another item which has gone up from 26½p to 65.5p during the same period, more than 100 per cent of an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> Cookeen, an item that is used by the old in order to make the bread more palatable went up from 6½p to 12½p, almost twice the price.  Margarine is another item which the Parliamentary Secretary chose to mention: Stork margarine increased from 7.25p to 12.5p.  Bread is a very important commodity and a 21b wrapped loaf is 18p now in comparison with 12½p at that time.  Cream crackers is an item that I do not think many old people look upon as a luxury.  In 1973 they were 7p for a half pound packet, and they are 17p now.</P>
    <P>I have not sufficient time to go down the list, but the official figures showing what Deputy O'Malley quoted as a 63.2 per cent increase between February, 1973 and February, 1976, let the Government off the hook. While I accept the official figures, many housewives are more inclined to believe that the cost of living today is at least 100 per cent more than it was three-and-a-half years ago, and it is steadily getting higher.</P>
    <P>I would hope that when the Minister comes in to speak in this debate tomorrow he would be more explicit about the measures being taken by the Government to control prices.  The Parliamentary Secretary promised further legislation, on-the-spot fines, further control of margins and a new beverage order.  There has to be a balance in this between the unfortunate consumer, on the one hand, and the unfortunate retailer and tax gatherer, on the other.  I saw&mdash;I have not had time to read it&mdash;yesterday or today some exercise about the time spent by retailers, and businessmen in general in their newly-found function as tax gatherers.  Here we are making things more difficult all the time.  We have no price control policy.  We have surveillance rather than price control. The Parliamentary Secretary thinks the more surveillance we have the better, as he said, 60 inspectors instead of 12.  What difference does that make? That has no effect on keeping down prices.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish):</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay in granting pensions to the persons named was due to the fact that evidence of the stamping of the deed of transfer of a holding was not received in my Department until 14th May, 1976. Pending the decision of the Old Age Pension Committee in the case pensions have now been awarded on a provisional basis at the rate of £4.30 weekly for each person, increased to £4.75 from 2nd April, 1976, and pension order books accordingly have been issued.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that a person (name supplied) in County Galway has been credited with two different insurance numbers in correspondence from his Department (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on this man's entitlement to benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy in his representations of 26th March, 1976, to my Department gave the age of the person named as 65 years in September, 1975.  As no insurance number was quoted a search was made in my Department's records and a person of the same name and locality whose date of birth was 8th September, 1910, was traced.  A reply accordingly issued to the Deputy on 14th April, 1976, on the basis of the insurance record disclosed by that number.  Subsequently, it was discovered that the particulars of the insurance record furnished to the Deputy did not apply to the person named by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The correct insurance number of the person named is 519951 and in the course of a detailed examination of the record of contributions under that number, it has come to light that a total of only 50 contributions were paid on the person's behalf under the former National Health Insurance Acts since 8th July, 1935, and 32 contributions <Col N="44" /> were paid on his behalf under the Social Welfare Acts since 18th December, 1961.  Allowing 3 for 2 in respect of the contributions paid prior to 1953 the total number of contributions paid for pensions purposes is 107.  The information supplied to the Deputy in my Department's letter of 17th February last incorrectly included certain credited employment contributions as paid contributions in the period prior to 1953.</P>
    <P>One of the statutory contribution conditions for the receipt of retirement pension&mdash;payable at age 65 years&mdash; and old age (contributory) pension&mdash; payable at age 67 years&mdash;requires the applicant to have at least 156 reckonable employment contributions paid on his behalf.  The person named, therefore, could not satisfy this contribution condition.</P>
    <P>As the person concerned had less than 156 contributions paid for disability benefit purposes, he was limited to 52 weeks benefit which he exhausted on 10th October, 1975.  In order to qualify for further payment of disability benefit, he would require to obtain an additional 13 contributions in respect of insurable employment.</P>
    <P>He is not entitled to become a voluntary contributor having less than 156 contributions paid on his behalf under the Social Welfare Acts, and as employment contributions are payable only in respect of employment which is insurable under those Acts he can not stamp his own card on a voluntary basis for the required number of weeks.</P>
