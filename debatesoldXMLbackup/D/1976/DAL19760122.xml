    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of questions arise on these two amendments.  During the discussion last night we did not get any really clear answers from the Minister.  As I recall it, the Minister has not given us the basis on which he has made his assertions in regard to the guarantees of immunity, nor has he given us any satisfactory explanation as to how he can expand what is written into the Bill to cover the many and varied dangers inherent in the situation wherein an accused person goes from the jurisdiction of this State into the Six Counties to be present while evidence is taken against him on commission.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not made it clear where he has got the assurances or the guarantees.  Will he tell the House whether these assurances, no matter from where they come, will have any weight if this Bill becomes law?  Is there any assurance that an accused person will not be subjected to abuse, physical or mental, while in the custoday of his accusers in the Six Counties? Can he tell us whether in the Bill and in the British legislation assurances are written in that no proceedings of any other nature will be taken against any such person?  This will not in any way cover the real bone of contention during last night's debate, the abuse or torture of a prisoner and, perhaps, the allowing of a prisoner to escape.  In such an escape a prisoner might never get down here to tell the tale as to what happened to him.  It is possible that his escape would be prevented by his being done to death.  This would be excusable in the eyes of the law in that he had attempted to escape and was shot doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must clear up this situation, and since there is not within the proposals in this Bill anything to cover this aspect&mdash;the most serious one&mdash;he must find some way to amend his own Bill.  If he cannot do that I am sure he will agree that to proceed with the Bill in its present form, lacking <Col N="180" /> any assurance or certainty that an accused person will not be exposed to such risk, the provision whereby a person may appear to be given his just, natural and legal rights of being present while evidence against him is being taken is so hollow that in practice it is not giving to such an accused person the legal and natural rights he should enjoy.  In theory it will be in the Bill but in practice it will not work.</P>
    <P>What person, in his half-senses, would, if sought by the police in the Six Counties, having been apprehended on this side of the Border at the request of the authorities in the Six Counties for the purposes of his own trial go back into the custody of the police in the Six Counties to have the opportunity of listening to evidence of witnesses against him? Knowing the situation there as those who have to live with it know it I do not think anybody in his half-senses in those circumstances could be induced by promises or assurances of any kind to give himself up into the custody of his accuser, the police in the Six Counties, or any other force there.  Not only the police are involved, and the probability is that they are the least dangerous in this regard and would be so regarded by accused persons finding themselves charged on this side of the Border under the terms of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not providing in a practical manner the very rudiments of what could be regarded as natural justice or fair play in that the accused will not in effect have the opportunity of attending his own trial.  Crudely, that is what it means.  Surely the Minister, in those circumstances, cannot continue to commend to this House, as he has been doing, this legislation. On this matter would the Minister give the House the benefit of his further thoughts with particular reference to the point I made, even with that which is not in the Bill, even if it was possible to add to the Bill assurances to cover matters omitted from the guarantee of immunity?  Will the Minister also comment on the hollowness of the procedure whereby in a practical manner and in practice there will be no such thing as an accused <Col N="181" /> being in a position, if of sound mind, of having the opportunity of being present while evidence against him is taken in the Six Counties?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is as I explained at some length yesterday during the debate. With regard to the question of immunity and the guarantee of immunity we have to distinguish between the immunity and the guarantee of the immunity.  The immunity is granted by the jurisdiction where in the person is at a particular time.  If a person is down here for trial the immunity is granted by the law of the State here, and if a person is in Northern Ireland for the Commission the immunity is granted by the law in the North.  The guaranteeing of the immunity is the desire of both Governments that this reciprocal measure will operate.  Should either Government fail to provide the immunity in the letter and the spirit that will be seen by the other Government as a failure to carry out its part of the bargain and the reciprocal arrangement will then come to an end. That is the guarantee.  In practice there will be a sanction on each Government to carry out its part of the bargain, the sanction being the ending of the bargain by the other Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing we have to look at is that we are talking about a bargain as if there was some equality of bargaining, as if the other side to this piece of legislation, the British Government, and ourselves intended to do things in an equal way.  Surely the Minister is not naïve enough to think that the operation will work in reverse to any degree?  Surely he is not suggesting to the House that there will be <i>quid pro quo</i>, that there will be give or take, that there will be as many moving in one direction as in the other? Surely he is not suggesting that there will be as many taken under the British Act as there will be under our proposed legislation?  This is utter nonsense.  It is merely window-dressing and was never intended to be anything else. Therefore, there can be no question of putting any weight on anything in this legislation merely because something of <Col N="182" /> a similar nature is provided for in the British legislation.  We may never be called upon to use that legislation.</P>
      <P>With regard to that British legislation, and its guarantees of immunity as far as they go, it is only the immunity under that legislation that there is any likelihood of use being made. We are not dealing as equals; we are not dealing with a matter where there will be equal traffic either way.  We are dealing with a lopsided discriminatory piece of legislation, and because there is a parallel for it at Westminster and Leinster House and because the two pieces of legislation seem to be complementary to each other what we are talking about is being given added impetus in its passage.  We have been told that the British legislation is similar to ours.  Yes, in so far as they put it through their Parliament, but there can be no question about it having equal application with our law, with our guarantees as against theirs.</P>
      <P>This is something the Minister should make very clear to the House, that this is a very lopsided, one-sided arrangement.  We are doing the giving. We are making the provisions, we will do the dirty work, it will be one way traffic.  What can the Minister tell us about that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first time intervening in this debate.  I had not intended intervening at all because I felt the contributions of both sides had covered the whole thing.  However, I now realise how one-sided this legislation is.  I did not think any party in this House would consider sitting here to debate this type of an arrangement where we would be doing the policing for the British.  I could understand it if there was a credible police force across the Border, but the minority in the North have no trust whatsoever in the policing there.  Everybody in the House disagrees with violence, but we have seen that persons who stand up here to defend justice are immediately charged with defending violence.  The violence there was generated over a number of years.  There is violence on both sides, but we are told we are defending violence on one side only.</P>

      <P>I cannot see it happening. We have this new gang down there at the moment with a right to kill, first order Black and Tans.  They are the type we will be calling in to give evidence against our people, maybe innocent, maybe guilty.  We have a responsibility to our people to see they get justice, and neither I nor anybody else can see justice being meted out there other than the type we have had over a number of years. I have great respect for the Minister as a man concerned with justice but I cannot see it being defended by what we are doing here today.  I agree more with the amendment of Deputy Collins than that of Deputy O'Connell because the portion of the Bill relevant to what we are now discussing is a waste of time, totally against the wishes of the people and against democracy and justice.</P>
      <P>I was shocked to hear about the custody situation, about a person from here going into the custody of those people.  We know what they did in the past to prisoners.</P>

      <P>Why have we got those people at Strasbourg at the moment if we think they are administering justice as it should be administered? Does anybody here think the SAS are the type of people we could depend on?  I should like the Minister to answer these questions.  They have been brought in to supplement the forces already there.  Does the Minister think he could get justice from this new murder gang?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very concerned with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get from the Minister if he at any time has considered the feasibility or the desirability of extending the immunity provided for in section 11 (2) (d) not alone to the accused but also to witnesses whom the accused might wish to call in his defence in our land. I can visualise a situation where an accused whose evidence is being taken on commission in Northern Ireland would be anxious to call two or three or more witnesses to give evidence, of an alibi for instance, but such witnesses would be fearful of appearing in that jurisdiction without the immunity given to the accused being extended to them.  The Minister will tell me that they can be called to give evidence in the South, but I am sure the Minister and everybody will agree that the evidence of a witness for the defence who can confront and contradict the witnesses for the prosecution in the same court or tribunal, before the same judge or judges, carries much more weight and is much more effective than if the evidence was taken elsewhere.  I should like to know if the Minister or his advisers have ever considered that aspect.  Certainly it would ensure that an accused would at least have all the evidence it was possible for him to call in his defence and have that evidence dealt with as effectively as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If an accused wants to call witnesses in his defence, the witnesses have the option of coming to the South and giving their evidence before the Special Court here, or the ordinary Criminal Court, as the case may be.  But those witnesses may not want to come South&mdash;we are envisaging a situation, according to Deputy Brosnan, in which they would be apprehensive of giving evidence in the North.  Therefore one must assume that they would have no apprehensions about coming South to a jurisdiction they would regard as friendly, or certainly not ill-disposed to them; that they would be fully free and agreeable to give their evidence without <Col N="185" /> any inhibitions whatever with regard to their own position, and that the accused would have the full benefit of that evidence.</P>
      <P>The assessment of that evidence would be made by the judges of the Special Court; they would be assessing all the evidence before them in any case.  Deputy Brosnan made the point that that evidence would be somehow less valuable if not given in the presence of prosecution witnesses.  I cannot see that point; the prosecution witnesses have no role in regard to assessment of defence evidence.  If all the evidence were being given in the one court the prosecution witnesses would give their evidence; they would then retire and take their seats in the court or they might go away.  The presence or non-presence of a prosecution witness has no relevance whatever to the weight, cogency or value to be placed on the evidence of other witnesses.  The only people who are concerned with those aspects of evidence are the judges.  The judges would have been present at the taking of evidence on commission; they would have been present at all stages of the trial and matters connected with the trial.  Therefore, they would be in a position properly to assess the evidence of the defence witnesses.  There is no way I can see in which it could be alleged that evidence of defence witnesses would be in any way less valuable because it was given in the courts in the South notwithstanding the fact that some of the evidence was taken on commission in the North in advance of being adduced in the court of trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of immunity for witnesses does not arise in this context. The only reason that immunity is put into this Bill for the accused is that he would be going in custody into another jurisdiction, and then he has to be given immunity.  But that position does not arise with regard to a witness in the other jurisdiction.  That witness already has immunity from arrest unless he has broken the law. Then, like any other citizen, he is liable to be arrested and taken into custody.  If he has not broken the law he need have no apprehension about giving evidence on commission in <Col N="186" /> Northern Ireland.  If he has broken the law, that is a separate matter and has nothing to do with this Bill.  If he has broken the law he is not entitled to immunity and he would be dealt with in whatever way that breach of the law involves.  But, if he has not broken the law and is an innocent person, he can give his evidence before the court down here, if he wants to; if he does not want to, he can give it on commission in Northern Ireland.  In either situation the rights of the accused are fully preserved because the assessment of that evidence is made by the judges. They are not going to worry about whether that evidence is given in the presence of Mr. A or Mr. B because they will look at that evidence, by itself, how it stands up to cross-examination, how credible it is in the general context of the trial.  That is what judges are for; that is their job.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the question of immunity for witnesses does not arise.  They have it by virtue of their status as citizens.  No man is immune if he breaks the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What about section 12, subsection (6) (a) which reads:</P>
      <P>A witness whose evidence has been or is being or is to be taken on commission under this section shall be entitled to the same privileges and immunities as a witness in the Central Criminal Court,...</P>
      <P>I am merely making the technical point.  The Minister is saying he does not need immunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That section merely means that it places a witness whose evidence is being taken on commission, in exactly the same position as he would be if he were giving evidence before a court; he has all the same privileges and immunities. A person in a witness box has a certain status; he is assisting the court. It does not mean he is immune from legal process within the jurisdiction where he is giving that evidence.  It could not mean that because his immunity before the commission depends on his&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that immunity is that he does not have to <Col N="187" /> give evidence which would convict himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, yes; that would be part of it.  But, if he is a law-abiding citizen, he thereby has ordinary immunity by reason of his status as a citizen.</P>
      <P>Of course, we are debating two amendments suggesting that there be a time limit on this Bill.  We have wandered very far from that.  I do hope that, when we come to the various sections, we are effectively debating now, we will not have this all over again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>We will be very fit by the time we come for the race itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blaney raised the point of immunity and the guaranteeing of immunity. He was apprehensive about what it would mean in practice, that it would not mean anything.  I was making the point that we have to distinguish between immunity and the guaranteeing of immunity.  The immunity is given in the jurisdiction wherein the person finds himself.  If an accused is down here for the taking of evidence on commission the immunity is granted by this jurisdiction.  If a prisoner is in Northern Ireland for the taking of evidence on commission, the immunity is given by that jurisdiction.  But the guarantee that that immunity will be honoured, fully observed and granted is contained in our ability to stop working the Act, stop sending people to the North if the immunity should not be given.  One case is sufficient to show bad faith in this regard&mdash;no more people will be sent North and this reciprocal arrangement will come to an end.  There is no question of a <i>quid pro quo</i>, in the sense that Deputy Blaney seems to feel there has to be the same number of trials North and South before those guarantees become operative.  If all the trials were to take place here and none were to take place in the North the sanction of the guarantee would be just as effective as if there were an equal number of cases North and South.  That has nothing <Col N="188" /> to do with the guarantee.  The guarantee is the ability of either jurisdiction to cease working the reciprocal arrangements and bring the matter to an end.  In other words, no more people would be sent South if we broke our word in regard to the granting of immunities; no more people would be sent North if the other jurisdiction broke their commitment with regard to the granting of immunities.  Quite frankly, I feel these are extreme arguments. I have every confidence that the immunity set out in the reciprocal measure in the British Parliament will be honoured because it is not something that can be given lightly to another sovereign government.  If it is not honoured we have the remedy: we do not send any more people into the other jurisdiction for the taking of evidence on commission and that means, in effect, that the reciprocal arrangement comes to an end.  I do not anticipate that that will happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brosnan and the Minister in these most recent exchanges envisage a situation which, in any sort of normal society, would be regarded as a normal situation to be discussed.  But we are talking about an absolutely abnormal situation so far as the Six Counties are concerned and the jurisdiction and authority of the establishment up there.  When we begin to speak about defence witnesses either being heard on commission or coming South to give evidence before our Special Criminal Court, or any other court provided for in this Bill&mdash;where they would be giving evidence on behalf of a person accused by the authorities in the Six Counties of some crime or other, as outlined in the Schedule to this Bill&mdash;there will not be any defence witnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the practicality of the situation, and no amount of guarantees of immunity on this side of the Border, to which I fully subscribe, will be fully ensured.  There is no question about that.  I am not questioning our ability to secure the safety of anyone coming South; I am sure our promise of full immunity and full security will be implemented.  Remember, these people will have to go back from whence they came and, having exposed <Col N="189" /> themselves or been exposed for the benefit of the accused by showing their faces and giving evidence on commission on behalf of the accused against the majesty of the law in the Six Counties, they will not be immune when they go back because there is no fair play or justice in the Six Counties.  If they choose to show themselves in order to help an accused person before our courts under this Bill they will be exposed to the gravest dangers, dangers which may identify them for early assassination.</P>
    <P>In the reality of the situation up there we are surely codding ourselves to an unbelievable degree in concerning ourselves with immunity or security in this legislation before the House.  Is the Minister not fully aware that the defence witnesses will be nonexistent where an accused member of the minority is concerned who is taken down here and prosecuted under this legislation?  We know only too well the abnormal situation obtaining in the Six Counties.  We know an accused will not get his natural and legal rights of being present at his own trial and there will be the very real danger of reprisals for anyone who raises a finger publicly to help someone the powers-that-be may be hounding.  We have the extraordinary situation that the accused may not be present at his own trial and, added to that, the absolutely astounding situation where in practice he will not be in a position either to procure or produce evidence from witnesses, evidence that would be helpful to his defence and, piled on his head, by leave of this House, there will be the evidence of the prosecution, trumped up or otherwise, on commission under the jurisdiction of the courts in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>That is the reality of what we are proposing to do here and no amount of talking around it will get away from that reality.  Am I right in saying that this abnormally unjust situation is being brought about solely and simply because the accusers and their witnesses are afraid to come South to a trial of one of their subjects before our courts as a result of their accusations and allegations and at their request? <Col N="190" /> Is this why we are bringing about this paraphernalia which, when one examines it, is extraordinarily discriminatory and totally unjust?  All this stems from the fear of those who make the accusations to come and back them up in the courts on this side of the Border if we act on their behalf and apprehend people at whom they point the finger.  Is that the basis for all this extraordinary paraphernalia in regard to taking evidence on commission and so on?</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister, in relation to my contribution yesterday evening, whether there is available to the Government the report on the case of Ireland versus the United Kingdom?  The House and the Minister will recall my paraphrase of the document available to Members in the Library giving the main ingredients of the case made by Ireland against the United Kingdom when Ireland was taking this action in 1971 on foot of very serious charges made against the then Administration in the North, presided over by the United Kingdom.  If the Minister can tell us whether the report is available and what it contains we believe the decision would have a very important bearing on our attitude to this Bill.  The case has been dragging on now since its inception for four-and-a-half years.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister tell the House whether the Garda authorities were consulted before some of the very serious and far-reaching sections of this Bill which will have a considerable effect on that force were brought before us? Throughout the history of this State our police force have not been found wanting in their service to the nation. They have always had the support of our citizens because of their impartial application of the functions with which they are charged.  Now they are being asked to associate with a comparable authority which, to say the least, have been suspect in regard to their functions down through the years.  These two questions&mdash;that of whether the report on the case of Ireland versus the UK is available and, if so, why the Minister has not reported on it to the House, and the question of whether the Garda authorities have been consulted in relation to those sections which affect them in the discharge of their duties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The questions which I put to the Minister but which were not answered are very relevant, because if the report shows that Ireland had no case the question of this legislation ceasing to operate in 12 months' time would not be of so much importance. The second question referred to the presence of this new force. While there are very strong arguments to be made against having this legislation at all, at least it should remain in operation only for as short a time as possible.  Therefore, we should know the findings of the report, regardless of whether it is against us or against Britain.</P>

      <P>The amendments being debated relate to the imposing of a time limit on the Bill.  Deputy O'Connell advocates a time limit in respect of the Bill as a whole while Deputy Collins seeks a time limit in respect of certain sections.  My answer, essentially, to those amendments, is that the time limit which Deputy Collins seeks is implicit in the Bill by virtue of the fact that the section to which most objection has been taken, but taken wrongly, that is, the provision in relation to the taking of evidence on commission, falls when the Special Court falls, and the Special Court exists only for as long as the emergency exists.  When the emergency is over the horrible crimes now being perpetrated will cease to be committed.  This question was debated for six hours yesterday and already today has been debated for an hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Bill should contain its own limitations, not limitations related to the provisions of the Special Court under other legislation.  The Special Court has been in existence for some time and may well be in existence because of circumstances within our jurisdiction long after the reason exists, as presented by the Government, for this kind of legislation.  The Minister implied that all the controversial sections of this Bill would cease to operate <Col N="193" /> when the Special Criminal Court became disestablished, but he climbed down from that position when it was pointed out to him from this side that that was not so.  It does not make sense to say that there is provision elsewhere for a Special Court and that when this court ceases to function the Bill automatically falls.  We should pass legislation which is clear and competent in its own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the provision of the Special Court that will really determine the matter but the circumstances obtaining on this island.  The circumstances of the time will determine the need for the Special Court, and if the circumstances are such that the need for the Special Court ceases to exist, the need for this type of legislation will also disappear.  What we are trying to deal with here is the problem of the scandal of the fugitive offenders who come here, having committed the most foul terrorist crimes elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main purposes for the introduction of the Special Court was the fact that it was a matter of concern for the administration that juries, either directly or indirectly, were being intimidated or were likely to be intimidated in relation to offences committed within this jurisdiction by people resident here. It had nothing to do with fugitive offenders, so it is not in accordance with the facts for the Minister to imply that the two coincide.  The general circumstances of the troubles in the North of Ireland have an effect on the country as a whole, but there have been circumstances during the history of this State where, because of the indirect effect of the northern problem on this jurisdiction, we have had to take certain steps, and one of those was the introduction of the Special Court, but that court was aimed to a considerable extent, if not exclusively, at dealing with people who were residents of this jurisdiction and who were being charged here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke at some length yesterday about guaranteeing immunity. However, he must recognise that in the final analysis these guarantees are informal and depend on the <Col N="194" /> administration of justice and on the conduct of the police in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>It is based on the conduct of police in Northern Ireland. The Minister will have to make a decision as a result of his judgment on the conduct of police in Northern Ireland.  It is most important that we should hear from the Minister what information, if any, he has as to the change in the structure, control and discipline within that police force from the circumstances that made it necessary for us to bring a complaint against that administration and its police at the European Court of Human Rights.  It is important that we hear from the Minister what has changed since that time.  We are not implying that where individual policemen or the forces of law and order are properly discharging their functions in a fair way and in the interests of all they should not be supported. <Col N="195" /> However, the Minister knows that we have grave reason to doubt the manner in which the police have acted, and are continuing to act, in the North of Ireland.  We are simply asking for a time-limit.  The Government are asking us to accept guarantees from them while this House is being blinkered regarding the outcome of the complaints at Strasbourg.  If such a report is available the Minister should make it available to us.  Otherwise, how can we judge the strength of the guarantees which he seems to think he has?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The guarantee is that we no longer allow people to go north for the purpose of hearing evidence on commission.  Therefore, the Bill no longer becomes operative by us.  That is the guarantee.  The Deputy is worried that something wrong will happen to people while in the other jurisdiction.  The first case where the immunity is not honoured in the letter and in the spirit then the guarantee becomes effective.  Nobody else goes.  I might add that I expect the immunity to be honoured.</P>

To say the least, there seems to have been grave apprehension about that ruling.  However, it was made and we have to live with it but I do not think it satisfied many people.  I am not dealing with that question now, but I am saying that if the Government have received a report that in any way confirms the basis of the complaints directed against the police force, it is a little strange for the Minister to tell us he has guarantees from those people and that he is satisfied with them.</P>

We are entitled to ask the Minister what information he has that we may not have.  How can he ask us to support <Col N="197" /> legislation on the basis of guarantees he tells us he has when we do not know what they are?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to what the leader of our party has said.  All of us want to see a situation where the people can give full support to the forces of law and order&mdash;more correctly, they should be known as the forces of peace and justice.  However, if there is clear evidence that they are not, neither our leader nor anyone else will suggest that the people should support those who may be the instruments of repression against them. As of now it can be fairly said that we have good grounds for apprehension, fear and distrust.  The record of past and recent history is there and, unless the Minister can tell us that circumstances have changed so considerably, it is not relevant to talk in terms of guarantees.  If he can give us clear proof that he has some way of ensuring these guarantees we will be happy to hear about them.  That is why we are proposing this stay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is relying on subsection (d) that a person will be immune from detention and any kind of suit or legal process in respect of any cause or matter, civil or criminal, arising before his arrival in Northern Ireland.  He seems to be satisfied that that will cover completely the manner of custody.  It would not be inconsistent in view of what has happened in the recent past in Northern Ireland to cite a case where a man is left in solitary confinement, in <Col N="198" /> a dark ceil from night to morning.  We will say he is not subjected to hooding but that he has not a proper diet. Where is that kind of conduct covered in the Bill?  By the standards of conduct mentioned in our complaints that would be almost like an afternoon tea-party.</P>
    <P>The Minister must recognise that the guarantees he is asking us to accept, which he has not clearly indicated here, are not in accordance with reality.  Deputy O'Connell asked that the whole Bill be terminated after a certain time. We ask that certain sections be terminated after a period of one year so that we would have an opportunity, if the Minister wished to bring them back again next year, of reviewing the matter.  Our view at the moment is that until such time as we know the basis for the Minister's guarantees, particularly the outcome during that period, we should not be dealing with this at all.  We should not allow one man to go up to the Six Counties in custody until we know the basis under which we can to some limited degree guarantee that man's right and protection. That is our view.  The Government have not played fair with us either yesterday or today, in letting us know if this report is available and what is the basis of the information which they may have which seems to make them happier about these guarantees than we can possibly be at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with what I regard as the essential element which is common to both these amendments, that is an attempt by <Col N="199" /> the Opposition and by Deputy O'Connell to write into this legislation the circumstances under which it will come to an end.  The first point I want to make is that there is nothing unprecedented about our proposal.  It is a well known, well established parliamentary procedure where a legislature see fit for some particular reason to pass legislation or to create legal machinery to deal with the particular machinery which the legislature do not wish to become part of the permanent statute law that there is then written into the legislation a provision which stipulates that the legislation shall come to an end after a certain period of time.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that the Minister or anybody on the Government side can dispute for one moment that that is a legitimate parliamentary device and that it is something which is very often resorted to.  Both these amendments must be regarded as entirely acceptable.  We then come to the question of whether or not it is desirable and valid in the case of this particular legislation to insert into it the provision for bringing it automatically to an end after a certain period of time.  Do we wish those provisions to become a permanent part of the law of this land, to become fixed, unalterable and permanent, to be on the Statute Book forever?  Do we visualise that they are undesirable, unpalatable and out of keeping with our legal and judicial traditions in the country and that they should be dispensed with at the earliest possible moment, if in fact they should be introduced at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, for the purpose of debating these amendments, we can leave aside the important argument as to whether or not the Bill should have been brought in at all or whether, even at this late stage, it should not be taken away and buried. If we are to have the Bill in something like its present form do we wish to see provisions of that sort enshrined forever in our legislation?  I believe that the Bill in its very origin is meant to be of a temporary nature. I quoted yesterday from the report of <Col N="200" /> the Law Reform Commission and, without wishing to be repetitive, I believe it is important that I should give the particular quotation again, where the commission with their very high level of expert, judicial people, fully conversant with all our legal traditions and our heritage said:</P>
    <P>Though the problem is urgent and serious its solution requires not far reaching law reform but immediate practical measures.</P>
    <P>If I were giving a sermon I would take that as my text, because those words outline more clearly than anything I could do the argument in favour of making this piece of legislation self-determining.  It is clear that the commission approached their task on the basis that it was a temporary situation to be dealt with by means of temporary measures.  The arguments in favour of making this Bill a temporary measure are unanswerable. Sooner or later the horrible, tragic situation we have to deal with will come to an end.  It is important that these provisions should be brought to an end at the earliest possible moment.  If the Minister suggests that 12 months is too soon I would at this stage put forward an amendment which would provide that the Bill would automatically come to an end at the expiration of 12 months unless the Minister came into the House and secured permission for its extension for another 12 months. That is also a well known parliamentary procedure and I am sure my colleagues on this side of the House would be prepared to accept a change of that order.</P>
    <P>If the Minister would accept from us the principle that this piece of legislation is undesirable and is not dear to the hearts of any of us, that it is something which he believes is necessary but should be of no longer duration than is strictly necessary, I am certain we could work out some amendment which would ensure that the Bill would be of a temporary nature and that temporary period could be extended by permission of the Dáil from time to time.</P>
    <P>From what I know of the present Minister for Justice, I would like to <Col N="201" /> think that at heart he is a law reformer. When he was a member of the Opposition he was very diligent and hardworking.  Anything he said or did at that time indicated on his part a wish for our legal structures to be enlightened and humane.  I am certain that, if it were left to his own personal decision and personal judgment, he would confirm that these are unpalatable and distasteful provisions. They take from our stature as an enlightened community or State.  They demean us.  By their very presence here before us they reproach us.  They say: &ldquo;You must not be ordering your affairs in any sort of civilised, enlightened and humane way if you have to bring in this sort of legislation&rdquo;. I think any right-thinking Member of the Oireachtas would look on these provisions in that way.</P>
    <P>The regrettable thing is that we have to bring in these provisions, not because of anything which has developed or evolved in this State of ours, but because of a situation which has developed in a part of our country which is under the control of and has been under the control of Great Britain for the past 50 years.  I do not think anybody in the House will deny that it is the situation in the North exclusively which has brought about the circumstances which make it necessary, or which the Minister thinks make it necessary, to bring in this legislation.  We have to besmirch our Statute Book with this piece of legislation because another jurisdiction has permitted a certain situation to develop over the decades, and over which we have no control.  There would be a different approach by many of us if this Bill was made necessary by something which had evolved or developed inside our jurisdiction because of our neglect.</P>
    <P>Since the State was founded, we have had a fair amount of success in building up a reasonable sort of community here.  Maybe economic development was not everything we would have wished it to be.  Maybe our economic resources did not enable us to have the same very high standard of social welfare and other services as they have in other European <Col N="202" /> countries.  Maybe in some respects our law is still antediluvian, but at least we succeeded by and large in creating a tolerably enlightened community in this part of Ireland.  If there had been no North of Ireland I could not visualise a situation evolving in this part of the country which would make legislation of this sort necessary.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that we in this Dáil are being asked to pass this legislation because of a situation which has arisen as a result of the misfeasance, mis-management and maladministration of Great Britain in regard to her responsibilities in the North of Ireland.  Is it not better then, in all those circumstances, that we should clearly say by the insertion of the provisions we have in mind, that this Bill, this legislation, is not in keeping with our Parliamentary traditions?  It is not the sort of legislation which would recommend itself to the vast majority of our people.  It is anathema to many of us.  If we have to have it we will have it as only a temporary, passing measure, just as we hope the tragic situation in the North is a temporary, passing thing.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to accept the principle of lack of permanence in this legislation for another reason. Whatever else may be said about us as a modern State, we have sought to behave well as international citizens. To the extent of our very limited resources, we have made valuable and important contributions in the Council of Europe, the United Nations, and now latterly in the European Parliament.  We have a very good record, particularly in the Council of Europe.  Indeed, individuals from all parties in this House deserve credit for their contribution. At different times we have made an important impact on the affairs of the United Nations.  I believe we will play a very important part in the development of the European Parliament. Already our members out there are having an effect and an impact away beyond anything that could be expected from the numbers involved.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned particularly about the Council of Europe.  We are <Col N="203" /> one of the founder members.  We played an important part.  We always made every effort we could as a nation to maintain loyal and worth-while membership, and to be good citizens of the European Community. That is very important for us.  Apart from the practical implications from the point of view of our legislation, our economy, and so on, it is important for us as a country to have the reputation of being a worthwhile member of that Community and a nation that can make an important, worthwhile contribution to its role.</P>
    <P>As this century draws to a close, these international organisations will attract an increasing importance.  No doubt, steadily day by day, the world is becoming more violent, more turbulent, more disturbed.  Some of the few things we can look to for any sort of salvation are useful, important, effective, international tribunals and organisations like the Council of Europe.  They are the bulwark for individuals and, indeed, for countries in this modern, turbulent world in which we live.</P>
    <P>Let nobody think that the Council of Europe and bodies like that are a sort of nice, interesting, academic, parliamentary affairs.  They are, as I see it, today incurring increasing practical importance from the point of view of individuals and, indeed, small countries like ours.  We have a very strong vested interest in ensuring the efficacy and importance of these international bodies and organisations. I fear that these provisions in this legislation will sooner rather than later bring us into conflict with the European Convention on Human Rights.  I cannot see any significant length of time elapsing before these provisions will involve us as a country in cases before the Council of Europe, before the commission and the court of the Council of Europe.  That is inevitable and that is going to affect our standing and status internationally.  It is going to affect our dignity and pride as a nation when we have to be hauled before these international <Col N="204" /> bodies.  That is inevitable if we pass these provisions in their present state.</P>
    <P>In that situation surely it would be plain common sense to make these provisions terminable so that we can say to any of these bodies: &ldquo;Yes, we regret we have had to invoke these provisions; the situation is desperate and tragic and we have to do these things; but we assure you, the world and European public opinion that these provisions will be of the shortest possible duration we can make them. We can assure you that they will be extant only for as long as they are strictly necessary&rdquo;.  That would be an important point in our favour in the eyes of these institutions and of public opinion.</P>
    <P>I believe that the arguments in favour of putting into the Bill these provisions are unanswerable.  I do not think the Minister has brought forward any conclusive reason why he should not accept the suggestions we have made.  I do not believe that they will affect in any way the workings of the provisions while they are in operation. If there is a provision in the Bill that the legislation will come to an end after a certain period it will not have any effect on the practical operation or application of the provisions. It will constitute an important statement on our part as legislators to the effect that we do not like these provisions and are going to tolerate them only for as long as is strictly necessary. It is important that we should do that.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could say that the inclusion of one of these amendments in the Bill would seriously affect the operation of the Bill that would be an argument we would have to listen to, but he cannot say that.  I sought to argue last night that the opposite would be the case and that everybody involved in these processes would be scrupulously concerned to ensure that everything would be done properly, above board and in strict accordance with the spirit and letter of the legislation if it could be seen that the legislation was automatically coming to an end after a certain period or that the Minister would have to come back to <Col N="205" /> the House and seek its renewal after a specified period.</P>
    <P>In debating these amendments up to now we strayed far from them and had a general look at the Bill in some detail.  That is inevitable because if we want to argue that the Bill should be brought to an end after 12 months it is essential to look at the different provisions so that we can build up our case why it should be brought to an end after that period.  However, nothing said by the Minister during the debate was in any way conclusive about the necessity to exclude the sort of provisions we are seeking.  We have advanced many persuasive arguments in favour of their inclusion, in favour of some provision of this sort, but the Minister has not seriously put forward any argument which could justify him opposing this principle of ours.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot say that our suggestion would interfere with the efficacy of the provisions of the Bill.  Is the Minister reluctant to have to come back to the Dáil after 12 months and seek a renewal of the legislation?  If that is what is in his mind that is a serious condemnation of the provisions of the Bill; he just wants to put this on the Statute Book and leave it there so that none of us can have anything to say about it again.  If the Minister is not afraid of the way these provisions will operate he should not be afraid to come back to the Dáil after 12 months and say: &ldquo;That is the end of that particular piece of legislation&rdquo; or &ldquo;The situation is such that I have to seek a further extension of 12 months&rdquo;.  We could then have a look at how the Bill operated up to that time.  There is everything to be said for that from the point of view of this Parliament and from the point of view of the legal and judicial process in our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey is worried that the provisions of the Bill will in some way besmirch our reputation, demean our standing and impair our status in the eyes of our colleagues on the Council of Europe.  He is concerned that our reputation as a nation would suffer, with harm to the national interest.  I do not agree at all.  It is clear <Col N="206" /> to our colleagues on the Council of Europe and to other countries that what we are providing for in this Bill is a mechanism to deal with a problem which, if allowed to go unchecked and remain without action our part, would have a far greater adverse effect on our reputation abroad.  We would be presented abroad in the eyes of the civilised world as a nation willing and anxious to give refuge to fugitive terrorists. Having regard to the magnitude of the problem of terrorism throughont the world any nation which seems to be on the side of the terrorist must surely suffer immense damage to its repuation.</P>
      <P>In my view that danger far outweighs the danger which Deputy Haughey worries about.  I do not concede that there is a danger in this Bill damaging our reputation because while it is novel legislation in our legal system, extra-territoriality and the taking of evidence on commission in criminal cases are not novel in the Civil Law countries.  The Bill is not going to impinge or damage our reputation in Europe.  I reject that argument.  We are subject to far greater damage if we can be presented as a nation which is prepared and anxious and willing to give refuge to fugitive offenders.  That is the danger we have to guard against if we are worried about our reputation, and we have a right to be worried about our reputation.  I believe the finding internationally will be in favour of what we are trying to do in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the arguments advanced for a specific time limit are valid for two reasons.  Deputy Haughey admits that special circumstances make this Bill necessary; these special circumstances produce these unfortunate results in Northern Ireland.  He suggested that we are dealing here with the results of mis-management by British rule for 50 years.  I concede&mdash;it does not have to be conceded because it is readily apparent&mdash;that there was misrule in one part of the island.  However, can anyone suggest that, if the terrorist who fired at a busload of schoolchildren yesterday was to be found in this jurisdiction, we should excuse him on the ground that his action was <Col N="207" /> the result of British mismanagement? It is straining the argument&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be accurate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  It is straining the argument to suggest that the terrorist acts which are now being committed, of the most foul kind, can be attributed to British mismanagement.  That is too simple. The problem has flowed over into this jurisdiction, and refuge has been sought here, and unless we can show that we are not prepared to allow our territory and our society to be havens for these people, our reputation abroad will be besmirched to a degree which could do us and the national interest immense harm.  The measures proposed in this Bill for the taking of evidence on commission, for dealing with the problem and for dealing with the legal difficulties, are reasonable and will be seen by outside observers to be reasonable.</P>
      <P>There are guarantees and protections built into the Bill.  These will be seen as such, and once seen as such I do not at all see how the Bill can be held up in any European forum and pointed to as a piece of undemocratic legislation.  On the contrary, it could be a headline for European countries that might be faced with similar problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is conceded that the circumstances of today are those which give rise to the problem of these fugitive offenders.  What we want is that there will be an end to the need for this unusual legislation when the problem with which it is intended to deal comes to an end&mdash;not any sooner. Deputy Haughey suggested that we look at it year by year and renew it if the problem has not come to an end.  I cannot see the validity of that argument.  We are legislating here to deal with a problem, and the Bill has built into it the Special Court.  The necessity for that court will come to an end when the circumstances giving rise to the problem we have come to an end.  Therefore particular provisions of this Bill including section 11 <Col N="208" /> which has caused such controversy, will no longer be necessary when the circumstances that gave rise to them come to an end.</P>
    <P>That is a proper time limit on the Bill, not an arbitrary 12 months, or a second 12 months or a third 12 months.  We are legislating for a certain situation which obtains now and whose end unhappily cannot be foreseen. Therefore the legislation logically should not have a time limit nor should it provide for its own renewal. What will end the legislation will be the ending of the circumstances that gave rise to it.  One of the reasons why the Opposition would like the legislation to be reviewed yearly is that they do not like the provisions in it.  This is where I disagree with them.  I think the provisions are perfectly reasonable, rational and just.  They implement the recommendations of a most eminent body of jurists, whose proposals are embodied in the Bill.  The provisions in the Bill and the mechanics provided in the Bill are reasonable to deal with the problem which has to be dealt with, a problem arising from the circumstances in this island now.  When those circumstances change will be the time for this legislation to come to an end. We have been debating this since 4.30 p.m. yesterday.  It is now 12.15 and if I may, I move that the question be put.</P>

      <P>One of the practical and cogent points made by Deputy Haughey is that if there was a time limit it would by its nature ensure that those from whom the Minister has accepted guarantees and on whose behalf he is so ready to give them would be more careful in the exercise of the powers they have under this legislation. That is a very fair case.  We want to see a position emerge throughout this island where the police forces, North or South, will have the full support of the community, North or South.</P>

      <P>The Chair wishes to remind the Deputy that we are dealing with amendments Deputy Haughey was able successfully to argue, on the question of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all in relation to time.  If at the end of a year <Col N="210" /> we could have an indication to satisfy us that the police authorities there had significantly changed their habits and procedures, if we had a guarantee that people committed to their custody would be treated properly, then of course we could have the dawn of a new era in Ireland in which at this end we could say that a police force who up to the moment have not acted in accordance with the standards of justice as we know them, the standards of the Garda Síochána, are guardians of peace and not just agents of law and order, then we would be happy to say that those forces deserve our support and that we will willingly give.  We are being asked to give our assent now in the light of history up to date. Frankly we should not give it.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect which is of vital importance.  We are pressing these amendments on the basis that they are the only ones available to us now.  As we have indicated, we oppose this legislation anyway.  Were we to put down an amendment in relation to the all-Ireland court, the whole Bill would go. Therefore, it is not open to us to do that.  That is still our position.  We find this suggestion unworkable and very undesirable.  We are adhering to our original position.  I want nobody to suggest that, because we are not arguing this now, we do not adhere to it.</P>
      <P>I want to come back to another aspect which is vitally important.  It has been pointed out by a number of speakers in the House here that one of the reasons we have to introduce this very unusual procedure for &ldquo;allowing&rdquo;&mdash;in inverted commas&mdash;defendants to go in custody, to be present when evidence is being heard against them on commission, is because the people giving the evidence, police, army witnesses and so on, will not come South.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If they did, the question would not arise at all.  It is to deal with the situation in which they &ldquo;will not&rdquo; that that provision of the Bill comes into effect.  Therefore, let us not speak about &ldquo;may not&rdquo;; it is only when that would happen that this provision will become operative.  If we are that sensitive about these people we <Col N="211" /> must consider the <i>quid pro quo</i> we have had to offer to show concern for their apprehension coming South. The <i>quid pro quo</i> is that our judges have to go North, not to act in the full judicial capacity to which they are accustomed, but rather to sit as observers at the hearing of this evidence.</P>

      <P>We asked for a time limit because we want to see how and to what extent the Bill will have operated.  If, for instance, it transpires that our judges, in the course of the first 12 months of its operation, say: &ldquo;look, we do not find this workable; we find this unacceptable; we find this compromises our judicial function in this part of the jurisdiction&rdquo;&mdash;which could well happen because this is a totally new obligation being imposed on them, harnessed as they will be&mdash; surely it is appropriate that we be enabled to consider that, amongst other things, at the end of 12 <Col N="212" /> months, to establish, even on that aspect, whether or not the Bill can be or has worked.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage the Minister said to me, in relation to this, that he would have thought it an impertinence of him to consult with our judges in the Special Court as to whether or not they would operate this.  That may be so, and we will deal with that when we come to the section.  Certainly, I have not, because it would be an impertinence for me to do so.  The Minister recognises that, supposing our judges do find this unworkable or unacceptable over the first six months; supposing it happened that some or all of them refused to go&mdash;because they felt they were at least as entitled to remain here in their jurisdiction discharging their functions as are the army and police in the North entitled to stay there; supposing they say &ldquo;no&rdquo;&mdash; does it not mean that this Bill falls, or certainly must be looked at again?</P>

      <P>Optimism is fine if based on reality.  I like to be optimistic too in relation to the whole problem about which we speak.  Certainly, all of us want to be optimistic in that connection.  But to be optimistic without having any real basis is a different matter.  To be optimistic about the workings of this Bill, when we do not even know how it will begin to operate, how those who in one way or another have a responsibility to implement the various aspects of its procedures will act, is being a little more than optimistic.  To say the least of it, it is being hazy and dreamy.</P>
      <P>If the Minister looks at some of these new procedures, surely it is right that we should come back here after 12 months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Minister comes back to us within three months and says to the House: &ldquo;Look, we have found this is unworkable; we have found that the guarantees you so freely accepted are not being implemented; we have found (a), (b), (c) or (d),&rdquo; does the Minister think we will resist him on this side of the House? We are simply saying that at least there should be this time limit.  I should like to have the Minister's comments on that, in regard to its workability and particularly whether or not our courts can or will operate it.</P>
      <P>There have been terrible things done in the North.  God knows, they need no exaggeration.  Some of the things done have been reprehensible, horrible and we reject them&mdash;sectarian assassinations. But, when the Minister, as a Minister of the Government here this morning, talks about someone firing on a busload of schoolchildren, I am not saying that what was done was anything other than reprehensible but, as far as we know there seems to have been two children on the bus&mdash;it is bad; it is horrible but it is a little different&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not in order at all.  The Minister talks about the good name of this country.  It is bad enough and has been sufficiently scarred but, for a Minister to come in here and exaggerate what, God knows, does not need to be exaggerated and talk in terms of firing on a busload of schoolchildren shows a slight tendency that has been emerging from that side of the House, and from the Minister as well, to try to aggravate the existing horror and imply that we are all&mdash;to quote himself, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;right on the brink of civil war.  If the deeds as bad as yesterday's were to be multiplied to the extent that the Minister has done, we would be right in the centre of it.  It would be very desirable that the Minister measure his words accurately in relation to an event of that sort which, in <Col N="215" /> any case, is horrible, without being aggravated in the way in which the Minister has done.</P>
      <P>Might I have the Minister's comments on the workability and also the guarantees he has, as to why our proposal for a 12-months' maximum time limit is not acceptable.  If it works in the 12 months we will be able to say then: &ldquo;these security forces, or whatever, have changed; there is a new era dawning in Ireland; we can all give it the support we want to give it&rdquo;.  Is that not a good idea?  But at present this is not the case and we are simply asking for that opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated in reply to Deputy Haughey's arguments, the reasons why I think, this arbitrary time limit of 12 months is undesirable.  This Bill is to meet the need of the times.  Nobody can say that that need is going to disappear in any given number of months.  The need for the Bill will disappear when the times change and when the circumstances of the present time giving rise to the Bill end, when acts of terrorism are no longer committed, when terrorists no longer come down South to take refuge from justice.  In that situation the Bill will have come to an end, not when a particular period of months has elapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to how the Bill will work it is a novel Bill&mdash;that has never been denied&mdash;and it does provide new procedures.  I am optimistic that with the application of common sense and a desire to see the Bill work it will work.  I am optimistic.  Deputy O'Kennedy is pessimistic.  That is as far as either of us can go.  Because I am optimistic, however, and because I consider the grounds reasonable and grounds that we can stand over as validly constitutional and valid also in terms of the Convention on Human Rights and recommended by a most eminent commission of jurists I have none of the fears expressed by the Opposition.  In fact, I have grounds for being optimistic.  I believe there will not be any trouble.  But, if my optimism is misplaced, then the matter will have to be looked at again. <Col N="216" /> I do not concede that my optimism is misplaced and, conceding that, I cannot agree to put an arbitrary time limit on the Bill because that would be tantamount to saying that what determines the life of the Bill is not what gives rise to it but some completely arbitrary number of months. What should determine the life of the Bill are the circumstances which give rise to it and, when they come to an end, the provisions which are causing so much contentious debate here will also come to an end because the Special Court will fall and these provisions cannot exist independently of that court.</P>
    <P>We have made these arguments at some length over the past two days and there is really nothing new to be said now on either side.  It would be more fruitful, I think, if we were to move on now and deal with the sections and, accordingly, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose that the question be put.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure we do not have as part of our law for all time legislation introduced to solve a particular problem.  If we find at the end of the 12-month period suggested in my amendment that we are not satisfied as to the effectiveness of the procedures adopted, then we must not be afraid to say so.  We are concerned here with aspects of the Bill which are extremely controversial and repressive. I refer to sections 2, 3, 11, 12, 18, 19 and 20.  These are the provisions I believe will need review within a 12-month period.  Sections 5 and 6 which amend the Larceny Act of 1916 are an improvement in the law, and it would not be necessary to remove these provisions from the Statute Book after 12 months.  There is nothing wrong with section 9 dealing with the carrying of firearms with criminal intent or section 10 dealing with the unlawful seizure of vehicles and so on. However, we do not wish to adopt for all time a method of dealing with terrorist offences when that method may prove unworkable.  Neither do we say that there are not other ways of dealing with these grave problems on both sides of the Border.  We do not wish to rule out for all time the possibility of an all-Ireland court to try certain offences, but we do not accept that the method adopted here in this Bill is the solution to our problems, and we must be in a position of being able to say so at the end of a 12-month period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not happy with sections 11 and 12 dealing with the taking of evidence in this State for a criminal trial in the Six Counties and <i>vice versa.</i> We do not believe this will be workable. We do not believe it is fair or adequate.  What will happen if no one is prepared to come south to give evidence?  What will happen if no one is prepared to go north to hear the <Col N="218" /> evidence given against him?  In that set of circumstances how can we possibly say the proposed methods here are workable or fair?  If a few accused persons go north and they are ill-treated, irrespective of whether or not it can be proved, if word goes round no one else will go north.  The Minister tried his best last evening to give assurances to his own party grouping for about three hours and he failed to reassure that particular supporter of his.  If the story goes round that people are ill-treated can we then say this Bill is unworkable?  Unless we are 100 per cent certain these provisions will work we must keep them on the Statute Book for the minimum period of time. We do not believe the restrictions and the procedure should remain in force for all time.  The prosecutor or the accused is no longer entitled to require the attendance of a person before a district justice for the purpose of examining him by way of oral deposition. It is a fundamental principle of our law that either the prosecution or the accused may call each other's witnesses to examine them.  We do not wish to restrict this right for all time.</P>
    <P>Section 19 empowers a member of the Garda Síochána to arrest without warrant anyone he has reasonable cause to suspect is guilty of an offence under this Bill.  In order to effect that arrest a member of the Garda Síochána may enter by force and search any place where he suspects a person to be.  This can be done without a warrant.  This sort of thing must not be undertaken lightly.  There are large discretionary powers.  Whether we need these to protect our interests is an open question, but we certainly do not want this kind of legislation on our Statute Book for all time.</P>
    <P>These are some of the controversial sections we opposed on the Second Stage.  It is clear now that the Government and the Minister will vote these sections through.  All we are calling for is a review of these procedures after 12 months for the purpose of making such changes and deletions as may seem desirable.  We have no way of knowing how these entirely new provisions will work or if they will work at all.  The arguments used by the Minister in not acceding to our <Col N="219" /> amendment or to the amendment tabled by a member of one of the parties which comprise this Government, Deputy O'Connell, are of the same type as those put forward by the Minister when he was in Opposition and was seeking a time limit in regard to the Prisons Bill of 1972.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening, whether deliberately or otherwise, the Minister misrepresented what was said by Deputy O'Malley.  As the then Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley agreed to a time limit in respect of the Prisons Bill, but he did this as a result of the case made by the then Opposition.  He had a problem on his hands regarding the provision of accommodation as a result of the actions of those who deliberately destroyed Mountjoy.</P>
      <P>In an effort to be fair to the Opposition at the time, Deputy O'Malley agreed to a two-year time limit, although saying that he would be back for an extension, because he knew that the repair work at Mountjoy would not be completed within that period.  Last evening he remarked that it was with a certain degree of irony he witnessed the present Minister coming before the House seeking an extension of that legislation for a further two-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that the Minister failed totally to satisfy not only Members on this side of the House but Members within his own party on the question of immunity or of the safety of accused persons who would have to deliver themselves into custody and go to the Six Counties.  The Chair reminded us yesterday that the case of Ireland versus England was <i>sub judice,</i> but we do not know whether the report is already in the hands of the Government. To an ordinary layman like myself&mdash;and I am glad that the majority of our citizens are lay people and not legal people&mdash;my understanding of <i>sub judice</i> is that it is for the purpose of ensuring that nothing said in public would have any effect on the <Col N="220" /> decision in any case.  I am satisfied that nothing I could say either here or elsewhere would affect the findings of the European Commission on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>From discussions on television and reports in the press we know that this report may be in the hands of the Government already but that they are deliberately withholding publication of it until such time as this Bill is enacted.  This leads many to believe that there is some type of a sinister political plot afoot whereby it is necessary for the Minister to withhold publication of the report in an effort to contain the level of revolt within the Labour Party until such time as the Bill has been passed.  Yesterday the Taoiseach could very well have told us whether the report had been received by the Government.</P>

      <P>I was again trying to make my case by saying to the Minister that he failed in the case he made in not accepting our amendments or the amendment of Deputy O'Connell for a time limit.  I understand that the Government have the political muscle to vote this Bill through the House.  I also know that the sincere cry of the member of the Labour Party who spoke in this debate will go unheeded by his colleagues in his own party and by his associates in Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>The one disturbing fact that has emerged in the six or eight hours of debate was that the Minister failed to satisfy not only this side of the House but also the only people on his side who have participated in the debate with regard to certain sections of the Bill.  The Minister cannot deny this.</P>
      <P>The Minister has failed to come out into the open and let us and the people know when it is likely that the report of the European Court of Human Rights will be available.  Are there grounds for believing, as many people do, that the report of these findings will be submerged while the Committee Stage of this Bill is going through?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to do with a time limit.  Perhaps on Report Stage I may facilitate the Minister with an amendment to the effect that the Bill does not become law until such time as the report is available and until everyone knows what is in it.  If the truth were known, if the contents of the report which many people believe has been in the hands of the Government for some days were known, perhaps people might take a different view of some of the sections in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister probably knows that in Strasbourg next week there is a plenary session of the Council of Europe.  This Parliament has representatives to the Council of Europe, and if we cannot get the information here which we want perhaps we will have it next week direct <Col N="222" /> from Strasbourg.  We will oblige the Minister and the Government on Report Stage with an amendment that will give us plenty of time to know what is going on.</P>
    <P>Our party do not want to hold up unduly the amendment before the House.  The amendment of Deputy O'Connell is the only amendment we can vote on.  I understand that the amendments in my name cannot be voted on at the present time.  We will wait for that at a later stage.

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for answers to specific questions I asked him.  In the welter of questions raised he has overlooked them.  First, where it is obviously not practicable, sensible or sane for an accused to hear evidence given against him on commission in the Six Counties, how can he square that with the normal expectation of justice and the rights of the individual? Secondly, how can he stand over the situation where an accused person held in our jurisdiction may not have any witnesses for his defence from the jurisdiction of the Six Counties for the practical reason that they would be exposing themselves to dangers that could result ultimately in their death?  Can the Minister give us any indication why he should go to the extreme length of providing for the taking of evidence on commission that deprives the accused of his natural and legal rights with regard to the hearing of the evidence against him, of being present as well as the calling of defence witnesses to aid his defence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 2, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The relevant provisions of this Act shall be subject, where appropriate to the provisions of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Protocols thereto.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>From the beginning my party clearly stated their opposition to the Bill in principle.  However, it is now clear that the Government are going to use their majority in this House to push it through even though our amendments are designed to minimise, as far as possible, the infringements of human rights and fundamental freedoms under this legislation.</P>
      <P>We are concerned to ensure a minimum standard of human rights and fundamental freedoms as enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights.  My amendment incorporates the relevant provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in the Bill.  The basis of the convention is a belief of a common heritage of freedom and democracy in Europe. Its purpose is to strengthen resistance to any undermining of democracy and to secure political and social stability in Europe.  The convention provides for a set of minimum standards&mdash;I stress the words &ldquo;minimum standards&rdquo;&mdash;and is in no way exhaustive. The Bill says it is necessary to limit certain rights because of the political climate in the Six Counties. The Bill limits the right to be tried in public and to examine and to have examined witnesses on behalf of the accused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are seeking to incorporate recognised international principles and we are not going beyond the minimum standards laid down by the convention.  We feel it necessary to introduce at least the standards of the convention in areas covered by the <Col N="228" /> Bill which are also covered by the convention.  For instance, it may well be that section 11 which requires an accused person to surrender himself from this jurisdiction into custody in Northern Ireland may be an infringement of the rights enshrined in the convention, particularly in Articles 5 and 6.  Article 5 states:</P>
    <P>(1) Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.  No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:</P>
    <P>(a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court;</P>
    <P>(b) the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non-compliance with the lawful order of a court or in order to secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law;</P>
    <P>(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;</P>
    <P>(d) the detention of a minor by lawful order for the purpose of educational supervision or his lawful detention for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority;</P>
    <P>(e) the lawful detention of persons for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases, of persons of unsound mind, alcoholics or drug addicts or vagrants;</P>
    <P>(f) the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.</P>
    <P>(2) Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons <Col N="229" /> for his arrest and of any charge against him.</P>
    <P>(3) Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.</P>
    <P>(4) Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.</P>
    <P>(5) Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an enforceable right to compensation. </P>
    <P>There is no better way to ensure these standards than by construing this Act in conformity with the provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  To introduce the convention, in whole or in part, as part of our law provides a basis for a uniformed approach to the administration of justice on both sides of the Border.  If we introduce the European Convention as a set of minimum standards we must go on to negotiate with the United Kingdom to adopt the European Convention as part of their law.</P>
    <P>At present there may be disparity between the laws of Britain and the Irish Republic or there may be disparity between the application of these laws.  Allegations of brutality in the British Government's application of their law in the North of Ireland cannot be completely ignored when we are to empower our law enforcement agents to send accused persons north of the Border to give evidence.  We must not allow our law enforcement agents to become tarred with the same brush as the law enforcement agents of the North.  At present we are awaiting the report <Col N="230" /> and the findings of the European Court on Human Rights on the case of Ireland v. England.  The charges of brutality by the forces in Northern Ireland were many.</P>
    <P>We are now on the eve of the publication of the report of the findings of the European Court on Human Rights.  As I have already said, it is likely this report is in the possession of the Government.  Unfortunately it is still not available to the House for the purpose of this debate or to the public at large.</P>
    <P>Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights states that no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  We must be seen very clearly to uphold this principle and the most effective way to do so is to adopt the relevant provisions of the convention in the application of this Bill.</P>
    <P>What would happen if, for example, the Garda delivered into the custody of the RUC an accused person for the purpose of the accused person giving evidence?  Let us say that on his departure from a Border town he is fit and well and that on his return he is bruised and scarred.  He returns unable to make the RUC take responsibility for this, and that being so it is quite likely he might blame the Garda.  One must ask what protection have the Garda from such allegations? How many persons will dare go north to give evidence, and if no one or only a few do so how can we say the Bill has done any more than deny an individual the right to hear evidence given against him?  For that matter how many people will come south?</P>
    <P>To introduce the convention as part of the law of the State will not solve problems that will be encountered in the working of this Bill when it becomes law.  It provides for the adoption of a set of minimum standards which are accepted internationally. By adopting the convention as part of the law of this State we establish minimum rules to protect human rights.  Legislation of this kind cannot avoid being repressive <Col N="231" /> sometimes and indeed excessive at other times, and once we have the relevant provisions of the convention incorporated in it we lay down minimum standards which ensure that we do not reduce freedom or limit rights.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat that the basis of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a belief in the common heritage of freedom and democracy in Europe.  I must stress that its purpose is to strengthen resistance to any attempt to undermine democracy and to secure the political and social stability of Europe.  This convention is a foundation on which to build human rights and fundamental freedoms and the foundation must exist on which to base the defence of human personality against all tyrannies and all forms of oppression.</P>
    <P>The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms lays down only minimum standards and by rejecting our amendments, which only seek these minimum standards, the Minister and the Government are completely rejecting the convention which we have ratified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment can be justified on its face, having regard to the provisions of this Bill.  It is also appropriate that we should look at the background to the European Convention on Human Rights. The fact that we are founder members of the Council of Europe is of vital importance here.  We have adhered to the standards it established and above all else we have always been seen to be initiators in that Council with regard to fundamental rights and freedoms.  Indeed, on one occasion we were ready to acknowledge that the Court of Human Rights had jurisdiction to hear complaints against our Government, and the fact that the court vindicated the Government at that time in the Lawless case gave great strength to that court in that we recognised its jurisdiction in regard to emergency <Col N="232" /> legislation.  It also vindicated the approach of our Government at that time.</P>
      <P>We cannot now talk in terms of national rights without recognising that there are universal rights.  We are concerned with a vital element in this amendment.  Because of the honoured position we have in the Council of Europe and of our allegiance to and adoption of the convention and the protocols, we have a special responsibility to extend where possible the application of that convention to countries that may not have adopted them to the extent we have done.  We are one of nine countries only of the Council of Europe who up to the moment have ratified and adopted all the conventions and protocols of the Council of Europe without reservation.  The others are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, Iceland, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden.</P>
      <P>It must be realised from that list that we are in the honourable company of countries who almost all have been known and recognised for their fierce concern for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  It is for that reason that we believe that this convention and what it stands for can be imported as a guarantee into our law particularly in regard to the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>It has become clear in the course of the debate that we are here dealing only with this legislation in so far as our rights and obligations are concerned, but the whole principle behind this legislation as presented by the Government is that it is reciprocal legislation to correspond to legislation already introduced and passed in the UK.  I understood the Minister to undertake last night to circulate to Deputies copies of the legislation which went through Westminster.  As far as I know, this morning none of us had a copy.</P>

      <P>One copy will not do when there are so many of us concerned on this side.  One copy will do over there for Deputy O'Connell who is the only Member who seems to be interested over there, but one will not do for us.  That is by way of passing. The thing that is central to our amendment is that in introducing this we will extract on a reciprocal basis a similar arrangement and commitment from the British Government&mdash;that they will incorporate it into their law at least in so far as it relates to this legislation.  That is a fundamental part. To do that we have to give the lead. We have given the lead many times in connection with human rights.  We would be very glad to give the lead in this connection as well, particularly when there are fundamental matters involved in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Might I indicate that, for instance, the United Kingdom have not ratified or adopted Protocol 4 to the Convention on Human Rights?  If one looks at the provisions of Protocol 4 one must ask why they did not adopt or ratify it.  Some of the Articles of that Protocol may indicate that they do not find themselves able to give effect to these fundamental freedoms set out therein.  Article 2 of Protocol 4 might be worth reading in relation to what we are speaking about:</P>
      <P>1.  Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether or not a person who would be lawfully within the territory in this case and surrendered himself voluntarily into custody could be accorded that right?  It continues:</P>
      <P>2.  Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own.</P>
      <P>There is an interesting one in Article 3 which says:</P>
      <P> 1.  No one shall be expelled, by means either of an individual or of a collective measure, from the territory of the State of which he is a national.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" /> And:</P>
    <P>2.  No one shall be deprived of the right to enter the territory of the State of which he is a national. </P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed about expulsions from the mainland, or the right of people who are residents of the Six Counties to enter the mainland of the United Kingdom.  For the moment I am referring to Protocol 4; perhaps those may be the grounds on which they have not adopted that.</P>
    <P>Relating to the whole convention it is vitally important that where we are going beyond the bounds of our own immediate control and responsibility&mdash;which I think the Minister will freely acknowledge we are doing here &mdash;where we are depending on the &ldquo;guarantees&rdquo; of another jurisdiction, depending on the authority and the implementation of that authority of another jurisdiction, then surely we must at least do all possible to ensure that that authority, in that other jurisdiction, will correspond, as Deputy G. Collins has said, at least to the minimum standards which are those set out in the Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>If we are literally to take upon ourselves responsibilities for what is done elsewhere, over which we have no control&mdash;and that is clearly evident from what emerged in the debate on the first amendment here&mdash;then the least we can do is introduce, for those who will be subjected to those procedures, the guarantees of this convention written in that interest, the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  I cannot imagine that writing in those guarantees and ensuring those fundamental freedoms could be said to be anything other than basic to a proposal of this nature.  It may be argued that possibly some time ago&mdash;last year or the year before&mdash;had this Bill never arisen we should have adopted this convention and its Protocols as part of our national law.  That is a good case.  The urgency for it would seem to have arisen.  If the relevant provisions were adopted in relation to this Bill, a person could then make a complaint in our courts in relation to infringement of the fundamental provisions of the convention. <Col N="235" /> At present, of course, that is not open to him.</P>
    <P>I am commenting now on judicial decisions that have been taken.  It is fair to say that our Supreme Court, particularly over the last decade, has shown itself to be particularly sensitive to the fundamental freedoms most of which are incorporated specifically in our Constitution.  But even in relation to those that may not be referred to specifically, our Supreme Court, to say the least of it, has taken note of them. On numerous occasions this convention has been referred to in that Supreme Court, by way of guidance, if not direction.  It is right that we should acknowledge that our Supreme Court &mdash;in accordance with its obligations and the sensitivity it shows for human rights&mdash;has taken heed of the principles underlying this convention.  Therefore, it would seem to be consistent that we now confer on them, and on our courts, the right to hear complaints based on breaches of the provisions of the convention and its protocols.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to read the Preamble to the convention to see what is the purpose behind it, as distinct from the Articles to which I shall refer later:</P>
    <P>The Governments signatory hereto, being Members of the Council of Europe,</P>
    <P>Considering the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10th December, 1948;</P>
    <P>Considering that this Declaration aims at securing the universal and effective recognition and observance of the Rights therein declared;</P>
    <P>That was the purpose of it&mdash;that this declaration would secure the universal and effective recognition and observance of the rights therein declared. There must have been areas in the national laws of the member countries, gaps, omissions and so on, which made it necessary to include a provision of that sort.  The preamble continues:</P>
    <P>Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is the achievement of greater unity between its <Col N="236" /> Members and that one of the methods by which that aim is to be pursued is the maintenance and further realisation of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms;</P>
    <P>If we are to take that on its face value &mdash;and I see no reason why we should not&mdash;it says that the more we would adopt this convention, far from creating any divisions between the members, it should mean, on the other hand, further to quote:</P>
    <P>... the achievement of greater unity between its Members...</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned with the United Kingdom and ourselves, far from creating any divisions or exacerbating relations between the two countries, it should have the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>The preamble continues to say:</P>
    <P>Reaffirming their profound belief in those Fundamental Freedoms which are the foundation of justice and peace in the world&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and this is very important</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and are best maintained on the one hand by an effective political democracy and on the other by a common understanding and observance of the Human Rights upon which they depend;</P>
    <P>I do not need to persuade the Minister or anybody that what we have at present in the Six Counties of Northern Ireland cannot be described as an effective political democracy. That convention recognises that the very foundation of human rights and fundamental freedoms is, amongst other things, an effective political democracy. To the extent that one does not have it, the obligation imposed on us to secure those rights and fundamental freedoms become all the more urgent and pressing.  That makes the argument for the adoption of the convention even more cogent.</P>
    <P>Finally, the preamble says:</P>
    <P>Being resolved, as the Governments of European countries which are like minded and have a common heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law to take the first steps for the collective enforcement of certain of the <Col N="237" /> Rights stated in the Universal Declaration,</P>
    <P>Have agreed as follows:</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that what follows in the various Articles has to be stated by way of general principle and, accordingly, is so stated.  When one looks at the general principles outlined, obviously they cannot be specific when talking about how those rights are to be implemented but they can be specific as to the nature of those rights.  It is vitally important that we be seen to support those rights in every way possible and anything we do should not in any way be an infringement of those rights.</P>
    <P>Article 5 says:</P>
    <P>Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Collins referred to these. I merely want to make some reference to the effect they might have on this Bill:</P>
    <P>No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a precedure prescribed by law.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Collins mentioned the cases.  It is fairly clear that the provisions of section 11 of this Bill are not envisaged within the exceptions mentioned in Article 5 of that convention. Here we have a situation where a person in order to exercise rights has to surrender himself into custody.  He is thereby obliging himself to be deprived of his right to liberty and security.  It is at least arguable that a man obliged to surrender himself into custody, thereby surrendering his liberty, will be deprived of other rights he is entitled to exercise under this convention. That, to me, is certainly against the spirit, if not the letter, of the convention. If it is arguable, then surely the protection should be written in so that those who find themselves in the position I have outlined can feel secure and guaranteed against infringement.</P>
    <P>Article 6 of the convention provides:</P>
    <P>In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any <Col N="238" /> criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.</P>
    <P>Will what is proposed here be a fair hearing within the meaning of the convention?  Is it a fair hearing if a man may or may not be present when evidence is given against him? If it is not, and it is arguable that it is not, then this convention we have so willingly and zealously adopted should be there as a fundamental protection in our courts for individuals whose liberty we are charged to guarantee in accordance with the law.</P>

      <P>To exercise that minimum right the person involved must surrender himself into custody and thereby deprive himself of the liberty guaranteed under the convention.  I do not think it would take any great legal ingenuity to have our Supreme Court or the Court on Human Rights rule that the provisions of this Bill are in both the spirit and the letter contrary to the provisions of the convention.  If the person involved has to deprive himself of one of these rights and exercises the other in a very limited way then this Bill takes no account of the provisions of the convention.  The Minister may argue it does.  There is only one way of checking whether or not it does and finding out which of us is right.  I would not attempt to give a judicial decision on this since that is no part of my function but, if what I say is correct, then the person charged has rights until he is convicted and, if we want to apprehend terrorists, we can deal only with those convicted of terrorism and not assume those charged, but not convicted, are guilty of an offence.  The Minister has been arguing that there is always the assumption that everyone will be charged before these courts.</P>

      <P>Because of these fundamental provisions the Minister can hardly say to us the protection should be in the Bill because he would have to say that the convention and protocol are all fine but there are times when one has to overlook them. This particular convention recognises beyond yea or nay that there will be occasions when emergency legislation is necessary.  It does not deny that or reject the right to pass such legislation. It simply says certain minimum rights must be accorded and that is why the provisions of our Offences Against the State Act were found to be in accordance with the principles and minimum rights of the convention. This is legislation in a totally uncharted territory, in a totally doubtful area, an area in which one has to balance what the Minister calls his optimism and my pessimism.  My pessimism is based on fact while the Minister's optimism is based on some sort of dreamland.  We should be seen to introduce and guarantee the provisions of the convention.  It is a question of fundamental principles.  It will have no effect unless there are reciprocal provisions in the United Kingdom and, from that point of view, we could be moving into an area of domestic legislation <i>ipso facto</i> in another country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the other point that never before in the history of this State have we involved ourselves in the <Col N="241" /> administration of justice, in the implementation of law or in the direction, control or supervision of the freedoms of the law of another jurisdiction over which we have no control.  We cannot do that confidently on the basis of the kind of loose guarantees that the Minister has talked of.  To say the least we have reason to be apprehensive in regard to the police force of that other jurisdiction when we consider their record to date.  We have our own standards in regard to such matters as bail, arrest without warrant and conditions of custody but Britain has standards that are different.  If, however, both jurisdictions are to work together, must there not be introduced some uniformity?  Any such uniformity can only be achieved by reference to the only known international uniform standard&mdash;the Convention on Human Rights.  It is because our standards and procedures are different from those of the other jurisdiction that we need to have them co-ordinated and related more directly to the most desirable international standard of which we were such enthusiastic founder members.  In view of the novel and strange nature of this Bill we urge the Minister to accept the proposal being put forward here.  This proposal cannot be mischievous but can only have the effect of guaranteeing rights.  Should the Minister agree to this amendment something will have been achieved for liberty not only in Ireland but in so far as the UK and the rest of Europe are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to import into our domestic law the European Convention on Human Rights.  The only reason why such an amendment would be necessary would be because there was something in our law which did not honour the rights provided for by that convention.  But that is not the case.  There is nothing in our law that is contrary to the convention. Had there been any such anomaly we could not have ratified the convention.  The minimum rights provided <Col N="242" /> by the Convention on Human Rights and the legal obligations which it imposes are part of our law.  Indeed, the trend of judicial opinion would appear to be going in the direction of saying that rights under a convention are specifically imported into the law.</P>
      <P>The rights provided by this convention are available and guaranteed to us in a fuller way by virtue of the provisions of our Constitution as it is being interpreted by the Supreme Court.  As Deputy O'Kennedy pointed out, the Constitution is interpreted with a jealous eye on the rights of the individual. Therefore, to suggest that this Bill should be made subject to the Convention on Human Rights or any other convention is tantamount to saying that a Bill should be made subject specifically to the Constitution. We know that there is no need for that because the Constitution is the basic law and it affects all our legislation and controls our Executive activities.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances it is obvious that this amendment is unnecessary. I would not accept the argument put forward that there is in any sense in this Bill a breach of or a lessening of the rights provided for by the Convention on Human Rights.  Should this Bill be tested in the courts on those grounds I am confident that it would not be found to be in breach of the convention.  However, should it breach the Convention on Human Rights it would breach also the provision of our Constitution.  The Bill contains fundamental rights; it contains the right to a fair trial and the right to defend oneself.  I think that we in this jurisdiction are a little off balance in debating a measure which contains provision for the taking of evidence on commission in criminal cases.  It is the first case in our jurisdiction and it is not a common procedure in Common Law countries.  However, it is a common procedure in civil law countries, in countries that are cosignatories with us to the Convention on Human Rights.  It is common enough in Europe to have evidence on commission in criminal cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council of Europe has another convention, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters <Col N="243" /> of 1959.  That convention specifically provides for the taking abroad of evidence on commission for criminal trials.  The convention has been ratified by nine members of the Council of Europe and of these eight have ratified the Convention on Human Rights.  What we propose in the Bill is no novelty in the legal systems of Europe and it would not be proper for us to suggest that the protection of human liberty and the enforcement of these rights are any less strong on the mainland of Europe than they are here where there is a different legal tradition.  There is nothing new in the matter of taking evidence on commission.  It does not diminish the rights of the accused person.  Finally, there is no need to import into this Bill provisions in the Human Rights Convention when these rights are already honoured throughout the length and breadth of our legal code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made great play of the fact that the taking of evidence on commission is nothing novel or new as between countries. However, here we are talking about a truncated part of our own country to which only this will apply. We are not dealing as between country and country.  We are dealing with the occupiers of part of our country in relation to the alleged operation of law and the administration of justice in that truncated, partitioned part of this country.  There is no point in the Minister talking about dealings between States.  We are not dealing with that.  Whether it is described as a territory, a State or a statelet, there is no indication that human rights and fundamental freedoms, as laid down in the document quoted by Deputy O'Kennedy today, will exist in the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has drawn a parallel between States operating this kind of law and the taking of evidence on commission.  If the Minister is so convinced that there will be no danger to an accused person going to hear the evidence against him in the Six Counties, if he is so satisfied that there is nothing to prevent an accused person <Col N="244" /> calling witnesses from the Six Counties to help his defence in the Six Counties or in our courts here, why does he not put into the Bill such an assurance as is requested in the amendment?  He should not try to get out of it on the grounds that what we practise here will be practised by the Six Counties in their dealings under this proposed legislation.  We have no such assurance and from the knowledge we have of the discriminatory nature of administration in the North, both in the past and at present, we cannot have any assurance that fair treatment will be given to the accused. Neither are we assured that those who may tender evidence in the defence of the accused on commission in the Six Counties or before our own courts may not have to suffer dire consequences.  This is where the whole argument in favour of the Bill falls.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy said that by accepting the amendment proposed by Deputy Collins and having regard to the fact that this measure is a reciprocal one between our Government and the British Government they in turn would be obliged to operate in a fashion that would conform to the requirements of human rights and fundamental freedoms as laid down.  This is why it is not sufficient to say that we might as well put into every piece of legislation here something to the effect that it will conform to our own Constitution. It is the argument the Minister is making and if he were talking about plain, straightforward cases one could agree with him.  However, there is no parallel for what we are proposing. It has not been attempted before in similar circumstances here or in any other part of the world so far as I know.  The arguments given by the Minister do not ensure that there will be the minimum human rights accorded to persons accused under the machinery that will be set up as a result of the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister can do one of two things.  He can back up his own belief that everything in the garden is rosy by accepting without further debate or equivocation the amendment now proposed or, by failing to accept <Col N="245" /> it, he can indicate that he is acknowledging that human rights and fundamental freedoms are not capable of being guaranteed in our partitioned Six Counties, in their courts, through their administration or through their police.  There is no other way out.</P>
    <P>It is rather perturbing and disquieting to find the Minister on behalf of our Government talking about human rights and fundamental freedom and extending them across the Border when, in this House, the Member who tabled amendment No. 1 was so screwed by the people in Government that he was not even allowed to vote for his own amendment.  I do not know where there are human rights or a fundamental freedom in that.  I do not know of any greater indictment of the Administration. Yet, against all the known facts of the injustices of the administration in the Six Counties, we are expected to accept from the Minister of a Government who deny the right of one of their own Deputies to vote for his own amendment in regard to a measure he totally abhors, without any proof whatever that the minimum of human rights will be accorded to an accused person going North, after being prosecuted in our courts for an offence as outlined in this particular measure.  This is asking too much, and the shying-away from writing it in on the spurious grounds the Minister has given is a sure indication that he is not convinced of what he told us earlier, of his belief that the safety, the freedom and the just treatment that any accused person is entitled to can be assured in a Six Counties court if such an accused person attempts to go there.  I am quite sure that such a person will not do so despite the urgency of our courts, as they are asked to do in a section of the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister either accept the amendment or give us an acknowledgement that he cannot and will not agree to the amendment because he is not satisfied that what he has assured us is within his competence to guarantee, that is the minimum right of any person being tried for a <Col N="246" /> criminal offence?  If he can give us one or the other we will be dealing honestly with the situation rather than the manner in which we are glibly trotting over it at the moment and trying to make it appear that it is quite a normal thing, that because it is being done elsewhere between sovereign states it is quite all right for us to set up that type of paraphernalia in consort with the British Government but only in relation to the Six Counties and which will only operate between here and the Six Counties.  They, strictly speaking, have no administration they can call their own.  Even if they had and even if they are so regarded as having their judicial political hacks, their politically motivated police force, their special branch, their occupation forces, including the abominable SAS, are the people we are proposing to apprehend on their behalf, those whom they would make accusations against for offences allegedly committed in the Six Counties&mdash;is it a fair trial for such people to be given the opportunity of attending in the Six Counties to hear evidence given against them by their own accusers who 99 times out of a 100 are drawn from the discredited forces I have just mentioned?  That, according to the Minister, is satisfactory and fair to the accused.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that any accused person in those circumstances will not opt, no matter what the exhortations are or where they come from, to go to the Six Counties to leave himself at the tender mercies of those about whom the Government of this country complained to the European Court in respect of which we are still awaiting a verdict although we know the truth. It is to the tender mercy of those people that we are telling an accused person under this Bill that he may go back up there, that that is fair play and he is entitled to hear the evidence being given against him.  We are telling him that in fairness to himself and to ensure that justice is done he may call witnesses, have them give evidence in the Six Counties and make sure that they expose themselves and make themselves known <Col N="247" /> by coming forward to those same discredited forces so that in turn those witnesses may expect to get the knock when it suits those particular people. If they do not then perhaps their cohorts, the paramilitary loyalists, will mark them down for further treatment in the future.</P>
    <P>This is what the Minister is proposing. In doing so he can stand up here and say that we do not need this proposed amendment because we take that for granted, that it is there and it is tantamount to writing into our ordinary legislation that it shall be subject to the provisions of our own Constitution.  The Minister went further and said that if it contravened human rights and fundamental freedom it would contravene our Constitution. I cannot credit that the Minister could mislead himself to the degree that he can possibly believe all that he is telling us here.  I do not believe he can in all honesty believe what he is advocating here.  It is a hard thing to say about any man that I doubt what he is saying.</P>
    <P>The circumstances are there and there is nothing that can take away from them nor can take away from the glaring discriminatory nature of this measure which, regardless of how it may appear theoretically, is designed and will be put into operation solely for the purpose of dealing with one element of the community in the Six Counties, namely the Catholic or Republican element, and that no Loyalist will float across the Border with the RUC on his heels to seek refuge on this side of the Border. Therefore, we will not have Loyalists dealt with on this measure.  Therefore, because of the circumstances that contrive to bring about this situation, we are proposing to pass legislation that applies to only one section of the terrorists that are mentioned here so frequently, which must be of the Republican hue, the Catholic persuasion or whatever you want to call them.  This is where the minority grouping in the main will be drawn from.  Our operations in regard to this proposed legislation will not have to deal with the loyalist extremists.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that in December, 1975, there were 250 patients with osteoarthritis on the waiting list at Merlin Park Hospital, Galway, for surgery for total hip replacements and that the average waiting time is two years; and if he will state the action being taken to provide additional staff and theatre facilities to reduce the long waiting period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of this type of operation has created an increased demand for it <Col N="253" /> in recent years.  To meet this demand a second orthopaedic theatre for Merlin Park Hospital has been approved but, due to many demands on the limited capital funds available at present for hospital improvements schemes, it has not been possible to allow the work to commence.  The matter will be considered further later in this year.  I understand that a proposal by the Western Health Board to create two additional posts of orthopaedic surgeon for Merlin Park is being considered by Comhairle na nOspidéal at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to reports of alleged child battering by parents; and if he will make a statement on the reports which have aroused widespread disquiet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the recent references and comments in the Press on a report on non-accidental injury to children prepared by a committee comprising members from the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the North Dublin <Col N="259" /> Social Workers.  I had already received a copy of this report.</P>
      <P>While I do not wish to discount the general significance of the problem, the aspect of the report which caused most comment in the Press and which was probably the greatest cause of public disquiet was the reference in the report to the estimate that as many as 100 children per year may die in Ireland as a result of non-accidental injury by their parents.  However, the information available to my Department indicates that the incidence of such deaths is nothing of the order of the above estimate.</P>
      <P>The problem of non-accidental injury to children has also been under examination by a committee established in May last at the instigation of my Department.  The group have a broadly based membership and I understand that their report will be submitted to my Department very shortly.</P>
      <P>The problem of non-accidental injury to children will be considered urgently in my Department in the light of the recommendations in the two reports referred to and I will then make a further statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to the ISPCC, somebody must have misinterpreted their report.  Until a national advisory centre has been established we will not know how big this problem is. At present in this city if a mother who is in mental trouble ill-treats her child she can go to 15 different hospitals on 15 different occasions and say that the child fell from a pram or something. This could not happen if there was a national centre at which such things could be registered.  The answer given is very vague.  We must have far more stringent measures so that remedial action can be taken, but this cannot be done until we have an advisory centre. Then we will know how many are dying as a result of ill-treatment.  We have been told that in Britain 300 children are dying per year from ill-treatment. Therefore, our ratio would be 30, but we will not know until a centre has been established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions I have considered the question of the decentralisation of the administration of sickness benefit, and I am satisfied that the present centralised system, which ensures the most effective administration for all areas of the country, would not be improved by the setting up of centres in particular areas to deal with claims and payments.  Disability and occupational injury cheques are delivered by post to the beneficiaries' addresses because these claimants are ill and in the main it would not be possible for them to attend at local offices for payment.  Decentralisation of payment in the case of these benefits would not therefore be of any advantage to the claimants.</P>

    <P>I do not accept that there are long delays in the payment of sickness benefit by my Department.  While I agree that delay in payment of benefit during <Col N="263" /> illness can cause considerable hardship.

There is a time within which she must lodge an appeal.  Whether or not anybody, including myself, has power to waive that, I do not know, but she has exceeded the 30 days limit.  Certainly, I will undertake to take the appeal from the Deputy to see whether it can be put before the appeals officer. On the second part of the question, as far as married women and other workers are concerned, the Deputy knows that I have no function.

There were a number of claimants in this area who called at the local office to inquire about payments. When they called at the local Garda station they found it was closed.  Others stated the gardaí told them to leave the forms and they would be posted to the local office.  It seems this delay occurred because the barracks was closed and the claims were not handed in.

    <Title>Wildlife Bill, 1975 [Seanad]: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed to provide an up-to-date, effective statutory framework for wildlife conservation in Ireland.  It is a comprehensive and complex measure but I hope the accompanying detailed explantory memorandum will have given Deputies a clearer picture of its objectives and proposals.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been throughly discussed in the Seanad and the text now before the Dáil includes a substantial number of amendments passed by that House.</P>
      <P>Some 45 years have elapsed since the enactment of any major measure concerning wild fauna and in these circumstances the persistent pressure for new legislation and, indeed, the criticism of delay in finalising the Bill are understandable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="284" /> I think that any objective assessment of the wide-ranging scope and technical content of the Bill will go some way towards indicating why it was necessary to devote more than the normal preparatory period to its formulation.  In this connection, I would like to pay tribute to the work done by my predecessors in the earlier preparatory stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Nowadays nature conservation is receiving increasing attention in the environmental programmes of intergovernmental agencies like the United Nations, the EEC and the Council of Europe, and in the activities of many non-governmental agencies such as the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, the International Hunting Council, the International Waterfowl Research Bureau, and so on, which specialise in different aspects of wildlife conservation and hunting.  The increasing involvement of my Department in the activities and programmes of these organisations makes it imperative that an up-to-date statutory basis be provided if we are to carry out our international responsibilities satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Of course, concern for international obligations is not to ignore the need for effective legislative machinery in the field of wildlife conservation in the domestic context.  Fortunately, despite some detrimental effects of technological developments in this country, it is not yet too late to embark on a positive, energetic conservation programme to safeguard our wildlife heritage.</P>
    <P>In the 1960s&mdash;following the transfer to my Department of responsibility for the administration of the Wild Birds Protection Act, 1930, and the Game Preservation Act, 1930&mdash;a positive, if modest, programme of game development and wildlife conservation was carried out by a small unit operating within the Land Commission.  In 1971 that unit was merged with the Forestry Division, following the impetus given to nature conservation by European Conservation Year 1970, and the combined agency is now known as the Forest and Wildlife Service.</P>
    <P>This service&mdash;with its very substantial and widely-distributed properties <Col N="285" /> throughout the country and its complement of personnel trained and experienced in the natural sciences&mdash;is now the main State agency for wildlife conservation.  Its activities in that sphere have largely been based on the two 1930 Acts to which I have referred and which I may say represented enlightened forward thinking at that early stage of the development of the State.</P>
    <P>But the limitations of the two 1930 Acts for present day needs were obvious and it became abundantly clear that, if worth-while progress from the national or international standpoints were to be made in the wildlife conservation sphere, modern and more effective statutory machinery would be indispensable.  That is what the Bill now before the House aims to provide.</P>
    <P>Against that short historical background I will now set out more fully the principal aims of the Bill and the effects of its individual provisions.  The major objectives of the Bill may be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P> 1.  To provide an adequate statutory basis for the conservation and better protection of wild fauna and flora and their habitats;</P>
    <P>2.  To define the role of the Minister for Lands in that sphere;</P>
    <P>3.  To ensure the conservation of areas having specific wildlife values;</P>
    <P>4.  To provide an up-to-date framework for the development and protection of our game resources, including proper exploitation of those resources;</P>
    <P>5.  To facilitate the unification within the Department of Lands of existing services dealing with such matters as forestry, conservation, amenity, and so on, and</P>
    <P>6.  To provide a firm statutory backing to accepted modern concepts of the multiple use of State forests and to provide an improved land acquisition procedure in this context. </P>
    <P>To illustrate how it is proposed to achieve these objectives and in order to indicate the thinking behind the proposals, I would now like to comment on the individual sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> Sections 1 to 10, inclusive, in Part 1 of the Bill, are largely routine and do not call for detailed comment.  Perhaps the most interesting provisions in this group are Sections 2 and 10.  The former provides a very comprehensive set of definitions for purposes of the Bill; the latter deals with the repeal of existing legislation as listed in the First Schedule.  The repeals include the two 1930 Acts to which I have already referred and also a number of old statutes going back to penal times. When the Bill becomes law, the main corpus of legislation relating to wildlife conservation will be embodied in a single modern Act.</P>
    <P>In Chapter I of Part II the real substance of the proposals in the Bill begins to emerge.  Section 11 defines the basic role of the Minister for Lands in the sphere of wildlife conservation and sets out general powers to enable him to exercise that role more effectively. These relate to such aspects of wildlife conservation as the provision of assistance and advice, management, by agreement, of lands not in State ownership, promotion of and participation in various schemes and projects, provision of grants and loans, the conduct of research, the furtherance of educational aspects of wildlife conservation and so on.</P>
    <P>A few general comments on these powers may not be amiss at this stage. As I said earlier, some modest progress in wildlife conservation has already been achieved despite the severe handicap of inadequate legislation.  That this has been possible is due in no small way to the ready co-operation and assistance afforded by voluntary organisations such as the Regional Game Councils and their National Association, the Irish Wildbird Conservancy, the Irish Deer Society, the Field and Country Sports Society and others.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to all these groups for their past co-operation and I am satisfied that the powers sought under the Bill, and under Section 11, in particular, will put my Department in an even stronger position to work in harmony with them for the future towards the attainment of mutual objectives.</P>
    <P>I referred briefly to educational aspects of wildlife conservation.  I would <Col N="287" /> like to make it clear that my reference was not so much to education in the formal sense, with which my Department is not directly concerned, but to the broader field of generating and encouraging a wider public understanding and support for nature conservation generally, and for wildlife values in particular.</P>
    <P>The success of the Bill will inevitably depend to a large extent on this kind of public appreciation and my Department will continue to use every means of publicity at their disposal&mdash; through information leaflets and booklets, lectures, films, exhibits and so on &mdash;to promote this ideal.  Indeed, I need only point to the tremendous public response to the opening up of the State forests for public recreation and education as a clear indication of the vast reservoir of goodwill which exists for a sound wildlife conservation programme.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the special contribution which the farming community can make towards wildlife conservation by virtue of their ownership and use of a sizeable part of the habitats which are vital to the survival of much of our wildlife.  A Bill of this kind inevitably imposes many constraints on many different interests but I think Deputies will find that every effort has been made to strike a reasonable balance between <i>bona fide</i> agricultural operations and wildlife conservation interests.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that, in return, farming organisations and those directly engaged in farming will do everything they can to ensure that our wildlife continues to survive but I would appeal to them especially on two counts&mdash;firstly, to keep the habitat requirements of wildlife in mind when planning their agricultural programmes and, secondly, to do nothing which would interfere with rare or threatened species.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 12 is to place an obligation on various public bodies, for example, Government Departments, local authorities, the Commissioners of Public Works and certain semi-State bodies to consult the Minister for Lands before undertaking <Col N="288" /> projects which might have a detrimental effect on nature reserves or refuges for fauna and so on which will be established under sections 15, 16, 17 and 18 of the Bill.  These areas will be chosen for their special wildlife values and it will be very important to ensure that they are subsequently safeguarded to the utmost extent practicable.</P>
    <P>The only exemptions from the obligation imposed by the section will be emergency measures and certain aspects of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  The activities of the Commissioners of Public Works under the Arterial Drainage Acts are also excluded but there are separate specific provisions to cater for these in section 43 which I will mention later.</P>
    <P>Section 13, which provides for the establishment of a Wildlife Advisory Council, is a very important provision. Any broadly-based programme of wildlife conservation involves, apart from the Forest and Wildlife Service, a wide diversity of interests&mdash;scientific, agricultural, cultural, sporting, and so forth&mdash;each of which can make a special and worth-while contribution towards the formulation of policy and the settlement of objectives. I visualise the council as providing an effective forum for a widely-representative group whose combined talents and expertise will ensure a steady flow of advice and guidance for my Department's on-going conservation programme.  In appointing the members of the council, it will be my aim to strike the best possible balance between representatives of the relevant scientific disciplines and those with practical experience at grassroots level.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is an enabling measure to permit the setting up of boards to administer any service which the Minister will be empowered to provide after the Bill becomes law.  As of now, the establishment of any such board is not envisaged, but the practical scope of wildlife conservation and game development is sufficiently far-reaching to warrant the inclusion of this enabling power to meet possible future needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> The Second Schedule to the Bill sets out in detail the various provisions which would apply to the constitution, practical operation etc. of any such board.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most notable defect in existing legislation is the virtual absence of any statutory protection for wildlife habitats&mdash;as distinct from the protection of species.  One of the fundamental aims of the Bill is to remedy this deficiency; we have already, in section 12, seen one small step in this direction, but the provisions in Chapter II are more directly concerned with this vital sector.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 16 can be taken together.  Section 15 relates to the establishment of nature reserves on lands owned by the Minister for Lands or by the State; section 16 is concerned with the formal recognition of reserves in private ownership.  In the selection of these sites, the overriding consideration will be their scientific value as habitats of fauna or flora or a combination of such features.</P>
    <P>My Department have already made some tentative progress on this front in anticipation of the enactment of this legislation.  As regards flora, some typical examples of native woodlands have been set aside for dedication as nature reserves; in regard to fauna, a wildfowl reserve of international significance has been established on lands jointly owned by my Department and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy at the North Slob, Wexford, where the primary concern is for the migratory Greenland Whitefronted goose.  The passage of the Bill will enable these and other nature reserves to be formally established.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to say that concern for the establishment of nature reserves is not confined entirely to the State; some private individuals and organisations have also shown commendable enterprise in dedicating lands&mdash;invariably at considerable personal expense&mdash;to the cause of wildlife conservation.  Section 16 of the Bill will make it possible to give this praiseworthy initiative a well-deserved formal recognition.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 16, with which I have just dealt, provide a mechanism <Col N="290" /> for safeguarding wildlife habitats where scientific interest is the dominant consideration.  However, there are some places throughout the country which, either because of the ownership situation or the particular wildlife value concerned, might not qualify for the rather special status of nature reserve but which nonetheless warrant positive protective measures.  It is proposed to protect habitats of this kind by designating them as refuges for fauna under section 17 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>An elaborate procedure is contemplated as a preliminary to the making of a designation order and involves consultation with other State agencies, notification of the owners, and publication of notice of intention to make the designation order.  Persons with an interest in the lands or who can establish that they would be affected by the protective measures of such an order will have ample opportunity to lodge an objection and will be entitled to compensation.  Compensation will be assessed on the basis of diminution of value, loss or disadvantage arising from the protective measures set out in the order, and, if the amount cannot be agreed, the matter will be open to arbitration.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the importance attached to both nature reserves and refuges is such that offences committed on these sites will carry special penalties under section 74 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The final section in Chapter II regarding habitat protection is section 18.  This relates to management agreements intended to restrict the user of land by owners or occupiers in such a way as not to impair its inherent wildlife values.  Such agreements, if they were to run only for the lifetime of the current owners or occupiers would not always achieve the desired results but subsection (4) is designed to enable agreements to bind on successors in title, thereby ensuring permanence for the commitment of the land to the cause of wildlife conservation.  There is provision in subsection (3) for monetary compensation.  By and large, the type of landowner likely to be interested in entering into such an agreement will be the owner who is already <Col N="291" /> keenly interested in wildlife conservation, but even if it were to result in safeguarding only a few vital habitats, the inclusion of section 18 in the Bill would be well justified.</P>
    <P>Chapter III of the Bill deals with the general protection of fauna and flora.  As there are a number of sections in this Chapter relating to fauna and only one directly concerned with flora, namely, section 21, I will deal with it first.  The importance of flora in the overall context of wildlife conservation frequently tends to be overshadowed by the more popular concern for fauna.</P>
    <P>The basic intention of section 21 is to provide an enabling power whereby species of flora in need of protection can be made the subject of Ministerial protection orders which would have effect either throughout the State or in specific areas.  It will be an offence to interfere with the flora or their habitats save under licence from the Minister.  The primary objective is to provide a measure of statutory protection for flora at national level which will augment certain conservation powers already vested in planning authorities under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  This does not connote any unnecessary overlapping because, in practice, the Minister for Lands will be concerned with rare species of flora (and their habitats) from the national viewpoint, whereas planning authorities will continue to exercise their existing powers in their own areas of jurisdiction.  The combined effects of these dual functions will be to strengthen substantially the present inadequate statutory position in so far as flora is concerned.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the provisions in the Bill for protection of fauna, starting with wild birds.  In this connection, it will be helpful to read sections 19 and 22 together.  Section 19 is the blanket provision under which it is proposed to protect all wild birds&mdash; including their nests and eggs&mdash;except the pest species listed in the Third Schedule; but, under subsection (2) of section 22, it will be possible to add <Col N="292" /> to or take from the species mentioned in the Third Schedule as circumstances require.  Section 22 will make it an offence to hunt, injure, capture or kill protected wild birds, with suitable exemptions for agricultural, forestry, fishery and certain other activities.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) may call for some degree of explanation: Under section 42 &mdash;with which I will be dealing more fully later&mdash;there are provisions to meet situations in which damage is being caused by protected fauna to agricultural and certain other interests. These provisions cover action taken by a person in defence of his property with the permission of the Minister. However, it may sometimes be necessary for a landowner to take immediate remedial action resulting in the killing of a protected wild bird without such prior permission.  The effect of subsection (6) of section 22 will be to exonerate that person from an offence except where the bird in question is one of the few rare or threatened species listed in Part I of the Fourth Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 and 23 contain provisions in relation to the protection of specific wild animals, which broadly correspond to those which apply to wild birds in sections 19 and 22.  Here again, it will be advantageous to read the two sections together.  The intention is to protect all those species of wild animals which are listed in the Fifth Schedule to the Bill.  The list may, under subsection (2) of section 23, be augmented or reduced as circumstances warrant.</P>
    <P>It will be an offence to interfere with or destroy the breeding place of protected wild animals or, save under licence, to hunt such animals; but there are appropriate exemptions under subsection (7) in favour of a variety of activities including agriculture, fishing, forestry, and so on.  Moreover&mdash;in line with the procedure already mentioned in the case of protected wild birds&mdash;there is a special provision in subsection (8) whereby landowners etc. who find it urgently necessary to kill protected wild animals in order to protect their property, may do so without breaking the law, provided that the animals in question do <Col N="293" /> not come within the very short list of rare or threatened species set out in Part II of the Fourth Schedule.</P>
    <P>Sections 24 and 25 provide for the declaration of open seasons for certain protected game birds and game animals and includes a provision for the imposition of bag limits, where necessary, in the interests of conservation of stocks.  The game species concerned will, by and large, be those which have traditionally been available to shooting men during open seasons declared under the Game Preservation Act, 1930, but deer will henceforth be included.</P>
    <P>The first part of section 26 provides for the future licensing by the Minister of otter hunting and stag hunting. The remainder of this section relates to hares and deals with the licensing of beagling and hare coursing for short periods outside the open season. I may say that my primary concern, where the hunting of deer, otters and hares is concerned, will be for the conservation of the species, and I am satisfied that the powers sought under sections 25 and 26 will permit the necessary degree of control.</P>
    <P>Section 27 is an attempt to prevent a serious decimation of populations of game species in the rare event of extreme weather conditions (at home or abroad) or other unexpected circumstances such as disease or sudden and acute drop in numbers of certain species.  The extent to which situations of this kind can be counteracted is, unfortunately, limited, but to allow game shooting to continue without interruption in such circumstances would manifestly be contrary not only to the conservation spirit of this Bill but also to all canons of good sporting behaviour.</P>
    <P>As appeals for voluntary restraint may not always elicit the desired total response, a statutory curtailment of open seasons in the circumstances mentioned is envisaged.  Incidentally, this provision will augment the power already available to the Minister for Justice to prohibit, at the request of the Minister for Lands, the use of carriage of firearms in the interests of game preservation, and the exercise <Col N="294" /> of both controls should effectively eliminate any abuse in this sector.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV of Part II of the Bill contains a wide variety of restrictions aimed at protecting wildlife.  Sections 28 and 29, which are complementary, include innovations which will concern everybody who is interested in game shooting&mdash;be they resident or visiting sportsmen.</P>
    <P>The basic objectives of these two sections is to regulate the hunting of game species with firearms by, first of all, defining the categories of persons who may lawfully do so and, secondly, setting up a licensing system for such persons.  The overall approach is based on the premise that anyone who hunts game on land without being the owner&mdash;or having the permission of the owner&mdash;of the shooting rights over that land is, to put it bluntly, poaching.</P>
    <P>My Department have for many years been directly involved&mdash;through the provision of financial support and technical advice&mdash;in a national programme of game development carried out by a network of Regional Game Councils.  The extent to which poaching can frustrate the joint effort put into this programme by the State and voluntary organisations is not difficult to understand and preventive action is obviously desirable.</P>
    <P>This is the general background to section 28 which seeks to define the various categories of persons who will in future be eligible for licences to hunt game.  The main criterion for eligibility will be ownership of game rights or authorisation by such owners. I think the range of qualified persons, as set out in section 28, includes everybody who can genuinely claim to have an entitlement to a hunting licence.</P>
    <P>Section 29 introduces a novel concept for this country, namely, a licence to hunt game with firearms&mdash;or, as it is better known, a game licence&mdash; as distinct from a firearm certificate. Thus, it is proposed to differentiate between the actual possession of a firearm and its use for game shooting.</P>
    <P>Under section 29 anybody wishing to shoot game in this country in future must apply for a game licence <Col N="295" /> and, in the process, he will be required to make a declaration of his qualification within the ambit of section 28.  The visiting sportsman who intends to shoot game species&mdash; whether wild birds or wild animals&mdash; must first seek and obtain a licence from the Minister for Lands.</P>
    <P>The resident sportsman who wishes to shoot game animals other than hares must follow a similar procedure, but where his interest is confined to game birds and hares he will, as at present, be able to get his firearm certificate from the Garda Síochána but with this difference: it will carry an endorsement deeming the certificate to be a licence to hunt game birds and hares, that is, those species which have traditionally been regarded as game species.  Under this procedure the resident sportsman will not have to make separate applications for the firearms certificate and the game licence.  Apart from facilitating the resident sportsman, this system will make for ease of administration. The foregoing disposes of the basic objective of section 29 but there are a few other elements in it which I should mention.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (7) a person aggrieved by the refusal of the Minister to grant or renew a game licence under subsections (1) and (2) will have an opportunity to appeal to the District Court.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) is aimed at making game licences&mdash;whether issued by the Minister for Lands or by the Garda &mdash;co-terminous, and this should go far towards eliminating a longstanding grievance on the part of organised resident sporstmen.  Very simply, their complaint is that the firearm certificates granted to them expire on 31st July each year, irrespective of the date of issue, whereas firearm certificates issued to non-residents run for 12 months from the date of issue, thereby making it possible for them to shoot through part of two open seasons.  The proposed uniformity in subsection (4) will bring about a desirable adjustment.</P>
    <P>In the recent past my Department and Bord Fáilte have been jointly endeavouring <Col N="296" /> to bring about a measure of control in the sphere of game shooting by visitors primarily to eliminate the objectionable, indiscriminate shooting engaged in by some visiting parties&mdash;sometimes, indeed, with a degree of connivance by certain local interests.  As an interim measure, arrangements were made with effect from 1st April, 1975, whereby, in agreement with the Department of Justice, all firearm certificates relating to visitors' shotguns are being issued by my Department as agent of the Minister for Justice.  Under the new procedure such certificates are issued only to those applicants who can show that they have made advance <i>bona fide</i> arrangements for their shooting holiday in Ireland.  The provisions of sections 28 and 29 of the Bill reflect, in so far as visiting game shooters are concerned, a further strengthening of this control.</P>
    <P>Section 30 is designed to control hunting on State foreshore and inland lakes and lakeshore accretions which vest in the State.  Some of these areas are frequently subjected to intense and indiscriminate shooting pressure, with serious detrimental effects on wildlife and valuable habitats.  In future, only persons who have obtained permission from the Minister will be allowed to hunt over such places.  Sometimes there is a doubt as to whether or not inland lakes are vested in the State but under a later provision of the Bill, section 57, machinery is being provided which will help to remove that doubt in certain instances.</P>
    <P>Section 31 is concerned with the breeding in captivity of certain wild perching birds.  The business of dealing in exotic species will not be affected by this section&mdash;though a later provision relating to the import of fauna may do so to some extent&mdash;and the intention is to prevent the sale, purchase or possession of species which occur in the wild state in Ireland or adjacent countries&mdash;apart from the pest species listed in the Third Schedule&mdash; unless the birds have been fitted with a close ring at the fledging stage to show that they were bred in captivity. <Col N="297" /> This will ensure that indigenous adult wild birds, which could well include specimens of rare species, cannot be captured and sold as birds bred and reared in captivity.</P>
    <P>The tagging or marking of wild animals and ringing of wild birds are very important features of wildlife research and should be entrusted only to suitably-qualified people.  Under section 32 only persons who obtain a licence from the Minister will be authorised to capture wild birds and wild animals for ringing or marking or to possess the nets used for those purposes.</P>
    <P>The next group of sections, that is, sections 33 to 38, inclusive, provide a number of restrictions and controls aimed at the adoption of proper hunting practices.  For the most part, however, the proposals represent an updating of corresponding provisions in legislation which is being superseded by the present measure and I do not propose to deal with them in any detail.</P>
    <P>Under section 33, the use of firearms, and so on, which cause excessive and inhumane wounding and killing of wild fauna is restricted.  The section will also enable the type and calibre of firearms and ammunition most suitable for shooting different protected species to be prescribed by way of regulations.  The necessity for this is perhaps best illustrated in the case of deer where the use of unsuitable weapons and ammunition and failure to effect a clean kill invariably results in a slow and painful death for the animal.  It is a matter for regret that such incidents, perpetrated by unscrupulous people, have been all too common in the past.</P>
    <P>Section 34 is intended to restrict the use of traps, snares, nets and substances such as birdlime and poisoned or stupefying baits in capturing and killing wild fauna.  There are exemptions to cater for <i>bona fide</i> needs and confined to the use of approved traps or other devices.  I should draw attention to the fact that, with the repeal of section 8 of the Protection of Animals Act, 1965, the use of the gin trap for taking otters&mdash;a species heretofore unprotected&mdash;will no longer be lawful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> Section 35 will impose restrictions on the use of scarecrows, decoys and call of wild birds and mammals as hunting aids.  There is an exemption to meet the needs of research and certain other approved activities carried out under licence.  Some traditional practices in relation to the hunting of wildfowl are also exempted.</P>
    <P>Section 36 restricts the use of power-boats and other mechanically-propelled vehicles in connection with game shooting, birds or mammals. This is an undesirable practice which can give rise to undue disturbance and harassment of fauna.  A special exception is being made in the case of scientific research carried out under licence from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Sections 37 and 38 are controls on hunting by night.  Much of the damage caused to wildlife, especially in the process of poaching, takes place at night and involves the use of lamps, dazzling devices, and so on, to facilitate capturing or killing wild birds or wild animals.  There may be justification for permitting a limited degree of hunting by night in specific instances but these will for the most part be tolerated only under licence from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 39 replaces section 61 of the Forestry Act, 1946, under which the burning of vegetation within a mile of State forestry plantations was controlled. A similar type of control is required in the context of nature reserves and refuges for fauna and, rather than have two separate and, perhaps, complementary statutory controls, the relevant Forestry Act provision is being repealed and replaced by the composite section 39, which not only covers plantations, reserves and refuges but extends to fire damage caused by acts of sheer negligence.  While evidence of such negligence may be difficult to adduce, there have been several cases in the past where such evidence was available but the provisions of the 1946 Act were not adequate to enable a prosecution to be pursued.</P>
    <P>Section 40 is designed to restrict the destruction of vegetation during the breeding and nesting season.  Existing statutory restrictions applied only to game birds.  This has to be extended <Col N="299" /> and in addition it is considered necessary to apply the restrictions over a somewhat longer period of the year. There is, in subsection (2), a liberal list of exemptions to ensure that normal agricultural and other essential operations will not be hampered by the proposed restrictions.</P>
    <P>The final chapter in Part II of the Bill consists of a group of miscellaneous provisions which, while not being quite so specifically oriented towards the conservation and protection of wildlife as those in the previous chapter, are nonetheless individually important.</P>
    <P>In this country the ancient art of falconry is not practised on a scale which warrants control.  However, it is desirable that a comprehensive Bill such as this should contain appropriate provision for later needs.  This is achieved in section 41 which is an enabling power to permit falconry and matters associated with the sport to be regulated should the necessity arise.</P>
    <P>Section 42 is an important provision to meet situations where damage is being done by protected wild birds and wild animals to agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and so on.  I did, in fact, already refer, in the context of sections 22 and 23, to situations of this kind. Section 42, as well as enabling the Minister to take direct action to deal with marauding animals or birds, sets out a procedure whereby an aggrieved owner may deal with the situation himself on permission from the Minister.</P>
    <P>However, the damage being done may sometimes be such as to necessitate immediate remedial action and Deputies will recall that this type of situation is catered for under sections 22 and 23.  Briefly, the approach is that reasonable facilities must be afforded for the elimination of the source of damage, with the conservation element dominating only where the damage is occasioned by rare or threatened species of fauna.</P>
    <P>Section 43 is a proposal aimed at ensuring that certain conservation benefits which will result from the Bill will not be unwittingly diminished by drainage schemes.  The areas concerned will, in the main, comprise wetland habitats of fauna and flora which are <Col N="300" /> set aside as nature reserves and refuges and also lands which become the subject of &ldquo;management agreements&rdquo; under section 18.  The intention is that where the Commissioners of Public Works propose to undertake drainage schemes on lands which include these prime wildlife areas they will consult the Minister for Lands with a view to safeguarding them to the utmost extent practicable.  The section is all the more important when it is realised that the habitats concerned may comprise places of international significance.  The view may well be taken that the powers provided for in section 43 do not go far enough, but I am satisfied that it would be unreasonable to seek more stringent restrictions on the national land drainage programme.</P>
    <P>Section 44 is an important provision relating to trespass on lands in pursuit of wildlife.  While the essential concern is for game species, the section is so drafted as to make trespass in pursuit of any wild bird or wild animal an offence, thereby tying up any possible loophole.  The section is really a further measure&mdash;augmenting section 28&mdash;to combat poaching.</P>
    <P>Particular attention is drawn to subsection (2) which lists the categories of persons who may challenge a trespasser and also to subsection (4) and (7) which deal with prosecutions.  In the latter context, I should point out (a) that this is the only instance under the Bill where the bringing of a prosecution will not be subject to the constraints of section 70 on the prosecution of offence under the Act and (b) that, in any proceedings for an offence under section 44 the onus of proof that the was on land with lawful authority will rest with the defendant.</P>
    <P>I now come to Part III of the Bill. The commercial exploitation of wildlife resources&mdash;both in relation to game and non-game species&mdash; would, if left uncontrolled, quickly tend to frustrate many of the positive conservation proposals enshrined in the Bill.  Such exploitation also has international connotations in terms of imports and exports for which suitable guidelines must be laid down. Part III of the Bill deals with this <Col N="301" /> whole sector&mdash;in so far as wildlife coming within the ambit of the Bill is concerned.</P>
    <P>Sections 45 to 50 provide a system of control over the business of wildlife dealing.  This activity involves the purchase, possession and sale of protected wild birds, and their eggs, and protected wild animals including, of course, game species in both categories.  The Game Preservation Act, 1930, contained certain statutory controls in relation to game species, but more comprehensive measures are now required to conform with the broader provisions of the Bill.  However, the basic control elements of a licensing system and obligation to keep records are being retained.</P>
    <P>Section 45 provides that only a licensed wildlife dealer shall sell, keep for sale, purchase or have in his possession specimens, live or dead, of protected wild fauna&mdash;including their flesh or eggs.  Subsection (3) contains certain exceptions, for example, the sale to a licensed dealer of game species lawfully killed during an open season.  Past experience also points to a need to control the purchase of game by hotels and other catering establishments, and there are special provisions accordingly in subsections (4) and (5).</P>
    <P>Section 46 empowers the Minister to prohibit or suitably control the purchase and sale of any protected species for specified periods where this is desirable in the interests of overall conservation of the species in question.  The section would also enable the Minister to control the various aspects of the business of wildlife dealing by means of comprehensive regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 47 is the statutory basis for the licensing of wildlife dealers with provisions, in subsection (2), for a transitional period after the Bill comes into operation.  The procedure for the granting and renewal of wildlife dealers' licences is set out in section 48.  The intention is that the Minister will issue or renew a licence on foot of a certificate of suitability granted by the district court.  Section 49 deals with revocation <Col N="302" /> of licences on conviction of licence holders of certain offences under the Bill and section 50 empowers the Minister to publish lists of licence holders or of persons whose licences have been revoked.</P>
    <P>Section 51 imposes an obligation on persons who transport protected wild fauna to indicate clearly on the container (a) their names and addresses and (b) the contents.  There is a saver in subsection (4) to cover the transport of game species lawfully taken during an open season.</P>
    <P>Regulations to control the import and export of fauna and flora are foreshadowed in sections 52 and 53 respectively.  The import controls&mdash; which are not confined to species protected under the Bill&mdash;are necessary (a) to preserve the characteristics of native species, (b) to prevent the entry of pest species into this country and (c) to facilitate compliance with the Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.  Ireland has already signed this Convention subject to ratification following the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The export controls&mdash;section 53&mdash; reflect similar existing restrictions on certain game bird exports, with appropriate modification and enlargement to cater for the much broader range of protected species&mdash;including flora &mdash;envisaged under the Bill.  In regard to both imports and exports, the necessary regulations will be made only after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and there are provisions for the granting of licences to meet genuine needs. The final section in Part III, namely section 54, simply sets out the obligation which attaches to persons engaged in the kind of imports and exports which I have just dealt with to comply with any relevant requirements of the Customs Act.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill, in addition to providing for a revised land acquisition procedure, is concerned mainly with the unification and rationalisation of certain services within my Department dealing with forestry, wildlife conservation and allied matters.  It also contains a number of important provisions affecting inland <Col N="303" /> waters and the territorial seas.  The long delays which arise from title clearance in the sales of land to my Department for forestry purposes have, over the years, been a persistent source of criticism and complaint.</P>
    <P>The new acquisition system, contained in section 55, will provide a more expeditious procedure for land acquisition whether the land is destined for afforestation or wildlife conservation purposes or both.  Operation of the section is confined to registered land which forms the bulk of the Minister's land purchase transactions, and I am confident that the new procedure will benefit both the vendors of such land and the Department.</P>
    <P>The details of the section are dealt with at considerable length in the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill and I do not propose to repeat them here.  However, there are a few aspects which I should like to emphasise.</P>
    <P>Firstly, there is no element of compulsion involved.  The entire process is based on a willingness on the part of owners of land to sell their interests to the Minister at an agreed price.  Secondly, there will be a number of conditions to be met by the Minister before he can make a Purchase Order.  Thirdly, there is provision for compensating <i>bona fide</i> late claimants with the possibility of recovering the amount of such compensation from the person who agreed to sell the land in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The effects of the provision in broad outline will be that, where a Purchase Order is made by the Minister it will automatically vest the land in him in fee simple and all estates, trusts, encumbrances, rights and claims, with a few exceptions, affecting the land will attach to the purchase money.  There are appropriate refinements in the procedure to cater for commonage lands.</P>
    <P>Section 56 will enable all land vested in the Minister under the Forestry Acts or under this Bill to be managed and used, as appropriate, for afforestation, wildlife conservation, game <Col N="304" /> development and other kindred purposes. The existing statutory provisions, which are confined to afforestation, would clearly be too restrictive in the context of the broader mandate which the Minister will have henceforth.</P>
    <P>Where some areas of land in the Minister's possession are unsuitable for management or use within that expanded mandate, he will have discretion as to how it should be dealt with.  A practical illustration of this would be where the Minister is obliged to purchase an entire property which includes some land not suitable either for forestry or wildlife purposes.</P>
    <P>I come now to section 57.  When dealing with section 30, I referred to inland waters and outlined the proposed measures to control hunting on these important wildlife habitats.  I also indicated that some further steps were contemplated under section 57 of the Bill aimed at clarifying the position in relation to certain inland waters&mdash;mainly those which are sometimes referred to as State lakes.</P>
    <P>In the case of some inland lakes, property rights are already clearly established but, in other cases, ownership is either believed to have vested in the State&mdash;as successor to the Crown&mdash;or has never been clarified. The potential of such lakes in the sphere of wildlife conservation, for example, as nature reserves or through controlled shooting over them, is such that some machinery is desirable to determine their ownership.</P>
    <P>A mechanism to facilitate this determination is proposed in section 57.  Very briefly, the intention is that the Minister would publish, in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and local newspapers, particulars of lakes and other inland waters the title to which is in doubt, and would require interested persons to lodge, within a specified period, particulars of any claims they wish to put forward.  If no claims are received or if, in relation to <i>bona fide</i> claims, the Minister acquires by agreement the interests of such claimants, he will then be empowered to declare, by order, that the fee simple of the particular lake or inland water <Col N="305" /> belongs to the State.  Where late claims are received and proved, there is provision for compensation.</P>
    <P>It is not intended ordinarily that fishing rights would be included in the invitation of claims and they would, therefore, not normally be comprehended by a declaration order.  However, the section is so drafted as to make it possible, exceptionally, to depart from this general approach, for example, where fish life constitutes a significant element in the establishment of a nature reserve in any lake or inland water concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 58 extends to the territorial seas of the State the kind of restrictions on hunting which would apply to foreshore and inland waters under section 30.  These marine areas are of major interest where the conservation of seabirds, marine mammals, and so on, is concerned, but are liable to unrestricted hunting and disturbance of fauna.  By formally asserting that hunting rights over the territorial seas belong to the State and that hunting over such areas will be subject to the permission of the Minister, appropriate control measures will be feasible.</P>
    <P>Section 59 is an enabling measure authorising the making of regulations governing access to and use by the public of State-owned foreshore, nature reserves and refuges for fauna in the interests of wildlife conservation. The regulations would be the subject of advance consultation with other interests.</P>
    <P>As regards properties held by the Minister, ownership entitles him to allow the public to use these properties for recreational or educational purposes and a statutory provision to this effect is not required.  However, there is a need to provide that breach of any bye-laws and so on made by the Minister in this context will be an offence and liable to an appropriate penalty: this point is provided for in subsection (11).</P>
    <P>Sections 60 and 61 contain further proposals aimed at the unification of services by adapting procedures under the Forestry Acts to parallel activities stemming from the Wildlife Bill.  Section 21 of the Forestry Act, 1946, lays down the procedure to be followed <Col N="306" /> where external rights of way are needed for access to lands being used for State afforestation purposes.  The procedure involves an application by the Minister to the Lay Commissioners of the Land Commission, and the effect of section 60 will be to apply this procedure also to rights of way required in connection with the management of lands acquired for purposes of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Similarily, section 61 is designed to adapt the relevant provisions of the Forestry Act, 1946, to the needs of the Bill in so far as the extinguishment of easements affecting acquired lands are concerned.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with the necessary amendment of other legislation arising from some provisions of the Bill.  The Firearms Act, 1925, is a case in point.  The statutory authority for the issue of firearm certificates resides in section 3 of that Act, but the introduction of the concept of a game licence under section 29 of the Bill will result in a changed procedure for issuing firearm certificates in respect of guns used for game shooting. The gist of the amendment of section 3 of the Firearms Act, 1925, contained in section 62 is that, in future, production of a game licence will be a pre-requisite to the issue of a firearm certificate for a gun intended to be used by (a) a resident sportsman who wishes to hunt certain mammal species, and (b) a visitor to the State who wishes to hunt any type of game.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt in section 29 with the case of the resident sportsman who wishes to shoot only game birds and hares.</P>
    <P>Amendments of the Firearms Act, 1964, which are set out in section 65 reflect, in the main, the need to adapt certain sections of that Act which relate to existing game species to the broader concept of protected species under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 63 contains further provisions aimed at unifying certain powers and procedures relating to State afforestation and wildlife conservation by adapting appropriate sections of the Forestry Act, 1946, to the needs of the Bill.  These may be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) will apply the Minister's <Col N="307" /> powers in section 9 of the 1946 Act&mdash;relating to purchase, sale and exchange of land and so on for afforestation purposes&mdash;to his corresponding functions in the sphere of wildlife conservation.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) is merely a modification of the general procedure relating to the creation of rights of way&mdash;which I already explained when commenting on section 60 a few minutes ago&mdash;in order to permit public user of rights of way.</P>
    <P>Subsections (3) and (4) will apply the Minister's existing compulsory land acquisition powers in the afforestation sector to land required for wildlife conservation purposes.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) seeks to amend section 58 of the Forestry Act, 1946 to provide that, in future, vermin in the context of that Act will consist of all species of wild animals and wild birds which are not given protection under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 64 envisages a slight amendment of the State Property Act, 1954. In the First Schedule to that Act, properties vested in the Minister for Lands under the Forestry Acts are excluded from the operation of certain sections of the Act.  The intention in section 64 is simply to extend this exclusion to lands which will vest in the Minister under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 66 is to amend the Registration of Title Act, 1964, so as to add to the list of items to be registered as burdens on the relevant folios management agreements&mdash;under section 18 of the Bill&mdash;which are binding on successors in title.</P>
    <P>The sale of animals as pets is already regulated under Part V of the Protection of Animals Act, 1965.  Such animals are likely to be largely, but not exclusively, in the domestic category. However, the Bill&mdash;notably in section 45&mdash;also restricts the sale of certain wild fauna and it is necessary to avoid overlapping between the two statutes; the proposed modification of the 1965 Act in section 67 of the Bill will meet the situation.</P>
    <P>The final Part of this long Bill, that is, Part VI, incorporates a group of diverse but essential provisions under the general heading of &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> Section 68 is concerned with the inspection of land by authorised officers of the Minister for various purposes, the basic feature being that such inspections would be carried out only with the consent of the owner or occupier.</P>
    <P>Section 69 is a general composite provision designed to make it quite clear that a variety of practices&mdash;such as aiding and abetting the commission of offences, giving false or misleading information, failure to comply with regulations and declarations, and so on &mdash;will, in themselves, constitute offences under the Bill and attach appropriate penalties.</P>
    <P>The position as regards prosecution of offences is provided for in section 70.  The right of the Minister to prosecute offences under the Bill is set out in subsection (1).  The Garda Síochána will, of course, have the same authority to prosecute under the Bill when it becomes law as they have under legislation generally.  In so far as persons other than the Minister or the Garda are concerned, however, subsection (2) will&mdash;subject to the special provisions in section 44 relating to trespass in pursuit of game&mdash;enable them to bring prosecutions with the consent of the Minister or his nominated officer not below the rank of Assistant Secretary.</P>
    <P>Section 71 is a technical provision designed to eliminate the waste of official time which would result if Departmental officers had to attend court in order to prove that an open season order or a licence or permission was not in force when an alleged offence was committed or that the act which is the subject of the proceedings was not the result of any other lawful act.  The existence or otherwise of a Ministerial Order declaring an open season will be a simple matter to establish.  The nub of the section is that the onus will be on the defendant to prove that he was in possession of a valid licence or permission when the alleged offence was committed or that the act complained of was merely the incidental outcome of an otherwise lawful act.</P>
    <P>I come now to the enforcement provisions of the Bill, and in this context <Col N="309" /> the overall picture can best be got by reading sections 72 and 73 together.  In formulating proposals of this kind due regard must be had to the realities of the situation in two important respects, namely, the scope of the enforcement agency and the extent of the powers which are to be given to it.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that much of the benefit of the Bill could be lost unless suitable enforcement measures are provided; at the same time, the establishment of a comprehensive wardening service to police a Bill whose writ extends to the entire State and its territorial waters would be so costly that one has to settle for a less ambitious system.  For practical purposes, enforcement of the Bill&mdash;apart from Garda Síochána involvement&mdash; will rest with authorised persons appointed by the Minister.  Such persons can be appointed from within the Forest and Wildlife Service but I would like to think that suitable candidates would, if necessary, be forthcoming from the ranks of voluntary organisations directly concerned in wildlife conservation, game development, and so on, in order to augment full-time personnel.</P>
    <P>The proposals in sections 72 and 73 reflect, in my view, a reasonable and realistic balance between all the relevant factors in providing the framework of an enforcement agency which can be built on and expended according as resources permit and the needs of a particular situation dictate.  The actual powers to be vested in authorised persons under section 72 relate to such matters as entry, search, inspection and detention of items of evidence.  Searches of persons will not be permitted and searches of premises may be made only under search warrants obtained in accordance with section 73.</P>
    <P>Section 74 sets out the various financial penalties which will attach to offences committed under the Bill.  The normal penalties are contained in subsection (1).  Subsection (2) provides for special penalties in respect of offences committed in nature reserves or refuges for fauna and subsections (3) and (4) provide for similar special penalties for offences relating to endangered species <Col N="310" /> of fauna and flora.  In case some Deputies may regard these penalties as unduly severe, let me remind the House that payment of several hundred pounds for such items as an outstanding specimen deer trophy or for the egg of a rare species of wild bird is not unknown.</P>
    <P>Further penalties of a non-monetary kind are contained in sections 75 and 76.  Section 75 would enable the courts to revoke a game licence and disqualify a licence holder, but there is a safeguard whereby the holder may retain a shotgun, under limited firearm certificate, for vermin destruction.  The various items which are liable to be forfeited and disposed of following convictions for offences under the Bill are set out in section 76, but before a court orders an item to be forfeited the owner or other interested person will be given a suitable opportunity to make his case.</P>
    <P>Sections 77 and 78 are concerned with items seized and detained as evidence by the Garda or authorised persons.  Section 77 will afford an aggrieved person a right of appeal to the District Court and an entitlement, where his appeal succeeds, not only to the return of the seized items but also to appropriate compensation.</P>
    <P>In some instances it may be unnecessary or undesirable to retain seized items until the subsequent court proceedings take place.  This necessitates a suitable statutory provision regarding their disposal and this is contained in section 78.  Where articles such as documents, weapons, traps and so forth, are concerned, the written consent of the owner thereof will, under subsection (1), be a prerequisite to their disposal.  In many cases, however, the thing seized will likely consist of a specimen or specimens of dead fauna, for example game unlawfully taken, and to meet such situations the more elaborate procedure in subsections (2) to (8) is necessary.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the end of the individual sections of the Bill.  There are five Schedules and as I have already referred to these, as appropriate, in the course of this statement, only a further brief mention of each need be made at this stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> The First Schedule lists the enactments proposed for repeal.  These are, for the most part, very antiquated laws and I think nobody will be sorry to see them removed from the statute book.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule contains the various provisions affecting any boards which may be established under section 14.  However, as I indicated earlier, that section is primarily an enabling measure to meet possible future needs and no immediate proposals arising from it are envisaged.</P>
    <P>The Third Schedule, relating to wild birds, contains what might be called the black-listed category, that is well-known and numerous pests species for which the conservation measures of the Bill are not at present deemed necessary.  All other wild birds will be protected under the Bill.  On the other hand, the Fifth Schedule, relating to wild animals, specifically sets out the species of wild animals, other than birds, that is certain land mammals, marine mammals and amphibians, which are to be given protection; therefore, the provisions of the Bill do not extend to other wild animal species.  As I made clear earlier, however, it will be possible to add to or take from both Schedules as and when circumstances require.</P>
    <P>The Fourth Schedule lists species of fauna&mdash;wild birds and wild animals &mdash;which as of now are regarded as falling within the rare or threatened categories and requiring the greatest degree of protection.  This list also is capable of variation should the need arise.</P>
    <P>That concludes my outline of the main objectives of the Bill and the various proposals for their realisation. I am sorry that this introductory address has taken up so much time of the House but, in the context of such a long and complex piece of legislation, I was anxious to give Deputies a full picture of the proposals.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the Bill now before the House provides a sound basic framework for the conservation of wildlife in Ireland for the foreseeable <Col N="312" /> future.  I may say that its provisions reflect in many instances the outcome of worth-while and constructive discussions&mdash;which I had invited&mdash; between various interested voluntary organisations involved in game and wildlife conservation and officials of my Department.  The Bill has also benefited from the very full debate which took place in the Seanad and to which I referred at the outset.  If, however, the Bill can be improved or embellished further by our deliberations here, then by all means let this be done.</P>
    <P>The Bill can hardly be regarded as controversial in the parliamentary sense of the term and I would hope that, when it has been fully debated by the House, an effective charter for wildlife conservation in this country will emerge.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend the Bill to the House and I shall welcome constructive suggestions from all sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is especially pleasing and satisfying for me as Opposition spokesman to address myself to this Bill on which it can be said there is general agreement, certainly as to the totality of the spirit of the Bill.  On a personal level, it is satisfying for me that this is an area in which I have what I would regard as a vital interest, and in that connection I am hopeful that during the course of the debate, without wanting to be presumptuous, my colleagues and I will be in a position to offer constructive comment not in the traditional fashion of Opposition but rather in what I would hope would be the modern concept of being complementary.</P>
      <P>I do not accuse the Minister, but I want to say in passing that I hope as the debate advances he will see reason for being a little more positive than he was in his ante-penultimate paragraph, the last sentence of which is based on a conditional mood in which he said:</P>
      <P>If, however, the Bill can be improved....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister were himself the author of every word in the Bill he <Col N="313" /> might have started that sentence by saying that he is quite sure that having left this House the Bill will be in a better condition than it was on its arrival.  When referring to the Minister generally, I refer to the many individuals, officials, agencies, institutions, professional and voluntary, who during the years have been involved in the long gestation period of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on what is to me an all too absent occurrence in this House, his acknowledging the contributions made by his immediate predecessors.  I join him in complimenting and thanking our colleagues in the Seanad for the improvements and embellishments the Bill now enjoys having been discussed in that House.  As a matter of interest it might be said that it was an unusual beginning, in the matter of what has been happening over the last few years, that a Bill should come to us from the Seanad.  In that regard it is interesting to note that the original 1930 Acts, the Act for the Protection of Wild Birds and the Game Preservation Act, not alone came from that House but would not have been there at all were it not that in, I think it was, 1927, far-seeing Members of that House initiated the Bills in question.  I refer now directly to the Act for the Protection of Wild Birds but it applies also to the Game Preservation Act.</P>
    <P>When reading the debates for those years it was interesting to note the derision, not alone opposition, encountered by the good gentlemen who realised, even then, the necessity for men to be involved in what I would regard&mdash;and what I regard this Bill as being&mdash;a <i>détente</i> with nature, not a pact or a <i>détente</i> in the manner of the stronger making peace with the weaker but a realisation that, unless that were done, unless measures were taken to protect species of fauna and flora, not alone would they reduce in number and we would have a sad absence of those species but it could lead ultimately to a situation where the actual habitat of man might be threatened&mdash;and here there are references to habitats of birds and animals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> I look on this Bill as referring to the habitat of man.  I am not saying it refers to the structure in which we live, although it does refer to that, to some extent.  Nowadays man spends a considerable amount of time away from that artificial but very necessary habitat.  This is concerned with the environment.  Surely we cannot dismiss the importance of the environment as far as the habitat of man is concerned. I have acknowledged the manner in which the collective wisdom of our colleagues in the Seanad has improved the Bill.  I have to some extent, acknowledged our indebtedness to the Members of the Seanad in the late twenties who had the foresight and the courage to defend their position against what could now be regarded as, a word I do not like using but what to me, in retrospect admittedly, was, to say the least of it, ignorant opposition.</P>

      <P>I propose to dwell to some extent on this aspect of the Bill in referring the measure here to man and his surroundings and to establishing that, while directly the Bill would seem to refer to animals and flowers, it really refers to man.  It refers to his awareness, belatedly perhaps but, again as we say: &ldquo;is fearr deineach na go brá,&rdquo; that unless he takes some stand against the inroads of technology, of what is correctly regarded as materialistic progress, takes issue with those two factors and indeed many others to which I referred, this generation or the next will have, I will not say doubtful, but the terrible recognition in history of having presided over the death of fauna and flora.  I do not want to be associated in any way with that.  In the country generally there is often a misconception as to the position of anyone from the metropolis in relation to matters dealing with nature.  There is a false idea abroad that, when one enters the Pale, there is no longer any interest in or regard for matters which refer <Col N="315" /> to nature.  I was fortunate to have been born in and lived in that area of Dublin which, in my youth, was little more than a village, where wild animals and birds abounded, and from where I retain memories, memories above all others akin to those our poet friend, Wordsworth, told us he retained about a field of daffodils.  In the times in which we live it is difficult to realise that less than 20 years ago within three or four miles of this city it was possible for anybody so disposed to hear the cuckoo and corn-crake and to see in abundance the cowslip, the bluebell and the primrose. All these are now much farther distant from the city.</P>
      <P>I know what has contributed, not to the total elimination but to the erosion that has occurred in my immediate area, and I admit that I, to some extent, have contributed in part to that erosion.  I am the owner of some fields.  In my anxiety to capitalise on the land I accepted the advice of the agricultural officer to remove the hedges and ditches from my land. All this represented, it may be said, a move towards better husbandry and a more intensive use of the land.  I invested in fertiliser and distributed that fertiliser on the land.  I encouraged the earlier growth of grass.  I made silage.  All this has had the effect of removing from the scene the birds and flowers which were there before I became so conscious of the need for making more money from my land. This pattern is reproduced all over the country.</P>
      <P>I can see the Minister's difficulty, therefore, in implementing the many desirable provisions contained in this Bill.  In the area in which I have this land there still remain some pheasants, but that is no thanks to me.  It is thanks to the local game council.  Were it not for the interest they took and the representations they made to me and to others in the area, others with more land at their disposal, the area could not at the moment boast of the wildlife that still exists there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later I hope to convince the Minister of how important it is that he should make clear in this legislation <Col N="316" /> that what is proposed here will not succeed unless we guarantee <i>ab initio</i> that the contribution people are prepared to make will be fully acknowledged and accommodated.  I shall not develop that particular aspect at the moment.  I shall do that when next we come to discuss this measure.  I see in what I have just said the whole basis of the success or failure of this legislation. This refers to man's habitat but its application refers to 19 million acres of land, to the skies above them and to the sea around them.  If we are to implement successfully these provisions we must involve not just the officials in the Department of Lands, not just the members of councils or boards but every citizen, young and old.</P>
    <P>Here, I would ask the Minister to reconsider his reference to education. He said:</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that my reference was not so much to education in the formal sense, with which my Department is not directly concerned, but to the broader field of generating and encouraging a wider understanding and support for nature conservation generally....</P>
    <P>This measure is inextricably bound up with education, formal and informal. There is no restriction on educating the public as to what we are endeavouring to do.  Over the last few years there has been at least a reflex opposition to that which people see happening to their environment.  In the matter of formal education it must be accepted that nothing fascinates a child more than lessons and experiences connected with flora and fauna.  That is an area different from all others, different from language teaching, civics teaching and so on.  It is an area in which the child can convince the adult and those of us who think over it must admit that is the true position.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity of raising here this evening the question <Col N="317" /> of the dispute between the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Irish Post Office Engineering Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It is a dispute that has been in existence for some time although the strike has been in operation only for the past few weeks.  However, the origins of this conflict go back for about two years.</P>
      <P>At the outset I wish to make it clear that I am not in any way endeavouring to jeopardise any negotiations which might take place but we are reaching a serious situation in relation to the telephone service, especially on the south side of the city where many business firms and private subscribers are deprived of this service. One can appreciate the serious effects this situation can have on the social and economic life of the city. Should the Minister think that any of the information at my disposal is not accurate, I should be glad if he would correct me.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are 1,200 people involved in the dispute and that unless some agreement is reached between the two parties, the consequencies will be very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the information available to me it appears that agreement was reached two years ago regarding the provision of proper facilities for the parking of vans at the Walkinstown Road site.  The men had been obliged to park their vans at Greenmount near Harold's Cross but this site was totally unsatisfactory because of the condition of the surface.  However, the promised facilities were not made available.  Consequently, the men's patience became exhausted and they began parking their vans at Parnell Road.  This is a very busy area and at certain times is a clearway so this action on the part of the men caused much congestion.  Fines were issued by the Corporation and some vans were towed away.  The Department instructed the men to park their vans <Col N="318" /> on the open space available there but because they refused to comply with that request a number of them were suspended on 22nd December.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are negotiations in progress aimed at settling the dispute but it might be no harm to remind the House of the regulations under which these people were suspended.  These regulations embrace insubordination as would any regulations concerning discipline.  However, the regulations to which I am referring date back to 1894.  It is obvious that they are totally inadequate for today and are not in line with modern trade union thinking. Section 383 of these regulations is the one embracing insubordination and this section reads that if an officer is guilty of insubordination he must be suspended from duty, that this rule is without exception, that the officer must remain under suspension until such time as he expresses regret and obeys.  The regulation says that in ordinary circumstances he should then be restored to duty and the facts reported without delay.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the views of trade unionists on this especially having regard to the circumstances in which these men were suspended. Had they been suspended for insobriety or for refusing to carry out a genuine order or for misconduct within their branch, I could understand the regulation applying to some extent, but asking people to express regret is too much in this day and age.  I cannot recall any trade union dispute during past years in which any member was asked to comply with such a request.  The outcome of this dispute will hinge to a large extent on this section of the regulations. I realise that any set of regulations must cover misconduct but I would ask the Minister to direct his attention to the proviso regarding the expression of regret and that of obeying. From reading regulations of this kind, which were drafted more than 80 years ago, one can appreciate that they were drawn up before ever there were trade union regulations in existence.</P>
    <P>As we go through the regulations <Col N="319" /> we can see that it is an offence to act as security for a fellow officer in raising a loan.  It is an offence to engage in betting or gambling of any form.  These are the regulations that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are operating under at this time.  The Minister should update them because otherwise he will have many disputes on his hands.  I should like to direct the attention of the Minister to these facts.</P>
    <P>I admit that there could be right on the Minister's side and I am anxious to get his point of view regarding who is responsible on this occasion.  Had the men a genuine grievance for taking instructions from their union to park their vans or not to park them on the open space?  I believe they did what was right at the time, that they had no choice. The Minister and the Department should have made proper provision on the adjacent site which was to be prepared for this section of the post office workers.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will try to get an end to the strike.  If positive steps are not taken it will develop into a far more serious strike and I would regret that. My reason for raising this matter on the Adjournment was to direct the attention of the Minister to these points.  Many business and private people have contacted me with regard to their telephones which are out of operation.  All of us are aware of the recent astronomical increase in charges. People are entitled to the service.  There may be rights and wrongs on both sides and I should like to hear the Minister's views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like it to go out from this short discussion that this party in any way support unofficial strike action but when an unofficial strike action of such dimension takes place it is a matter of concern for all Members, no matter on which side of the House they sit.  The media, no doubt well briefed by the Minister, have suggested to the public that more than 1,000 men are on strike because a couple of men were afraid to get their shoes muddy.  I should like to put it on <Col N="320" /> record that so far as my information and research are concerned nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
      <P>To follow what Deputy Fitzpatrick said, perhaps it is true that the origins of this dispute go back to the Victorian staff relations policy applied by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for several decades, certainly at least since I came into public life.  The personnel relations between the Minister and the workers in his Department are very important because he is the largest employer of workers in the State, whether in the private or the State sector.  I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that he should examine the regulations in order to have them revised completely.</P>
      <P>However, the more immediate reason for the stoppage has its origin in a ministerial decision.  That decision, as Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, was not to proceed with the opening of the depot in Walkinstown Avenue.  It has been opened since the strike took place but that is not sufficient; if it had been opened before the strike took place we would not have this problem.  It was an agreement freely entered into between the unions and the Minister approximately two years ago and was not applied.  The situation was aggravated to a greater extent by the Minister's decision to restrict overtime during the Christmas period.  That might be right because we knew that owing to increased postal charges the volume of business might go down.  However, there were new empty vans at Jones' Road and in other depots throughout the country that could carry out the work these men would do on an overtime basis but which were given out to private contract by the Minister.  That was a decision of the Minister's and he must take full responsibility for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The straw that eventually broke the camel's back was the fact that two days before Christmas the Minister decided to suspend certain men without pay. This happened when the banks were closed and when there was no way for them to get money to look after their families during Christmas.  That eventually led to the situation the Minister now faces.  The suspensions increased to approximately 40 and now more than 1,000 people have downed <Col N="321" /> their tools.  I cannot understand why the executive of the union concerned did not declare this strike official.  I know they do not have a great reserve of funds but I think the evidence will show that the Minister would prefer not to negotiate with this union at all because it is not an officially recognised union so far as his Department are concerned.</P>

      <P>My reason for speaking in the debate is that I live in and represent the Walkinstown area.  It is badly affected by the strike and a number of people in industry have been in touch with me regarding their telephones which are out of order. Walkinstown has been badly hit by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. We have the worst postal delivery service in the country.  Up to last week the people there were still getting their Christmas mail as a result of something that happened in the Department.  Now they are badly hit with regard to their telephone service and quite a number of the people involved are living in the area.  It was a sad day in Irish life when a number of these employees were suspended just before Christmas.  I would ask the Minister to intervene in the matter and to do something about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to express my regret to telephone users in the Dublin area for the inconvenience and hardship that unofficial industrial action taken by some <Col N="322" /> engineering staff in recent weeks, and which is still continuing, has caused them.  That action can bring no benefit to the staff.  Therefore, I hope that the men involved will realise this, will stop their action and return to work.  This is what was asked of them.</P>
      <P>This is an unofficial strike.  It is not, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, a dispute between the Irish Post Office Engineering Union and the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The executive of the union are opposed to the strike and that distinction should have been clearly drawn by the Fianna Fáil spokesman on this subject but it was not drawn by him.  Nor is it true, as Deputy Lemass said that the Irish Post Office Engineering Union is not a recognised union.  It is a recognised union.  This is an unofficial strike by members of a recognised union.  Newspaper reports have made it clear that it was called against the instructions of the union's national executive who had earlier instructed the branches concerned that this illegal parking should cease.  I do not think anyone on the benches over there referred to the parking as illegal, which it was.  The union has been defied on both occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these difficult times which we are passing through it is essential for orderly negotiations that the elected executive bodies of unions should not have their authority undermined.  This is of urgent importance now but it has always been of importance.  Had Deputy Fitzpatrick consulted those members of his party, who were Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs before me, they could have told him that they, too, had to take a firm stand on this issue and under these very regulations which they maintained and which he now seeks to undermine.  None of them is now in the House and I can see the reason why.  The reason is that Deputy Fitzpatrick has made a rather serious mistake.  They could have told him if he had asked them that a quick way to industrial anarchy lies in encouraging unofficial strikes, particularly in <Col N="323" /> essential industries like telecommunications. They could also have told him that my party in the past never yielded to the temptation, which it is, of making political capital out of such strikes. The Labour Party in and out of office have consistently opposed the unofficial strike which undermines the real interests of workers just as it causes great inconvenience to the public and often to the men who are so misguided as to take that action.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick and other Fianna Fáil speakers have stressed the inconvenience&mdash;it is a very real one and is in danger of growing&mdash; which has been caused to the public by this action.  I ask them to realise that the effect of their intervention here and of their repeating the arguments of these unofficial strikers, who are acting against their union, can only be to encourage the men in the misguided pursuit of this strike.  They will say: &ldquo;Public opinion is on our side.  The biggest party in this country are on our side.  If we keep it up we will win&rdquo;.  If they do that is an illusion in which they will have been encouraged because any of my predecessors could have informed the Fianna Fáil Deputies who spoke today, that the Department cannot and will not capitulate to this kind of action and, therefore, if this strike continues, no capitulation will follow. The inconvenience will have been drawn out.</P>
    <P>The Department cannot capitulate because that means destroying all discipline in the public service and, therefore, all efficiency and it would mean much more serious and prolonged inconvenience to the public. The Department have always recognised this, irrespective of who was Minister.  I am sorry to say that it is deplorable&mdash;I respect Deputy Fitzpatrick but he has made a serious error on this occasion&mdash;that the shadow Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has failed to recognise this and is thereby encouraging an unofficial strike.  It may be that one day the shadow Minister will become Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and if he does he will be very sorry <Col N="324" /> that he is on record as speaking as he has in this debate as the mouthpiece for unofficial strikes.</P>
    <P>I would now like to describe the events leading to the suspensions which have taken place.  About two years ago the Department bought a property consisting of a factory building and a large parking area in Walkinstown for use as an additional engineering depot on the south side of the city to provide for staff accommodation and for the parking of departmental vehicles.  The intention was that a number of outdoor staff headquartered at the existing depot at Harold's Cross would be transferred to the new depot as soon as certain structural works and improvements were carried out to the former factory building.  In the meantime, the parking area was made available for engineering vans for which there was not adequate space at the Harold's Cross depot.  The depot at Walkinstown was suitable in every respect for parking purposes. It has a hard-surfaced area capable of taking up to 150 vans at a time although space for about 30 is all that is needed at present.</P>
    <P>In May, 1975 local union branch representatives expressed dissatisfaction to local management that the additional accommodation at Walkinstown had not yet been made available and intimated that the staff would resume parking their vans at the Harold's Cross depot.  As the garage there could not house all the vans it was arranged that the overflow would be parked on a vacant site nearby.  The vacant site, although not ideal for parking, was no worse than any parking lots used throughout the city.</P>
    <P>In October, 1975 the local union branch representatives wrote to local management to say that they feared that the vacant site would become unsuitable for parking during the winter. While the local management did not accept that the site would become unsuitable they informed them that if the staff did not wish to park there the Walkinstown depot should be used. The staff continued to use the vacant site up to 24th November.  On that day the staff parked their vehicles on a <Col N="325" /> clearway at Harold's Cross although specifically instructed not to do so. In order to avoid a breach of the parking regulations involved and to reduce inconvenience and risk to the public the Department arranged to bring on some drivers early each morning to remove the vehicles before the clearway regulations became operative but the staff concerned stopped doing so after a few days on the instructions of their union branches.</P>
    <P>During the course of this illegal parking some 100 parking fines were imposed and three vehicles were impounded. Finally, on 22nd December, on a further refusal by the drivers to carry out instructions given to them to park at Walkinstown and not on the clearway, 29 drivers were suspended. The union executive and the local union branches had been warned in advance that such action would have to be taken.  The Department showed a certain amount of patience in this matter.  Two accidents had already occurred involving the vans illegally parked and there was a constant risk of further accidents occurring.  I ask how could the Department allow that to continue?  In related incidents later, 11 members of the staff were suspended when they refused to carry out normal work.</P>
    <P>The parking accommodation provided at Walkinstown has always been suitable for that purpose and it has never been contended by the staff that it is not.  The suitability of the depot for parking purposes was not affected by the structural alterations that were to be carried out in the factory building. These alterations were to enable the depot to be used as a staff headquarters.</P>
    <P>The work required to enable the Walkinstown depot to be used as a staff headquarters was completed recently. It was not possible to complete this work earlier partly because of other commitments and partly because of protracted negotiations about accommodation with various staff groups. The local branch representatives were kept informed of developments in making this accommodation available and they and the headquarters of the union concerned had been clearly told, before <Col N="326" /> the resort to illegal parking, that the accommodation would be available within a few weeks.  The transfer of some staff headquarters from Harold's Cross to Walkinstown and the parking of vehicles at Walkinstown are separate issues.</P>
    <P>Although Deputy Fitzpatrick has made considerable comment on the question of office accommodation at Walkinstown the fact is that when the illegal parking began no mention of this was made.  I regret very much that illegal action and the subsequent deplore any attempt to make political unofficial strike that has arisen and I capital as a result.  To the extent that there may be dissatisfaction about the provision of more office accommodation at Walkinstown then I would hope that the men would realise that such a problem can be resolved through the normal processes of union negotiation on the resumption of work.</P>
    <P>The Community is, as has been said opposite, making large sums of money available for telephone development and in the course of such an expansion, problems and stresses are bound to arise.  They are also arising in every other area of national effort.  There can be no hope of progress except by orderly negotiations and there is need for an understanding by all concerned that the resources of money and men do not exist to enable us to resolve all problems quickly.  In this particular case, I hope that on reconsideration the men who were responsible for organising the very unusual action of parking some 30 vans day after day on a busy clearway, so as to inconvenience and put seriously at risk the public using the road, will realise how ill-advised they were.  Deputies opposite should tell them so.</P>
    <P>The current unofficial strike can only result in loss to the strikers and in serious inconvenience and hardship to telephone users.  It is putting in jeopardy the jobs of other workers and making it that much more difficult to get on with the economic recovery so urgently needed.  While the strikers may feel that in a State industry their jobs are likely to be safe they should take into account that their action may put other people in <Col N="327" /> less secure employment out of jobs altogether.  Please do not encourage this unofficial strike.</P>
