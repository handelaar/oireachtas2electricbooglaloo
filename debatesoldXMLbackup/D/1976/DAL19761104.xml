      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill sets out to correct a serious omission in our statute law in respect of the individual's right to fair treatment by his employer in circumstances where the employer either contemplates or has decided that he should be dismissed.  As the law stands, the employer could proceed to implement dismissal in circumstances where the culpability of the individual worker need not be soundly based.  The employees recourse up to now against the unjust dismissal lay only through action in the courts in which he would risk all the personal affront entailed by the law's delay.  This omission in our industrial legislation has resulted in a number of dismissals occurring in which individual employees often with many years of service in enterprise to their credit lost their employment without due cause.  Arguments about the rights and wrongs of such decisions leading to dismissals have led to costly strikes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that we must limit the area of arbitrary behaviour in industrial relations from whatever side it emanates.  In its place we must institute codes of behaviour jointly obeyed by both sides in an enterprise <Col N="1076" /> so that those who direct and those who implement will be guided by criteria based on justice and rationality. I am convinced that the adoption of such an approach will not jeopardise the efficiency of any business concern.</P>
    <P>As the law stands, the employer has the absolute legal right to hire and fire at his discretion.  He must, of course, give the requisite notice as required under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, which provides for periods of minimum notice based on service.  In practice, what has happened when an employee has felt aggrieved by the manner of his dismissal is that he sought the support of his fellow employees. Because no accepted procedures governing discipline in general existed, disputes have occurred in firms where large numbers of workers were drawn into disputes which primarily concerned an individual or individuals because of their conviction that an injustice had occurred.  The probability of this consequence followed because the law was silent on the matter.  Because of the law's silence the crude weapon of strike action was resorted to.  Despite the best efforts of both the rights commissioners and the Labour Court disputes occurred affecting large numbers of people. These disputes owe their origin to the individual sense of unfair treatment in the matter of his dismissal.</P>
    <P>The incidence of disputes relating to dismissals involves enormous social and economic costs to the individual, his fellow employees and the economy generally.  In the years 1972 to 1975 there were 187 recorded disputes classified as relating to &ldquo;engagement or dismissal, redundancies, etc.&rdquo; in which 26,299 people were involved. These disputes alone accounted for over a quarter of a million man-days lost in industry.  During last year over one-third of all man-days lost, that is 116,000 man-days, were due to these reasons.  I do not suggest that all such disputes will be eliminated by the passing of this legislation but I would hope that the necessity to engage in industrial action will be lessened.  To that extent the Bill will be of benefit to both sides of industry by helping <Col N="1077" /> to remove dismissal cases as a significant factor in industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>The provision of this legislation will apply to employees in all occupational categories, manual, white collar and technical employees at all levels from the shop floor to the managing director.  In all about three-quarters of a million employees will be covered.</P>
    <P>I have said that my objective is to limit the area of arbitrary behaviour in industrial relations.  The Bill lists in detail criteria for unfair dismissals and sets down the forms of redress and the methods of adjudication on claims.  The basic proposal of the Bill is that the dismissal of an employee will be regarded as unfair unless the employer can show grounds which justify the dismissal.  In order to clarify this basic prescription and to make it easier for employees, employers and the adjudicating bodies to fulfil the spirit of the legislation, I have listed the criteria in relation to dismissals.</P>
    <P>It will be unfair to dismiss an employee because of trade union membership or trade union activities either outside his hours of work or at times during work hours which are agreed by the employer.  Dismissal will also be unfair if it arises from the religious or political opinions of the employee; civil proceedings against the employer which involve the employee as a party or witness; criminal proceedings against the employer which involve the employee as a complainant or witness; and the race or colour of the employee.  In addition, where pregnancy is the sole reason for dismissal it will be unfair.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that it will be for the employer to demonstrate that the dismissal was justified and he must show that it resulted from one or more of the following or some other substantial grounds justifying the dismissal:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the employee's capability, competence or qualifications for the work he was employed to do,</P>
    <P>&mdash;his conduct,</P>
    <P>&mdash;redundancy, or</P>
    <P>&mdash;if his employment in his particular <Col N="1078" /> job contravened statutory requirements.</P>
    <P>An unfairly dismissed employee will, therefore, be entitled to re-engagement in his old job or in a suitable alternative job and the alternative form of redress to re-engagement will be an award of compensation within a maximum of two years' pay.</P>
    <P>This redress available in the Bill should act as a deterrent by encouraging employers to think seriously before dismissing a worker&mdash; in fact, to ensure that dismissal is a last resort which must be shown to be fully justified.  It is in this context that we can be reasonably sure that this legislation will help in reducing the number of instant dismissals&mdash;bearing in mind that at present industrial action is often the only practicable resort available to workers in disputed dismissal cases.</P>
    <P>The adjudication process envisages three possible stages, involving hearings before a rights commissioner, an Employment Appeals Tribunal, and a final appeal to the Circuit Court. This provides an effective system under which disputes about dismissals would be investigated with a minimum of formality and expense.</P>
    <P>I understand that fears have been expressed in some sections of industry that the Bill is biased against management.  This is not the case. For the vast majority of managements this Bill need not present problems. I want to make it clear that this legislation will not give protection to employees who are clearly incompetent in their work or whose conduct at work is seriously detrimental to the performance of their job.</P>
    <P>I hope that the passing of this Bill will give a further stimulus to the development of agreed disciplinary and dismissal procedures within firms and to their establishment in firms where no such agreed procedures exist. It is accepted by both sides in industry that there should be procedures, with graduated steps and sanctions with due warning, and the dismissal should be the ultimate sanction and applied only in most serious cases.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that in addition to <Col N="1079" /> procedures at the level of the firm there should also be a national code of agreed disciplinary procedures relating to dismissals.  On the enactment of the Bill it is my intention to initiate discussions with representatives of trade unions and employers with a view to agreeing such a national code.  This national code should suggest alternatives to dismissal and agree on a graduated scale of sanctions such as reprimands and suspensions, commensurate with perceived shortcomings. The code should also give guidance on appropriate appeals machinery within the firm.  The main purpose of this code would consist in the achievement of agreement on both sides on necessary steps in grievance procedure.</P>
    <P>There are limited exceptions in section 2 in respect of a few categories of workers.  These relate mainly to employees at retiring age, close relatives, persons being trained by AnCO and to persons in public sector employment, many of whom have the benefit of dismissal procedures under other legislation.  I am taking power to bring excluded groups within the scope of the legislation if this appears to be desirable at a future time.  Section 2 also sets a qualifying period of one year's service with the employer concerned before the Act will apply. I have included an exception to this qualifying service requirement so that a woman dismissed on grounds of pregnancy can appeal even if she has less than 12 months' service.</P>
    <P>I considered that it was desirable to clarify in the Bill the position about the termination of fixed term contracts. Broadly speaking, I have provided in subsection (2) of section 2 that a dismissal which represents the expiry of a fixed time contract cannot be disputed under the terms of the legislation.  In subsection (3) of the same section, I have proposed provisions to make clear the position of employees working abroad.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 3 recognise the special relationship which exists when an employee is on probation or training and the accepted concept that he has to prove his worth <Col N="1080" /> during a trial period.  In specifying that the Act will not apply to such a dismissal, I have provided the safeguards that the contract of employment must be in writing and the duration of probation or training must be two years or less and be specified in the contract. Having regard to the rigorous training and tests which must apply for qualification as nurses or for para-medical employment, provision is also made whereby the Act will not apply to a dismissal during the initial training period.</P>
    <P>Section 4 continues a concept enshrined in other legislation whereby employers who take on more employees than they require for training as apprentices will not face the possibility of unfair dismissal claims if the worker is dismissed within six months after the apprenticeship begins or within one month of the completion of the apprenticeship.  In making this provision, I am anxious not to undermine the practice of some large organisations which take on more apprentices than they would need for their own requirements.  These firms are performing a useful function for the benefit of the whole community.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with dismissals by way of lock-out or for taking part in a strike or other industrial action. I have provided that dismissal by way of lock-out will not be unfair if the employee is offered re-engagement on resumption of work.  In the case of strikes or other industrial action, I felt that some protection against victimisation was necessary for employees. In the return-to-work situation, there must be equal treatment for all participants.  I have provided that if an individual is picked out for dismissal or if he is not offered his job back along with his colleagues he can claim unfair dismissal.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the criteria for unfair dismissal.  As I mentioned earlier, it will be unfair to dismiss an employee because of his trade union activities, his religious or political opinions, his failure to be a member of a trade union, unless membership was a prior condition for entering the particular employment; civil or criminal proceedings against the employer <Col N="1081" /> which involve the employee and the race or colour of the employee.</P>
    <P>I am providing that dismissal will be unfair subject to certain conditions if it results from the pregnancy of the employee.  The qualifying limitation of one year's service does not apply to this particular provision.  This right is qualified to the extent that dismissal of a pregnant employee is unfair unless she was unable by reason of pregnancy to do her work or her being at work contravened some other legal requirement and the employer could not offer her another suitable vacancy or she refused an offer of suitable alternative employment.</P>
    <P>I have provided also in section 6 that unfair selection for redundancy shall be regarded as unfair dismissal. I consider that this provision is very necessary to guard against victimisation of individual workers for other motives in a redundancy situation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides finally that it will be for the employer to demonstrate that the dismissal was justified and he must show that it resulted either from one or more of the following matters to which I referred earlier or from some other substantial grounds justifying the dismissal:</P>
    <P>(a)  the employee's capability, competence or qualifications for the work he was employed to do,</P>
    <P>(b)  his conduct,</P>
    <P>(c)  redundancy, or</P>
    <P>(d)  if his employment in his particular job contravened another legal requirement.</P>
    <P>I have provided in section 7 that if a dismissal is deemed unfair the employee is entitled to re-engagement in his old job or in a suitable alternative position and the re-engagement can be on the basis that continuity of employment is preserved.  The alternative to re-engagement is an award of compensation, subject to a maximum of 104 weeks' pay.  In determining the level of compensation account must be taken of the extent to which the employer or employee was responsible and of other guidelines, including the extent to which <Col N="1082" /> the employer or employee abided by negotiated dismissal arrangements or complied with the code of practice relating to dismissal procedures approved by me and to which I referred earlier.  Further recognition of negotiated dismissal procedures is given in section 14, to which I will refer later.  I am taking specific power in section 7 to approve a general code of practice relating to dismissal procedures which could be a guideline to all employers and employees.</P>
    <P>In sections 8 to 10, inclusive, I set out the proposals for adjudication on claims of unfair dismissal.  While these may seem a little complicated, I intend to produce literature when the Bill becomes law which will leave employees and employers in no doubt about the procedures they should follow.  I will ensure that the information literature will receive the widest possible circulation. The adjudication process envisages three possible stages, involving a rights commissioner, the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal, which is being renamed the Employment Appeals Tribunal under section 18, and a final appeal to the civil courts.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will know, the rights commissioners service operates on a voluntary basis under the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, in areas of dispute which are not connected with pay or general employment conditions. The Redundancy Appeals Tribunal deal at present with minimum notice and redundancy dismissal disputes and my decision to assign unfair dismissal cases to the tribunal achieves a unity of subject matter relating to dismissals for adjudication purposes.  I feel that the tribunal are the appropriate forum if dismissal disputes are to be removed from the area of industrial disputes. The third stage of final appeal to the civil courts is necessary in order to integrate the proposals with the existing legal system.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides therefore that a claim for redress for unfair dismissal must be initiated by an employee within six months of dismissal by giving a written notice to a rights commissioner&mdash;or to the tribunal if the <Col N="1083" /> employee objects to a hearing by a rights commissioner.  Either party may object to a claim being heard by a rights commissioner.  In cases which come before him, however, the rights commissioner will make a recommendation in relation to a claim.  If that recommendation is not carried out the employee may bring his claim to the tribunal which will make a determination in relation to the claim.  I should mention here that there is separate provision in section 9 enabling either an employee or an employer to appeal to the tribunal against the terms of a recommendation of a rights commissioner within six weeks of the date of the recommendation.  The tribunal will make determinations on all claims which come before it.</P>
    <P>Section 10 introduces the third stage in the adjudication process, whereby if an employer fails within six weeks to carry out a determination of the tribunal, the Minister may institute Circuit Court proceedings on behalf of the employee for the remedies provided in the Act.  The Minister will pay any costs imposed on him by the court.  This section also provides that either an employee or an employer can on their own initiative appeal to the Circuit Court against the terms of a determination of the tribunal but in these cases the Minister would not be liable to pay costs.</P>
    <P>On the question of costs, I should like to stress that other than any travel or subsistence costs which may arise no costs necessarily arise for either the employer or employee in the first two stages of the adjudication process. It is open to either the employer or the employee, at their own cost, to be legally or otherwise represented before the tribunal but it is not necessary and in fact, a very limited number of cases now coming before the tribunal involve legal representation.  As I have said earlier, the only case under this Bill in which the State can bear an employee's legal expenses will be when an employer fails to carry out a determination of the tribunal; the Minister then takes the case to the civil courts on the employee's behalf and the courts might award costs against the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> Section 11 is a standard provision to facilitate the service of documents on corporate and unincorporated bodies in connection with proceedings under the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 12 accords priority status to compensation payable under the legislation in the winding up of companies or in bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>Section 13 contains the standard provisions which prevent employers from avoiding the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>In section 14, I give special recognition to the existence of negotiated dismissal agreements and require employers to give written details of such dismissal procedures to employees within 28 days of taking up employment. Similarly, any alteration in these procedures must also be notified in writing within a 28 day period.  These requirements will, of course, be satisfied if the procedures are incorporated, for instance, in a staff manual which is handed to each worker immediately on taking up employment.  I am also providing in this section, that where an employee is dismissed, the employer must, if he is requested to do so, give written particulars of the grounds for the dismissal to the employee within a 14 day period.  There is a qualification to this in that any other substantial grounds, which would have justified the dismissal, may be taken into account by the adjudicating bodies when considering claims under this legislation.</P>
    <P>At present the only legal recourse available to a dismissed employee is a common law action for wrongful dismissal. That right of action is preserved under section 15.  In making available the simple and effective system of adjudication and redress under the Bill and in committing taxpayers' money to their operation, I consider that the employee can reasonably be required to choose between a common law action or a claim under this legislation.  I have provided for such choice in this section.</P>
    <P>I am taking power in section 16, subject to affirmative resolution of each House of the Oireachtas to amend certain provisions of the legislation, such as the extension of the <Col N="1085" /> Act to any of those people excluded under section 2, variation of the maximum amount of compensation of two years' pay and amendment of the Act so as to comply with any international obligations in relation to dismissals which the State decides to assume.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to its passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the life of this Dáil we have had numbers of anti-discrimination Bills introduced, some were passed and others are at various stages and now we have the Anti-Discrimination (Unfair Dismissals) Bill on Second Stage this morning. Already on the Dáil Order Paper we have the 1975 Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill, 1975, introduced a year ago at First Stage and never advanced beyond that.  One would be inclined to ask when we could expect to have the Second Stage.  The other anti-discrimination Bill on the Order Paper is the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) (Amendment) Bill, 1976 and in view of the European decision at that time that knocked the procedure for the passage of that Bill, when the man that we are now pleased to have nominated as our President, pointed out the contradiction between any amendment here and European legislation, one must ask what is the reason for that anti-discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Anti-Discrimination (Unfair Dismissals) Bill, 1976 is before the House this morning.  In my opinion any Bill that would help towards improving industrial relations, protecting the individual rights of people and the establishment of a code of practice would be a step in the right direction.  I have very serious reservations on many sections of this Bill and on Committee Stage we will be proposing amendments in an effort to tidy up what we consider to be legislation that could have done with more thorough investigation and more detailed examination.  I am a little concerned that a surfeit of legislation might be a disincentive to employment. This has been commented on by many trade union people who are concerned at present about our high <Col N="1086" /> unemployment figures and about any disincentives that may be created.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, I believe this type of Bill is necessary but the Minister must realise that we can never hope to legislate ideally for good industrial relations. In the past industrial disputes have taken place over trivial issues.  All that the Minister hopes, and I support him in those hopes, is that some of the sections in this measure will contribute towards a reduction of man-days lost. I make the point&mdash;I made it many times before in relation to other legislation&mdash;that a Bill of this nature which is aimed at protecting the rights of workers should be phrased in as simple language as possible.  The Bill at present is not phrased in simple language. I do not want to see this Bill become a bonanza for the legal profession. This would probably mean a complete change of existing procedures in Bill draftsmanship for the Minister but any worker should be able to satisfy himself as to his or her rights under this Bill.  The terminology at times is confusing and sometimes even contradictory.  The ideal situation is that nobody should ever be unfairly dismissed.</P>
    <P>It could be said that any limitations or exclusions in this Bill would imply that we in this House are giving certain freedoms of dismissal. Human nature being what it is, human frailty being what it is, an ideal situation does not exist and certain safeguards have to be built in.  One must decide how far to go with some of these safeguards because the employer-employee relationship, the trade union-employer organisation relationship that has existed has, for the most part, been quite a good one. The flexibility of that system has possibly helped it to a great extent.  I am not saying it is perfect&mdash;indeed, it is not&mdash;but what system is ever perfect?  As I said earlier, if there are any areas in which this Bill can be of help, I would be delighted to be of assistance, but one must allow a certain amount of flexibility to continue in that system and not legislate to tie completely the hands of trade unions or employers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> This Bill covers a very wide area. I look forward to the Committee Stage when we will obviously have to thrash it out and get explanations from the Minister on the very many areas of the Bill where one could express doubts.  This morning the Minister said that:</P>
    <P>As the statute law stands the employer has the absolute legal right to hire and fire at his discretion.</P>
    <P>This, of course, is true but has not been practised to too large an extent. Indeed, I would condemn such a practice and the trade union structure has probably provided a safeguard against this practice on too wide a basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>The incidence of disputes relating to dismissals involves enormous social and economic costs to the individual, his fellow employees and the economy generally.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that he omitted the company, or the business, or the industry concerned.  I agree with him to a limited extent, but I would also include the business, or the company, or the industry concerned.  I have always been a firm believer that nobody ever wins in a strike situation. In fact, everybody loses.  I believe that any steps we can take here to encourage or improve industrial relations would be very useful, always bearing in mind that we cannot legislate rigidly for their application.  A substantial degree of flexibility must remain.</P>
    <P>The Minister said three-quarters of a million employees will be covered. I take his word for that.  I presume his statistics are correct.  When one looks at that figure and the many groups excluded under section 2 and other sections, one would be inclined to think the total would be greater than the workforce that we are supposed to have.  I am concerned about one matter.  I do not want it to be taken that I am supporting a situation which exists in reality.  I am talking about the small employer, the farmer, or the small shopkeeper.  Assuming he gets into financial difficulty and he can no longer keep on his employees, or perhaps his business or <Col N="1088" /> farm is running down, what is his position under the Bill?  Can he be safeguarded in some way?  Naturally he would not be in a position to meet the 104 weeks' pay provision.  I am not referring to any person who may be exploiting young people.  A Bill dealing with the protection of young persons' employment has been hanging around the two Houses since about 1974 and it still has not become law. I am talking about the genuine person with a little business, or a farmer who may have had one or two employees and who found he was no longer able to retain their services.  I appreciate that the Redundancy Act would cover such persons, but they may not qualify for the lump sum payments suggested in this Bill.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we will have a worth-while and exhaustive discussion on many sections.  I should like to express a few opinions for the Minister's consideration.  We will be submitting amendments for Committee Stage.  Section 2 deals with exclusions. There are quite a few exclusions which one must question very closely.  I am talking broadly about the public service, the Garda, the prison officers, the civil servants, the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the officers of local authorities and the officers of the health boards.  I question why they are excluded.  Under section 16 the Minister may, by order, amend section 2 and include any categories he so wishes.  I fully agree the Minister deserves to have that entitlement.</P>
    <P>I question very many of the exclusions. Why is the public sector excluded?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that sector is covered under existing legislation. Now that we are introducing new legislation to cover unfair dismissals, we should discontinue discrimination or division between public servants and public officials and workers in the private sector.  Local authority exclusions refer only to the officers so it appears employees are included. Why not include the officers?  Why not make it an all-embracing provision where they are concerned? There are other exclusions.  Only a few specified individuals are excluded. <Col N="1089" /> Mainly groups are excluded.  Section 2 (1) (d) refers to the Defence Forces. Possibly Deputy Dowling will have a few words to say about that.  Other Members will have comments to make on the exclusion of the chairman of the Army Pensions Board.  That was one of the most disgraceful acts performed by this Government and I am sorry to see the Minister in this Bill allowing the type of situation which developed in that area a few years ago to continue.  However, I am sure other Deputies on these benches will elaborate on that incident.</P>
    <P>Of course the Garda Síochána are excluded, but I want to come to paragraph (c) of section 2 (1) which refers to the exclusion of relatives.  I see no reason for the all-embracing terms of this exclusion.  I would certainly be prepared to listen to a more confined exclusion of relatives but in a straight line relationship, say, between brother and sister, there have been many unfair dismissals.  I have seen too many hardship cases to accept what is here, but if the Minister would guarantee that there would be a compulsory social welfare scheme available for those people I might be prepared to accept the provision.  It is unjust that, in the case of two brothers one of whom is the boss, the other brother is put out of employment with absolutely no financial entitlement.  I do not believe it is right to exclude such people from the Bill.  As I say, I am prepared to accept the exclusion of some relatives but not the comprehensive exclusion provided for here.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of section 2 (1) refers to the person who is dismissed after less than one year's continuous service with his employer.  One can look at this in a number of ways.  Some people will say the period is too long, others that it is too short.  I would ask if it covers the situation where a firm or small business which employs a person for 20 years is taken over by a new employer?  Is the 20 years' service discounted or will the Redundancy Act cover the situation?  It would appear that there is a breakdown here in regard to continuity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> Under section 6 (2) (g) there is an exclusion relating to pregnancy.  I realise the Minister's reason for having this in the Bill, but is there a danger of discrimination here against the married woman?  It appears to me that under this Bill it would be an unfair dismissal, except in exceptional circumstances, to dismiss a person if, say, two days after she had been employed it was discovered that she was pregnant.  While I see the Minister's dilemma, my concern is that the possibility of pregnancy will discourage people from taking married women into employment.</P>
    <P>In regard to domicile outside the State this can be interpreted very widely, particularly in our context where people may be working in Northern Ireland and living in our own country.  This may need further examination.</P>
    <P>Section 3 seems to exclude people who, in my opinion, should not be excluded.  Subsection (1) reads:</P>
    <P>This Act shall not apply in relation to the dismissal of an employee during a period starting with the commencement of the employment when he is on probation or undergoing training&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Does that mean that probationary teachers or trainee nurses are excluded? I do not think that such people should be excluded for the entire duration of their training from the provisions of this Bill.  It is discriminatory and we shall be putting down amendments in this regard.</P>
    <P>As well as that, if I may return briefly to section 2, vocational teachers appear to be excluded, and I am wondering about the position of secondary teachers in private schools in many areas of the country.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with apprenticeship. I often wonder when Bills come before the House whether adequate research has gone into them.  Are we pushing them out hastily?  Have we the Labour hustings in Limerick in mind in trying to put Bills quickly before the House in order to placate the party faithful, perhaps at the behest of the former general secretary of the Labour Party who would be encouraging <Col N="1091" /> the Minister to do things like that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The apprentice can be dismissed within six months of commencement of training.  If the job has been arranged through AnCO, does that give the employer adequate time to assess the suitability of the apprentice for the employment? Where I think a greater danger exists, especially in the present climate, is that on the other side of the coin, he can be dismissed one month after the completion of apprenticeship.  Despite what the Minister may think at times, there are quite a number of employers with a social conscience.  These people may have one or two apprentices who have finished their time and for whom they have no further work, but having a social conscience they are prepared to say: &ldquo;We will keep you until such time as you get an alternative job.  We will give you a few months to look around.&rdquo;  This Bill will stop that, because the employer who keeps the apprentice on after one month is faced with the unfair dismissal situation. Human nature being what it is, the employer will use the escape from that and dismiss the apprentice within one month.  I think that is an unwise exclusion.</P>
      <P>Section 5 is more related to tidying up that can be done on Committee Stage.  One might consider reinstatement or being re-engaged in a different position which would be reasonably suitable to him.  Has he sole discretion? Who adjudicates on whether the position is reasonably suitable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 deals with unfair dismissal and again it calls for tidying up and being made more specific.  It spells out the circumstances in which an employee is entitled to claim he has been unfairly dismissed.  One cannot complain about that except perhaps in regard to details of wording that can be discussed at a later stage.  Subsection (2) <i>(g)</i> refers to pregnancy and while the terms and language used may be legally and technically correct, it takes a great deal of reading to <Col N="1092" /> understand it.  Subsection (4) refers to dismissals that are not unfair and here the Minister has a good deal to do between now and Committee Stage as regards making matters clear.  It refers to capability and competence but there are no definitions of them. Surely there must be some definition difficult though it may be; otherwise people will be forever arguing as to what competence means and what capability means.  Should &ldquo;qualifications&rdquo; be there?  Surely a person either has or has not the qualifications for a job.  If he is deemed in the first six months to have the qualifications, surely he does not cease to have them suddenly.  I question the wording there.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Conduct&rdquo; also comes into it.  I am sure we could argue here at length as to what was good or bad conduct, whether dismissal was merited because of some specified conduct and so on. This must also be considered in greater detail.  We come then to the question of redress for unfair dismissal and the compensation or re-engagement for a specific period.  I am a little worried about defining a period of two years. One can look at it from two sides. Could a strong employer who wished to dismiss a man avail of the two years' wages provision to rid himself of somebody that he wanted to be rid of?  On the other hand, if it is a case of a highly-paid person, a managing director or somebody like that, perhaps 104 weeks' salary is a very heavy penalty on a firm.  I should prefer a somewhat flexible provision.  While I agree that 104 weeks should be the maximum I think that 104 weeks will become more or less established procedure.  Experience has taught us that.</P>
    <P>The different references to the claim again seem to be matters for Committee Stage.  One wonders if one is justified in having the rights commissioner there at all.  I am all in favour of it but what I am getting at is that under the terms of the Bill he can be by-passed and the tribunal can determine findings or recommendations. One could think, looking at the ease with which the rights commissioner can be eliminated that the procedures in the Bill should be re-examined. <Col N="1093" /> There is the situation where the Circuit Court can be involved in an appeal, or if the person wishes he can take the case to court under the old system.  I think experience here has shown that proceedings taken against unfair dismissals are always taken at high management level.  Perhaps it will be an advantage for the person on the shop floor who may fear litigation to have these facilities available to him.</P>
    <P>Wide powers are being taken by the Minister in section 16.  One wonders if these powers are dangerously wide without the opportunity of anything but an order being made under them to amend certain sections.  I am particularly concerned with subsection (5) which reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order amend any provisions of this Act so as to comply with any international obligations in relation to dismissals that the State has decided to assume.</P>
    <P>While it may be ideal for the Minister to have this in the Bill, now with our accession to the EEC we have in this House a Joint Committee on EEC Legislation.  One would think that this committee should be consulted if such a step were being taken by a Minister. While I appreciate that the draft order will be laid before the House or an opportunity given to the House to discuss it, I do not think that happens soon enough.  If such an order is being made, the committee should be consulted. Again, that is a matter mainly for Committee Stage, which I believe will be quite interesting.  It is important that adequate time and attention be given to it and I hope the Minister will accept some of the amendments we shall put forward.  I think we can improve the Bill by spending time on it here so that when it eventually leaves the House, as outlined by the Minister and improved by us, it will contribute to improved industrial relations.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, we can never legislate for them but we can help and encourage.  We must allow a certain flexibility to remain at all times.  If we can remove some of the existing problems it will be worth while.</P>
    <P>In this area there are some sections where we might create problems and <Col N="1094" /> this we must guard against.  It is very difficult in a small country like this. I fully accept the difficulties created for any Minister occupying the position of Minister for Labour.  I appreciate the fact that we have a mixed economy.  We have a wide range of industry and employers, small, medium and large.  The small employer scattered throughout rural Ireland, providing a useful service in a town or village, is the one I am concerned about under this Bill.  I appreciate the difficulty the Minister can experience in excluding him, but the Minister has to observe certain standards and restrictions.  Whether or not we can embrace him under the Bill as it stands I am not quite sure. It might harm him if we did that.  I am satisfied that this Minister or any other Minister would not deliberately set out to harm anyone who is providing a service to the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the House will bear with me for a while because I have little or no experience of industrial employment.  There are a number of industries in my constituency and I am familiar with some of the problems of employees. I am always amused by Opposition speakers who bemoan the fact that only now after so many years of Coalition Government are we getting an anti-discrimination Bill.  I should like to remind Deputy Fitzgerald, although he was not in the House in the 16 years before this Government came to office, that his Party were in Government for 16 years and did nothing about anti-discrimination legislation.</P>
      <P>When I think of anti-discrimination legislation I think in terms of the female.  Heretofore discrimination against female employees was common.  This Bill creates a delicate balance of fairness between employee and employer.  The trade unions have always tried, successfully in many cases, to protect the employee but the employer seems to have been neglected.  On Committee Stage I shall have a great deal more to say on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe, as Deputy Fitzgerald <Col N="1095" /> does, that the Bill will increase discrimination against pregnant women; indeed, I think it protects them.  With more married women working this type of protection is necessary.  Girls are marrying younger and employers will have no alternative but to employ them.  Deputy Fitzgerald also says that nobody should be dismissed unfairly.  We do not live in an ideal society and life can be very unfair.  Employers are only human and in many cases there are unfair dismissals.  For the first time employees have the right of reply under this Bill.  They can appeal to the rights commissioner, the tribunal and finally to the civil courts.  The fact that the Minister will pay the costs of a civil case gives absolute protection to the employee.  As everybody knows, litigation is expensive and slow.  Lower paid employees are slow to resort to the courts because of the cost involved.  This is a great step forward.</P>
    <P>In regard to redundancy, I have been told that women employees are always the first to be selected.  That is unfair selection and this Bill protects them.  There is no doubt that we live in a male oriented society.  No matter what women's &ldquo;libbers&rdquo; say, it still exists.  I do not believe in the extreme views of the women's &ldquo;libbers&rdquo;.  I believe that men and women should complement each other and not devour each other.  Men and women should be employed on their ability.  A man or a woman should only be engaged to do a job that he or she is capable of doing.</P>
    <P>The 14-day period for giving a reason for dismissal is a good point and should apply to the civil service as well as to other employers.  When a Deputy makes an inquiry in regard to the dismissal of an employee, he is usually told that it is not the custom to divulge the reasons for the dismissal. All employees who are dismissed should be given in writing the reason for their dismissal.  If they are good enough to do the work they are good enough to be treated as human beings.</P>
    <P>In many ways this Bill will help to prevent strikes.  When an employee is dismissed everybody goes out on <Col N="1096" /> strike.  Therefore, the appeal clause will help both employee and employer, industry and the country in general.  I welcome the Bill and hope it gets a speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill but am uneasy about certain aspects of it.  We have the habit of making pious resolutions but we are not all fair-minded.  Human nature being what it is there is the difficult question of interpretation.  The Bill is completely subject to interpretation.  I am asking if temporary employees are included. I am afraid&mdash;particularly in regard to small business people&mdash;that if everybody across the board is not included there will be very few permanent employees with small industries and business people because such employers might be afraid that if the industry or business went down it would not be that easy to dispense with an employee.  It would be unfair to dismiss a temporary employee without giving good reasons why one was getting rid of his services.</P>
      <P>The major problem I see in the Bill is in regard to its interpretation.  For instance, there enters in the qualification of a person, again something that is open to interpretation.  An employer wanting to get rid of employees could very easily use the excuse that they were not qualified. Then there is the question of conduct in respect of which various interpretations could be brought into play if one wanted to make the case that a person had misconducted himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, I foresee <Col N="1097" /> many problems in its implementation. It is when one begins to put theory into practice that one runs into the question of different interpretations. Who is to interpret these questions? Allowing for the appeals which exist involving hearings before a rights commissioner, one can eventually end up in the court.  I approve also of the provision that if an employee does not agree with a decision of the rights commissioner the State enters in to pay his expenses.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Hogan O'Higgins said, this is a Committee Stage Bill.  Perhaps the Minister would consider seriously setting up some type of committee.  If I am an employer and see something wrong in respect of one of my employees, I should like to be able to discuss it before dismissal takes place.  It is when the dismissal has actually taken place that all the trouble starts.  It is then that it is difficult to get an interpretation on the charge of misconduct or that of not being qualified for a particular job.  Before a dispute occurs I should like to see negotiations being entered into or advice being obtained from the people concerned.  The same goes for the person employed.  If he or she can say: &ldquo;I am about to be dismissed on such and such grounds, what are my rights in this case?  give my qualifications&rdquo;, it might all be settled before dismissal actually takes place.</P>
    <P>I should not like it to go out that this Bill would prevent people from taking on personnel for training purposes. At present many people are being taken on.  I have got people into businesses where there has not been a lot of work for them.  People have agreed to take on unemployed people. Many youngsters are being taken into employment.  They might expect a lot better but they are very glad to get anything.  Would there not be the danger that such business people would begin to worry about taking on such personnel?  This Bill would need to be very fully explained to them.  As Deputy Hogan O'Higgins said, one has to strike a balance between what is fair to the employer and the employee. We all know that people have been wrongfully dismissed in the past. <Col N="1098" /> It is only right that there should be protection but the amount of protection that can be afforded is the all-important point.</P>
    <P>The whole question of interpretation is what worries me.  I am a member of a local authority.  We made planning decisions.  Planning Bills were passed here and officials had to interpret them.  In some cases they were interpreted entirely differently from what the spirit meant.  That is why I am worried about the interpretation of one's conduct, ability or qualifications. I want to know what code will be laid down in that respect because the whole Bill stands or falls on that point.  For instance, if when there is disagreement between a trade union and an employee the rights commissioner involved in an appeal comes forward and says: &ldquo;Yes, this person is qualified&rdquo; and the employer says: &ldquo;He is not qualified&rdquo;, is that binding? I assume it is.  I assume that if the employer does not accept the ruling, the State will pay the expenses of the employee to take it to the courts.</P>
    <P>We would need to be very careful because there are so many different categories of persons employing people.  Factories, small businesses, small farmers take people on for a while who might be afraid they did not understand the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill merely seeks fair play but the whole interpretation of fair play should be thoroughly explained so that it would not turn employers from taking on prospective personnel. I do not think the Bill covers a sufficiently wide range of people; it should go right across the board.  Too many people are excluded from it.  Deputy Hogan O'Higgins said there is no point in people standing up and criticising the Bill.  I want to make it clear that I am not criticising it.  I welcome it. But they are the practical applications of the Bill about which I am worried and in respect of which I should like some information from the Minister. Like Deputy Hogan O'Higgins, I will have a lot to say on Committee Stage in order that I may understand its practical implications.  I am not saying that the Minister is infallible or could give me answers off the cuff here today. When a set of directions is laid <Col N="1099" /> down theoretically, it is only when one begins to put them into practice one runs up against stone walls.  I am afraid one will run up against a few stone walls in the implementation of this Bill.  I do not say that for the purpose of throwing water on the Bill. This House, the trade unions and employees should be able to discuss it seriously.  A political football should not be made of it.  We are here to introduce legislation for everybody's benefit and to ensure fair play.  I merely pose those questions to the Minister in the hope that the Bill, when it leaves this House, will be a useful one.  It is not fair to say that anybody on this side of the House wants to make political propoganda out of or throw water on the Bill.  I did not stand up to do so and I do not do it now.  There is a lot of looseness in this Bill.  I merely wish we could say: &ldquo;We have a perfect way of putting that into law and there are no snags involved.&rdquo;  If this Bill does anything to stop trade disputes I can assure the Minister that it will receive my support and the support of every Member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of those who feel that we cannot have too much of this type of legislation.  I welcome all legislation which protects the right of the employee in his employment. I am not saying that there was a great deal of injustice committed in this area in the past, but some injustices were committed and in this regard there was a serious omission in our legislation.  However, the trade union movement, in consultation and in negotiation with the various employer organisations and with individual employers, have prepared workable and sensible dismissal procedures.  As a result of this, satisfactory agreement has been reached in many cases where dismissals would otherwise have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us of the number of man days lost as a result of trade disputes arising out of the dismissal of employees but, unfortunately, the Minister's Department does not have the statistics which would show the tremendous work done by the unions <Col N="1100" /> in negotiation with employers in solving problems in this area.  The number of problems solved in relation to dismissals far exceeds the number of man days lost.  I do not mean to put forward the view that this legislation is not necessary.  It is very necessary because even though the majority of employers are good and progressive in their relationships with employees, there are some who have taken advantage of every situation to effect unfair and unjust dismissals and who take other forms of discriminatory action against employees. When we think of the fact that in 99 per cent of cases employees are totally dependent for their livelihood on their employers we can realise the seriousness of a dismissal, particularly when alternative employment is not easily available as at present.  It is more important than ever that nobody should be dismissed except for the gravest of reasons which must be proved to all concerned.</P>
    <P>As previous speakers have pointed out, this is a Bill which will be discussed in greater detail on Committee Stage and many of the points raised will come up again on that Stage but I should like the Minister to deal with the general comments I shall make on the Bill when replying to Second Stage.  The most important thing in procedures of this kind is the necessity for swift action because when a dismissal which appears unjust to the majority of the fellow workers of the employee dismissed occurs, it is difficult to contain their feelings about the dismissal.  For that reason it is necessary to put into this legislation provisions which would make it mandatory for such an employee to be retained in employment pending the outcome of this procedure.  There are cases where employees are not given dismissal notices and many methods are used by a small minority of employers when they want to dismiss unfairly or get rid of some workers.  Such employers can make conditions intolerable to the extent that an employee breaks down and gives in notice.  I am not too clear whether such a situation is covered in the Bill but we can be certain that as soon as this Bill becomes law some <Col N="1101" /> people will search for the loopholes. An employer can make conditions, not necessarily physical conditions, intolerable for an employee.  I hope that any loophole in that area will be closed off effectively.</P>
    <P>Exclusions have been mentioned and I am satisfied with the Minister's statement that after the passing of the Bill he will examine the matter in practice and that if necessary he will extend the legislation later to cover other categories of employment. I agree with Deputies who expressed concern about the exclusions, particularly in regard to trainee nurses and paramedical employment.  It is true to say that most of the cases excluded are covered by fairly adequate procedures but I do not like to see so many exclusions in the initial stages.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned apprentices. He may have overlooked that there is provision in the Redundancy Act that may have acted as an encouragement to employers to let off apprentices within a month of their having completed their time.  That Act states that an employer who makes an apprentice redundant within four weeks of completion of his apprenticeship is not liable to pay a redundancy lump sum or weekly payments.  This Bill keeps in step with that provision and there is something to be said for and against that situation.  Some employers are inclined to hold on to apprentices who have completed their time for a year or two afterwards, but because of the provision in the Redundancy Act they may feel obliged to let them go before the four weeks have been completed because if they did not they would be liable for full redundancy compensation.</P>
    <P>I should like some clarification in regard to already established dismissal procedures where they are in most cases more favourable to the employee than the provisions in this Bill.  I appreciate that the Bill must take a middle course and that it may not go as far as we should like it to go.  I should like to know the position in the case of agreements under which the employer has discretion only in respect of dismissal within three months or six <Col N="1102" /> months.  When this Bill becomes law can that employer take advantage of the 12-month period?  To my mind the 12-month period is a bit long, although I appreciate the problems facing the Minister who must try to get generally acceptable and practicable proposals.</P>
    <P>The Bill is mainly aimed at areas in which there has been absolutely no protection.  The exclusions in it have at least some protective procedures. The existence of common law protection does not amount to anything because no employee can afford to avail of it and the law is so vague on this matter that it is very difficult for a case taken to succeed.  I hope this Bill will not take the place of more favourable agreements.  I hope that it will deal with cases where no protection at all has existed.</P>
    <P>Before Committee Stage I should like clarification on whether it is an individual decision of an employee to avail of the machinery provided here or whether it is to be a majority decision in the workplace.  It happens occasionally that a dismissed worker genuinely and sincerely thinks he has been unfairly dismissed but the majority of his fellow employees would not support him in a dispute with the employer.  This type of situation has been overlooked in various comments and reports.  It has been held generally that when someone is dismissed a dispute exists and that his fellow employees walk out whether a person has been dismissed justly or unjustly.  That is not the position.  In my experience I have found that workers are responsible and that before they take any decision they weigh all the evidence available to them.  It is only after serious consideration of the case that they will take the decision to strike.  I would like to have a point clarified: is it up to the individual or the majority of his fellow employees to decide if he has a case for the rights commissioner and the appeals tribunal?</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan O'Higgins mentioned the case of girls being dismissed first; in other words, discrimination is practised in that area.  I would like to extend that to include discrimination on age grounds.  It happens that <Col N="1103" /> people can be made redundant because of their age.  To my mind that is as discriminatory a practice as that mentioned by Deputy Hogan O'Higgins.</P>
    <P>There is another point I would like to have clarified.  What happens if one person is to be made redundant and a decision is taken to let go a single person as against the married person?  Some people might interpret that as unfair dismissal.  There are provisions in this Bill which say what will or will not in a certain situation and at a certain time and place be an unfair dismissal.  When this Bill is passed it will be important that details be readily available to all concerned. The Minister said he will make leaflets available but he should take steps to ensure that a notice outlining the main provisions of this Bill are posted in every work place.  This is done in relation to the Factories Acts and certain provisions of the joint labour committees and industrial committees of the Labour Court.  Everybody can see from these notices the conditions under which he or she is working and the procedures to be followed if any problems occur.  I would like the Minister to make it mandatory prominently to display a notice outlining the Bill's provisions.</P>
    <P>A fund should be set up to pay compensation to employees.  Particularly under the Minimum Notice Act it has happened that employees awarded sums under that Act were not able to get them because their former employers had gone out of business, had no assets or perhaps had even left the country and there were no funds from which those people could get what had been awarded to them.  In this case there is no fund from which people can be paid.  To get money a person must go to court.  It may be possible after one or two years for the employee to get the money to which he is entitled but it is when he has been unfairly dismissed that he needs the money, not at the end of a long legal process.  There might be some way of getting over that problem.</P>
    <P>I do not see any of the difficulties envisaged by some speakers about the <Col N="1104" /> provisions dealing with female employees who became pregnant.  I do not share the concern of those who have expressed the view that this Bill will militate against the employment of females.  It would be unfortunate if that provision were not included in the Bill.  I welcome the provision that pregnancy will not and cannot be used as a reason for dismissal.  At present the situation is very unsatisfactory because when female employees look for maternity leave, normally a minimum of three months, they are told: &ldquo;You may have your leave but we cannot hold your job.  The work must go on. We must get someone to take your place.  After your maternity leave we will see if we have a job available for you.&rdquo;  That is the attitude in a number of cases at present.</P>
    <P>When the girl reports back for her job she is told: &ldquo;We are sorry.  We filled your position.  You will have to go on a waiting list and you will hear from us in due course.&rdquo;  In most cases &ldquo;in due course&rdquo; turns out to be never. In addition, if a girl goes to the labour exchange to claim benefit she is disallowed automatically because she is held to be unavailable for work by reason of having to care for a child. The next step open to her is to take her case to the appeals machinery.  At that stage the matter is outside the responsibility of the Minister for Labour.  However, I welcome the provisions of the Bill dealing with this aspect of employment.  It should lead to the employment of more women because for every four girls employed in a concern the liability for maternity leave would amount to 12 months combined and this should create a job for an additional woman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that employers will adapt to the new situation and that any problem which may arise can be sorted out.  Another area in respect of which problems can arise is that of the conduct of an employee outside his hours of work.  I expect <Col N="1105" /> this would be a matter for the rights commissioner and the Appeals Tribunal but it is desirable that the legislation in this regard would not be left as wide as it is.  I have in mind in particular the worker who breaks the law and is sent to prison for a month or, perhaps, 12 months and who, on his release, finds that his job is no longer available although he may have been in that employment for up to ten or 20 years.  By serving his sentence he will have repaid his debt to society and the deed for which he was sentenced might have no connection whatever with his work and, consequently, would not affect his employer's interest in any way.  For such a person the greater penalty by far for himself and for his family is the loss of his job.  Therefore, I should like to see some provision in the Bill to deal with such cases rather than to leave the reference to &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; as wide as it is.  It has happened in the past that employers have used employees' convictions for misdemeanours unconnected with their work as an excuse for dismissal.  This sort of situation leads to much argument between employers and the representatives of the workers concerned.</P>
      <P>I should like, too, to see some provision in the Bill to deal with the question of demotions because very often demotion and dismissal can be so closely related as to mean the same thing.  I say this because by being demoted a worker's conditions can be made so intolerable as to force him to leave his employment.  Unfair demotions give rise to disputes both official and unofficial.  The provisions of this Bill should be extended to take account of changes in work performed by an employee which clearly are to his detriment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because it fills a very serious gap in the area of the protection of certain employees.  Also, I regard it as a beginning of legislation of this nature.  I trust that there will be further legislation in this field as time goes on and when we have seen how this legislation works in practice.  The Bill should be welcomed by both sides in industry.  As the Minister said, it is legislation that will not <Col N="1106" /> present any problem for the vast majority of managements.</P>
    <P>There is a further point I should like to make about the lock-out situation, that is, at what stage does the lock-out become a dismissal?  The provision regarding lock-outs in this Bill is that the employee is re-engaged on resumption of work but I have known lock-outs to go on and on indefinitely and resumption of work, in some cases, never happens.  It is just a lock-out full stop.  At what stage can an employee in such a lock-out situation have the option to claim compensation on the basis that he is dismissed?</P>
    <P>The remaining points I have to make would be more appropriate on Committee Stage when I am confident we will have a very useful discussion on most sections of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to the voices of other speakers, particularly that of our spokesman on labour, Deputy Fitzgerald. The Minister said:</P>
      <P>In the years 1972 to 1975 there were 187 recorded disputes classified as relating to &ldquo;engagement or dismissal, redundancies, etc.&rdquo; in which 26,299 people were involved. These disputes alone accounted for over a quarter of a million man-days lost in industry.  During last year alone over one-third of all man-days lost, that is 116,000 man-days, were due to these reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an indication of the seriousness of this legislation.  When we examine the situation in relation to dismissals, we must also look over our shoulder at the question of employment. Legislation of this nature in connection with workers' rights is a sensitive area.  It is only right that legislation should be updated to ensure that the unsatisfactory loopholes which were availed of by employers are sealed off.  Over the years efforts have been made in a variety of Acts to give workers rights.  In the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, and in other Acts, we have endeavoured to give workers certain rights and conditions.  On the basis of what this <Col N="1107" /> Bill seeks to achieve, it will certainly have the support of this House.</P>
    <P>I will not deal with the mechanics of the Bill.  I will be brief.  I want to deal with sections 2 and 6.  At the moment, we have many people on the labour exchange who are not affected by this Bill.  They find it difficult to obtain employment, some of them on the grounds of their political opinions, and others on the grounds of their religious opinions.  It is sad that while a certain section of the community is being safeguarded under this Bill, a large number of people who are looking for employment are deprived of it by groups of people who came together in fashionable clubs, society seekers and otherwise, in plush hotels and in Government Departments and hatch out plans. I feel very strongly for the unfortunate people who have not got employment and who are debarred from employment for reasons which the Minister regards as unfair reasons for dismissal. I will deal with some of those in a moment.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister gave us an undertaking.  He has not honoured it in this Bill.  He gave us an undertaking that there would be a section in this Bill which would endeavour to seal off a loophole he left in the equal pay Bill whereby a person who applied for equal pay could be dismissed and have no right constitutionally&mdash;we were told at one stage by the Minister&mdash;to be re-employed.  I should like to know if that aspect is covered in this Bill.  Does this Bill ensure that such a person can be re-employed?  Can the Minister indicate if that is so?  Has he sealed off the loophole he told us he would seal off and that people who apply for their rights will not be liable to dismissal with no redress.  Is this Bill a comprehensive effort to seal off the loophole left by the Minister?  When Deputy Fitzgerald, Deputy Moore and I raised this question about victimisation of people, we were told such people would be safeguarded under this Bill.  If the Minister had sealed off that loophole he would be only too happy to say so.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a farce if it does not guarantee rights to individuals who are <Col N="1108" /> seeking their rights under legislation passed in this House in the past 12 months.  Is this another piece of window-dressing? It appears to me that the people we spoke about during the debate on the equal pay Bill are not safeguarded and the Minister has broken his word to Members of this House.  While the Minister may think he is doing a good job in pointing the finger at employers, he should now point the finger at the State for bringing in defective legislation which could cause serious problems in relation to dismissals with no redress.  We were told by the Minister that the employer has the right to employ whoever he likes.  I hope the Minister will clear this up before the discussion ends.  If he does not, then as we did when the equal pay Bill was before the House we will bring in amendments to ensure that legislation passed here will not subject people to unfair dismissal.</P>
    <P>We have been told by the Minister that every Bill he puts through the House needs another measure to bolster it up.  The Minister should be introducing comprehensive legislation that will seal off the loopholes, not saying: &ldquo;Let this Bill go through and we will bring in another Bill to ensure it can operate&rdquo;.  This is a farcical situation to which this House has been subjected over the last couple of years.  Again, there is no indication from the Minister whether this Bill seals off the loopholes.  If we can no longer trust the word of a Minister in this House in relation to the protection of workers, then the Bills he presents can only be regarded as rushed legislation not for the purpose he indicates they are intended but purely to bolster up a sagging political situation within his own party and the Government.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that, as this Bill progresses through the House, our spokesman on Labour, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, will fine comb it and will bring in amendments to ensure that it will be a worth-while measure.  I do not agree with piecemeal legislation of this type.  What have we got from the Department of Labour over the past three-and-a-half years?  We have defective legislation which puts <Col N="1109" /> workers at risk and we are told it will be bolstered up by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald has dealt at some length with the exclusions, and other speakers have expressed doubts about these exclusions.  It is rather peculiar that section 2 excludes the chairman of the Army Pensions Board.  There are many other boards that have been established by the State over the years that in one way or another administer the affairs of the State, Bord na gCon, Bord na gCapall and so on.  Why pick out the chairman of the Army Pensions Board?  I believe the chairman of the Army Pensions Board was picked out to cover up the irresponsible action of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Donegan, in dismissing a man who gave valued service to this nation, General Mac Eoin.  It must be for some reason and I suggest it is so that in future it can be said: &ldquo;The Army Pensions Board chairman is excluded from unfair dismissal&rdquo;, which means, in effect, that unfair dismissal will be tolerated in relation to the chairman of the Army Pensions Board, that he has no protection whatever.  This is a man who was acclaimed for his service to this nation at home and also abroad for his service in the interest of peace and justice as commander-in-chief of the United Nations Force, and who was abruptly kicked out of office at a time when he was called before the Minister, as he thought, to receive instructions.  This man had no political axe to grind.  He was a responsible, competent officer.  The chairmen of the other State boards are not specified. Why pick out the chairman of one board?  This is a serious situation, that the chairman of this board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understand that, but the important point is that it is sought to justify the unfair dismissal of the chairman of the Army Pensions Board.  I suggest this is an appointment in regard to which they must cover up their tracks.  Collectively speaking, the Minister for Labour is just as much responsible as the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence.  I hope we will never see again the like of this degrading tactic that has been employed and for which provision is now included in the Bill in order to justify the Government's action in the past.</P>
      <P>There are other aspects of the exclusions that I could deal with, but Deputy Fitzgerald has indicated that he intends to examine in great depth and detail these exclusions with a view to putting forward amendments at another stage.</P>
      <P>Section 16 deals with unfair dismissals. Nowhere in this section can I see a reference to the personnel to whom I referred earlier.  Will the Minister now give an undertaking that he will bring in an amendment to ensure that a group of workers who seek rights under another Act will be protected? He has already admitted that there is no protection under the other protecting Act that he brought before the House.  It is interesting to note the terms of section 6 (2):</P>
      <P>...the religious or political opinions of the employee, being opinions the holding or expression of which do not directly or indirectly cause or result in damage to the interests of the employer,</P>
      <P>From time to time people have been dismissed from the Government service because of their political opinions. People are being dismissed for that reason and people will not be employed because of their political opinions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill needs the entire attention of the House.  The passage of the Bill may take some time so that we can ensure that we get a true insight into <Col N="1111" /> the minds of the Government, the Minister and the Taoiseach because their stamp can be clearly seen in the Bill.  As the Bill goes through the House I hope we shall have many contributions and that on the Committee Stage we shall have a variety of amendments that will correct the erroneous trends in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into any greater detail on this section than I did on section 2 other than to express amazement at the fact that areas which the Minister undertook would be included in the Bill are not included in the way that he had indicated. The previous Bill went through the House in the manner in which it did, being fought line by line, because we did not accept the sincerity of the Minister in regard to the undertakings he was giving.  Our stand is borne out now by this legislation.  I appeal to the Minister, even at this stage, to withdraw the Bill and have it revamped so as to embody matters we had been promised would be included, so that the exclusions mentioned can be reconsidered and so that we can have a realistic Bill presented to the House, something that we can be proud of.</P>
    <P>This is a sensitive area and there is no doubt that some employers take advantage of workers.  The great bulk of employers are responsible persons who realise that it is necessary and desirable to have adequate protection for employees.  Again, people are being debarred from employment for the reasons covered by the Minister here. On another occasion I shall deal in some detail with people who have been debarred from employment or dismissed by the Government on the grounds of political opinion.  When the time comes I trust we can have a more comprehensive debate and place the true facts before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Bill is another step in the right direction, towards giving us an ordered industrial relations situation.  With the exception of the previous speaker I think those who spoke this morning were sincere. Everybody was concerned that this legislation should be enacted quickly and should meet the needs of presentday <Col N="1112" /> industrial relations.  I should be glad if people would not take too seriously the contribution of the previous speaker as it bore little relation to what is envisaged in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am a bit unhappy about the exclusion in section 2, where it mentions a person with less than one year's continuous service.  This might lead to a situation where a person about to complete a year's employment might be let go for one reason or another. I would hope that employers would tend to put people on probation for a short period and be able to judge their performance.  Then, if they did not measure up, they could be let go.  A period of one year could be used to get rid of people.  There is also the question of people employed by relatives. This should be further considered, especially where only a small unit of employment is concerned.  A person might have a brother or some other relative employed and some domestic problem could arise and he could dismiss him or her and that would be excluded.  In my view we should bring into the net as many as possible and I would envisage relatives being included.  I see no good reason to exclude them.</P>
      <P>I know that these classes are covered under other Acts but I am also concerned about civil servants, local authority employees, health board officials and various other people excluded. I should like to see a more comprehensive type of industrial relations legislation which would encompass everybody.  Those in State employment should not be subject to one type of legislation and those in private employment to another.  We should aim at getting everybody under the umbrella. I would consider the probationary period of two years as far too long especially now when people can serve apprenticeship within three years starting from scratch.  We are talking of a person who might be qualified, or have certain experience, undergoing a probationary period of two years.  I think that should be reconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a period of six months for appeal.  Why should it take a person six months to decide that he had been unfairly dismissed or victimised?  The <Col N="1113" /> problem here is that an employer may dismiss somebody unfairly, perhaps, and no action is taken for six months. Within that period he may have taken on another employee who can be working and then this appeal comes up and goes in favour of the former employee.  The employer then can, and will, dismiss the person taken on. There may be very good reason for the six months' period but, if not, I think we should shorten it as much as possible, particularly in view of the fact of the introduction of this Bill, which will be advertised and a leaflet will be circulated giving details of it and setting out the rights of workers under it.  In that instance there should not be any great need for a long period of time for an appeal.</P>
    <P>Some speakers questioned the position of apprentices.  As some employers take on more than their quota of apprentices to give them the benefit of training, it is important that they should be able to lay off apprentices within a month of the ending of the apprenticeship.  It is important that we have a steady stream of apprentices and I have no doubt that this Bill will not inhibit employers in this respect. It is a very fair Bill and considers the position of both employer and employee. It is our duty to legislate for the good of the community and to ensure that the legislation on our Statute Book is seen to be fair.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated his reasons for inserting a clause in regard to the number of man-days lost.  If there is a dispute I hope this machinery will operate quickly and before industrial action can be taken.  In the event of a verdict being against an employee, can strike action still be taken?  The taking of industrial action after a decision of the tribunal would create difficulties for all concerned.  Having legislation binding on both parties is not an easy parcel to sell.  Highly industrialised countries with good industrial relations have legislation which is binding on both parties.  It is important to have meaningful and operable legislation. We all want to eliminate the number of man-days lost in industry. One dispute in the west divided the <Col N="1114" /> community and nearly closed a particular firm.  It dragged on for a long time.  This is the type of situation we should try to eliminate.  When a person is being considered for dismissal he should be put on notice.  If he feels he is being unfairly treated he should be able to bring his case before the rights commissioner as quickly as possible. If this were done it would eliminate the number of man-days lost in industry.  This legislation will make employers more responsible in that any action they take against an employee will involve an element of appeal and in that regard they would need to be sure of their grounds for dismissing an employee.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying he should tell us how the trade unions have reacted to this Bill.  I have no doubt they will welcome it because it will make their job easier.  What will their attitude be towards industrial action if a man is unfairly dismissed? Will they advise holding back from industrial action pending the hearing of a case?</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison raised the question of lock-outs.  How long should a lock-out continue before it is deemed to be unfair?  Will the man who has been locked out have to go cap in hand to get his job back?  That situation would not create the right atmosphere and would lead to further frustration. Lock-outs should be treated as dismissals and investigated quickly to ensure that they do not continue for any length of time.</P>
    <P>This is a fine Bill.  It constitutes another piece of the jigsaw.  The Minister, since coming into office three-and-a-half years ago has introduced much legislation.  He has an understanding of the overall industrial relations position.  If we are to emerge strong industrially we must have comprehensive industrial relations legislation to protect everybody's rights.  However, we must continue to explore that whole area.  I support also the bringing in of people on the boards of semi-State bodies. That is part only of what I should like to see done in the area of workers' councils and participation at different levels of management.  One <Col N="1115" /> hopes that all of this will be dove-tailed in the future, because I believe it is the only way we can remain competitive in the industrial world. If our competitors are reasonably strike-free because of their good industrial relations which we are not, then we will find ourselves totally non-competitive.  We have merely to look across the water at the car industry where, because of their industrial relations, that industry has been literally torn apart.  As an emerging industrial nation we do not want to be beset by problems such as those but we must gear ourselves to meet the challenge of the highly-industrialised countries by having good industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill. I look forward to participating in the Committee and other Stages to ensure that, when complete, it will meet the needs of this area.  We can then explore other areas where further legislation is required in order to bring industrial relations here to a fine point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people would agree with Deputy O'Brien when he said that, if this Bill improves industrial relations, then we would be all for it.  However, I wonder will it do anything to better relations on the factory floor and in offices.  In this respect we need legislation.  We need action by people employed in industry or commerce in an endeavour to make those concerned more competitive in order that they can withstand the colossal challenge they will meet from the rest of the world, and particularly from Europe.  One of the first things one must think on today is: what can an employer and employee put into an industry so that it will be well run, that workers' rights will be respected which in turn will play its part in building up our economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I hear people speak about human relations I often wonder does a man when he becomes the owner of a factory change somewhat.  Does he &mdash;or any group for that matter&mdash; become a different being?  I do not <Col N="1116" /> think they do but the atmosphere in a firm may contribute to the behaviour of that employee or employer.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not deal with conditions. Over the years mistakes have been made by the introduction of piecemeal legislation on industrial or human relations.  It would be well if we took time off some day to examine all of the legislation, starting just after the industrial revolution right up to date, so that in today's modern concept of industry and commerce we might be able to draft a bill of rights which would be a charter of equity and protection for all people engaged in them.  In that way we would codify our laws and have a single piece of legislation, a testament of equality and justice.  Then each person engaged in industry or commerce would have that ideal before him: knowing he had a job to do, whether it be on the managerial or operative side, but that he was safeguarded and that, in his efforts, he sought a common good.  He would know that in so doing his rights were protected and there was no discrimination against him.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been faultily drafted. If one reads the Minister's brief one finds it absolutely discriminatory regarding women in its phraseology.  I can see the Minister being rapped by some of the women's liberation groups for his persistent use of &ldquo;he&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;he will have this&rdquo;, &ldquo;he will have that&rdquo; or &ldquo;he can do this&rdquo; or &ldquo;he cannot do that&rdquo;.  I can see the Minister being classed as a chauvinist because of the phraseology here.  As one wades further into the Bill one finds it is specified that, of course, women are affected by it also.  But in the phraseology of the Minister's brief one does detect purely male thinking which does not get the Bill off to a good start.</P>
    <P>The Minister might some day consider the introduction of a bill of rights, to which I have referred, and the evolution of a social contract. While at present a worker taken on by an employer has a certain kind of contract it would help him very much indeed, and add somewhat to his dignity, were he taken on contract, with certain things laid down in it, was <Col N="1117" /> treated as an individual, not merely a number on a card to clock in and out each day.  Indeed, there would probably be no name on such a card.</P>
    <P>We might study also the position of industry in western Europe to see if we could learn anything from it.  I am sure we could.  I believe we will have a situation here in years to come such as occurred in Western Europe recently where employees took an employer to task because of the employer's inefficiency.  The employees involved believed that the factory where they were working was going down through the fault of the employer.  They took the matter to the equivalent of our Department of Labour and I believe remedial action was taken.  I am trying to put across that we cannot legislate against certain attitudes, but legislation should encourage people and not coerce them.  It should encourage employers to be good employers and encourage workers to be good also. Legislation prepared in that way would be effective but the patchwork pattern of legislation of the Government in this field is contributing greatly to the non-achievement of proper industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The Minister has promised further legislation but he should introduce a Bill similar to that brought in by the late Seán Lemass in the 1930s, the Conditions of Employment Act.  That Act was regarded as a charter for those engaged in industry and it is still on our Statute Book.  We could learn a lot from it.  The scene has changed a lot since then and I believe it would be easier for the Minister to introduce legislation to build up our industrial arm.  If this help to prevent days lost by the crude weapon of strike, as he terms it, it is good.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (4) states:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, the dismissal of an employee shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, not to be an unfair dismissal, if it results wholly or mainly from one or more of the following:</P>
    <P>(a)  the capability, competence <Col N="1118" /> or qualifications of the employee for performing work of the kind which he was employed by the employer to do,</P>
    <P>(b)  the conduct of the employee,</P>
    <P>That is very general.  Would the Minister write in a provision to the effect that an employee must not use Anglo-Saxon words to his foreman? We had a bitter strike some time ago, which divided one of our smaller cities in two, arising out of the fact that an employee was alleged to use Anglo-Saxon words to a supervisor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There are but the good Irish speakers do not know them.  The provision I have quoted is too broad. We should be more specific on this matter.  The Minister must tighten up that provision before it would be acceptable or helpful.  That section also refers to the &ldquo;pregnancy of the employee&rdquo;.  That is very inefficient. The pregnancy of an employee should be dealt with in a different way because I could not see an employer dismissing an employee because of that.  I would like to see a provision written in to the effect that social services should be called on in such a case.  Pregnancy should not be written in as if it is another handicap to an employee.  From this and other defects I gather that the Bill was drafted in a hurry.  There is a degree of patchwork about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because discrimination of any type can be the cause of a bitter strike the Minister should insert in the Bill a guidance service which will help those involved in industry to preserve the human relations between employer and employee, always realising that we have 110,000 people unemployed. Industry will only be an efficient arm of the economy if it is well run and if those engaged in it get job satisfaction. When we are removing the irritants which cause people to act unreasonably, employer or employee, we must face the fact that employers have problems and employees may have problems which can be sorted out, not <Col N="1119" /> so much by legislation as by intelligent thinking.  The Minister should take the Bill back, think over it, and I am sure he will find great scope for improving it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had interesting contributions from all sides.  As those who contributed remarked, much of the material in the Bill can be gone into in greater detail at Committee Stage.  I hope to have the opportunity then of replying to many points raised this morning.  A fear was expressed that we were overburdening the area of industrial relations with excessive legislative interference.  That is a fear that might be expressed more validly of other systems than of ours.  I have been seeking to repair omissions that existed in our laws and, where experience recommended, the introduction of new legislation.  I have proceeded to do that.  Over this area of legislation in respect of the individual at work and working conditions, in respect of such matters as worker participation, our laws have been silent over a great number of years.  In introducing the agricultural joint labour committee we saw that legislation in relation to agricultural workers was last passed in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Similar remarks can be made about many other areas.  This is an area which has been neglected for many years in the sense that no new legislation consonant with modern attitudes has been introduced.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore was worried about the use of &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;his&rdquo; and other descriptions in the Bill which would suggest that we were reflecting male chauvinism.  He thought it reflected some discrimination towards female employees.  In any legislation we produce here, when we refer to &ldquo;he&rdquo; we base our use of the word on the Interpretation Act, 1937, which sets out clearly that the male &ldquo;he&rdquo; also includes a female.  We may object to that but that is the legal position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many questions of detail were raised.  Deputy O'Brien raised the question of the one year of qualifying <Col N="1120" /> service.  What we require in this respect is a trial period and we set on one year as a period during which employers and employees can decide whether they are suited to each other.  It would be unfair to select a shorter period.  We decided that one year was a reasonable period and that we would thereafter give power to declare the situation open to action within the framework of the Bill. Section 16 (1) gives power to cut that period later if experience suggests it should be cut.</P>
    <P>What I have tried to do in this legislation is to limit the area of arbitrary behaviour in the important matter of dismissal.  Deputies have referred to disputes that have occurred which owed their origins to an individual sense of grievance arising out of a person's dismissal by a particular firm.  From the figures I gave this morning, we know of the many strikes that have occurred which owe their origins to the feeling on the part of individuals that they have been unfairly treated after not too many years of service.  A person, because of disagreement with his employer, might find himself dismissed and his fellow employees, sharing his sense of grievance, have supported him.</P>
    <P>Up to now the problem has been that remedies have been sought to correct that situation by declaring strike notice.  There is nothing more potent in spreading a dispute than a sense of injustice shared by a number of workers in relation to a grievance of one individual.  This legislation is directed at removing the potential of an individual grievance for general dispute.  That is the constructive contribution which this Bill will make to improving industrial relations.  It does not ensure automatically that there will be an elimination of all kinds of dispute of this character but Deputies will admit it must be of assistance in this respect.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not an instance of law for law's sake but of the law helping to improve deficiencies that exist at present, of the law being invoked to ensure that the individual who may suffer a sense of grievance in the matter of his proposed dismissal will <Col N="1121" /> have set down for him procedures which he may utilise and accordingly his use of these procedures will ensure that his workmates will not feel impelled to support him in unnecessary strike action.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison raised the question of conduct outside working hours. One can say on the basis of the Bill that it is very unlikely to justify dismissal on grounds of such conduct unless it could be demonstrated categorically that the conduct was directly relevant to the effect on his job performance.  To decide on all these questions of interpretation, we have experienced bodies such as rights commissioners and the tribunal I referred to earlier, all experienced in the matter of interpretation of the section.  We can be assured that their interpretation will always be made on common-sense grounds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison also raised the question of unfair demotion and various other ways in which an employee's life may become almost intolerable, forcing him to leave the job.  The Deputy asked whether that kind of situation is covered by the Bill.  The employee can avail of the constructive dismissal element which can be found in section 1.  He could thereby bring action against his employer.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy asked about funds to compensate employees where employers default in unfair dismissal cases.  We must make a distinction between such cases and redundancy. Cases in which employers go out of business and default equate to the redundancy situation and the employee can claim compensation from the redundancy fund in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald asked about the two years' pay and compensation which is referred to in section 7 (1) (b). I do not intend to have a ceiling in money terms because it must not be forgotten that this Bill covers all levels of employee.  It is not confined to the shop floor: it covers all levels, from general manager to general worker.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald referred to the possibility of defining the criterion of <Col N="1122" /> unfair dismissal.  He said that to try to define &ldquo;capability&rdquo; and &ldquo;competence&rdquo; qualifications should result in a narrower legalistic interpretation. Here again we must realise that these will be subject to the interpretation of the experienced adjudication bodies I have referred to.  It must be borne in mind that these tribunals will in certain cases need legal representations in addition to the representations from both sides of industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison asked about discrimination on age grounds in connection with redundancy.  Section 6 (3) makes special provision to deal with unfair selection for redundancy.  This can be judged to be unfair dismissal under this Bill.  An employee who feels he has been unfairly treated in connection with redundancy will under that subsection have grounds for action.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy asked about groups of workers who do not support an individual who has been dismissed &mdash;what would be their position? One of the benefits of this legislation is that there is no reason why a group would feel impelled to offer the same support to an individual as they would have up to now because from now on in such a situation the individual aggrieved can be informed by his fellow workers that this legislation enables him to present his case to the adjudication bodies, if he so wishes.  It is up to the individual to present his case in that way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald raised the question of powers to amend the Bill in relation to international obligations of the State.  One of the provisions of the Bill is that the Houses of the Oireachtas can debate the contents of all such orders before they approve of them, and this gives full recognition to the Oireachtas.  A point was made about existing dismissal procedures. The Bill will not prevent employers and employees having recourse to established agreements in this respect.  The provisions of the Bill will come into being after a dismissal has taken place and this presumes that the provisions of negotiation agreements have already been exhausted.  I am giving special <Col N="1123" /> recognition to existing agreements in section 14.</P>
    <P>The question of apprentices was raised by many Deputies.  Deputy Pattison stated the advantages and snags of this provision.  I believe the balance of advantage lies clearly in retaining this provision.  I welcome full discussion of this but I am anxious to ensure that firms who bring on more apprentices for training than they require should not find themselves in difficulty because of the passing of this Bill.  I spend a lot of my time urging firms to employ more apprentices than their requirements dictate, because I believe it is important that firms realise that this training objective should be fulfilled by firms around the country.  Therefore, I would like to see the larger firms take on more apprentices than they might immediately require because the economy is in need of these skilled people.  Over this recession period I have been anxious to see that firms do not cut down on their training targets.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald raised the question of a change of ownership of a company.  That is covered in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  There are certain safeguards in relation to transfer of business mentioned in that Act and his point is amply met by the provisions of that Act.</P>
    <P>I agree with those speakers who talk about the necessity for swift action.  We have not had many complaints about delays by the rights commissioners to certain situations. Retention in employment has been raised.  Deputy Pattison asked if the aggrieved person could be retained in employment pending the hearing on his proposed dismissal.  I imagine that is the kind of situation which would most ideally be dealt with in the code of practice.  As I indicated this morning, as soon as this Bill passes through both Houses, I will initiate discussions with the unions and employers to get agreement on the national code of practice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan raised the question of qualifications and conduct. <Col N="1124" /> Adjudicating bodies will, in practice, have to set down their precedents case by case.  They will involve procedures that will be based on sound industrial relations experience. The rights commissioners and the employment tribunal are well acquainted with the existing practice of industrial relations.  I have no reason to fear that their definitions of qualifications and conduct will stray far from common sense; in fact, they will be based on interpretation of this Bill and will ensure that in practice, qualifications and conduct will not be interpreted to the disadvantage of the individual concerned.</P>
    <P>I have tried to cover some of the points raised but I am conscious that I have not referred to all of them. Deputy Fitzgerald referred to his fears about the exclusion of close relatives.  What I had in mind were the problems raised in farming enterprises. I have an open mind on this. We all know of cases where the question of close relationship did not prevent injustices occurring.  This is a very complicated area.  In my opinion we should keep family squabbles out of general law but, as I said, I am aware of certain injustices that have occurred here.  I hope we will return to this on Committee Stage.  My own misgivings in this area relate to the question of family connections and farming practices.</P>

      <P>Yes, in the area of exclusions, probationary teachers were mentioned.  They can be excluded for two years only.  There is a common sense point that where a person is undergoing training or probation obviously it might be considered unfair to introduce the question of legislating for unfair dismissal over that period.  That person could prove to be totally incompetent and unsuitable for the job.  In that situation it would be unfair to ask the management to abide by the complete rules of unfair dismissals.  This is a matter we <Col N="1125" /> will be returning to on Committee Stage.  I have done my best to cover all the points raised and hope we will come back to them on Committee Stage when we can go into them in greater detail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Today I am bringing before the House a Bill relating to a subject to which we as a nation have for too long given too little attention, the promotion and the utilisation of science.</P>
      <P>The correlation between science and technology and economic and social development cannot be disputed. It is no coincidence that the countries that have made the greatest strides in science and technology are also those which are the most prosperous and have the highest living standards.  It is in our interest, therefore, to organise our own national effort in science and technology so that we diminish as quickly as possible, and ultimately eliminate, the science and technology gap between us and other developed countries.  To this end we must devise an appropriate policy at national level and create effective mechanisms for implementation of that policy.  Such a policy must also, of course, take into account the importance of fundamental research, not only as the source from which applied science draws, but also as deserving attention for its own sake in any nation which likes to think of itself as cultured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making proposals for a new institutional element in science and technology, I must begin by expressing appreciation and encouragement to the existing bodies in the excellent work which they have done and are continuing to do.  I believe, however, that just as science and technology themselves are of their nature <Col N="1126" /> evolving, so also must the related institutional mechanisms be adapted to the changing needs of society.  The limited resources of men and money available in Ireland for scientific and technological endeavour make it imperative that they are so deployed that the community receives optimum value for its investment.  My intention in the legislative proposals which I am putting before the House is to help create a situation which will allow both scientists and technologists and users of science and technology to get maximum satisfaction from the activities undertaken with the support of public funds.</P>
    <P>For historic reasons much science and technology is organised on a sectoral basis in Ireland.  The main institutes, in spite of limited resources, have made major contributions to national development.  They were nevertheless founded, for good reasons at the time of founding, on a sectoral basis.  With the increasing growth, development and diversification of the economy, however, these sectoral divisions tend to inhibit the emergence of an overall fully integrated policy for science and technology.</P>
    <P>There are scientific, economic and social considerations which suggest that a co-ordinated approach across sectoral boundaries would yield enhanced results.  Such an approach must result in increased benefit through concentration of resources and effective planning for the build-up of expertise.</P>
    <P>Certain areas which show great economic promise fall largely between existing institutions and their development requires expertise and facilities which are largely scattered.  There is a need for a mechanism whereby major gaps in our national coverage of science and technology, many of which overlap traditional economic sectors, are effectively filled.</P>
    <P>Moreover, there is a need to persuade the community of the economic and social role of science and technology and to ensure that their potential for contributing to national development is given full consideration by national policy matters.</P>
    <P>The Government feel, therefore, that the time has come to establish <Col N="1127" /> more stable and permanent institutional arrangements for the formulation and implementation of a comprehensive national policy for science and technology and for harmonising and integrating the various strands which go to make it up.</P>
    <P>Before arriving at this conclusion considerable time and effort has been spent in exploring the ground.  The National Science Council were set up in 1968 to advise the Government on science and technology and to promote co-ordination in scientific and technological activity.  As part of the valuable work carried out by the council under a number of heads, they have devoted particular attention to the examination of institutional mechanisms for science and technology. Arising out of their examination, a survey of science policy for Ireland was undertaken by OECD between 1971 and 1973.  The OECD recommended new mechanisms for the formulation and implementation of science policy.  These were adopted by the council and subsequently submitted to and approved by the Government.  The main features of these new arrangements which are provided for in the legislation which I am presenting to the House are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a new National Board for Science and Technology and</P>
    <P>&mdash;a science budget.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the National Board for Science and Technology will have responsibility to secure from the national effort in pure and applied science and in technology the most effective contribution towards economic and social development.  They will do this by, <i>inter alia</i>, providing or promoting the provision of the necessary mechanisms to achieve the various objectives of a national policy for science and technology.  Such a policy should draw together all the various threads of scientific and technological activity in the community into a composite and integrated whole which would then be directed towards securing the optimum contribution towards economic and social development and the attainment of national goals.  It would, in <Col N="1128" /> particular, attempt to secure the most worth-while contribution from scientific and technological activities in the public sector; it would seek to identify priority areas for such activities; it would indicate where there are gaps to be filled in such activities; it would suggest how to secure an advance across the whole spectrum of activities in the public sector; and it would recommend where incentives and other stimuli might be applied so that the private sector would also make an enhanced contribution.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill sets out the functions of the board.  It contains first a general statement of the board's functions, that is, to act as a body having responsibility for the furtherance of science and technology.  It provides for advising the Government on policy for science and technology. It authorises the board to promote the co-ordination of investment in science and technology and it enables the board to provide and administer grants and other financial facilities. This last provision is an essential part of the promotional activity of the board in relation to the filling of gaps not covered up to now.  The board are authorised also under this section to promote the appreciation of the value of science and technology in our society.  This very important function is designed to enable science and technology to flourish and to make their maximum contribution to public well-being in a climate of informed opinion favourable to their development and application.</P>
    <P>Section 4 sets out also specific functions of the board, the most basic of which will be the preparation of a national programme for science and technology.  This programme will not be a static blueprint but a continually up-dated agenda for all activity relating to science and technology in the public sector.  It will serve a variety of purposes.  It will be a basic point of reference for the board in their activities.  It will be a master plan helping to determine the direction of Government activity in the science and technology area.  It will be a guide to individual institutions financed by public money, helping <Col N="1129" /> them to shape their policies and to direct their courses in accordance with overall national objectives.  It should be a very useful background for institutions and firms in the private sector in helping them to make their own programmes of action complementary to and compatible with those in the public sector and it should be instrumental in helping to create an informed public awareness of the place of science and technology in our national life.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides also for a number of other functions for the board. It empowers the board to promote the co-ordination of activities related to science and technology by the various institutions, and also to promote participation by them in such activities.  The board may engage in activities, but this is subject to approval by the Minister.  One of my principal concerns in this connection will be that it should not undertake activities which could more appropriately be carried out by another institution.  There is sometimes the danger that activity in the field of science should be concentrated on the conduct of research, but it is vital that the dissemination of the results of research, whether conducted here or elsewhere should receive constant attention.  The board are empowered by section 4 to disseminate information or to promote its dissemination by others.  There is a related provision giving the board the function of organising seminars, conferences and so on.  Science and technology are by their nature global, and provision for collaboration with bodies abroad is included also.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (4) (b) of section 4 also provides that the teaching functions of any educational institute, college or school shall be deemed not to be restricted by any provisions of the statute.  The board will, of course, be interacting with such institutions to the maximum extent possible, for instance, in relation to research activities from the fundamental level upwards; by way of involving academics as members of the board, as members of the various committees of the board, or carrying out tasks <Col N="1130" /> for the board in relation to international activities and the like; participation by educational institutions in conjoint work both with the board and with industry; collaboration between the board and educational institutions in the matter of training, for example, under the oil scholarship arrangements.  It is envisaged that there will be the maximum interaction between the board and educational institutions to their mutual advantage.</P>
    <P>It will be the board's responsibility to evolve a policy covering all aspects of scientific and technological activity and to present the Government with an overall and coherent basis for decisions influencing, <i>inter alia</i>, investment in scientific research and its extension into technological development.  Choices in this regard should properly be made at national level.  Priorities should be established and respected by all sectors of scientific and technological activity funded with public money. Co-ordination should be improved and strengthened.  All of this requires that quite specific recommendations accompanied by figures should be presented by the board to the Government. It is these considerations which have led to the conclusion that there should be a science budget.</P>
    <P>The concept of a science budget is new to this country but is quite well known on the Continent of Europe. Section 5 provides in this regard that the board will prepare a statement based as far as possible on the national programme for science and technology which the board is to devise and keep constantly under review under section 4 (3), and including, in particular, the requirements and proposals of all institutions in receipt of money from the State and giving in addition the board's own observations and recommendations on such requirements.  This statement will be submitted to the Minister for Finance and, of course, will be available to other interested Ministers, and will be submitted to the Government.  The final details of the financial allocations approved by the Government in respect of each <Col N="1131" /> institution will be published together with a commentary by the board on the general position of national policy for science and technology, both from the point of view of conception and of implementation. These together will constitute the science budget for each financial year or such other period as may be desirable from time to time.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the preparation and submission of the science budget will enable requirements for science and technology to be presented for the first time as an entity rather than as items scattered through departmental votes and that more informed and effective decision making by Government will ensue, and that meaningful debates will be facilitated in both of the Houses of the Oireachtas by the presentation to them of the science budget.</P>
    <P>There will be no change, however, in the system of voting money for these purposes.  It will continue to be voted under the relevant votes as at present, but the Dáil will, as a result of its consideration of the science budget from year to year, be in a much better position to offer informed comment on the provisions for science and technology within these votes. The science budget, containing particulars of all on-going activities financed from public moneys will be a valuable source of reference, not only for the board in their work, but for all other organisations and for the public generally.</P>
    <P>An essential feature of the work of the board will be a continuing review of the effectiveness of public investment in science and technology and this is provided for in section 6.</P>
    <P>It is very important that, for the purpose of carrying out their various tasks as set out particularly in section 4 and also in sections 5, 6 (1) and 7, the board should have ready access to information.  Section 6 (2), therefore, provides for the obtaining by the board of such information as to enable them to carry out with full effect their functions of advising the Government and individual Ministers, of promoting co-ordination, and of <Col N="1132" /> making recommendations on financial allocations.  It will also facilitate the board in their planning functions in relation to preparing a national programme and the promotion of, or participation in, pilot activities.</P>
    <P>Section 7 gives the board general authority to institute, conduct and promote research into, and studies on, problems relating to science and technology and to publish or disseminate the results, again subject to the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the appointment of the chairman and members of the board.  The number is being limited to ten, as it is felt that a larger number would encumber the effective performance by the board of their duties.  It should be emphasised, however, that the board will be assisted by a number of committees and provision for this is contained in section 22. The board may in fact delegate some of their functions to these committees, although all acts of the committees will be subject to the approval of the board.  Sections 9 to 14 are standard type provisions in relation to membership of the board, qualifications for membership and meetings and procedures of the board.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the provision of funds for the board out of Oireachtas grants and section 17 enables the board to use their funds for the performance of their functions. The remaining sections are standard in relation to most State-sponsored bodies and it is hardly necessary for me to go into detail as far as they are concerned at this stage.  Section 26 provides that the board shall appoint their own officers and servants but that their remuneration and allowances will be subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>In sum, the work of the new board will have four main aspects.  These will be, advising the Government, promoting co-ordination, making recommendations on financial allocations, and pilot and promotional activities. Taken in a broad sense, all these functions relate to the one distinct element of promoting co-ordination, including its positive aspects of <Col N="1133" /> consultation, linkage forming, co-operation, joint action, inter-institutional and inter-disciplinary action, smoothing out sectoral and demarcation problems and above all preparing the way for a new activity seen to be important for economic and social development.</P>
    <P>Finally, this statement would not be complete without an expression of gratitude to the National Science Council, the body which will be replaced by the National Board for Science and Technology.  The council was set up in 1968 with a very broad mandate which was nevertheless exploratory. The council was very largely left to seek its own role and evolve the kind of job which was best suited to it, and to the more formally constituted body which, it was always anticipated, would succeed it.  It was always intended that after a period of experiment and trial, the question of institutional mechanisms for formulating and implementing policy for science and technology would be reconsidered and the council itself took an initiative here when it prepared its report on science policy formulation and resource allocation.  The pioneering work of the council has cleared the ground and laid the basis for the tasks now to be undertaken by the new board. Without this preliminary work the task of the new board would be that much more difficult and the functions most appropriate to them still the subject of some speculation.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from this institutional aspect, the council has done valuable work right across the scientific spectrum. It has already laid the ground work for further advance by the new board in such disparate areas as energy, environment, marine science and technology and scientific and technical information.  It has also served the country very well in an immense amount of representation work at international level.  I cannot praise highly enough the application and dedication of the members of the council in particular its distinguished chairman, over a period of eight years and I am taking this opportunity of paying them the tribute which they deserve.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> I commend the Bill to the House for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal to restructure the National Science Council in a statutory body as the National Board for Science and Technology was first announced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the opening of the Institution of Engineers of Ireland, 1974, annual conference in the autumn of that year. In his speech at that conference, the Minister outlined the importance which he stated was being given by the Government to investment in science and technology, and indicated that the transfer of responsibility for the proposed new body with its expanded role to his Department highlighted the significance which the Government attached to its successful functioning and the dynamism that was expected of it.</P>
      <P>Many people who agreed with these sentiments and aspirations are disappointed that it has taken over two years to produce this comparatively short Bill which, happily, is now before the Dáil, and many people will hope that the new board will exhibit some dynamism and an imaginative appreciation of the vital role which it could play.  Science and technology are what we live with today, whether we like it or not.  It is essential, therefore, that the encouragement and financing of scientific and technological research and development be promoted to the greatest extent possible. Agriculture and industry, if they are even to remain competitive in today's European Community and in today's world, will depend increasingly on a steadily improving availability of scientific and technological study, educational and information facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of the board, as set out in its proposed functions in section 4, cannot be faulted in any significant degree.  What is not clear is how these are to be brought about, and to what extent encouragement, co-ordination and expansion of existing individual effort is proposed, or how much concentration in new or existing State organisations is visualised.  I would regard this as a vital and important point.  As in so many other <Col N="1135" /> sectors, the problem here is to devise in the best possible manner the roles to be played by private and State enterprise.  There has been a growing tendency over the past few years to neatly label problems and allocate them to a State agency such as IIRS, or An Foras Forbartha, or an Foras Talúntais, and to set up an independent or an inter-departmental committee.</P>
    <P>This is an adequate solution in many cases, but certainly not always.  The danger lies in growing acceptance of it, and hence the tendency, because of precedent, for it to be done automatically without reviewing the skills available elsewhere.  One cannot expect the larger State organisations to turn away such requests, nor yet to involve outsiders in their work.  Some safeguard to a greater extent than appears in the Bill should, in my view, be introduced requiring the board to consult with and take full account of established professional institutions or national bodies, and to consult where possible with them, or with members designated by them, in matters in which they have a particular competence.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the private sector should be encouraged as much as possible so that the role and significance of science and technology are appreciated to the widest extent possible. If the board does not attain the right mix between State and private sector involvement, it will render its own efforts less effective.  Science and technology cannot just be produced.  They have to be diffused in the right way to the right people if they are to be used effectively.  A frustrated private sector will not best encourage this.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister and the Government, quite rightly in my view, feel the encouragement of science and technology is especially necessary here arises to a great extent from our traditional educational system.  For a very long number of years the emphasis has been on what are regarded as academic subjects rather than the more practical or technological subjects.  Up to fairly recently, at any rate, there has been a belief that in some way the <Col N="1136" /> academic subjects were socially superior for those who were pursuing them, and that there was a certain element of inferiority in some respects in the more practical or technological aspects of education. This outlook has changed a good deal in the past five to ten years.  Much of the reason for the change was the effort made in the middle and late 1960s by the previous Government to lay far greater emphasis on technology and its importance and its significance in the community, and its value from the industrial and employment point of view.</P>
    <P>I would hope that situation would continue, but one is a bit perturbed by recent developments in the most important third level institution in the country in the technological sphere.  That is, of course, the NIHE, Limerick, which, as the House is well aware, has had a very unhappy time, to say the least of it, over the past 12 to 18 months.  Many of the original aims of that institute have been blunted to some extent by a forced involvement with the National University of Ireland which was not sought by the NIHE, Limerick, or desired by it or thought by it to be advantageous.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, while the sentiments expressed by the Minister in his speech here are laudable and seek to achieve the kind of things I would hope we would all wish to achieve in regard to science and technology, nonetheless, at the very time this Bill is being promoted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance between them are acting quite contrary to the desires and aims of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as expressed here.  For example, they have enforced a cutback of approximately 30 per cent in the money voted by this House for the NIHE, Limerick, in the current year.</P>
    <P>At the moment in that institution at Plassey outside Limerick, there are no less than 30 vacant offices.  There are 34 staff appointments which were established last year, and for which the money was voted by this House, <Col N="1137" /> but which cannot now be filled because the Department of Education will not allow the full amount voted by this House to be expended by the institute.  The number of students in the institute at Plassey, which, is, of course, our principal third level technological institution, is approximately 350 fewer than it could be if the full funds voted by this House were made available to the institute. It was envisaged that it would be necessary to build a further stage of the buildings in that institute. Now, clearly that is not necessary in the immediately foreseeable future, at any rate, because a large proportion of the existing buildings is not in use at all.</P>
    <P>It seems, therefore, that different Ministers in different Departments take quite different attitudes to technology and to its importance.  I would go along with the attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as expressed in his speech today, and I regret that his colleague, the Minister for Education, does not feel as strongly about the importance of these matters as many of us do.  Apart from the financial constraints that have been put on third level technological education this year, there is the further very important long-term problem for future technological education at third level that at the moment in the Department of Education there is a working party set up to draft the general heads of a Bill which hopefully will be introduced here reasonably soon by the Minister for Education to chart the whole course of university and third level education generally.  There is no representation of the principal technological institution in the country on that working party.  Limerick does not know what is happening in that working party.  I am informed that, as well as Limerick having no representation, there is no technological representation at all on that working party, and that the party consists of officials of the Department together with representatives of the various existing universities and university colleges and representatives of the HEA and the NCEA.</P>
    <P>This is a cause of concern to all <Col N="1138" /> who are interested in the proper development of third level technological education.  In fact, it is a cause for concern to people who are interested in the sort of thing the Minister for Industry and Commerce very properly stressed in his introductory speech.  As I said, I agree with the sentiments he has expressed but regret that there appears to be a different attitude on the part of the Minister for Education.  Hitherto these topics were dealt with, departmentally speaking, to a great extent by the Department of Education and the Department of Finance.  I am led to believe that it was the personal interest of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in these matters we are discussing today which caused the transfer to his Department of the general topic of science and technology and that as a result he is introducing this Bill now. I am told there are considerable misgivings in the Department of Education about the fact that this transfer has taken place and that this whole field is now to be regarded as one coming primarily under the jurisdiction of the Department of Industry and Commerce. I think the difficulty that has been created for everyone is highlighted by the fact and the example I have given of the situation in the NIHE at Limerick, because as I understand the Minister's speech and as I understand the Bill, a major technical teaching institution such as Plassey will, to a very great extent, be funded from public money as a result of the recommendations of this proposed National Board for Science and Technology and will be funded as a result of the priorities which the members of that board will, in their wisdom, establish.</P>
    <P>If there is going to be a conflict, as unquestionably appears to exist at the moment, between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Education in regard to this, the losers will inevitably be institutions like Plassey and the other second and third level technological institutions to which we as a nation must give increasing importance and emphasis if they are to achieve the objectives we desire.  I would ask the Minister to deal in particular, and, if <Col N="1139" /> possible, in some detail, with the conflict which, on the face of it, will almost certainly arise between the priorities being established by this proposed board and the priorities in financial terms of the Department of Education and the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister also, in view of his undoubted interest, in applied technology and the value of increasing our knowledge and teaching ability as a nation in that whole field, to interest himself in the predicament in which the NIHE in Limerick now find itself, to interest himself in the fact that one of the very few, perhaps the only, educational institution in this country which is grossly understaffed, even though there is plenty of room for the staff, and which is under-studented by 300 or 350, is the premier third level technological institution.  This is most regrettable, and this is so at a time when we read in the newspapers yesterday a speech of the president of University College Dublin that for every student whom that college admitted in this academic year, they had to refuse admission to three others.  There is space in Limerick and Limerick is vitally important, not in the educational field alone but in the far wider scope of social, economic and industrial development, leading to worth-while employment for our own people in spheres where traditionally, unfortunately, we often could not get it before, where we had to import technology and technologists and very frequently left our own people to fill the less important jobs in much of the industry we attracted over the past 20 or 25 years.</P>
    <P>The question of patents, while it is not mentioned here, is very relevant to the work of this board and to the work which it might encourage and hopefully will encourage others to do. One of the great difficulties encountered by people doing scientific and technological research is that, if they do make a discovery which is valuable in commercial terms, they are not able to turn their work to at least reasonable commercial advantage for themselves. <Col N="1140" /> The Minister, I am sure, will recognise that the ability to get some reasonable remuneration or financial return from one's discoveries is a major incentive for many people in engaging in work of this kind.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into a long discourse on the problems one encounters in the Patents Office.  It is well known that the delays that can be experienced there are very lengthy indeed and that they are a discouragement to many people to engage in the kind of work that the Minister, I am sure, in this proposed board would like to encourage our citizens to engage in.  Frequently, we have had the situation where people have gone abroad to patent discoveries rather than have those patents done here. The Patents Office comes within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and therefore I would ask him to use his position in that regard to try to improve the situation there in order that the whole development of science and technology in the future might be improved.</P>

      <P>Tá na figiúirí anseo agam.  I gcomparáid leis an mbliain <Col N="1142" /> 1975 nuair a bhí 16,890 ag freastal ar chursaí samhraidh, tá laghdú beag níos lua na 3 faoin gcéad.  I gcomparáid le 1974 bhí méadú agus i gcomparáid le 1973 bhí méadú an-mhór. Faoi mar atá an scéal anois, i 1974, i 1975 agus i 1976 bhí líon na ndaltaí thar 16,000 agus sna blianta roimhe bhí breis agus 13,000.  Dá bhrí sin, tá an tinreamh ar leibhéal 16,000 nó mar sin.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Mar adúras, laghdú an-bheag a bhí ann.  Maidir leis an mheán-uimhir do 1974, 1975 agus 1976 tá na figiúirí ar an leibhéal céanna beagnach, thar 16,000.  Is uimhreacha &ldquo;constant&rdquo; iad.  Níl aon rud aisteach ann ó thaobh an laghdú beag a bhí ann i mbliana.  Tá na figiúirí an-shásúil ar fad.  Tuigimse, cé nach bhfuil aon tagairt sa cheist a chuir an Teachta, chomh mhaith go raibh méadú beag ar líon na ndaltaí a bhí ag freastal ar na coláistí cónaithe i mBaile Brigin agus coláistí mar sin.</P>

Ní h-eol domsa aon ghearán a tháinig isteach i mbliana cuir i gcás.

        <i>Cavan</i>): A survey has been carried out by the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department in order to establish the distribution of the disease in Ireland. Results to date show that it is widespread and occurs most frequently in the limestone regions of the east and southeast.  The elm is not, of course, a major component of the Irish landscape and thus the visual impact of the disease is not at all as severe as it is in Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will have inquiries made into an incident on 5th August, 1976, on the main Swanlinbar-Enniskillen road involving a person (name supplied) who was detained by British soldiers and interrogated for one hour.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's question refers to an incident which took place in County Fermanagh <Col N="1145" /> While the security arrangements in Northern Ireland are, of course, the responsibility of the United Kingdom authorities, they are aware of the Government's concern that disruption and inconvenience resulting from security controls should be kept to a minimum consistent with security considerations.</P>
      <P>The incident to which the Deputy refers was not raised with my Department nor have I received sufficient information to judge whether it would be appropriate to raise the matter with the British authorities.  If the Deputy wishes to supply me with full details of the incident, I shall consider the matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's situation is that his Department have no knowledge of this incident.  The Department did undertake to institute inquiries but they have not been able to find out anything about the matter. If the Deputy will give full details of the incident to the Minister, the Minister will consider the matter further. But he would not undertake, purely on the facts implicit in the Deputy's question, to take any particular action until he knew the circumstances of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it would perturb the Minister.  A security authority anywhere must do its job in the best way it can.  I cannot offer a comment on the way this particular authority is doing its job.  If the person who consulted the Deputy has serious reason to be aggrieved, or any reason to be aggrieved the Minister will consider the matter further.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that Father Rice is still being detained in Argentina.  Repeated representations at high level have been made by our Ambassador in Buenos Aires to have Fr. Rice released.  In addition representations were made to the Ambassador of Argentina to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been advised that Fr. Rice, who has been in custody since 11th October, is being detained in accordance with Argentine law.  To date no formal charges have been preferred against him.  The Minister is disturbed that an Irish citizen should be in prison abroad in such circumstances and continuing efforts are being made to secure Fr. Rice's release, or at least to have any judicial proceedings that may be contemplated in his regard concluded as speedily as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be reassured about that because the protection of Irish citizens abroad in circumstances of this kind would be a normal part of our Embassies' functions. As a matter of course, the Embassy in Buenos Aires would make sure he was properly represented and that everything possible was done to ensure justice and proper treatment. The Ambassador and his secretary have seen Father Rice on three occasions, the last occasion of which we know was only six days ago.  They <Col N="1147" /> may have seen him since then, but if so word has not yet reached the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot offer a comment on or give an assurance about the judicial system of another country. Anyone in custody in a foreign country must take the judicial system of that country as he finds it.  I cannot give the Deputy the assurance that he seeks.  But I do assure the Deputy that the Embassy in Buenos Aires is keeping in touch with Father Rice and the authorities responsible either for prosecuting him or releasing him, and that will include the ordinary humanitarian efforts of keeping people in contact, if that can be done.</P>

      <P>Since the resignation of the postmistress of Tory Island in August, 1976, mail and telephone services have continued without interruption.  A restricted counter service is provided by departmental staff as frequently as the helicopter service to the island permits.  Provision of a normal counter service is dependent <Col N="1149" /> on the appointment of a postmaster. Repeated advertising and a canvass of the island attracted no applicants for the postmastership initially but a number of applications have since been received and are at present under consideration.</P>

      <P>My Department would gladly adopt the course suggested by the Deputy if this could be done without unduly delaying attention to other waiting applications. Unfortunately, this would not be practicable.  To attend to all applications, including very recent ones, in any area where, for example, a telephone was being installed on priority for a doctor, would almost certainly draw justifiable complaints from applicants in adjoining areas who had been waiting for service for, say, two or three years.  If the practice suggested were extended generally construction gangs would spend much longer in each exchange area.  The result would be that many exchange areas and the long outstanding applicants there would have to wait for attention for months later than they would under existing arrangements. There would be little reduction in costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some difficulty in understanding just what the question is that the Deputy is putting.  As far as I can identify it, I will try to answer his initial question in some detail and to explain that the procedure he advocates would necessarily involve the disruption of the priority system and that the priority system is not merely intended to secure just and fair treatment for individual applicants but also that telephones be given where they are socially most useful, as in the case of a doctor.  This procedure would mean that priority applicants in areas other than those which receive collective priority treatment would suffer.  His specific supplementary concerned cost.</P>
      <P>I am informed that there would be little saving in cost arising from his suggestion as, in general, construction forces operate from their headquarters and return visits from their headquarters by the engineering work force would be necessary in any event to clear all the waiting applicants in a village or townland. I am informed that the reduction in cost would be very small and would by no means justify the disruption of the telephone priority system which would necessarily be a consequence of the suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear to the Minister that I am not referring to priorities at all.  I am referring to four applicants in a village.  One did not seem to have priority over the other.  Two applicants have been informed that they are getting a telephone and the two others have not been.  I cannot understand why, when going into that village to install two telephones, they cannot install the four.</P>

      <P>For my part I should like to help the Deputy, but he put down a general question implying the need for a completely new system of operation in the telephone field.  Whereas he did not <Col N="1151" /> specifically refer to priorities the suggestion made by him would necessarily disrupt the priority system on a national scale.  In any case his original question concerned the installation of telephones generally. He now makes specific suggestions about, as far as I can follow, the idea that a priority system was not followed in a particular case or that fair treatment was not extended.  If he would care to put down a question regarding any particular anomaly that has come to his notice or that he seems to have found, I will certainly try to answer that whether directly to him or in the House, whichever he prefers.</P>

      <P>In both the on-shore and off-shore sectors I have taken or propose to take a number of measures and initiatives which will contribute significantly to the development of our mineral resources.</P>
      <P>New rules relating to on-shore minerals prospecting licences were announced in 1976 with a view to more intensive and speedier exploration of these resources.  Active consideration is being given to steps that might be taken to resolve certain difficulties that have arisen in regard to private ownership of minerals and which have been a cause for some concern to companies engaged in prospecting.</P>
      <P>A further development has been the decision announced in the recent Green Paper to revive the State sponsored company, Mianraí Teo., with a view to participation in the development of mineral resources in parallel with and in co-operation with the private sector.</P>
      <P>In accordance with directions issued by me discussions between the IDA and established companies are continuing in relation to the setting up of a zinc smelter to process production from the valuable ore-body at Navan now in course of development.</P>
      <P>I am also preparing policy guidelines to deal with exploration for and development of potential deposits of radioactive minerals, and extensive prospecting facilities have already been offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1154" /> As regards the off-shore sector a further area was designated last July with a view to increasing the area of Continental Shelf within which the State will have rights in regard to the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the seabed and subsoil.  The total area thus designated to date comprises well over half a million square kilometres or more than seven times our total land mass and at its furthest points extends 520 nautical miles approximately from our coastline.</P>
    <P>Until this year exploratory drilling for oil and gas was conducted solely by Marathon Petroleum Ireland Ltd. and by Esso Exploration Inc. under a farm-out agreement from Marathon. Earlier this year I announced that exclusive petroleum exploration licences had been granted to 11 consortia including virtually all the most competent exploration groups in the world. The firm work obligations provided for in these licences ensure a territorially wide ranging drilling programme in our Continental Shelf area covering 43 blocks in the south-west, west, north-west and east.  There has already been some drilling in the limited time available this year and the programme will continue for the next three to four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There are now 13 companies or groups of companies with exclusive exploration rights in our offshore waters.  To date a total of 28 wells have been drilled in the Irish offshore.  The 1976 drilling season has been the most active since drilling commenced off the south coast in 1970.  A total of six new wells were drilled, three by petroleum consortia who were granted exploration licences this year under the exclusive offshore licensing terms which I published in April, 1975.  At the peak of the season, there were four drilling rigs active off the south coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> Detailed plans for the 1977 drilling season have not yet been finalised by all the offshore operators but I would expect that the high level of exploration activity will be at least maintained not only in the areas where drilling was done this year but also extending to areas off the west coast.  This is in keeping with the Government's objective to secure the optimum spread of exploration activity around our coasts within the next few years.</P>

      <P>The only real satisfactory indication is to poke a drilling bit into a reservoir.  This year there was no commercial find.

A great deal of extra information has been received as a result of those bore holes and the interest and optimism in regard to our continental shelf are undiminished.  I should like to add that the Norwegians drilled from 1964 to 1969 before they got oil or gas so that a delay of this kind is not indicative of the erosion of hope.</P>

      <P>I have read the report referred to by the Deputy.  The report states that statistics over a ten-year period do not suggest that use of plastic materials mainly polyurethane foam in the manufacture of furniture has increased the fire risk.  I believe the overall conclusion to be drawn from the report is that polyurethane, like all alternative materials, presents some dangers peculiar to itself but that these are not sufficiently great to warrant restricting the use of polyurethane when regard is had to its manifest advantages such as cheapness, cleanliness and comfort.  At the request <Col N="1158" /> of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards in January, 1975, circularised furniture manufacturers recommending the use of low-flammability materials for covering polyurethane foam padding. Unless further investigations being carried out abroad produce evidence to the contrary, I would not consider that more restrictive action, which would almost certainly increase the price of furniture, would be justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason to be dissatisfied with progress to date in making the conversion to metric units. As I explained in reply to a question in March last, considerable progress has been made in the change over and it could be said that much of the economy is now metric, in some sectors exclusively and in others on the basis that it is a freely available alternative to the imperial system. We should have no great difficulty in complying with the EEC Directive on units of measure which imposes the metric system from the end of 1977 with some extensions to the end of 1979 and the possibility of some limited extensions after that.  A survey of industry earlier this year showed that 52 per cent of firms were mainly metric.  Apart from industry, such areas as education, State purchasing, and the work of State and local authorities generally, are mainly metric. Distributors and consumers have had the benefit of a special committee for some years, and a great deal of promotional material which has had a considerable effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge those trades or industries which have not yet changed to plan now for the change which is inevitable and I would also urge the retail sector to prepare now to play its part in helping to effect the change over smoothly and with a minimum of disturbance.  With the co-operation of industry, agriculture, distributors and <Col N="1159" /> consumers, I have no doubt we can complete the change without the necessity of imposing mandatory cut-off dates for imperial units which would require a change in present Government policy.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my announcement of 23rd September, 1976, a copy of which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Statement by the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the field of higher education in particular and of education generally there is now a considerable body of Government decisions which requires legislative enactment.  I am anxious, naturally to get the legislative processes under way and in order to get on with the job I have asked the Higher Education Authority to set up with me a joint working party to draft the heads of an Education Act.  We have, in fact, set up the working party <Col N="1160" /> which I will chair and which consists of an officer of my Department, the chairman and secretary of the Higher Education Authority and five persons from the university colleges.  I want to stress that the members of the working party are not here as representatives of the colleges in which they serve: we asked for them because of their experience in college administration.</P>
    <P>The membership of the working party could be extended if found necessary.</P>
    <P>The problems of higher education have been under discussion for a very considerable time.  The Government's intentions in the various matters have been before the public for a long time and I have received a very substantial body of comment.  It is fair to say that discussion and comment have gone on for long enough: that it is now time for action.  I intend to move forward on the Bill as quickly as I can.</P>
    <P>September 23, 1976</P>
    <P>Members of Working Party: Reverend Professor Michael Enda McDonagh, BSc, LPH, DD, DCL, Maynooth College, Director of Post-Graduate Studies in Theology; Dr. David Ian Dickson Howie, BSc (ST.

      <P>I am not aware that the position is as represented by the Deputy.  There was no downgrading of music as a subject in the new syllabus which was introduced in 1974 on the recommendation of the Syllabus Committee who are representative of teachers' organisations, managerial associations and the relevant university faculties as well as representatives of the Department of Education.  This syllabus was examined at leaving certificate level for the first time in 1976 and a difficulty arose when university authorities did not accord the same recognition in the allotment of points for results on the common paper which was recommended by the Syllabus Committee as they do for results on higher course <Col N="1164" /> papers.  This matter has been taken up by the Department with the university authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The influence of universities on secondary education is a matter which, as the Deputy will no doubt remember, has been a bone of contention for some time.  I agree with the Deputy that the allotment of points by the universities has an effect on the second level syllabus.  However, I hasten to point out that the allotment of points is not something over which I have direct control but I have asked the university authorities to reconsider this position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will await the reply of the university authorities to my request to reconsider the allotment of points.  There are inconsistencies even within the National University. UCC are understood to allot five points to grade A of the music and musicianship paper whereas UCD offer only three points.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the higher education grants scheme is of little help to students who qualify for grants. In the academic year 1975-76 the amount expended on the grants was £2.4 million and the number of students assisted was 6,168.  The question of increasing the income limits for eligibility is kept under continuing review in the context of available financial resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had time to analyse the figures given, but as far as the income level for qualification for university scholarships is concerned the object is to assess the income limit.  Does the Minister realise that there is such a thing as the income coming into a household as distinct from the family?  There could be a family of one and there could be another family of three or four and the income has not the same effect in the respective cases.  For instance, as has happened, if there are two members of a family who have qualified, the amount allowed by the Department would not satisfy the finishing requirements of one student.  Bearing these facts in mind, I ask the Minister to have another look at the income levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking Question No. 26, is the Minister satisfied that the limit for maintenance, which is now £300 maximum for somebody not living in a university town, is a disincentive to people to take up these grants, considering the inflation situation since 1973, since when there has not been any substantial increase?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the two schools vary considerably, that the subjects those children need are provided in Scarriff post-primary school and that they are not available in the Tulla convent school?  There has already been a precedent in Tulla where on another bus route a Tulla boy was given travel facilities to Scarriff to avail of the technical education which he, his family and his teachers decided was his correct training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The concession the Deputy referred to is on a scheduled service and was given some time ago when it was considered that the subjects available in Tulla were insufficient as far as technical subjects were concerned.  As the Deputy is probably <Col N="1169" /> aware, there have been fairly significant improvements in the range of choice of subjects available in Tulla since that date.  If the Deputy wishes, I can give him a list of the subjects that are now available at junior and senior cycle in Tulla.  The general proposition in the operation of a scheme like this is that you do not have encroachment of services from one school catchment into another. That must be maintained.</P>

      <P>I would like to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that the bus service to Scarriff secondary school goes from the little village of Feakle and a bus service to Tulla also goes from Feakle.  Those children live only three miles from Feakle. Their parents and the teachers from the Tulla area would be very pleased if they got the facilities they think they should get in Scarriff.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary not extend it for approximately eight children a mere three miles from Feakle to Glandree Cross?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation which is there at the moment is the Road Traffic Act which provides for severe penalties for wandering animals, those causing obstruction on the roads.  So far as damage to private property is concerned, that is a complex matter because it involves the question of civil liability and is something which would need a lot of consideration.  Indeed, it might be apt for the Law Reform Commission.  With regard to wandering animals and the question of their impeding or obstructing the public highways, that is already provided for in the Road Traffic Act, 1961.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a matter for the courts in any particular case to decide whether or not a prosecution is well brought.  The Road Traffic Act, 1961 has been effective in bringing successful prosecutions for obstruction in respect of wandering horses. So far as the criminal element is concerned, <Col N="1172" /> it is dealt with there.  As I said, the civil element is a more complex matter.</P>

    <Title>National Board for Science and Technology Bill, 1976:    Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was speaking about the difficulties encountered by many scientists and technologists in the Patents Office.  I was asking the Minister if it was possible for him to take steps to reduce substantially the delays that occur there which themselves are a disincentive to the kind of work the Minister is endeavouring to promote through this Bill and through the establishment of this proposed board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the board to have some powers also to do something towards having the results of Irish technology and science put into commercial production in this country. Perhaps the most notable recent example we have had of this is the very fine work done by Professor Timoney of UCD at the request of the Army when he developed over a number of years, beginning in 1970 or early 1971, a new type armoured car which is regarded apparently by military experts as being superior to anything else of its type available on the world market at present.  All the development work and the technological work for that was done in Ireland by Irishmen under Professor Timoney's direction, and it has been a source of great disappointment to many people to find that the actual building of the commercial models, as opposed to the prototype of this vehicle, is now being carried out in Belgium.  I hope the board will have some powers to encourage, as far as possible, the commercial exploitation of the results of Irish technological and scientific work and invention here for the benefit of our people.  It is regrettable that something which is potentially a great carner of foreign currency, such as this, should be developed for the most part abroad apparently, due to <Col N="1174" /> factors that I am not clear about.  If it was possible to build three prototypes here one would imagine that it should be possible to establish some kind of assembly line that would enable commercial production to take place here.  If the necessary backing, financial and otherwise, was forthcoming, perhaps that could have been done and perhaps at this stage can still be done in regard to that vehicle.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that while the science budget that would be prepared under section 5 of this Bill would be laid before the House and would presumably be open to discussion by the House, it would not be passed, or the money voted in that form by the House for scientific and technological work, but that the actual votes for each specific item would form part of the existing Votes which would be, I presume, in the Departments of Education and Finance and perhaps Agriculture and Industry and Commerce and a number of other Departments. I can see the technical reasons why that should be so, but the Minister will agree that if it was possible to do it it would be much more satisfactory that a science budget would be brought in here and that it would not become operative until it was passed and the money voted in the process of passing that budget.  That would allow us to discuss all technological and scientific advancement in this country in the kind of way that the Minister wants it co-ordinated by the establishment of this board. A very much more meaningful debate might take place and we would see more clearly where we are going if the money was voted in the science budget rather than voted separately under various headings for various Departments.</P>
    <P>If the money is to be voted separately, as suggested, we are going immediately to run up against the difficulty that I referred to earlier of, for example, the NIHE in Limerick, where it might be the wish of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and of the proposed National Board for Science and Technology that that institute would play a very prominent <Col N="1175" /> part indeed, as I believe it should, in third level scientific and technological education.  However, the view of the Minister for Education, and presumably his officials, is apparently different, and when money had to be saved this year this unfortunately was one of the areas in which there was a cut back.  The institute were not paid the full amount of money they had been led to believe at the end of last year that they would get.  It was included in the Estimates for this year and was voted by this House for this year.</P>
    <P>It seems that there is, therefore, a contradiction in the Government's priorities.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is here today with this Bill pushing a certain set of priorities with which I agree; on the other hand the Minister for Education is establishing different priorities.  This Bill, therefore, and this proposed board will give rise to certain conflicts of this kind. These conflicts should be avoided if possible by laying down in the legislation who is to predominate and to make the final decisions.  If the money for an institution such as the NIHE is to come out of the Department of Education Vote they in the last resort are the people who hold the whiphand, and if they decide to put into the Estimate only so much, that is that, and the possibly quite contrary view of the National Board for Science and Technology and of the Minister for Industry and Commerce presumably will not then prevail and we will not achieve what the Minister quite legitimately is setting out to achieve, a co-ordination of our efforts in science and technology generally and the prevention of these conflicts and of different priorities in different places.</P>
    <P>The Minister might well bear in mind also that in many countries where there is a vast technological and scientific knowledge a great deal of that advanced knowledge derives from the fact that institutes and boards such as the proposed one we are talking about are very frequently heavily financed by private industry and from private sources.  The USA is perhaps the best example of that.  The reason, <Col N="1176" /> of course, is that the USA, which gives little or no Federal or public help to institutions of this kind because it is not really necessary, have tax laws which are geared to encourage industrial and commercial firms and wealthy private individuals to fund boards and projects of the kind we are talking about.  Our tax laws really give no help at all to people who want to assist work of this kind.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the need for assistance at the technological and scientific level in regard to both research and development in Ireland is probably greater that it is in almost any other western country.  If the Minister for Finance were to take a more liberal view than he does and traditionally has done in regard to the funding of work of this kind we would very rapidly get a quite generous return in terms of scientific and technological advancement.</P>
    <P>Science and technology are the aspects of learning generally that are most easily applied.  They have the greatest application and this is particularly important for us in terms of giving employment at a time when a very large number of people are unemployed. I hope these aspects will be borne in mind by the Minister between now and Committee Stage and that we might have some amendments that would meet some of the difficulties I mentioned.</P>
    <P>The last 20 sections of this Bill are really formal sections dealing with the setting up of boards of this kind generally.  As the Minister has said and from what I can see from reading the sections, I do not think they differ materially from the sort of formula that has been used in relation to a large number of other State bodies.  Therefore, at this stage I do not propose to deal with them because they do not go to the root of the proposals of the Minister.  I shall have some comments to make about individual sections on Committee Stage but I do not think it necessary to deal with them now.</P>
    <P>Subject to what I have said and, in particular, to the conflict of priorities that seems to exist between the Department of Education and the Department <Col N="1177" /> of Industry and Commerce &mdash;in regard particularly to the NIHE and to a lesser extent to some of the other second and third level technological institutions&mdash;generally I welcome the proposals of the Minister as set out in the Bill and in his speech.  He is on the right lines and if the Department of Education are on different lines, irrespective of what they may think themselves, they are on the wrong lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should allow myself first to regret that we have not had more discussion of this Bill.  I am not referring to the Opposition in that regard but to the House as a whole. It seems awful that if there were politics or conflict involved we would have plenty of contributions.</P>
      <P>This is a profoundly important Bill.  Part of our weakness in the area of science and technology is that the public&mdash;in this instance the public as represented by Deputies on all sides&mdash; are not as convinced of its importance as I am.  On the other hand, although we have not had a lengthy debate I have been very interested in the points made.  I have been interested that Deputy O'Malley who by training I understand is not a scientist still seems to have the feel of what this is all about.  I will not always be able to agree with the points he made but they were all serious ones and I will try to answer them <i>seriatim.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One theme arose from the Deputy's disappointment at the delay of two years.  He talked about the appropriate form of institution, the power it should have and the possibilities of conflict.  Those threads all hang together through what he said.  He said he was disappointed it took so long and so am I.  This Bill is not enormous but part of the reason for that was precisely a reason of discussion, explanation, persuasion and reassurance so that people in existing organisations with existing identities and boundaries did not feel threatened, did not feel a <i>gauleiter</i> for science was going to come along, cutting across departmental boundaries and wrecking things.  It was not the complexity but <Col N="1178" /> the need to convince people, often with patient discussion and explanation, that this was the best way of doing it.</P>
    <P>I am sorry it took that length of time.  The great danger is that we produce not more co-ordination which we need, but confusion, chaos, wreckage and hostility.  I have said before that I get more insight into the workings of the body politic and of the economic system from my knowledge of animal behaviour than I do from reading history or biography. Where you have an existing institution of any kind, whether it is a political party, a Government department, a scientific institution, a theatre or a farm, there is always a sense of defending its independence and boundaries. There is always a little ritualised, hopefully only that, conflict at the boundary with other organisations. This keeps everybody on his toes and is not a bad thing but very easily it can get out of hand and have a non-productive conflict.</P>
    <P>Scientists and technologists are like everybody else.  Science permeates everything.  We come back to the question of who should present this Bill.  The argument was made and was accepted by our predecessors that this should be in the Department of Finance.  That had a certain logic. Since the Department of Education are so profoundly involved in science, especially in the teaching rather than in the application of technology to the economy, you could say it should be there.  You could say it should be in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries; that is where our greatest need is and in the past it is where there has been our greatest effort. You could say having regard to what is happening in communications throughout the world it should be in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. They have important communication information network inputs into any scientific effort.  You could say it could be in the Department of Transport and Power because there is a tremendous amount of science and technology there.  All of those arguments have an aspect of truth.  It has to be put somewhere. <Col N="1179" /> There is also the argument that it should be put in the Department of the Taoiseach since it applies to everybody and there is some sense in that.</P>
    <P>I am happy to affirm a personal interest in science and technology.  I have spent my life in a certain area of it and I am very interested in the application of technology to economic change but it was not simply a question of my personal interest.  It was that the crucial thing was to get existing and new knowledge to bear on the economy.  It was the relationship between the economy and the scientific and technological knowledge that was crucial.  Therefore, it was science and technology in the service of economic progress that was the crucial thing.  It seemed to us that perhaps the Department that had responsibility for industrial development, although not for agricultural development, was as appropriate a place as any and more appropriate than most.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley said he did not think the objectives could be faulted; the question was how they were to be attained.  I am afraid there is no magic about this, there is no enormous speed. We have had the predecessors of the NBST, the National Science Council, functioning since 1968 with some people to whom I was very happy to pay generous tribute.  They were good people and they worked very well. What they have done is to build policy slowly and to build interconnections slowly because if you try to have the dramatic plucking of certain major targets out of the air your chances of doing wrong are very great indeed.  If you try to rush the formation of interconnections and trust between people, then you produce the opposite of what you want to achieve.  You produce fragmentation and distrust and you make the work very hard.  The task is very much a co-ordinational one.  For the benefit of Deputy O'Malley and the benefit of people generally who need reassurance, perhaps I should refer now to what I said in my opening statement.</P>
    <P>The board may itself engage in activities, but that is subject to the <Col N="1180" /> approval of the Minister.  One of my principal concerns in this connection will be that it should not undertake activities which could more appropriately be carried out by another institution.</P>
    <P>When we are searching in an nonpartisan way for the best methods we have to be very, very careful to avoid duplication.  Let me give a specific example of what I mean : I was very happy and interested in watching and commenting and, indeed, at one time in broadcasting in the formative days of the Institute of Agriculture.  This organisation has done an immense amount of good.  I admire its vitality, its courage and the quality of its work. They have a momentum, and esprit and an individuality of their own. Their preoccupation is that this new thing coming along, answerable to another Minister, will in some way undermine their unity.  Now that is a very real preoccupation and it is one I understand.  We have seen examples all over the world of people setting up competing institutions in the same areas and frittering away funds.</P>
    <P>The task is one of planning, co-ordinating and disseminating.  Those right at the coalface, if I may use that expression, of scientific discovery or new technological application should be in those institutions, be they third level, be they the pure institutions, be they laboratories in individual departments, or be they, as I would wish them to be, in the industrial workshops where knowledge can be used to make a better product, improve a product or make a cheaper product, so that the application, participation and practice of the development of science and technology permeates the whole of our economy, industrial and agricultural, public and private.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Malley that we have to find the best possible division between the public and private sector and we have to see that we do not add a false relationship where people in the private sector wait for things to be done for them and feel they can call on institutions to do things for them.  The received information from outside one's own factory, or one's own science or one's own <Col N="1181" /> particular discipline in agriculture is never as good as what is generated indigenously.  We do not have to have centres of generation of knowledge.  We have to have technological change by the application of science permeating everything and it ought to permeate the Department of Posts and Telegraphs just as much as it ought to permeate a farm, a creamery, the way that my Department manages its documentation, or the way that people make motor cars.  It is simply a way of approaching problems and, if you isolate into particular places and think you can do the job in particular places rather than permeating the whole of the economic structure, then you are less efficient.</P>
    <P>We could establish new structures too easily and if we establish them as generators in new science or new technology then we would be precisely producing a sort of conflict and chaos and duplication and, therefore, the sort of waste of resources we should avoid in a poor country.  This is something against which Deputy O'Malley correctly warned.  That is a danger but, with this structure and with these guidelines and, may I add, with the selection of people for the new board we can, I think, avoid that.  It is a small board.  Ten, by our standards, is small. I profoundly believe that if you genuflect towards every interest group&mdash;you do not exactly say &ldquo;Send us a nominee&rdquo;; you more or less say &ldquo;Give us a few names&rdquo; and they give two or three, and it is Buggins' turn, and you get 25 people&mdash;then you get a sort of grey result.  They do not work very well and I personally do not like that sort of board.  If one wants a board to act and change things it has to be cohesive and quite small so that it will not break into subgroups or sub-boards. I would add the proviso that it has to be chosen in a totally non-partisan way on the basis of excellence. It has to represent the private and the commercially-oriented sector just as much as the public and educational one because we are concerned with that bridge and with the pushing out of scientific knowledge into all sectors of our whole economic system.</P>
    <P>We can, I think, agree about the <Col N="1182" /> bias Deputy O'Malley mentioned in our educational system.  Again, I do not want to talk about him being a lawyer but, coming from that side of the division between Science and the Arts, if I may put it that way, then I am particularly happy here because we have looked on the workplace and technology as somehow being less respectable than some of the older professions. We have done that to our detriment and we have skewed the balance of our syllabus in our secondary education with those preconceptions in mind to our detriment and there is now a wide recognition that that is a mistake.  There is excellence and there is the reward of skilful work in a particular area in which one labours and this ought to be the situation in a properly oriented society where people are mobile and get away from snobbery and do not attach greater respectability to one avocation as compared with another. We are moving towards that.  It is a liberating development.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go into the question of the NIHE in Limerick in any detail.  It was mentioned by Deputy O'Malley.  I will not try to avoid mentioning it completely because this gives me the opportunity again to point out a danger and to make a clarification. If the NBST, through the science budget, were to be the supreme arbiter &mdash;Deputy O'Malley asked who is to predominate&mdash;in the area of third level technological education and if they were to predominate you would have a formula for total chaos and for a war between two Departments and this Bill would not have come in in two years or maybe 22 years.  What we have done, I think sensibly and practically, with the difficulty of definition at the boundary, as there often is a boundary, is to say that those aspects of any 2nd, 3rd or 2½ level, like the regional technical colleges, of what they do which are educational are the responsibility of the Minister for Education and this board and myself, as Minister, have no say and want no say.  In those matters which are matters of research, particularly the sort of research that involves technological application, we have responsibility. <Col N="1183" /> That is where the dividing line is.</P>
    <P>I have been a teacher and a researcher. Good teaching requires that a bit of research goes on and good teaching sometimes brings pupils into the research.  It is not a perfectly clear-cut dividing line, but then neither are many of the other dividing lines we operate quite successfully from time to time.  We are not trying to be <i>gauleiters</i> over the universities, third level institutions or regional technical colleges because we do not need new institutions at all.  What we need is co-ordination and we need an overall view so that rational planning can be done.  If people will not do the co-ordination and the rational planning voluntarily because they recognise the common good and because the whole contour of the problem is set out for them, there is no way we can coerce them to do it.  To set up a new super-institution to force them to do it would not be any good either and would smash a lot of existing institutions which have their own traditions, momentum and disciplines and with which I do not think one should lightly interfere.</P>
    <P>For the record, I want to indicate a difference in emphasis in my thinking about the NIHE Limerick. Deputy O'Malley referred to it as our principal third level technological institution and mentioned third level technological education.  We inherit a past where the binary system operated, where we had a technological strand and an academic strand.  The agreed educational policy is that we move away from the binary system, not in disruptive, sudden, hasty or coercive ways, but by long-term planning, by agreement and by the evolution of institutions.  I am convinced that we ought not to at third level make the division into technological and other. The people who are doing a technological thing in their working day would benefit from being educated and going to debating societies, dances and other curricular and extra-curricular social activities that go on in third level institutions, and by mixing with people <Col N="1184" /> of the other disciplines.  The separating of the technological strand from the rest is the perpetuation of the two cultures which we can see has come into existence, for example, in the United Kingdom and has done a great deal of damage.</P>
    <P>Although there are great institutions in the world, like Caltech and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which have done superb things in the development of science and technology, the evolution even of those institutions, however they came into existence and whatever they are called, is towards making them into balanced third level organisations, putting in the Arts, if it was purely technological in the past, or, if it was purely an Art place, putting in some technology.  We need to break down that separation. There are different ways of working, but culture is an entity.</P>
    <P>I have probably spoken as a Minister more often in NIHE Limerick than in any other third level institution in Ireland, including the university of which I am a staff member.  I feel great interest and excitement in this development. I regret that exigencies has prevented its funding and growth as rapidly and as generously as I would have wished.  I can see no other conflict with any other Minister or Department if I say that.  I would not like to think of it developing forever with the target of remaining even the best third level technological institution in the country.  I would like to think of it not accepting that one half of the binary system but of being a total third level institution.</P>
    <P>I have to have a role in third level institutions through responsibility for science and the Institute of Agriculture, but that does not make me either the Minister for Education or the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I do not want to be nor do I want to usurp any of their powers.  Were I to try to do so I would make this sort of progress impossible.  I would wreck the whole thing.  What I can do is try to produce co-ordination, the flow of knowledge and the evolution of policies.  If that becomes coercive or an effort to build an empire, or to grab responsibility from one Department for something <Col N="1185" /> they have built up, then it becomes self-defeating.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley asked me to interest myself in the NIHE Limerick and I reaffirm my interest.  I am not reaffirming it, or never did affirm it, in conflict with any other Department or any other Minister.  The possibility of conflict is inherent in the ministerial system.  We are 15 people.  We have demarcation disputes between Departments all the time.  If any of us in this or any other Government is dotty enough to drive those to the point of destruction, it is perfectly easy to smash the whole thing.  We have seen instances of that in other countries in recent times.  One must assume a certain modicum of common sense on the part of all the participants. If that is denied or somebody is getting paranoid, of course it does not work.</P>
    <P>Let me come back to the science budget because this raises the same question.  If we gather into a single document all the expenditure, then we can see the strengths and gaps, we can see the wood as well as the trees, and strategy as well as tactics.  If we present that to a Government and to an Oireachtas, hopefully there will be debate, growing understanding, what we are overdoing and what we are not doing at all.  We will get our balance, our expenditure and money better, and avoid duplication.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons as a management to, an understanding to, a planning to the preparation of a science budget, is a very useful thing.  That half is positive.  But think in real terms. Were I to say that in regard to the expenditures for research on communications I wanted to do them and not the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, or in regard to the Institute of Agriculture I wanted to do it and not the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, or in regard to educational research or economic and social research, which seems to me to be a part of science, that I wanted them, or in regard to energy research that I wanted to move in on the Minister for Transport and Power in the ESB, and Bord Gáis, the Nuclear Energy Board and so on, all I would do is <Col N="1186" /> disrupt government and make the enactment of this Bill impossible.</P>
    <P>In a sense I would like to say that I would be happy to do it but I would not really be happy, because I know perfectly well I could not do it.  I know too that the effort to do it would be simply disruptive and would defeat the first half of my intention with the science budget, which is to see the whole area and to enable strategy to evolve.  It must be remembered that that does not evolve in Government Departments or in the heads of Ministers. That will evolve in the board. They are the people who will have to evolve it slowly.</P>
    <P>While I understand the wish that says : &ldquo;Yes, push the science budget beyond being a record and a planning device, so that instead of doing the funding through the individual Votes of individual Ministers you do it collectively in a single science budget&rdquo;. My answer is that that would not work.  There would be terrible difficulties deciding what was and what was not science.  If it were done that way, it is clear where the Institute of Agriculture should go.  There are other activities of a research kind embedded in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  That is the Department I speak about most because I knew most about it when I was not a politician.  Where do you separate some of the things of a research character that are done within the structure of that Department?  That observation applies to many other Departments.</P>
    <P>I am not unsympathetic to that idea in theory, but in practice it would produce the opposite to what Deputy O'Malley and I wish, namely, instead of producing cohesion, co-ordination and a calm overview so that you could spot the priorities and the weaknesses, and correct the weaknesses, it would be productive of the sort of conflicts we both want to avoid.</P>
    <P>There are a few smaller points to which I wish to refer.  Regarding the Patents Office, I agree with the Deputy's observations; but in saying that I am not in any way criticising the people who have worked hard <Col N="1187" /> there.  The system is one that has built up during a long period but it has performed too slowly.  I am not apportioning the blame for this to individuals but it is a fair description of the situation.  However, I am glad to be able to tell the Deputy that a reform is in hand which, it is hoped, will overcome the weaknesses that he identifies correctly&mdash;the weakness of delay and, consequently of discouragement. We are well advanced in having the situation put right.</P>
    <P>On the question of finance from the private sector, it is the situation in America that not only can scientific and technological research be funded to a large extent from the private sector but that country's funds are so vast and their benefactors so thick on the ground that it is possible to fund universities privately.  In our situation that is something that is unthinkable. Apart from that consideration I have a firm belief that those companies which have some cash to spare&mdash;and this means only that they are profitable and the more profitable they are the better from the point of view of their growth and re-equipment&mdash;should be encouraged to plough back that cash into the business rather that to be told to give it for the use of others.  Deputy O'Malley said that there is almost no help given <i>via</i> the tax laws.  While the help given may not be specifically towards science there are write-offs and allowances of a reasonably generous kind for activities which are chargeable within the present tax laws. I am glad that this situation exists and I am not claiming it to be an innovation of ours.  Therefore to suggest that no help is given in that area is not true. Expenditures which can be written off are best spent within the company on product development and on technology transfer but it might be worth considering the point Deputy O'Malley makes regarding the private individual who after a lifetime of commercial success wishes to do something useful by donating money.  While I am not Minister for Finance I would imagine that what the Deputy has in mind would not cost very much in terms of lost funds but might produce some <Col N="1188" /> money for areas in which we would like to help.</P>
    <P>To return to the question of conflicts and contradictions in priorities, Deputy O'Malley referred to there being no provision in the Bill as to who was to be the predominant figure in decision making.  It is right that there is no such information available because if any one Minister were to predominate, we would have chaos and confusion.  The task of the board is that of planning, co-ordinating and conciliating.  This job involves interchanges and these, in turn, involve correlation, the avoidance of conflict, of duplication and of waste resources of people and money.  Consequently, it is not the job of any Minister to predominate at the decision centre. Certainly, the Minister for Education has a role.  So has the Minister for Finance and other interested Ministers. Somebody must take formal responsibility but he must resist the temptation to use that responsibility at the expense of other people.  There is no person who will predominate in this case in the sense of one Minister <i>vis-à-vis</i> another.  Neither is there any contradiction in priorities except to the extent that between different Departments there are always contradictions.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries would like to be given more resources for development. I, too, would like more money for the development of industry. The Minister for Education must fight his corner.  The same goes for all the other Ministers, but the Minister for Finance must stop all our spending enthusiasm.  As a human being each Minister will regard his Department as having priority, but as a politician as well as a human being each must reconcile that with the needs of his colleagues and of the Government as a whole.  It is the same as running a family or a business.  I have been in the universities all my life and I have never yet met a university teacher who did not consider his subject to be the most important of all subjects taught at the university. Neither have I ever met a school-teacher who did not consider his subject <Col N="1189" /> to be the most important on the curriculum.  However, that does not prevent people from getting on with each other or from getting on with the work.  The way that we avoid conflict is by the sort of mechanism we have set up.  Were this mechanism to have more power, which is what Deputy O'Malley seemed to be saying, it would be less effective because it would produce precisely those conflicts that we are all anxious to avoid.</P>
    <P>I have not been convinced by Deputy O'Malley's arguments, like the argument, for example, that I should strengthen the science budget and do it as a single Minister rather than to spread it among all the Departments. However, we have some time yet as we shall not be seeking the remaining <Col N="1190" /> Stages of this Bill today.  It would be hasty to do so.  Having said that I am not one to rule out the idea that Deputies across the floor can improve Bills so if the Deputy is not pleased with what I have said we can consider amending the Bill at Committee Stage. In fairness, though, I should point out that on balance he has not convinced me and that to do as he suggests would produce an end result opposite to the one for which we both wish.</P>
