    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the speech of his Parliamentary Secretary at Rathfarnham on 29th March, 1976, represents Government policy on State enterprise in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the Parliamentary Secretary's speech as an exhortation towards community self-sufficiency and as urging the full appraisal of proposals before action is taken on them.  I would recommend the speech for consideration by every Deputy and constituent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the principles enunciated in the speech are in direct conflict with those enunciated on behalf of the Labour Party about a week previously by Senator Brendan Halligan; and can the Taoiseach reconcile the two diametrically opposed views and tell us which, if either, is the view of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no obligation to reconcile any views of Deputies or Senators.  This is a debate on economic planning and obviously it is a matter on which different views are bound to be expressed.  Indeed, as the Deputy is aware, his own Leader expressed somewhat similar views to those of the Parliamentary Secretary in a speech some days later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state in relation to each of the four named industries which the Taoiseach recently announced in New York (a) when the industry concerned was first in touch with the IDA, (b) when the industry concerned decided to establish in Ireland, (c) when the industry will be at full production and (d) when the buildings in which the industry will operate were constructed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The four new projects announced last week in New York were Thermo King for Galway, Analog Devices Inc. for Limerick, A. O. Smith for Bray and Blue Bell Inc., which will set up a project in Ballyhaunis and also in Galway.</P>
      <P>While the Industrial Development Authority through US officers had been in touch with these companies for some time the companies only came forward with specific proposals late last year and early this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Thermo King project is scheduled to reach full production by 1985; the A. O. Smith project by 1981; and the Blue Bell project by <Col N="888" /> 1979.  A time schedule for full production has not yet been reached with Analog Devices Inc. but full production for phase 1 of the project is expected to be reached by the end of 1978; full production for the complete project should be reached by 1983.</P>
    <P>All of the projects will initially, at any rate, move into existing factory premises and production is expected to commence this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that one of the firms he mentioned, Thermo King, which proposes to establish in Galway, sent out a circular to Irish subcontractors at the beginning of October, 1975, announcing that it was establishing in Ireland and asking them to quote for certain subcontracting work which they wished to have done?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that this is five-and-a-half months before the announcement that was made in New York by the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the circular referred to by the Deputy, but I can tell him that detailed proposals were not made by the firm to the IDA until 26th January, 1976.  These were approved by the IDA board on 19th February and grants were approved by the Government on 12th March, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the circular here&mdash;and I am prepared to give it to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;which shows it was sent out at the beginning of October, 1975, and which announces that they were establishing a manufacturing facility in Ireland and asking for quotations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having a statement from the Deputy rather than a supplementary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was made perfectly clear&mdash;and this was reflected in the reports both of <i>The Irish Press</i> and the <i>Cork Examiner</i>&mdash;that negotiations had been taking place in a general way with the IDA with all these firms for a period of about 18 months.  But what is important is, first of all, the Government agreement to the precise <Col N="889" /> package of grants which, as I say, in this case did not take place until 12th March, 1976.  What is even more important is the agreement of the firm in question that their commitment should be announced, and in all of these cases that agreement was not forthcoming until the week prior to the announcements being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware from the list he read out and, indeed, from the announcements that were made by this and other firms that the great bulk of these jobs which were announced with such a fanfare will not arise until the mid-1980s, and is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there is a growing need for jobs at present and not in the mid-1980s?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is either entirely misrepresenting what I said or he was not listening, because I indicated that in only one of those cases could the mid-1980s be said to be the date and that case was Thermo King and it was the date of full production. In fact, two of the projects will reach full production in 1978 and another in 1980.  In the case of Thermo King, production will commence around July, 1976, Analog, August, 1976, A. O. Smith, September, 1976, and Blue Bell, June in the case of the Ballyhaunis project and July/August in the case of the Galway project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What will be the net creation of new jobs arising out of this, bearing in mind that each of these firms is going into a factory which recently closed down with a considerable loss of employment?  Will there be any net jobs created when the loss of the corresponding jobs is taken into account?</P>

      <P>I am sure that, on reflection, the Deputy will appreciate that I could not possibly agree to give details of security precautions in relation to mail trains since to do so would be playing into the hands of criminal elements in our society.  The matter is, and has for a considerable time been, the subject of constant consultation between the Garda and the interests concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the same reason, and also because, of course, the Garda Síochána are investigating the matter, I cannot undertake to make any detailed statement in regard to the particular train robbery referred to by the Deputy but I think it is only right to refer to one <Col N="902" /> particular aspect of that case which I understand Deputy Collins has commented on publicly, and that is a report that an armed member of the Garda Síochána normally travelled on that train but was withdrawn on the occasion the robbery took place.  That report was erroneous and was, in fact, promptly denied by the Garda Press Office.</P>
    <P>As regards the armed robberies in the Dublin area on 26th March, the number reported to the Garda was four.  Nobody has yet been charged with any of these four crimes but investigations are, of course, continuing.</P>
    <P>In more general terms, I think it right to say that, in the context of a threat of armed raids, the protection of cash, whether it be in banks, offices or other places of that kind, or in transit by train or van or even by hand, presents problems that are very much more complex than are apparent on the surface.  The amount of money that has to be moved from place to place in a modern economy, the frequency of such movements and the great variety of circumstances in which it has to be moved are such as to pose security problems of quite alarming dimensions.  We could, quite literally, treble our present police force and still be very far from being able to guarantee protection against such raids.</P>
    <P>Our society is based on certain unspoken assumptions, one of them being that armed criminals are not going about in such numbers or such manner as to cause a serious threat to the daily life of the country.  If, for any reason, that assumption ceases to be valid, we as a community will have to face some very hard questions. Stringent laws would be unavoidable. The provision of armed guards at every vulnerable point, even if our society could afford it, would involve a basic change in the kind of society we have had.  It would mean a large move away from the concept of the Garda Síochána being an unarmed force and, paradoxically, perhaps, would be liable to lead to an increase rather than a decrease in serious crimes of violence.  It would also involve a large diversion of resources badly needed for other purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> I do not mean by this to imply that nothing can be or is being done in the short term to combat what is going on. The contrary is very much the case but I cannot, for obvious reasons, go into details.  I have good hopes that what is being done will be successful but I think because of the amount of public worry and concern that exist that it would be wrong of me not to point out the difficulties and flag the legal changes that might have to be made but which we would prefer to avoid.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is common knowledge at present that there was not a guard on the train and that every person in the country from the age of the use of reason upwards knows this to be a fact?  Why has the Minister not got available to him the information with regard to the amount of money taken from the train?  Can he further say if other trains carrying similar vast sums of money are unguarded at the present time?  What would the actual cost be of paying two men to be on guard duty on a particular mail train, such as the one which was robbed?</P>

This would be getting into the realm of detail in the security area which would be undesirable.  As I said in my reply to the question any such information would only be playing into the hands of criminal elements in our society.  As to the cost of having an armed guard <Col N="904" /> am I correct in presuming that the Deputy means an armed garda and not an armed civilian?</P>

      <P>The cost of having armed guards present would not be a factor in deciding whether or not they should be present.  It would be a matter for the professional judgment of the Garda themselves.  I have an amount here but I am not sure if it is the complete amount.  I do not want to give it to the House until I am satisfied it is accurate.  I will check it and I will send it to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Minister is hiding behind the mantle of security in that he is not prepared to say certain things for security reasons.  Is he aware that the bank robbers knew full well what the situation was and also that it is common gossip now? Everybody knows that since the robbery there has been a guard on the train, that prior to the cutback on Garda overtime by the Minister and the Government, there was a guard on the train.</P>

      <P>Those statements are not correct so far as the information I have is concerned.  I can only repeat that I am not prepared to say what trains are guarded and what trains are not guarded.  As I said in the main reply to the question, there is a large amount of movement of cash throughout the country at frequent intervals.  There is movement by various means, by road, by rail and by hand.  We have in the country a number of determined criminals who have been affected by the cult of the gun which has spilled over from Northern Ireland.  It is not a great matter for them to be able to make deductions as to where movements of cash are likely to take place.  I repeat what I said to the House that should circumstances warrant it, should our society be changed in such a way that we can no longer make an assumption that we will be free of armed gangs roaming the country, then we will have to look at our entire legal and police positions.  In the meantime certain measures are <Col N="905" /> being taken which I hope will be successful in curtailing future raids. Should they be unsuccessful, I may have to come back to the House and make suggestions which nobody in my position or, indeed, nobody in the House would welcome.  I hope it will not come to that.  I hope that those who are engaged in these nefarious activities will realise the community will not tolerate their conduct.</P>

In addition duplicates of the freehold and leasehold registers for the particular county as well as an index of the names of registered owners are maintained in the local offices.</P>
      <P>Presumably what the Deputy has in mind however is the setting up of regional offices which would fulfil all the functions in respect of a particular region at present fulfilled by the central office.  This is a complex question which involves detailed consideration of a number of factors, the obvious ones being cost and efficiency.  The study group which I reconstituted in April, 1974, to review the organisation and procedures in the Land Registry will furnish me with a report on the matter in due course.</P>

It is a fact that it is not possible to proceed this year with the projects the Deputy has mentioned and that the intensive care unit and the psychiatric unit can operate only on a day clinic basis.  With regard to the Ballybane school, the position is much the same.  The project will cost in the region of £1 million and its establishment is a matter that has been going on for a long time.

There is also an agreed reduction in the provisions for medical equipment, pathology, heating, furniture and maintenance, amounting to £170,000. In the community services there is elimination of locum cover except for assistance officers, representing a saving of £82,000; replacement of ambulances and dental equipment, £39,000 and in the central services a saving on locums for clerical staff of £12,000; a saving on training and advertising of £12,000.  There was additional income which had not been provided for by the health board of £17,500, making a total saving of £524,000 on £905,000.  There is still a gap of £381,000.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if complaints have been made to him by public representatives and private individuals concerning the demolition of part of Midleton Hospital, County Cork; if he will ensure that the demolition is discontinued pending the investigation of the complaints; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I have not received any such complaints.  The position is that one block of the old county home at Midleton was in a bad state of repair. It was also a fire hazard and involved a heavy maintenance liability.  The patients have been transferred to new welfare home accommodation.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board recently applied for planning permission for the demolition of the block mentioned and I see no reason to interfere with their decision.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy claimed disability benefit in June, 1973 in respect of incapacity certified as &ldquo;bursitis of knee&rdquo; and was paid this benefit for the period of his incapacity from June to September, 1973.  Following representations made on his behalf in October 1973 regarding his entitlement to benefit under the occupational injuries scheme in respect of the period for which he had been paid disability benefit, an injury benefit claim form was sent to him for completion.  When this form was returned it was erroneously filed with the disability benefit claim papers and did not again come to notice until December, 1975.  Necessary inquiries from the claimant's employer regarding the origin of the incapacity have now been completed and it has been decided that injury benefit is payable to the claimant in respect of the period in question. The amount of disability benefit already paid in respect of the period has been treated as paid on account of injury benefit and a cheque for the balance has been issued.</P>

      <P>Yes, The circumstances were that he applied in 1973 for disability benefit.  That was paid and after he had returned to employment he queried his right to benefit under the occupational injuries scheme.  A form was sent to him and when the form was returned a mistake was made in the Department and it was filed with the disability benefit claim and taken as a closed claim.  Inquiries were reactivated in December, 1975.  We heard nothing in between.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the newspaper report referred to by the Deputy.  These documents related to periods in the sixties and had been set aside for destruction in accordance with the procedure laid down for the destruction of confidential documents. The circumstances in which the documents were not sent for destruction and in which they came to be found on a Dublin street are still under investigation.  Pending completion of inquiries I have nothing to add to the statement already issued by me in the matter through the Government Information Services, except to say that my Department have taken all necessary steps to ensure that there will not be a recurrence of such an incident.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>All documents, as far as I am aware, have been recovered through the offices of the Garda Síochána and the offices of the Department of Social Welfare.  I am satisfied that the documents have been dealt with in a way that will ensure they do not come to public notice in the manner they did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary say when the investigation he is now conducting will be completed?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary inform the House of the conclusion of this investigation?  The Parliamentary Secretary issued a statement, through the Government Information Services, suggesting that many of the documents concerned contained documents of a trivial nature, but will he, on reflection, say whether that statement is true or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Obviously, I regard it as being true if I included it in a statement that I made to the public in general.  The investigations going on as to how the documents came to be in a public thoroughfare <Col N="917" /> are complicated by the fact that the documents were found in a building that ceased to be used as a public building or for the purpose of handling any public or State business in 1972.  Some of the officers who were then with the appropriate department which at the time catered for the employment exchanges have been transferred while others have retired.  It is to ensure that all the necessary information available is given so that an accurate conclusion as to how this matter arose can be arrived at that there has been some delay in finalising the report.  I expect the report will be issued to me in the immediate future but as it is an internal report it is not my intention to publish it.  Two weeks ago the Deputy stated in the Dáil in relation to this matter that he was not raising it for the purpose of a witch-hunt but in order to ensure that there will not be a recurrence of this nature and that is another reason why it is not my intention to publish the report.</P>

    <Title>European Council Meeting: Statement by Taoiseach.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I should like to make a statement to <Col N="961" /> the House about the meeting in Luxembourg last Thursday and Friday of the European Council of the heads of state or Government of the member states of the European Communities, accompanied by their Foreign Ministers.</P>
      <P>The main items discussed by the Council were the economic, monetary and social situation in the Community, direct elections to the European Parliament, the report by Mr. Tindemans on European Union, and a number of other items particularly matters concerned with the foreign relations of the Community.</P>
      <P>Much of the discussion on the economic, monetary and social situation was concerned with the stability of currencies.  As Deputies will be aware, there have been sharp fluctuations recently in the value of the £ sterling, the French franc, the Deutschmark and the Italian lira. These fluctuations may seem remote from our ordinary everyday concerns but let me emphasise that a continuation of the instability of recent years could have the most serious consequences for international trade.  Since imports and exports are equivalent to more than 90 per cent of our gross national product any sizeable interference with such trade could affect our economy.</P>
      <P>There was a general recognition at the Council&mdash;and this was a new and from our point of view, very welcome feature&mdash;that it is unrealistic to see exchange rate fluctuations as a substitute for measures to reduce disparities between the levels of development of the economies of the member states.  We did not get as far as discussing in any detail such questions as the policies or the amounts of the transfer of resources from the richer to the poorer countries necessary to reduce these disparities.  However, it emerged quite clearly that there was little enthusiasm among the most developed member states for large Community assistance to their weaker partners in the present economic climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dual themes of Community solidarity and economic discipline or <Col N="962" /> responsibility also came through in proposals discussed at the meeting. These involve the concept of sanctions where member states fail to carry out Community guidelines for their economic activity and policy.  I should emphasise that under these proposals, the Community guidelines would be agreed by member states in advance.  An interesting feature which this country would certainly welcome is that the guidelines would be set in an agreed medium-term framework. Our attitude to the proposition about sanctions is necessarily one of reserve as it seems likely that any such sanctions could affect the richer and poorer member states in a quite disproportionate way.  However, the proposal is indicative of the realities with which we are faced and underlines the need which I and my colleagues have been stressing to get our inflation under control.  The problems in the economic field and the Commission's proposals were remitted to the Finance Minister for the serious study they require.</P>
    <P>There are over five million persons wholly unemployed in the Community and 1½ millions on short-time working. I made the point that there are two types of unemployment&mdash;cyclical and structural.  The first can be cured by demand management policies and I supported the Commission's call for those states who have decided on expansionary action to implement their measures as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>Structural unemployment is, to us in Ireland, a familiar problem.  However, accelerating technological change and the growing shift of some industries to lower cost countries, as well as high labour costs, are now creating serious problems of structural unemployment throughout the Community which cannot be dealt with by ordinary counter-cyclical policies.  I urged that we should all tackle this Community-wide task together.  The meeting asked the Commission to put in hands a study of remedial measures immediately.</P>
    <P>We went to Luxembourg, faced with various proposals on the allocation of seats in a directly elected <Col N="963" /> European Parliament, including a French proposal that would have sharply reduced Ireland's proportion of the Parliament's membership.  At Luxembourg, President Giscard d'Estaing put forward an alternative proposal that, in effect, accepted our position.  This, of course, was that unanimously adopted by the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities&mdash;that our proportionate representation, so recently settled in the Treaty of Accession, should be maintained.  The French President's proposal was that the present size and composition of the Parliament be maintained.  While we would wish for good reasons to have a larger number of members than the present ten, the proposal met our main concern and was accepted by me.  In the event, it did not prove possible to reach agreement on the issue.  The positions of Italy, Britain and Denmark raised difficulties which it was not possible to resolve at the meeting.</P>
    <P>This will, I know, be a source of keen disappointment to the House. It must be accounted the one clear failure of the Luxembourg meeting which the European Council had itself set as the deadline for finalising the text of the convention on direct elections.  The delay raises doubts about the feasibility of holding these elections in May or June, 1978, as agreed in Rome.  However, it would be premature to write this off as a possibility.  If the outstanding problems could be settled speedily&mdash;say, by the July meeting of the European Council&mdash;the target might still be feasible.</P>
    <P>The third main item discussed was the report on European Union prepared by Mr. Leo Tindemans, the Prime Minister of Belgium, to whom we are all indebted for the way in which he discharged a daunting task. There was, of course, no question of expecting final decisions on so fundamental a matter from the Luxembourg meeting.  Indeed, I was the first to speak on this matter and I proposed that the report be examined in detail and decisions taken at the next <Col N="964" /> or second-next European Council. This was agreed.  Much of the work will be done by the Foreign Ministers as members of the Council.</P>
    <P>In Luxembourg, I spoke in some detail on the principal proposals in the report, relating to a common Community approach to foreign relations and the development of the institutions of the Community, emphasising that the broad thrust must be to develop the supra-national character of these institutions.  Debate on the report's proposals on economic and monetary union had, I may explain, become tied up with the wider discussion of economic and monetary matters.  I do not propose to go into detail on the report as I hope that the House will have an early opportunity of debating it in conjunction with the motions on the Fifth and Sixth Reports on the Activities of the European Communities which are on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>I also raised the question of the revision of the Community's fisheries policy.  I stressed the importance of conservation for the future of the industry throughout the Community. I suggested that a combination of substantial exclusive zones reserved to coastal fisheries and a quota system not related solely to historical experience, but which would take full account of development and of the needs of coastal regions, would provide a firm basis for a new policy.  I hope that the interventions on this matter will give an impetus to its consideration in the Council.</P>
    <P>The European Council also agreed declarations on Rhodesia and on the entry into force&mdash;on 1st April&mdash;of the Convention of Lomé, the terms of which were approved by the House fairly recently.  We also adopted a resolution conferring the title of Honorary Citizen of Europe on M. Jean Monnet, in recognition of his services to the cause of European integration.  I am arranging for the early presentation of these texts.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to return briefly to the role and significance of these meetings.  They are primarily occasions for exchanges of <Col N="965" /> views, enabling those who head the Governments of the Community's member States to reflect together on the problems of the Community and on foreign policy matters of common concern to the Nine.  On some major issues it is certainly appropriate to look to the European Council for general orientations, in discharge of the role that is, in my view, most appropriate to it as a Community body, that of giving an impetus and lending the authority of Heads of State of Government to the progressive development of the Community.</P>
    <P>It is wrong, however, to look to the Council meetings for detailed plans or concrete measures.  Indeed, any development of a role of this kind would be, I believe, inimical to this country's interests.  Inherent in the operations of the European Council is the danger that the Community's decision-making process could tend in the direction of inter-governmental co-operation, to the detriment of the procedures and institutions established by the Treaties which it is in this country's interest&mdash;and, I believe, that of the Community&mdash;to maintain and develop.</P>
    <P>However, simply to meet and exchange views is not enough, especially in the current situation where the economic position remains grave, progress towards European integration is stalled and even existing Community achievements are under threat.  In these circumstances there is a need for positive guidance from the European Council.  While I did not have great expectations, the outcome of the Luxembourg meeting was perhaps a disappointment.  Nevertheless, it has put in hands further work in the economic and monetary spheres and on European Union, which could be of great importance if properly developed.  The task of building Europe is a continuous process.  In assessing progress it is perhaps best to look not at the outcome of a single meeting but at the results over the full span of Community activity over a period of time.  By the end of this year it should be possible to make a fair assessment and to set the outcome <Col N="966" /> of our meeting last week in perspective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the custom to have a debate on a report made by the head of Government on his return to the national Parliament.  As the Taoiseach has stated, there are motions on the Order Paper which will give an opportunity for debate later on.  If the leader of our party were present he would have to express on behalf of his party and the country the grave disappointment raised by the lack of any positive action by these summit meetings.  The Taoiseach rightly expressed that disappointment himself. Indeed, he made an effort to produce a report that might be in some way heartening.  From a study of the report, which I was grateful to receive ten or 15 minutes ago, one can only come to the conclusion that these summit meetings tend to get further and further away from the spirit of the Treaty of Rome.  The only positive thing this summit did was to pass a resolution of recognition to Jean Monnet for the part he played in European integration.  Otherwise the meeting was an insult to his great work in founding the Community. The summit is regarded by the people as a sounding board for national parliaments to create propaganda for home consumption.</P>
      <P>We will have other opportunities of discussing it, but it is disappointing to find that the three major items for discussion by the summit have been met with such indecision and complete procrastination.  Indeed, there is no sign of any harmony in relation to them.  The elections to the European Parliament will not&mdash;and the Taoiseach is being very careful in suggesting that they might not&mdash;take place as arranged in 1978.  This would now be impossible.  We are not likely to get the representation which we and France would be prepared to accept unless we assert ourselves positively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must forget this whole question of looking to the European Community to do something about our economy.  The answer is emerging clearly from these meetings&mdash;the same answer which was given to the <Col N="967" /> Minister for Finance in America&mdash; that each nation must look after its own inflation and put its own house in order before they can expect the stronger members of the Community to come to the assistance of the weaker members.  When we are seen to be doing our homework, we can then expect the stronger member States to do something for us.  It was a disappointing summit meeting and one that has left the people dismayed at a time when they were hoping for some flicker of light at the end of the tunnel.  It is a sad reflection on how the Community is being allowed to develop.</P>

      <P>I would like to stress this party's position on this motion. As the House is aware, we opposed this proposal when it was originally introduced and this is a request to the House to extend the trial period.  We at this stage are equally opposed to the whole method of introducing these proposed changes.  We made it clear at the outset that this was a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, as established by precedent, and those are the lines that should have been followed.  Why this should be taken into the House and bulldozed through without having been properly discussed and agreed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to put on record our opposition to this motion, because this proposal to have a trial period extended could easily be interpreted as our acquiescence in allowing it to remain.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1965 the State acquired the British and Irish Steam Packet Company <Col N="969" /> Ltd., the principal object being to ensure effective Irish participation on the Irish Sea in the interests of trade and tourism.  The purchase price was £3,600,000.  The issued share capital of the company at that time was £1,600,000.</P>
    <P>The assets of the company at the time of their takeover by the State consisted principally of three vessels, the old <i>Leinster, Munster</i> and <i>Innisfallen</i>, which carried passengers, goods and livestock and a limited number of cars, four cattle/general cargo vessels, the <i>Kilkenny, Meath, Dundalk</i> and <i>Glanmire</i>, and two general cargo vessels, the <i>Wicklow</i> and <i>Inniscarra.</i> These vessels were for the most part out of date and ill-adapted to meet the developing needs of sea transport.  In particular they could not cater for the revolutionary change from general cargo to containers, nor for the emerging trend towards the roll-on/ roll-off movement of passenger cars and freight vehicles.  The new board of the company in consequence found it necessary to embark on a thoroughgoing policy of modernisation, involving the acquisition of three new roll-on/roll-off passenger ferries, four container ships and a roll-on/roll-off cargo ship.  In addition it was necessary to invest in new specialised berths and terminals to cater for containers and ferries, as well as to acquire a stock of containers.  The capital expenditure involved amounted to over £23 million.  Very nearly 80 per cent of this investment was financed by loans or longterm leases or agreements.</P>
    <P>Following an investigation of the company in 1970 by consultants who reported that undue proportion of the B &amp; I's capital resources was made up of loan capital, an extra £3 million share capital was taken up by the Minister for Finance under the British and Irish Steam Packet Company (Acquisition) (Amendment) Act, 1971, bringing the issued share capital of the company to £4.6 million.</P>
    <P>Even after the raising of the issued share capital to £4.6 million, the capital structure of the company still reflected a substantial imbalance between share and loan capital.  As <Col N="970" /> against a total capital expenditure of over £23 million, the equity content of £4.6 million represented only 20 per cent leaving a disproportionate share of 80 per cent made up of loans and similar forms of financing.</P>
    <P>This loan orientated capital structure is throwing an unduly heavy burden on the company by way of interest and principal payments.  For example, the company achieved a net profit of £281,000 in 1974 after allowing for financial charges of £1,000,000 in that year, and will record a further surplus of £139,000 in their 1975 accounts after allowing for financial charges of £1,400,000 in that year.</P>
    <P>The need for further share capital at this juncture was established by reports from consultants engaged at the behest of the Minister for Finance, who have undertaken a review of the company's operations and of their prospects and financial outlook up to the end of the decade.  The consultants made clear that, apart from share capital needed to restore the loan/ equity balance, it was likely that a requirement would arise for substantial additional capital towards the cost of any further expansion of the scope of the company's activities, or of the replacement or renewal of the vessels of the fleet or of terminal facilities.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I have deemed it advisable to take the opportunity to provide scope in the present legislation for meeting possible future needs of the company as well as their present requirements, and accordingly I am, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, seeking the agreement of the Oireachtas to empower the Minister for Finance to take up a further £15 million share capital in the company.  In effect, the company's authorised share capital is being increased by this amount.</P>
    <P>Apart from what is needed to restore a reasonable loan/equity ratio, the B &amp; I Company will also require capital to help finance the acquisition of an additional car ferry vessel.  They have, in fact, in the past week, made a formal proposal to me to order another car ferry to be built at <Col N="971" /> Verolme Cork Dockyard for delivery in 1978.  The matter is under active consideration at the moment in consultation with the Minister for Finance and I would hope to be in a position to make an announcement shortly.  The company propose to have two vessels on the Cork/Swansea route, complementing the two operating on the Dublin/Liverpool service.</P>
    <P>I believe that I should avail of this occasion to undertake a general review of the B &amp; I's activities, especially in the light of the investigations recently conducted by consultants.</P>
    <P>The company's operations come under two main heads, passenger traffic and goods traffic.  Passengers&mdash; both foot passengers and motorists&mdash; and cars are carried on two carferries, the <i>Munster</i> and the <i>Leinster</i>, operating between Dublin and Liverpool, and on a third, the <i>Innisfallen</i>, operating between Cork and Swansea. These services are, of course, of vital importance to Irish tourism, offering as they do the most economic means of transport from our main market.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the company's car ferries in 1968 their carryings have increased spectacularly, for example: passenger carryings have increased from 360,000 in 1968 to 576,000 in 1975; car carryings have increased over the same period from 43,000 to 110,000, and the number of wheeled units moved has increased from 5,157 to 27,459.</P>
    <P>The company have maintained this growth pattern despite the effects of the Northern Ireland trouble on tourist traffic from Britain and the downturn in the Irish and British economies.  In the context of an overall expansion of the market the company believe that the prospects for continued increase in the overall numbers of sea passengers are good.</P>
    <P>The second part of the company's operations is the carriage of cargo.  At the present time the B &amp; I operate a container service from Dublin to Liverpool, as well as a weekly service to Rotterdam and Le Havre.  Container services entail the use of custom-built container ships, together <Col N="972" /> with elaborate terminal installations at ports.  In addition, the three car ferries provide all year round capacity for the carriage of roll-on/roll-off goods traffic.  About 12 months ago, the company undertook, jointly with the British firm of P and O, who provided the ship, a roll-on/roll-off cargo service between Dublin and Fleetwood.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I are the major carriers of freight on the Irish Sea moving almost one million tons of freight a year between Ireland, Britain and Europe.  They carry 30 per cent of all traffic on the Irish Sea and this includes exports for onward shipment to many parts of the world.  They offer a truly comprehensive service catering for every customer requirement. The most significant development has been in the field of roll-on/ roll-off freight which is growing at the rate of 20 per cent per year.  This trend has been accelerated since Ireland's accession to the EEC.  It is significant to note in the context of the company's freight activities that their average price for moving goods has risen by only 22 per cent per ton since 1966 compared with a rise in the consumer price index of 120 per cent over the same period.  In actual money terms, the average charge per ton of freight carried was £5.13 in 1966 and £6.27 at the end of 1975.  When it is considered that these figures ignore the fall in the value of money over the interval, it is very obvious that the real cost of shipping a ton of freight across the Irish Sea has fallen sharply over the period.</P>
    <P>Following the economic downturn resulting from the fuel crisis at the end of 1973 the company reorganised their services to match frequency and capacity more closely to current demands. At that time the company reduced their container operation into Liverpool from two ships to one ship and transferred traffic to the new joint service to Fleetwood which the company commenced in April, 1975, in conjunction with the P and O Company.  This had the added benefit of achieving a significant degree of rationalisation of freight services on the Irish Sea and at the same time <Col N="973" /> allowed the company to provide capacity for increased roll-on/roll-off freight demands.</P>
    <P>Two special factors, one adverse and one helpful, may be noted.  There is a basic imbalance between the volume of goods conveyed from Britain to Ireland, and from Ireland to Britain.  The fact that there is more empty space on eastward-bound cargo ships than on westward means greater competition for traffic on the former, to the benefit, no doubt, of the Irish exporter, but at the expense of the carrier, while the imbalance of volume also militates against the most efficient use of vessels, containers, pallets and other facilities.</P>
    <P>The more favourable factor, from the viewpoint of the B &amp; I, is the growing trend towards roll-on/roll-off traffic at the expense of container traffic.  The advantages offered by roll-on/roll-off to the customer have led him to utilise this mode increasingly, despite the higher charges levied, which are more economic to the shipowner.  This development is consequently beneficial to both parties.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I were acquired by the Government with the intention that it should continue to be operated as a commercial enterprise and this objective has been adhered to.  The development programme undertaken by the board of directors involved the construction of new terminals at Dublin, Cork, Liverpool and Swansea; three new car ferries, the new <i>Munster</i> and <i>Leinster</i> operating Dublin-Liverpool, and the <i>Innisfallen</i> operating Cork-Swansea, and five new freight ships, the container vessels <i>Wicklow, Kerry, Sligo</i> and <i>Kilkenny</i> and the roll-on/ roll-off vessel <i>Dundalk</i>, were constructed; of these the <i>Wicklow</i> operates Dublin-Liverpool, and the <i>KilKenny</i> Dublin/Le Havre/Rotterdam, the <i>Kerry</i> and the <i>Dundalk</i>, with Irish crews are on charter abroad, and the <i>Sligo</i> is no longer employed by the company; new road transport fleets and a pool of 3,500 containers and trailers and extensive terminal equipment were required.  Staff had to be <Col N="974" /> retrained and new business obtained. Today we see the fruits of this programme:</P>
    <P>Present turnover of the company amounts to £19 million, two-thirds of which revenue is earned abroad; it employs 1,500 people&mdash;1,200 in Ireland; its annual expenditure on goods and services in Ireland is £10 million; its expenditure at Verolme Cork Dockyard since 1969 has been £10 million; its expenditure at Liffey Dockyard since 1969 is £1.4 million.</P>
    <P>The company have had an excellent record in the field of personnel relations.  They have developed the concept of works councils in their organisation and these now form a real part of their communicating and decision-making processes.  In 1975 all the employees of the company, in recognition of the difficulties likely to face the economy in 1976, agreed to defer any increase which might emerge out of any new national wage agreement for 12 months.  This would represent an interest free loan to the company which would be repayable from future profits.</P>
    <P>In retrospect it would seem to me that, having regard to the extensive scheme of modernisation which the B &amp; I had to embark upon in the sixties, the capital resources with which it was provided by the State at the outset were far from adequate, and the company have never really been able to compensate for this initial handicap.  If the company are to continue their progress, a further allocation of capital is now urgently necessary.  The figure of £15 million provided for in this Bill will enable the company's loan/equity ratio to be restored to a reasonable balance and at the same time make provision for the financing of a further car ferry vessel.  I should make it clear at this stage that all that is being done is that the maximum authorised share capital which the Minister for Finance is empowered to subscribe is being increased by £15 million.  It is the intention that the money will actually be made available in instalments from time to time in this and future years only according as it may <Col N="975" /> be required to meet the immediate needs of the company.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this Bill which will enable the Minister to increase his capital investment in this company.  We sincerely hope that he will be able to subscribe the capital in the present economic situation.  We would also like to congratulate the company on their performance and achievements since they acquired the coastal services of a certain company in 1965.  It makes a pleasant change for the Minister, as well as ourselves to speak of a semi-State body which is still able to make a profit.  As I said, the company are to be congratulated and we hope their performance will continue.</P>
      <P>We also recognise the vital contribution the company are making to tourism and the economy.  They are the main carrier of tourists on the Irish Sea.  The number of passengers carried last year, 576,000, is a large percentage of the total passengers on these routes. They carried 110,000 cars&mdash;a magnificent performance.  It is good to hear that they have such confidence in the future that they propose to extend their services.  If they do that, they will help our economy and the tourist industry by giving them a much needed injection.</P>
      <P>The Minister went through the company's records very fully and it is not necessary for any of us to say very much about them.  We realise that the company cannot continue meeting the loan repayments of 1.8 million over the next five years if they are to expand. As they said, the company must provide an additional car ferry for the Dublin-Liverpool and Cork-Swansea routes.  The increase cost of tonnage is 400 per cent while freight rates have risen by only 22 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also welcome the announcement that they intend to place their order with Cork dockyard.  This is reassuring in the view of recent experience with Irish Shipping who created new employment in Japan.  We are delighted that B &amp; I will not make any move towards getting their ships built in <Col N="976" /> Japan.  As we pointed out at the time, the figure for Irish Shipping was false because of the drastic drop in the £ against all hard currencies, including the yen.  It would be very interesting to hear exactly how much these ships will cost.  Taking into account the drop in the £, even in the last two weeks, I feel certain the figure will be far in excess of the price quoted at the time. At the rate the £ is devaluing, the figure will probably be even higher than the quotation from Cork Dockyard. This should have been foreseen by the Government and the company. It was not too difficult to foresee this, and we pointed it out at the time.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping are providing increased employment in the Japanese shipyards instead of protecting the numbers employed in the Cork Dockyard. The B &amp; I proposal, together with the Irish Shipping order, would have made a great contribution towards reversing the unemployment trend and providing more cash flow into that area. It was a grave error and we are delighted it is not being repeated on this occasion.  It should never have taken place.  This company have made a very substantial contribution to the Exchequer.  In 1975 they provided £934,000 in pay through all the company's operations.  I am sure this is very welcome to the Exchequer. As the Minister pointed out, they also enjoy very good personnel relations. It is very welcome to see a company and their employees getting on so well.  They have 1,500 employees, of which there are 1,200 employed in the country.  They also spend a lot of money on goods and services which they require.  A very important feature of their operations is that 66 per cent of their revenue is in foreign currency. This is very important for our economy.</P>
    <P>This company have for some time been seeking duty free facilities on the Irish Sea.  There is no reason why such facilities should not be provided to this company.  They are the only people operating between EEC countries which have not these facilities. This facility is already provided between Shannon Airport and England if you fly direct.  I cannot <Col N="977" /> understand why this facility is not granted to the B &amp; I on the Irish Sea. The company estimate that this would bring in an additional income of £4 million.  It would help to give a further stimulus to the freight industry. I ask the Minister to look into this matter and take whatever action is necessary to afford those facilities to the B &amp; I on the Irish Sea.  I do not know who is stopping this facility being provided to them.  It should certainly be granted.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the company on their achievements since 1965 and I hope these will continue. I look forward to their expansion in the manner it is being proposed with a view to helping our economy and the country and also in the next year or two providing increased facilities for tourists to come and spend more money here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Barrett, I would like to welcome the introduction of this Bill.  Its introduction is an endorsement of the wise decision made by the Fianna Fáil Administration in the sixties when they decided to take an interest in the British and Irish Steampacket Company.  At that time they foresaw our entry into Europe and the necessity for this island nation to have secure shipping facilities.  They very wisely became involved with the British and Irish Steampacket Company. The introduction of this Bill, increasing the share capital up to £18 million, follows on that wise decision.</P>
      <P>The Government are merely providing an enabling measure and are not providing the money.  The Minister said that this money would be made available in instalments.  What sort of instalments will be made? When will the money be made available to them?  If the situation is as bad as it appears at the moment in relation to the balance between equity and loans surely the necessity for the money is obvious now?  A very large first instalment should be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to see that the Minister has announced that the B &amp; I intend placing an order for a new car ferry with Verolme Dockyard for <Col N="978" /> delivery in 1978.  It must be very obvious that there is a need to have any future vessels required for any of our shipping companies built in Ireland. It has been reported in today's papers, in relation to British Rail, that because of inflation and sterling devaluation the 9,000 ton ferry for the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route, at present being built in Denmark, will cost an extra £2 million.  When the original order was placed the cost was £12 million but it has now gone up to £14 million.  This experience, together with the disastrous decision made by Irish Shipping to have ships built in Japan, indicates that in the future we must build our ships in Ireland.  Despite the short term attraction of lower foreign tenders it has now been proved that this has been eaten away by the drop in sterling and because of inflation.  When ships are built in Ireland there is the extra bonus of providing badly needed jobs in Ireland in a highly labour intensified industry.  We should insist that the construction of ships required by any of our State-sponsored bodies be carried out in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Everybody must be proud of the B &amp; I success story.  They have a very necessary role to play in the tourist industry.  In 1974 the company carried 99,500 cars and approximately 548,000 passengers.  This is a major contribution to the tourist industry. The company were very far seeing when they introduced their drive on/ drive off facilities.  The Minister for Transport and Power could make a very major contribution to further expansion of the B &amp; I if he was prepared to do something this side of the House has spoken about on many occasions and something which is common in many European countries, that is facilities for reduced petrol prices for tourists.  This could be done on a coupon system.  The coupons could be bought on the B &amp; I ferries or any other ferries coming into the country.  If we were prepared to provide petrol at a cheaper rate for tourists it would be a great attraction and would result in more money being spent by tourists here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett mentioned the provision of duty free facilities on the <Col N="979" /> B &amp; I.  They are the only remaining link in any of the EEC countries without such facilities.  This can be said not only for our ships but also for our airplanes.</P>
    <P>I put down a question approximately two years ago to the Minister for Finance on this matter.  He said the British Chancellor was not in favour of it.  We are an independent nation. Surely we are capable of making independent decisions.  We should have duty free facilities on our ships and airplanes.  It has been estimated that this would provide an extra £4 million to £5 million worth of business.  It would considerably increase the employment potential of United Distillers, our own Irish company.  It would increase our cigarette trade.  Other trades would be improved considerably.  It would bring extra money into these businesses if duty free facilities were provided on our ships and on our airplanes. Aer Lingus should be allowed to provide this facility.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I have been very progressive in their approach to the provision of new facilities and new ships and nowhere better than in their drive-on/ drive-off service.  They made gains by the introduction of that service.  They have a large portion of the tourist market on the Irish Sea.  In their examination of their future plans, they should consider providing a facility which is provided on the English Channel between Britain and France, that is, a hover-craft service.  B &amp; I must have had this in mind because they set up a subsidiary, Irish Sea Hovercraft Ltd.  So far there has been no trading with that company.  In the future the provision of a hovercraft service on the Irish Sea should be looked into.  It has proved very successful on the English Channel.  I have no doubt it would prove very successful on the Irish Sea routes as well.</P>
    <P>Being an island nation in the EEC, we must have a very efficient sea network and sea link.  B &amp; I have a major role to play in freight.  I congratulate them on the way they have met this challenge so far.  I encourage them to even greater efforts in the future.  The success of this company <Col N="980" /> has been due in no small way to the co-operation and liaison between the staff and management.  I should like to record my congratulations to the staff on a job well done, not only in the way they have co-operated with the management but also in the way they have looked after the travelling public.  They have set a headline for many other semi-State and private companies in the effectiveness of their works council. The chairman of the board, Mr. M.J. O'Keeffe, in his address at the annual general meeting last April commented on this.  I should like to echo what he had to say.  B &amp; I transformed a loss in 1973 to a profit of £281,000 in 1974. I was delighted to hear the Minister announcing there will be a further profit in 1975.  This is due to the co-operation between management and staff.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I believe that I should avail of this occasion to undertake a general review of the B &amp; I's activities, especially in the light of the investigations recently conducted by consultants.</P>
    <P>I will throw out an idea to the Minister and I should like to hear his comments on it.  I have no definite views on the matter myself but I should like to hear the Minister's comments. We are a small nation.  We have two shipping companies, Irish Shipping and B &amp; I.  They are both semi-State companies.  I should like the Minister or his advisers to examine the possibility of having some link between the two companies.  Irish Shipping are involved in deep sea operations and B &amp; I in local and European operations. The situation is similar in the airline business.  Aer Lingus operate the European line and one of their subsidiaries operate the American line.  I think they are called Aerlínte.  Is there any possibility of a similar type of liaison between B &amp; I and Irish Shipping?</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and his colleagues in Government, having introduced this measure here today, to make the money available to B &amp; I so that they can go from strength to strength.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of what I want to say will be by way of question.  I <Col N="981" /> also welcome the Bill to provide this money.  I support Deputy Burke in his plea that the money should be made available at once.  This firm are very successful and deserve well of the country.  The Minister said the consultants were particularly exercised by the imbalance in the loan equity situation and that the provision of this money is, in great part, intended to bring a better balance between what is borrowed and the equity.</P>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister what terms of reference those consultants had.  Were they in a position to examine the possibility of the use of other ports by ships, either existing ones or, if the existing ones are too big, ports like Drogheda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy say &ldquo;boats&rdquo; or &ldquo;ports&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Ports.  Listening to the Minister's statement one heard about Dublin-Cork and Cork-Dublin.  No other place in Ireland is involved.  Was there a general consideration by the consultants of the use which could be made of other ports, even in the west of Ireland apart from the traditional and historic ports on the east coast?  I know the economics of this would be very important but, with the steep rise in the cost of road transport, there might be sense in operating with small vessels from the west to the east coast.</P>
      <P>I should like to add my word of exhortation to the Minister about duty free facilities.  I have had correspondence from the United Counties Association in Britain, an association who are pushing this very strongly.  The Minister should give it serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position with regard to the roll-on/roll-off service seems to be satisfactory. I wonder whether the Minister heard any complaints from personnel in this service, and particularly in the meat service.  Has there been any unnecessary interference by the Customs and Excise people or the security people in the working of B &amp; I?  If the Minister thinks there might be economic benefit from it, I suggest that, if <Col N="982" /> his consultants did not consider the point about other ports when they were examining the company, since the employment situation is so grave, he might ask a firm of consultants to examine the question of extending activities to other ports, if necessary getting smaller vessels, thus providing extra employment which is badly needed. When I was working in Donegal I remember seeing small coal ships from Holland operating to places such as Letterkenny up stretches of the Swilly. The story there was that it was the only place where ships travelled by meadow. From a distance it appeared as if the ships were moving between fields and it looked rather mysterious.  If B &amp; I could expand their business in that way it would be to the advantage of the country.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the House for the warm welcome for this Bill.  As I pointed out earlier, it is to redress the loan capital equity of the B &amp; I Company.  As I stated when I spoke initially on this matter, this had got seriously out of balance during the years because of the capital structure of the company.  An injection of capital was given in 1971.  Since then the assets have grown enormously; both the onshore and floating assets have been replaced, modernised and updated.  This work was done largely by borrowing loans and we have now reached the position where too much of the profits are being eaten up by loan charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is a shareholder in the company and the Government took a decision that I should be empowered to bring in this Bill. However, before doing that, they said that for the purpose of giving effect to this decision the consultants' firm of Mergers Limited, a subsidiary of the Industrial Credit Company Ltd., was engaged to advise the Ministers to review and check the estimates and assumptions of future trading activities the revenue prepared by B &amp; I for the period up to 1980, on which the anticipated capital requirements of the company were based.  This was just to check that it was purely to do with the ratio of loan capital to equity capital. It had nothing to do with the day-to-day <Col N="983" /> administration of the company, with trading with different ports which the board decided to carry out.</P>
    <P>I anticipated that the proposed new ferry to operate on the Cork-Swansea route would be welcomed by the House.  As I pointed out last November, on the Private Members' motion regarding Irish Shipping, it was intended that it would be built in the dockyard.  I thought that the Opposition would not be able to resist reintroducing the topic of the purchase of the two ships in Japan. Either they do not know the facts, they have forgotten them or they choose to ignore them.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out last November, and it is still true today, the Verolme Dockyard could not take an order at that stage.  There was a bottleneck in the shed which would not be free until the end of 1976.  The Department of Defence have given an order for a new fishery protection vessel and this will carry the company through until the early months of 1977.  I pointed out that this would be done when we were discussing the Private Members' motion and I also said that it will be followed by an order for the B &amp; I car ferry.  Even though the order must be given reasonably soon, it will come on-stream for construction in the early months of 1977 and it will carry the company through until the middle of 1978.</P>
    <P>Although the Opposition ignored it, Verolme said that if the sequence of events occurred in this way they would consider Irish Shipping were quite correct in giving the order to Japan.  The joint cost of the two ships ordered in Japan is less than the cost of the B &amp; I car ferry.  One of the ships will be launched in July this year and the other in October of this year, both before the Verolme Dockyard were ready to take the order. Verolme Dockyard could not accept the order until the end of 1978 but the ships ordered in Japan will be earning money for Irish Shipping long before that time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred to the relationship between the yen and the £. <Col N="984" /> In the order for the car ferry and in any order given to Verolme, for a reason I do not understand&mdash;the previous Government came to this arrangement&mdash;25 per cent of the cost must be paid in Dutch guilders.  It is not a sterling transaction and it is subject to currency fluctuations. There is no escalation clause with regard to wages in the Japanese contract but there is such a clause in any contract given to Verolme.</P>
    <P>The attitude of both companies was quite correct.  The most important thing that can be said is that the dockyard won the contract in their own right because they were more capable and had better prices than any of the six other yards who were asked to quote for the car ferry. They won the contract in their own right; it was not steered towards them against the will or inclination of another State company.</P>
    <P>The Opposition cannot continue to come here and say that taxes are too high but that we must spend more money.  They never seem to see the contradiction in this.  The Government can only get money by raising taxes.  They must clear their minds on this point: they cannot advocate cutting taxes while calling for increased expenditure.  Irish Shipping were correct to go to Japan for the ships because they got ships at a cheap rate and in this way they can compete with companies who are buying in the same market.  It will ensure employment for 150 Irish men while the ships are in operation.  B &amp; I were quite correct in what they did.  They will get the standard of workmanship they require on the spot.  The car ferry will be used by thousands of people continuously throughout the year.  Parts wear out and servicing is required and this will be available on the spot in Ireland.  If the Opposition had discussed this matter with someone who was involved in finance, they would see that the two decisions were correct and were in the best interests of the country.  In time they will see that this is the position but I suspect they will never admit it in public. The correct decision was taken to build the car ferry in the dockyard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As the relationship between the yen and the £ has changed of course it will mean an extra cost to Irish Shipping but the two ships will still cost less than the car ferry.  Verolme Dockyard said that if they got the fishery protection vessel and the car ferry, not alone would they not raise any objections but they would prefer those two ships to the bulk carriers for Irish Shipping. They are getting what they want now, namely, continual employment in their yard up to the end of 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is.  The general manager of the dockyard wrote to the Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time to that effect before the order was placed. Another hoary chestnut is the question of duty-free goods on ships and on planes crossing the Irish Sea.  This has been going on for 15 years.  It was originally proposed in the early sixties to Dr. Ryan, the then Minister for Finance.  After he left office Deputy Lynch became Minister for Finance and the proposal was put to him.  When Deputy Lynch became Taoiseach Deputy Haughey was appointed to the office and subsequently Deputy Colley became Minister for Finance.  This proposition regarding duty-free goods on Irish ships and planes travelling between England and Ireland was put to each of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was summarily thrown out by all of them and if Deputy Barrett wants to know why it was not implemented he might ask any of his colleagues, but the present Minister for Finance says he thinks there may be merit in it and he would like to have a proper case put to him by Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus and B &amp; I and have it examined in depth and then make a decision having seen all the facts, not summarily throwing it out.  That is at present under way.  A decision will be made by the Minister for Finance when he gets a report from the interdepartmental committee.  I could not <Col N="986" /> anticipate that decision but for the first time this suggestion is being seriously examined by people who can make a judgment on it and I hope the result will be available reasonably shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke raised the point about the amalgamation of B &amp; I and Irish Shipping.  People sometimes think this is an obvious thing to do but the car ferry is operating across the Irish Sea and engages in a different type of trade to that of Irish Shipping.  Car ferries are extensions of rail and road services between here and England and what might be looked at, if there was thought of amalgamation, would be amalgamation between B &amp; I and CIE rather than B &amp; I and Irish Shipping.  At present I am very satisfied with the way the three companies are operating separately.  If I could see benefit to the economy by bringing two of those companies together&mdash;I would prefer to see them operating and concentrating in the specialised area in which each operates; I think that is better&mdash;I am open to any argument put forward for the amalgamation of any two of them.  I have no preconceived ideas about what should happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If you combine B &amp; I with CIE, is there not a danger of them losing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but it might be more logical than to join them with Irish Shipping.  At the moment I am satisfied that each of them is operating in a specialised field efficiently and well and I would like to leave them like that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke asked when the money would be made available to B &amp; I.  It will not be made available in a lump sum but in different pieces by the Minister for Finance as the company require it, for instance, to pay for the car ferry, when the various claims for that come on stream.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, money will be provided this year.  The Minister for Finance is the shareholder, in fact, and it is he who will be taking up the equity even though the company and legislation relating to it come under my Department.  He is the shareholder in every State company, not the Minister under whose Department the company comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The money will be supplied this year, as far as is necessary. Deputy Burke also asked about hovercraft.  I understand that at present the position is that the Irish Sea is much more turbulent and dangerous than the English Channel and that hovercraft are not sufficiently technologically advanced to be used on this route.  I am sure B &amp; I are keeping all these developments under review and if they see a demand and the possibility of making a profit on the Irish Sea with hovercraft and continuing to operate with safety, they will introduce them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson said he hoped there was no undue interference by customs and excise and security people with the personnel on roll-on/roll-off ferries.  If he means that customs and security personnel are checking the employees and passengers on the ferries as they come from England, I am sure he will agree that is very necessary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it could be overdone.  It is extremely important. The Deputy appreciates why the security net should be tight.  Car ferries are a very obvious way of smuggling and the security personnel should be very alert and keep an eye open at all times for the possible importation of weapons or anything like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the House for what I expected would be their welcome for increased capital for the B &amp; I Company and a recognition of the valuable part they are playing for tourism <Col N="988" /> and for the economy generally. Deputy Barrett referred to a point that, perhaps, needs reiteration, the benefit Irish exporters get from the freight carried by B &amp; I.  By providing competition they have ensured that in the last eight or ten years freight rates have risen by only 22 per cent.  This is a great benefit to Irish exporters.  If that competition with the B &amp; I were not there, transport between here and our major customer would be very much higher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an expert on this but I think the point is that B &amp; I have facilities on the other side of the English Channel which they must use.  They could run into Liverpool from Drogheda rather than Dublin, perhaps or could negotiate other facilities but I think&mdash;particularly in regard to car ferries&mdash;they would want to operate from the point of greatest demand so that they would have a better chance of getting the highest occupancy on their ferries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for this short Bill arises out of a recent High Court judgment <Col N="989" /> related to convictions obtained against two fishermen in the District Court in Newtowncunningham, County Donegal, in respect of fishery offences committed within the area of jurisdiction of the Foyle Fisheries Commission&mdash;some in County Donegal and some in County Derry.  The offences in question were in breach of regulations made by the commission in 1966 with the approval of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in Dublin and the Ministry of Agriculture in Belfast.</P>
    <P>The Foyle Fisheries Act of 1952 under which the commission were established states that for the purposes of the Act the Minister means the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Ministry means the Ministry of Commerce.  On 1st April, 1963, the functions in relation to Foyle matters were transferred from the Ministry of Commerce in Belfast to the Ministry of Agriculture under the Ministries (Transfer of Functions) Order (Northern Ireland) 1963.  The High Court ruled, however, that this order did not render the approval of the Ministry of Agriculture sufficient to validate regulations of the Foyle Fisheries Commission and that an Act of the Oireachtas would be necessary to effect a statutory transfer of the power of approval of commission regulations from the Ministry of Commerce to the Ministry of Agriculture.  Accordingly, the High Court ruled that the regulations of 1966 were not validly made.</P>
    <P>The present Bill proposes to give statutory recognition to the transfer of functions in relation to Foyle matters from the Ministry of Commerce to the Ministry of Agriculture and to any subsequent changes that might arise on the Northern Ireland side in this regard.  So as to enable the commission to carry out their functions in regard to the management, conservation and protection of the Foyle fisheries the enactment of this Bill is a matter of extreme urgency and, as its sole purpose is merely to rectify a legal flaw in our earlier legislation, I would ask the co-operation of the House in having all Stages of the Bill taken today.</P>

I accept the reasons the Parliamentary Secretary has given for wanting the Bill passed quickly.  Recently I read statements to the effect that catches of salmon in this area were declining and that is another reason for this Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that the Bill will cover the period from 1962 and I should like to know what will be the position of those who were charged during that period when the Bill is passed.  What will the position be of those who had their gear confiscated prior to its introduction?</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Gallagher for the manner he has dealt with the Bill which is being introduced to rectify a legal flaw that was not discovered until the Newtown-cunningham fishermen brought a case before the High Court.  When the change was made from the Ministry of Commerce to the Ministry of Agriculture in Northern Ireland in 1962 the Northern authorities made the necessary transfer in accordance with the statutory requirements by enacting the necessary legislation.  It was an oversight on our part that we did not take similar action.  This Bill will put the matter in order.  It caters for future changes that may arise in Northern Ireland legislation.  At present the Ministry of Agriculture are responsible for the Foyle Fisheries Commission but we do not know how long that will continue.  It is possible that the Foyle Fisheries Commission will be controlled by some British authority but this Bill covers such eventuality.</P>
      <P>The regulations made in the 1960s and 1970s will be valid when this Bill is passed but it will not validate any offences committed during that period.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is purely technical.  It involves no question of principle.  Briefly, what it does is to secure that, where a criminal court is sitting without a jury, the court shall <Col N="992" /> have the same power to make any determination as if the court were sitting with a jury.</P>
    <P>The kind of determination that is most relevant for the purpose of the Bill is a determination that the accused is guilty of an offence different from but cognate to and in general lesser than the offence specifically charged.  Determinations may also be necessary sometimes as to the sanity or insanity of the accused or, very occasionally, as to whether he has already been tried for the offence charged.  The Bill will apply to determinations of these issues also, but as the first kind of determination I have mentioned&mdash; that is to say, a determination that the accused is guilty of a different offence&mdash;is the most important, I shall deal with this matter first.</P>
    <P>The powers under which a person charged with offence A may be convicted instead of offence B are commonly referred to as the powers to give &ldquo;alternative verdicts&rdquo;, and they are a well-known feature of criminal procedure in jury trials.  Some of the powers are common law ones, others are statutory.</P>
    <P>The common law rule is that a person charged on indictment with a felony may be convicted instead of a lesser felony whose ingredients are included in the felony charged and, similarly, that a person charged with a misdemeanour may be convicted of a lesser misdemeanour included in the misdemeanour charged.  To take two examples only from among felonies, a person charged with murder may be convicted instead of manslaughter and a person charged with robbery may be convicted instead of larceny. This is because an allegation in an indictment that the accused committed murder necessarily implies an allegation of manslaughter and an allegation that he committed robbery necessarily implies an allegation of larceny.  The lesser offence is included in the greater, and the giving of the alternative verdict that the accused is guilty of the lesser offence means that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct of the accused amounted to the <Col N="993" /> offence specifically charged but were satisfied that it amounted to the lesser offence.</P>
    <P>In addition to the common law rule there are several statutory provisions by which a person charged with offence A may be convicted instead with offence B.  In some cases the reason for the statutory power is that, although the ingredients of the lesser offence are included in the offence charged, the offence charged is a felony and the lesser offence is a misdemeanour and, as I have indicated, the common law power applies only where both the offences in question are felonies or both are misdemeanours. The common law rule does not allow the jury to cross the line, so to speak, between felonies and misdemeanours.</P>
    <P>Examples of statutory powers given for this reason are the power under section 5 of the Prevention of Offences Act, 1851, by which a person charged with the felony of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm may be convicted of the misdemeanour of unlawful wounding and the general power under section 9 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1851 by which a person charged with committing an offence may be convicted of attempting to commit that offence.  The reason for the latter provision is that with few exceptions an attempt to commit an offence is a misdemeanour even if the offence attempted is a felony.  Besides this class of enactments there are several enactments by which a person charged with offence A may be convicted instead of offence B when, although the ingredients of offence B are not necessarily included in offence A, the two offences are by their definitions so closely related that it may be difficult for the prosecution to foresee, in advance of the evidence, which is the appropriate offence to charge.  Examples are the provision in subsection (1) of section 44 of the Larceny Act, 1916, by which a person charged with robbery may be convicted instead of assault with intent to rob and the provisions in subsection (2) of the same section by which a person charged with embezzling <Col N="994" /> property may be convicted instead of stealing it and a person charged with stealing property may be convicted of embezzling or fraudulently converting it.</P>
    <P>With that summary of the technical rules as to alternative verdicts, I come to the particular difficulty that is the occasion for introducing this Bill.  The difficulty is that most of the statutory provisions allowing alternative verdicts are in terms of what &ldquo;the jury&rdquo; may do.  This applies to all the statutory provisions that I have just instanced. Leaving on one side for the present summary trials, this method of drafting was appropriate in the case of trials on indictment, which at the time when the enactments were passed were always tried with a jury and which are still so tried in the ordinary course. But now, unfortunately, trials in some cases have to take place before the Special Criminal Court, which sits without a jury.  In a case decided by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 12th November last&mdash;the case of <i>The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. Rice</i>&mdash;a man was tried before the Special Criminal Court for robbery and was convicted by the court of assault with intent to rob.  This was in reliance on the provision in section 44 (1) of the Larceny Act, 1916, to which I have referred; but the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the conviction on the ground that the power under that provision to convict of assault with intent to rob was expressed to be exercisable by &ldquo;the jury&rdquo; and did not apply to the Special Criminal Court sitting without a jury.</P>
    <P>This situation is clearly unsatisfactory, because the Special Criminal Court should obviously be able to give whatever alternative verdict a jury can give and before the decision I have mentioned this was thought to be the law.  The present Bill seeks to remedy the situation by providing&mdash;to state the matter shortly&mdash;that a criminal court sitting without a jury may make any determination that could be made if it were a court sitting with a jury.  In particular, this will enable the court to convict of an alternative offence in any case where a jury may do so.</P>
    <P>The main provision is in section 1 <Col N="995" /> (1), which assimilates the powers of a court sitting without a jury to those of a court sitting with a jury in the respect I have mentioned.  The subsection will apply not only to the case of the Special Criminal Court but also to the District Court.  In general the powers available to juries to bring in alternative verdicts are not exercisable by the District Court.  Therefore if the District Court considers that the evidence shows that the accused should be convicted of a lesser offence than the offence charged, a fresh information must be issued charging the lesser offence.  There is an exception in the case of dangerous and careless driving.  By section 53 (4) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, a person charged with dangerous driving may be convicted instead of careless driving, and this applies both to jury trials and trials in the District Court.</P>
    <P>It seems to the Government that, now that provision is to be made ensuring that the Special Criminal Court should have the same powers as juries to give alternative verdicts, it would be desirable in the interests of simplicity that the powers should extend to the District Court.  Therefore subsection (1) gives the powers to any court sitting without a jury. Paragraph (b) of the subsection is worded as it is to take account of the fact that a purely summary offence cannot be tried with a jury: the paragraph secures that the District Court shall have the necessary powers in respect of a trial for a purely summary offence as if it were an offence triable on indictment&mdash;that is to say, triable with a jury.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) is very technical.  It ensures that, in any case where a person is charged with offence A and can be convicted instead of offence B, he can plead guilty to offence B.  The result, if the prosecution are willing to accept the plea of guilty and the court approves, is that the accused is convicted only of offence B and dealt with accordingly.  This is the procedure at present under section 39 (1) of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1914 in respect of trials on indictment, and subsection (2) will ensure that the <Col N="996" /> procedure applies to all courts.  The subsection will cover trials on indictment before the ordinary criminal courts and will therefore supersede the provision in the 1914 Act, which subsection (4) repeals.</P>
    <P>So far I have referred mainly to the powers of convicting of alternative offences.  But I mentioned briefly two other classes of issues which juries may have to determine in trials on indictment in the ordinary courts. These are, first, issues in relation to the sanity or insanity of the accused and, second, the issue whether a person is exempt from trial on the ground that he has already been convicted or acquitted by a competent court of the offence charged.  The second class of issues, which are raised by what are technically called pleas in bar&mdash;of &ldquo;<i>autrefois</i> convict&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>autrefois</i> acquit&rdquo; as the case may be&mdash;rarely arises and need not detain us.  The Bill will enable the court to decide the issue as a jury can.</P>
    <P>The issues as to insanity are more important.  At present an issue as to the sanity of the accused may arise at three stages.  First, before the trial begins there may be a question whether the accused is so insane that he cannot be tried at all&mdash;that is to say, whether he is what is called &ldquo;unfit to plead&rdquo;.  Second, a similar question may arise during the trial. Third, the accused's defence may be that, although he may have committed the act in question, he was insane so as not to be responsible in law for his action&mdash;that is to say, that the verdict should be &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo;.  In all these cases the issue of insanity is determined by a jury&mdash; in the first two cases under section 17 of the Lunacy (Ireland) Act, 1821 and in the third under section 2 of the Trial of Lunatics Act, 1883.  I should mention that there is a slip in the Bill in that the short title of the 1821 Act is the Lunacy&mdash;not Lunatics &mdash;(Ireland) Act 1821.  This will be put right in the next print.</P>
    <P>In a case where the issue of fitness to plead arises before the trial a jury is specially formed to determine the issue.  Under the Acts, if the jury finds the accused insane, the court orders <Col N="997" /> him to be detained until he is found fit to plead, or to be detained in a place suitable for a person who has been found guilty but insane, as the case may be.  The place in which he is detained is determined by order of the Minister for Justice.  By subsection (1) of section 1 of the Bill the functions of a jury in deciding the issue of sanity will be exercisable by the Special Criminal Court in the case of a trial before that court.  But subsection (3) ensures that the powers under the Acts mentioned shall not be exercisable by the District Court. In the District Court the issue of the sanity of the accused does not arise in practice&mdash;even in the higher courts it rarely arises except in cases of murder&mdash;and it would not, in the Government's opinion, be appropriate to include in the Bill a provision that would, in theory, give the District Court so great a power as that exercisable by the higher courts under the two Acts mentioned, involving as it does the possibility that the accused will be detained indefinitely in the State mental hospital.  For this reason the Bill extends the powers of courts sitting with juries in these respects to the Special Criminal Court only.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is distasteful because it has been dressed up in the explanatory memorandum and presented to this House and to the public as a small tidying up operation and a regularisation and improvement on the present criminal law and procedure, whereas the reality is that it is nothing of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real motive behind this Bill, as is partially alluded to in the explanatory memorandum, is to get over by statute the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the case of The People <i>versus</i> Rice.  Certainly there has been no other judicial verdict or decision or any call from those who practise the criminal law that the procedures in the District Court and the powers in relation to a finding of sanity need change or alteration. Accordingly it can be taken that the mainspring of reasoning behind this Bill is that the Rice decision in some <Col N="998" /> way affected the effectiveness of the Special Criminal Court.  The Rice decision did nothing of the sort, and I will deal with that decision in a few minutes.</P>
    <P>When we were discussing the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill some weeks ago one of the grounds of objection to that Bill was that, by virtue of the procedures contained in it, the Minister was tending to make the Special Criminal Court part of the permanent, established criminal jurisdiction of this country.  This Bill attempts to do the same, and that is one reason why I am not at all keen on it.</P>
    <P>The Special Criminal Court is, as its name implies, a special court.  The Constitution empowers the establishment and the functioning of such special courts.  Over the years the Special Criminal Court has been brought into existence on three occasions. On each occasion it lasted for a comparatively short period of time, and then the processes of the ordinary courts became operative again.  During all the times that the Special Criminal Court has been in operation it has operated under the jurisdiction given to it by the 1939 Offences Against the State Act and, in particular, section 43 of that Act, which gives jurisdiction to the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>The jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court is limited to certain scheduled offences and also to other offences which the Attorney General may certify to be appropriate to be tried by the Special Criminal Court. Indeed, it is to be noted that when the Prosecution of Offences Act was being passed providing for the setting up of the Director of Public Prosecutions, it was expressly provided that the Attorney General might retain the power of certification.</P>
    <P>The jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court is to try and to convict or acquit any person lawfully brought before that court.  Section 43 of the Offences Against the State Act of 1939, in sections 45 to 48, inclusive, lays down different procedures whereby a person may be brought before the Special Criminal <Col N="999" /> Court.  In all cases it is clear that the jurisdiction of the special court to try and to convict or acquit any person is limited in those sections to trying and convicting or acquitting those persons who are before the court on specified charges or, as in the phrase used in those sections, &ldquo;on such charge&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This was the real matter at issue in the Court of Criminal Appeal in The People <i>versus</i> Rice case, and although it was not necessary for a court to go that far in its decision, it is quite clear that the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court is limited to trying those offences with which the accused before it has been expressly charged.</P>
    <P>I very much doubt whether the Minister's expressed intentions in this explanatory memorandum can be fulfilled. I do not think his efforts to amend the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, which he is trying to do here this afternoon without even mentioning that Act by name, will be sufficient to confer fresh jurisdiction on a court which is special by name and special by the constitutional authority which enabled it to be set up.</P>
    <P>I find it extremely difficult to understand why the Minister in looking for these changes did not come into this House and ask that the Offences Against the State Act be amended. Surely this would be the proper way of achieving what he hopes to achieve, but under another name.  Is it perhaps that the Minister and the Government are not sure that if they came before this House with an amendment to the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, they would have the full support of all the members of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party?  When pondering these questions one must cast one's mind back to 1972 when the present Minister for Justice, then on this side of the House and on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, castigated his predecessor, Deputy O'Malley, then Minister for Justice, for trying to bring through this House an amendment to the Offences Against the State Act.  It is very likely that the present Minister for Justice will do everything to avoid bringing <Col N="1000" /> about changes in legislation, particularly if it is labelled an amendment to the Offences Against the State Act. Perhaps the Minister knows that he could not count on the voting support of all the members of both parties that make up the Government.</P>
    <P>In my view the Minister came into this House trying to make changes in legislation but he did not go about it in a straightforward way.  For political reasons we are dealing with a Bill which will bring about change and which, if passed, will be known as the Criminal Justice (Verdicts) Bill, 1976. The Minister and the Government would be more honest with this House, with themselves and with the people, if they said they wanted to amend the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, but were not sure that they could vote it through the House because they were not satisfied they could depend on the support of the members of the two parties which form the Government.</P>
    <P>In the Rice case, which has already been mentioned, the accused was charged with aggravated robbery, that is, robbery while armed with an offensive weapon.  At the end of the prosecution case the prosecution had either failed or neglected to prove that any robbery had taken place.  In that case it would have been equally open to the Director of Public Prosecutions to have had Mr. Rice charged not merely with aggravated robbery but also with assault with intent to rob and any other charge that might have seemed appropriate to him.  Had he done so that would have been sufficient to give jurisdiction to the court to try to convict or acquit Mr. Rice of all the charges with which he had been charged.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the Special Criminal Court had been in operation on three occasions since the 1939 Act came into being.  That is relevant in this context.  During all the years the Special Criminal Court was in operation it was quite clear that the jurisdiction of that court was limited as I described it.  It was the practice that any offence of which, on the particular set of facts, an accused might be found guilty, was included in the list of charges with which an accused person was charged before <Col N="1001" /> the Special Criminal Court.  On all the occasions when we were in office, and when the prosecutions to the Special Criminal Court were made under the direction of the Attorney General of the day, we were aware of the jurisdiction of the court to which we were certifying and sending forward persons to be tried.</P>
    <P>This Bill does two things in relation to the Special Criminal Court.  First, in relation to jurisdiction, it purports to extend and confer on the Special Criminal Court a jurisdiction not given to it by the Act which set up the court, namely, the Offences Against the State Act, without mentioning the jurisdiction section of the Special Criminal Court, section 43 of the 1939 Act, and without mentioning in this Bill the existence of the Special Criminal Court itself or the Offences Against the State Act.  It is very doubtful if the Minister can so confer jurisdiction on the Special Criminal Court in this way.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it places a premium on the incompetence or otherwise of those charged with prosecuting criminal offences.  It may require a little more time and effort to decide what are the appropriate charges for a Special Criminal Court to determine. I do not think the way to get over the apparent failure of prosecutors to prosecute properly in the Special Criminal Court is to pretend that the Special Criminal Court is not in fact special but is an ordinary court sitting with a jury.  The striking impression left by this Bill, when it is read in conjunction with the explanatory memorandum, is that it seems a little less than honest.  If the Minister were honest, open and candid he would have brought in a Bill to amend the Offences Against the State Act where he thought it necessary to change the operations of the Special Criminal Court.  As I said, perhaps he could not depend on his own backbenchers if the words &ldquo;Offences Against the State Act&rdquo; were mentioned.</P>
    <P>In relation to the District Court the position is also objectionable.  When a person is before any criminal court he is entitled to know the exact offence with which he is charged.  One <Col N="1002" /> of the reasons for this is that he is entitled to defend himself.  It is specious for a Bill to be brought in giving a District Court the same powers a jury have in a trial on indictment. The District Court is a summary court and is entitled to try only summary offences, with limited exceptions.  Any specific legislation where it may seem desirable to give the District Court power to find an alternative verdict, as in the case of reducing a charge from dangerous to careless driving, is the place to give that jurisdiction and not by lumping it all together in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The House would be sympathetic to the Minister in the example I have given.  The difference between dangerous and careless driving is a factual matter depending on the evidence.  This is a clear example of where it is sensible to give this power to a justice.  This Bill is going too far in giving overall powers to the District Courts, which is set up under the Constitution to deal with summary offences.  The Minister uses the Rice decision as the basis for the need for the Bill, but he gives no such explanation for extending this power to the District Court.  From my understanding of what the position is in the District Court I believe this power is unnecessary and there is no recent case or series of cases which have shown any need for this power to be given to the District Court.</P>
    <P>In relation to the power given to the Special Criminal Court to find a person unfit to plead, the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court is limited to trying, convicting or acquitting persons under the provisions of section 43 of the Offences Against the State Act.  I do not believe the Minister can purport to amend that jurisdiction in any way by this Bill.  It is frightening that the Minister purports to give such powers to the Special Criminal Court when none of its members may be judges or even lawyers and where the court can consist <i>in toto</i> of military officers.</P>
    <P>I appreciate this has not been the position in the last three-and-a-half years but it is always open to be so. The power of finding a person unfit <Col N="1003" /> to plead is a jurisdiction which should be clearly left to the ordinary courts. The Minister is presumably aware of the current order made by a judge where a person in the Central Criminal Court found unfit to plead is kept in detention until the judge is satisfied that at some future date he has become fit again.  Does this presuppose an indefinite extension of the life of the Special Criminal Court?  Is that court to follow the practice of the Central Criminal Court as the Offences Against the State Act requires it to do?</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government would be far more honest and open with themselves, the House and the public at large if in trying to achieve what they want to achieve they came into the House and said they wanted to amend the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  I believe this is the way it should be done.  The Minister and the Government are going about this in an underhand manner.  I understand they have to do it in this particular way because they are not confident that they would have the majority within their party groupings or that they could depend on Members of the House who refused to vote with them recently when we were enacting the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill. Perhaps there are certain Members of the Labour Party grouping in the Government who because of their attitude during the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill forced the Minister to come into the House in the way he has done and do something which I believe he is not doing in the proper manner.  If changes are necessary, if the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, is to be amended, if the Minister seeks to give them more jurisdiction than what they have, then the House and the general public should clearly know what is going on and what it is all about.</P>
    <P>It is not right for the Minister in his opening brief this afternoon to say that this Bill is purely technical.  That is wrong.  I believe the Minister and the Government are wrong in their attitude. If it is for political reasons that they come before the House, hoping to achieve the changes they desire under <Col N="1004" /> the heading of this Bill, let them come in and say so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This surely must be a classic example of political ice skating. The Minister has introduced the Criminal Justice (Verdicts) Bill, 1976, when what is required is an amendment to the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  The Minister in the first sentence of his brief said that the purpose of this Bill is purely technical.  This is less than correct.  If a situation has arisen which showed that the operations of the Special Criminal Court had been found to be hindered, surely the Government should introduce an amendment to the Offences Against the State Act, 1939?</P>
      <P>I can understand the political predicament the Minister finds himself in when introducing any Bill which would use the wording &ldquo;Offences against the State Act&rdquo;.  The Minister during the debate on the previous amendment in 1972 made very strong comments.  I am sure that the Minister realised that if they used the proper machinery, if they used the 1939 Act, they could not guarantee the support of the Members sitting behind them in the Fine Gael Party and particularly of those in the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>During the debate on the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill we saw Members of the Labour Party refusing to vote on amendments they put down to that Bill.  Some of those who voted in favour of some amendments to that Bill did so with public declarations of their reluctance to vote.  Surely the Minister must have read the situation and realised if he was to bring in an amendment to the Offences Against the State Act he had not a chance of getting it through the House without the support of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister feels that some measure similar to the one he has introduced today is necessary but he is disregarding the real machinery for bringing it about: the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  The Bill will go on record as being the Criminal Justice (Verdicts) Bill, 1976, and not one line of it will mention what is the parent Bill, the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  Like the <Col N="1005" /> Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, this Bill is making the Special Criminal Court a permanent feature of our legal proceedings.  It has had to be used on three occasions only.  None of us wants to see it as a permanent feature of our courts and we all hope circumstances will allow it to be disbanded as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>If the Government are introducing legislation which they feel is necessary they should do the honourable thing and bring it in in its proper form.  I endorse all the comments made by our spokesman, Deputy Collins, and I share his reservations on this legislation introduced here today.  This is not the way to get around the problem which has arisen and the handling of this Bill typifies the general handling of the affairs of the country at the security level.  We are now getting to the stage where we have practically a bank robbery a day and a post office robbery every second day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The point has already been made that this Bill stands on its own legs, so to speak, and is not related to the specific provisions for Special Courts, which we all agree are unnecessary, or to the jurisdiction generally as set up for instance by the Offences Against the State Act.  This point has already been made by other speakers but I wish to make it from a different angle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill were specifically for that purpose it is only proper that it <Col N="1006" /> should be related to the extraordinary jurisdiction which it was regrettably necessary to set up to deal with an extraordinary situation.  This Bill, as a general amendment of the criminal law, requires considerably more scrutiny than it would if it were an amendment of what I have called the special or extraordinary code regrettably made necessary by extraordinary crimes of organised violence.  This is the essence of the whole thing.</P>
    <P>The problems which have arisen and which this Bill seeks to deal with would have called for nothing more than minor amendments in the law. They would have been merely adjustments of the jurisdiction of the District Courts in certain regards and major adjustments of the jurisdiction in other regards were it not for the fact that organised crimes of violence made it necessary to have this extraordinary code.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is clearly not to provide for amending the jurisdiction of the District Court. If it were presented in that form there would be a good deal of opposition to certain interpretations of the Bill and the remainder would be accepted as convenient amendments.  I could not see the Dáil accepting the Bill on this basis.  Therefore, and this is the inescapable logic of that situation, essentially this Bill is intended to be applied as an amendment of the extraordinary or special criminal code enacted for a special or extraordinary reason.  It is mainly intended to apply to cases of extraordinary jurisdiction to be heard and determined by courts of extraordinary criminal jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister to consider what has been said by Deputy Collins and Deputy Burke from another point of view.  I want him to consider it from the point of view I am now putting forward which is a more technical point of view.  There is a consequence to this which, in general terms, lawyers will find disturbing. If the Minister had done what Deputies on this side of the House suggested he should do and brought this in as part of the extraordinary code of special criminal jurisdiction the Bill would have carried with it the <Col N="1007" /> limitations of that extraordinary code which at this moment we are not seeking to confine and in the specific context of that code, I think the Minister would get support and agreement from the House as a whole.</P>
    <P>If the Bill were brought in in that context, as it should have been, it would be hedged in, so to speak, by its general setting in the appropriate code of extraordinary criminal jurisdiction. I make these points in an effort to be clear.  First, the Bill is intended to be part of that code and, by including it where it should be, a good deal of this debate and the Bill's possible consequences could be avoided and a greater degree of certainty would be brought into the law.</P>
    <P>Secondly, bringing it in in this way without having it in its proper setting means that the Bill has consequences for our criminal jurisdiction and the criminal law of the State in general which are open to serious criticism. When one excludes the necessity for the extraordinary or special criminal jurisdiction it is sometimes hard to make these distinctions clear but, in this case, that could have been done very simply by amending the title and setting the Bill in its proper context in the code.  If it were so placed in the code, generally speaking being related to the code, then the Minister would have no difficulty in getting support from this side of the House for these provisions.  The Minister would command more general support for the Bill if it were made more precise by being included where it really belongs.</P>
    <P>I have to consider this Bill in two parts.  I have to consider it with relation to the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court to deal with special and extraordinary crimes and I must deal with it as part of our more general criminal jurisdiction affecting all crime.  Because it is presented in this way, its ramifications extend far beyond what is clearly the Minister's main purpose as set out in his opening statement today.</P>
    <P>Let us consider it first from the point of view of the Special Criminal Court.  The crimes visualised there <Col N="1008" /> are essentially those of organised violence, of crimes that have associated with them two features that defeat the fair or practicable application of the ordinary criminal law of the land.  These features are, first, organised violence and, secondly, intimidation.</P>
    <P>I know I may be over-simplifying the case when I put it in that way but I will not be very far wrong if I say that this extraordinary criminal jurisdiction and the Special Criminal Court are necessary because, unhappily, there has been a wave of organised violence.  It is not spontaneous, individual violence but organised violence such as assassinations, armed robberies, train robberies and other crimes of that kind.  Here, it is impossible to apply the law because of the intimidation of individual justices, or even of individual judges who cannot be protected and, in particular, the intimidation of juries.  It is difficult to get a fair and a just verdict and we must protect those who are called on to convict. There was one question with regard to subsection (2) which the Minister stated was rather technical; that phrase will detain me and it might even alarm me.  However, except for the comment there and a question that arises with regard to insanity I think the Minister should get this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am now making the distinction that this Bill is brought in as a general amendment to criminal law in the whole area where it should have been in the specific area of extraordinary criminal jurisdiction and I will deal with it on both bases.  In the context of its extraordinary jurisdiction, the first point is that it is eminently reasonable that the Special Criminal Court should have the powers a jury would have of alternative conviction. Generally speaking, that is what is contained in section 1 (1) of this Bill. That is not only a reasonable requirement but it is a necessary one for the Special Criminal Court and for this extraordinary special criminal jurisdiction. The reason can be given quite simply.  It is that you cannot have the normal procedure in these cases of <Col N="1009" /> trial by indictment before a jury because the organisation of the crimes and the crimes concerned defeat justice by conspiracy in the first case and by intimidation in the second case.  We cannot cavil at subsection (1) so far as the Special Criminal Court is concerned.  I will go even further: I think the Minister needed this amendment.</P>

      <P>I may not have heard all of Deputy Collins's contribution. I am a little taken by surprise by the Minister.  The points I am making are specifically in relation to this provision being tied specifically to the Special Criminal Court's code. I am approaching the matter in general terms.  I can see that another Deputy&mdash;it might even happen in my case if I took it from another point of view&mdash;could criticise the provision on the grounds that it might be too easy to evade responsibility of proof. I am assuming we are still going to have the responsible standards of prosecution that heretofore we have had. If these standards are going to slide we are in a different area completely.  I was assuming that everything was <i>rite esse acta</i>, that it was to be properly done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) to my mind may have a certain ambiguity and would have less ambiguity if it were in the code <Col N="1010" /> to which it specifically belongs.  Reading the subsection as it stands, because this Bill stands by itself, the interpretation of the phrase at the end of the section &ldquo;...after trial for the offence specifically charged&rdquo;, seems to me to involve a certain ambiguity.  The subsection states:</P>
    <P>Where a person is lawfully before a court charged with an offence, the court shall have jurisdiction to convict the person, on a plea of guilty, of another offence with which he is not specifically charged and of which he could be convicted by that court after trial for the offence specifically charged.</P>
    <P>On that wording, does it really mean that if a man pleads guilty to manslaughter when charged with murder, say&mdash;I think that would come within the section here and it is very common&mdash;he could be convicted of manslaughter?</P>
    <P>My worry is that subsection (1) already, so to speak, confers this power if it is interpreted in that way and if this is the interpretation, is this not tautology?  Unless I read subsection (1) incorrectly we are putting the Special Criminal Court or any special court of that nature in the same position as a judge and jury but, under the general criminal law as we have it, both common law and the enactments of the general criminal law, subsection (2) would not be generally necessary for trial before a jury.  It, therefore, seems to me&mdash;perhaps, an erroneous view&mdash;that if this was all the Minister required, subsection (1) would give him what he wants as, if I read it correctly, it gives the criminal court the same jurisdiction as if it were a court with a jury. It says &ldquo;...shall have the same jurisdiction and powers...&rdquo; which would allow the court to convict of manslaughter when the charge was murder.  This has been spelled out by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the distinction between subsection (1) and subsection (2) is that in subsection (1) we have the case where there is not a plea but <Col N="1011" /> subsection (2) envisages the case where there is a plea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a long time away from the law but suppose a man were charged in the Central Criminal Court with murder before judge and jury, is there not jurisdiction in that court to accept a plea of manslaughter?</P>

      <P>Then it seems that subsection (1) covers all the Minister wants to do.  It confers &ldquo;the same jurisdiction and powers&rdquo;.  I am labouring the point, not because I object to the doing of it&mdash;I would not even object to repeating the point <i>ex majorem cautela</i> or whatever way you wish to put it, but the argument I am developing might lead to a different construction of subsection (2).  Subsection (2) may be open to this construction: it may include the case we have already mentioned, the jurisdiction of what I might call cognate or related crime.  Is it not also possible that it could be read this way: where a person pleads guilty of a crime with which he is not specifically charged he could be convicted of any other crime, whatever he pleaded, because the court would have jurisdiction to convict him subject only to what is covered by &ldquo;already convicted&rdquo; or &ldquo;already acquitted&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Is there not a danger that this perverse construction could be put on that section, that he could only be convicted of a crime with which he could be charged after he was either convicted or acquitted of the original crime?  Suppose the man pleaded guilty to manslaughter instead of murder.  Suppose he had been convicted either of manslaughter or murder, thereafter virtually all crimes of that particular homicide would be excluded and he could set up a defence under this section.  Again, this arises from the way the subsection appears, standing by itself and covering the whole jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 39 (1) of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1914, is <Col N="1012" /> explicit enough.  I will leave all that with the Minister.  I am not interested in trying to argue my opinion but the Minister knows that criminal law is extremely technical and will be construed technically for the accused. Does this restrict the conviction under subsection (2) to offences which are not in the category I have outlined because they would already have been convicted or acquitted in the first instance?  That is an impression. I do not think it is our duty to set ourselves up as technicians here and it should be sufficient to raise the question, freely conceding that the question may not have substance.  It is right that the Minister, and his advisers, should watch that point.</P>
    <P>It would not be a good thing to import it into our law as a whole.  It is like what we do for penalty, where an accused asks to have other offences taken into account when he is being sentenced.  It seems that the effect of this section is that an accused can only be convicted of an offence with which he is not specifically charged if it was one which he could have been convicted of after trial.  Looking at it in a perverse way, it might rule out the cognate type of trial.  There is another way of interpreting it and, perhaps, it is a more natural way.  An accused could almost plead guilty to anything as an alternative but is that another trap?  If I am wrong in the way I put it first, an exclusion, would I be correct in saying that if he was charged with murder he could plead guilty to some crime that would, in general, be thought to be unrelated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that but here, again, is the objection to having this form in the Bill.  The Minister stated that this is very technical but it is something more than what the Minister stated in his explanation.  I am not accusing the Minister of concealment or anything because he pointed out that it was technical.  It is the very technicality and the different ways this simple phraseology can be read that <Col N="1013" /> causes me to ask the Minister to look at the matter again.</P>
      <P>On the question of the person already convicted, I agree with the Minister that it is a pretty infrequent occurrence but it could be of specific importance in the code I am thinking of.  The more important is the case of insanity.  On that question I am more disturbed.  I am up against the difficulty that in all criminal jurisdiction, the amendment of criminal law and the provision for such things as a defence of insanity the courts have always been very sensitive to the danger of the misuse of the provision.  In the normal case of ordinary jurisdiction, the plea of insanity has been mainly used in the past to escape capital punishment, to escape in a charge of murder where the maximum penalty was concerned. It is in that form that it is best known to our law.  However, even in that simple context the courts, the Legislature and the public were extremely sensitive to the dangers of a provision like that being misapplied to put someone away and to effect a conviction where it might not have been possible to get it otherwise.</P>
      <P>It is not unknown in another part of the world, either because of difficulty of convicting or the political undesirability of convicting to escape awkward political consequences, for people to be committed as of unsound mind.  We know it has happened and, thank God, there has never been any suspicion of it having happened here.</P>

      <P>That is a good point <i>pro tantum</i> but the law has always been very careful to provide safeguards in a case like this.  The traditional safeguard was, of course, a jury of one's peers.  It was an assurance that either the foibles of a particular judge or the viewpoint of the Constitution did not prevail in the matter.  I have a worry&mdash;and it would not be helpful to be too explicit, as the Minister will appreciate&mdash;that in conferring this kind of jurisdiction on these extraordinary courts we are opening the door to something <Col N="1014" /> undesirable.  Again, I would settle for the setting of the Bill in what I have called its proper or natural context, but I do not think that the giving of a power to any court above a district court without safeguards is a little disturbing. One might argue that it is even more disturbing to put it in its own special context.  I, therefore, feel a little unhappy about this plea.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Quite frankly, I am not in a position to argue in detail with the Deputy.  I still feel there is a built-in precaution in the criminal code in that matters of this nature are generally decided by a jury.  Why do I jib at giving this power to a special court?  Special courts of their nature tend to be driven by circumstances to a particular point of view.  I would like to see a more positive stop to possible abuses of the nature I have indicated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will take me as agreeing with this and accepting it wholeheartedly at the moment, but it is part of our role as legislators to consider possibilities in the future and it is from this point of view that I wish to be helpful.  From the Minister's remarks I think he understands the point I have made. It would not be helpful to spell it out in any more detail and I will ask him to consider it.  It does mean that these provisions should be more circumscribed than they are.  The lack of circumscription seems largely to stem from the setting or absence of setting of the Bill.  The setting of the Bill is at large in our criminal jurisdiction rather than the setting of it in the particular <Col N="1015" /> jurisdiction for which it is mainly intended.  The amendments in regard to the District Court appear to be mainly considered as being put in for convenience.  If the District Court is getting more than would be convenient, it is because it would be rather inconvenient to make fine divisions.  I can see that point of view. I have misgivings about the Bill, particularly in regard to the three points I have mentioned.  Its setting colours and affects the whole concept and interpretation in the broadest sense of the provisions in the Bill.  The possible interpretations of the phrase in subsection (2) &ldquo;of which he could be convicted by that court after trial for the offence specifically charged&rdquo; seems to me to be open to possible meanings or applied as meaning something that was not intended. Lastly, it is with a great deal of a lawyer's conservative feeling that I urge caution in the extension of any jurisdiction that enables any court or administration to set up as a legal fact through conviction, plea or otherwise, that an individual citizen is not fully <i>compos mentis</i>, in other words, is of unsound mind, and that that being so that he can be by that device committed indefinitely.</P>
      <P>I know and accept, and, indeed, wish to endorse what the Minister said but we are looking at law being made.  We know that abuses of that nature have not been unknown in the world's history.  Nevertheless, bearing in mind those possibilities and with those warnings of experience, I urge the Minister to ask his advisers to consider again very carefully the circumscription of any power that could be abused.  It is not sufficient to rely on present undoubted integrities in all quarters.  I am worried about a possible wider, long-term interpretation that could develop gradually in another context.  A lot of trouble could be avoided were this Bill set in its proper context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because I believe Deputy O'Malley has been waiting to make a contribution. Deputy de Valera's contribution <Col N="1016" /> has been an interesting one. I agree with a lot of what he says on the basis on which he approached the matter&mdash;we have got to look at things in the context in which we find a particular court performing its functions. If we take the example of the Special Criminal Court, dealing with rather serious criminal offences we know now that, as a result of the recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the Director of Public Prosecutions <i>versus</i> Rice, a difficulty has occurred.  That decision highlights the fact that there might be certain reliefs not open to an accused person in the management and running of his business before that court in the trial of criminal offences.</P>
      <P>This Bill goes further than that court.  It does something here that is of some importance.  It establishes a new principle in the sense that it puts it in writing.  There has always been in the public mind a feeling that where the court accepts a plea of a lesser offence to that with which a person is charged something has happened along the line, that somebody has been given a little preference or allowed to pull strings.  It is stated in subsection (2) that a person's plea is accepted in the court.  Every lawyer knows of cases where a person has offered a plea in court which has not been accepted, or has been put aside, the main charge originally preferred has gone ahead and the person has been acquitted.  I am talking now about jury cases where I have seen this happen and where very often the person has been acquitted by the jury.  In such cases many people felt the acquittal given by the jury might not have been given but for the fact that the plea had been made by the accused.  In other words, possibly there was not a reasonable, independent consideration of the original charge.  This section, although it may deal with other matters, does bring that point into proper perspective&mdash;the plea is there and, if it is acceptable subsequently, the matter can be dealt with on the basis of the offence to which a person pleads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go any further on these alternative pleas.  But Deputy de <Col N="1017" /> Valera did mention the question of the plea of insanity.  In his opening statement the Minister very succinctly put the situation that it can arise in relation to these pleas of insanity.  Both the Minister and Deputy de Valera quite rightly pointed to the fact that where a plea of insanity in a criminal case has arisen it has always been dealt with by a jury set up for that purpose; if it be, first of all, the plea of whether a person is fit to give instructions to stand trial that is dealt with as a separate matter before a jury.  If we have a court of qualified judges on the bench of a level to deal with criminal trials and with the sentencing of criminals that have been dealt with before juries&mdash;and remember one is dealing with three judges, not merely one; therefore, one is virtually dealing with a mini jury of judges&mdash;it is right and this has been more or less explicitly indicated in that decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, that that court should have the same power as is given to a jury in trial of criminal cases.  Otherwise one might say, about the Special Criminal Court, that that court is not a proper court of criminal law.  This is a very important matter and it should be seen that they have that power.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera quite rightly said that the plea of insanity has often and mainly been used where there is a charge that a capital offence has been committed.  I have taken part in such trials.  Most Deputies who are lawyers have had something to do with a murder trial at some stage in their careers.  Most of us have had the very awkward decision to make of whether we should raise the issue of whether or not a person is fit to plead.  It is a very agonising decision for a lawyer&mdash;because we all know that if one fails on that plea the alternative plea which would normally follow&mdash;namely, the plea of insanity on the actual offence itself which arises as an issue in the trial&mdash; can go overboard and one can fail on it.  Let me come back to the question of whether it is right that judges should have the power a jury has on this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is a plea at the beginning of inability to stand trial or at the end a determination by the jury, in either case the jury determines it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  That is what I am coming to.  The important thing is this.  If a court is going to try the facts of a case they should have the same powers as a jury in deciding facts.  That is axiomatic.  One cannot deny the accused person the same pleas he has in an ordinary criminal court.  If so, one would be curtailing a fair realm of the application of the principles of justice as we know it in this island on a trial of criminal offence.  This has arisen more by accident than anything else.  I do not think it was appreciated earlier on.</P>
      <P>I want to go now to the little&mdash; perhaps I should not use the word &ldquo;little&rdquo;&mdash;danger to which Deputy de Valera referred, mainly, the question of whether it is right that a judge, or judges, should decide a matter that has always been dealt with by one's peers on the question of whether or not there is insanity. Instanced already during Deputy de Valera's speech is the fact that this decision is made very frequently in the wards of court offices.</P>
      <P>I do want to deal with another matter which is peculiar to our law. If something goes wrong at a judge and jury trial, the person to whom one goes, one's ultimate relief, is under the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, and that is decided by a judge.  This is our full stop where the principles of liberty of the subject are concerned. Ultimately one ends up with a judge deciding.  That is an enormous and important decision that has to be made.  It is a judge who decides it and not a jury.</P>

It is principles that are applied to facts.  It is interesting to note that that is the structure in our law and that is the ultimate court of recourse to which people have to go.</P>
      <P>Those are the only points I want to make, but I hope the public appreciate that what the Minister is trying to do here is to have available to the accused person in these courts on criminal trials the same right as he would have if he was tried before a jury.  That is an old principle of our law and we try to keep to it as closely as we can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suspicious of this Bill for the sort of reasons that have been set out in some detail by Deputy G. Collins and Deputy de Valera.  I want to go into certain aspects of what they said in relation to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing is that this Bill is before the House today because of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal on 12th November last in Rice's case.  If Rice's case had not been decided as it was by the Court of Criminal Appeal, there would be no Bill here today to do this.  Therefore, it is important that we should discover what Rice's case decided.  In particular <Col N="1020" /> we should be careful to ensure that the Bill does no more than what Rice's case created the necessity for, if one accepts that there is a necessity for the change in question and that is a matter that need not necessarily be taken as agreed.  I quote from a copy which the Minister kindly lent me of the judgment which was delivered by Mr. Justice Henchy on behalf of that court. On page 7 he says:</P>
    <P>While the inclusion of alternative counts in an indictment is procedural, the power to return a verdict of guilty of an offence not charged is a matter of jurisdiction which must be shown to exist under either common law or statute.  The Special Criminal Court being a creature of statute, such jurisdiction could be found only in the statutory provisions investing it with jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The statutory provisions on which the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court rests are those in section 41.</P>
    <P>That is referring to the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and it is clear that what was intended there was section 43, and that is possibly a misprint because section 43 is the one dealing with the jurisdiction.  The judgment goes on to say:</P>
    <P>These cannot be read as endowing the Court with a jurisdiction to convict an accused of an offence other than one for which he has been indicted. We must, therefore, sustain the grounds of appeal alleging that the conviction and sentence in this case were made and imposed without jurisdiction.  The conviction and sentence must, as a result, be quashed.</P>
    <P>That is the kernel of the judgment in Rice's case and it is founded on the fact that the Special Criminal Court, being a creature of statute, has only the jurisdiction which the statute establishing it gives to it.  The court points out that section 43 does not contain certain matters, even though section 43 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 does contain a great many matters in which jurisdiction is conferred.</P>
    <P>We should ask ourselves a question straight away.  Was it quite possibly the <Col N="1021" /> intention of the Legislature in 1939, because of the special specific nature of the Special Criminal Court, not to confer certain jurisdictions?  It is very hard after this stretch of time to answer that with certainty but it is possible&mdash; one cannot put it any further than that &mdash;that the Legislature in 1939 in establishing this special court under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, wanted only to give it jurisdiction which is not as great as that of the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>The possibility of this thesis being true is borne out by the fairly elaborate drafting of section 43 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  It sets out what the jurisdiction will be and what it calls &ldquo;the following ancillary jurisdictions&rdquo; of which there were six different categories set out.  The six different categories that are set out as the ancillary jurisdictions need not have been specified if section 43 was drafted in a different way, and need run to only two or three lines to say that the Special Criminal Court shall have all the powers and jurisdictions of the Central Criminal Court and all the powers and jurisdictions which will be exercisable either by the judge or by the jury in the Central Criminal Court. However, it did not do that.  It could have done that in two or three lines.</P>
    <P>This difficulty that came to light in Rice's case would not have occurred if that was the way section 43 was drafted.  I would say when a draftsman applied his mind in 1939 to the conferring of jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court that is possibly the way he approached it.  It would seem the logical way from his own point of view, the easiest way to do, but he did not do it that way, because the desire, apparently, at the time was that there would be certain limitations on the jurisdictions of the Special Criminal Court.  Probably that desire was there because of the unusual, unique nature of the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>The section went on to set out these six ancillary jurisdictions and it deliberately omitted the minor ancillary jurisdiction, and it is fair to say it is only a comparatively minor one, which gave rise to the difficulty in Rice's case and which led to the quashing of the <Col N="1022" /> conviction there.  The first thing I want to say in relation to the drafting of the statutory provision to overcome what arose in Rice's case is that the obvious, normal way to draft that statutory provision would be to introduce here a Bill which would be to add an ancillary jurisdiction to subsection (1) of section 43 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and it would become paragraph (g) of subsection (1) immediately after (f).  The incredible thing is that that was not done but instead a Bill which has the appearance of being in some way a substantive Bill in its own right and which deals with matters outside of any difficulties that may have arisen as a result of the decision in Rice's case is brought in rather than an amending Bill.  The Minister and those who drafted the Bill performed quite a feat.</P>
    <P>They produced a Bill about section 43 of the Offences Against the State Act and virtually about that only and they never mentioned the section or the Act.  What is even a greater achievement is the Minister's speech here today.  It goes into some detail and succeeds in avoiding any mention of section 43, or, indeed, of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, at all.  Whoever drafted this speech is entitled to at least as much credit as whoever drafted the Bill because without reading Rice's case, the references right through are to sections 41, 43 and 47 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>The whole thing is about section 43 in particular and sections 41 and 47 in an ancillary way, and the Act that we are here to amend today is not mentioned at all.  The section that we are here to amend is not mentioned.  No recourse is had to the normal method of amending that section by adding a seventh ancillary jurisdiction at the end of subsection (1) of section 43 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  Instead, a new Bill which makes no mention of the Offences Against the State Act is produced.  As well as covering what the Minister or the prosecution might consider a defect in section 43 of the Offences Against the State Act, it goes on to extend this amendment not <Col N="1023" /> just to the Special Criminal Court but to the District Court also.  I think that the District Court was dragged into this not because there was any necessity or demand for it but in order to give an air of respectability to the whole introduction and passage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister seeks to give the impression that this is a minor technical amendment because of a decision in a case, that it has nothing to do with the Offences Against the State Act at all, that it is simply to do with procedure in non-jury courts and that these include the District Court. Therefore, the District Court must be lumped in with this as well.  The District Court has existed in this country for 50-odd years.  I have never heard of the problem that the Minister alleges he is solving in this Bill being a problem in the District Court.  I practised there for six years.</P>

      <P>I never saw the difficulty arise.  I saw pleas accepted on lesser counts and people found guilty of lesser offences.  No difficulties seemed to arise.  There has been no demand from anybody that I am aware of.  It seems to me that the Minister is trying to plug holes where they do not exist, and where they may never have existed and where for 50 years no difficulty has arisen. Apart from the fact that it is proposed to extend the right to plead guilty to a lesser offence to the District Court, I cannot see any point in the repeal of subsection (1) of section 39 of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, and its re-enactment again in different words but in the same sense in this Bill in subsection (2).  Section 39 (1) of the 1914 Act reads:</P>
      <P>Where a prisoner is arraigned on an indictment for any offence, and can lawfully be convicted on such indictment of some other offence not charged in such indictment, he may plead not guilty of the offence charged in the indictment, but guilty of such other offence.</P>

      <P>I feel that bringing the District Court into this is only <Col N="1025" /> trying to divert attention away from the fact that it is basically concerned with the Special Criminal Court.  We are in the position, leaving the District Court out of it for the time being, that the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rice's case discussed at great length in the judgment the various elements that go to make up the statutory jurisdiction conferred on the Special Court, and having considered the matter at great length finds that section 43 is lacking in a slight way in the sort of jurisdiction that is contained in subsection (1) of section 1 and, therefore, the man in question was entitled to be acquitted. The obvious conclusion to draw from that, and from any normal reading of the judgment, and of the difficulty that it gave rise to, is that it can be cured by an amendment to section 43. If the Minister wants to bring in the District Court&mdash;I do not know that there is a necessity for that&mdash;he could produce another section of another couple of lines and say that the same thing would apply in the District Court.  That is not done.  There is colossal effort, which makes me suspicious, and I think would make anybody suspicious, to avoid talking about the very thing that we are doing. What we are doing, even though we are doing it in a roundabout fashion, is amending section 43 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 to confer a greater jurisdiction on the Special Criminal Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores those actions of the Government which have reduced the competitiveness of the Irish tourist industry and recommends that subventions necessary to restore competitiveness be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We decided to table this motion because of the serious position in which the tourist industry is at the moment. It is the third largest industry in the country after agriculture and the <Col N="1026" /> manufacturing industry.  Not alone is it a large industry but it is a very specialised type of industry which can have an effect on the economy far greater than the total value of the takings from the industry would indicate. I propose to examine the industry now in the light of the various price changes that have taken place, in the light of the tax impositions and tax extensions in recent times which have resulted in adversely affecting the competitiveness of the industry.</P>
    <P>In order to examine properly the damage done to the industry by the January budget we must look at the position of the industry immediately prior to the budget and consider how it had been faring up to that point. The earnings of the industry in 1975 were estimated at £162.3 million.  If that figure is related to GNP for 1975 the return from tourism does not seem very great but that narrow view would not be a full or fair assessment of the industry.  Tourism is an invisible import-export industry and the earnings from tourism are of advantage from the point of view of an economy suffering from a serious balance of payments problem.  The earnings from tourism also have a multiplier impact since the money passes from person to person, resulting in additional personal income, additional savings and additional revenue to the Exchequer.  The regional impact is important because there is a more equitable distribution of wealth.  For these reasons the total value of tourism is above and beyond the £162.3 million estimated earnings for 1975.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that the 1975 figures are the figures for an industry suffering a recession.  The potential of the industry on a return to more normal conditions is bound to be much greater than the present return or than the percentage of gross national product.  The contribution to GNP is just over 4 per cent.  There is a great danger&mdash;indeed, there is evidence&mdash;that the value of tourism is being measured in an oversimplified fashion and judging the significance of the contribution in that way <Col N="1027" /> greatly under-rates the real and immense value of the industry to the country and to the economy.  The tourist industry, unlike the bulk of our manufacturing industry, utilises raw materials produced within the country.  The earnings from tourism filter through the economy in a dramatic fashion.  They are equivalent, in fact, to a spending power of an additional 150,000 home consumers.</P>
    <P>Some people believe that the vast bulk of the earnings from tourism go to hotels, restaurants and so on.  That is not so.  The benefits of tourism are spread right throughout the whole community.  It is calculated that approximately 10 per cent of the jobs in banking and insurance result from tourism, that 20,000 jobs in the wholesale and retail trade are provided by tourism, 4,000 jobs in the entertainment business, 7,000 in the clothing and textile industry and some 2,000 jobs in the drink and tobacco industries.</P>
    <P>On the agricultural side the tourist industry consumes some 2½ million gallons of milk, 36 million eggs, 2,000 tons of butter, 6,000 tons of meat, 15,000 tons of vegetables.  Those are considerable amounts of agricultural produce and they show quite clearly that tourism has a very dramatic effect on the economy as a whole. Another important aspect of tourism is that it is an export industry because it deals in foreign currency and it thereby enables the Irish economy to run a larger balance of trade deficit than would otherwise be feasible. Tourist revenue, though declining, still makes up 10 per cent of foreign earnings and it permits our imports to be financed and a higher level of consumption of foreign products.</P>
    <P>Another important impact tourism can have on the economy is that of job creation.  It is a labour intensive industry.  It employs in the region of 118,000 creating employment for approximately 10 per cent of our total labour force.  Without tourism the Irish manufacturing section would be much smaller than it is.  It can easily be seen from this that it is an industry affecting <Col N="1028" /> all of us.  As the third largest industry it deserves the attention and assistance befitting an industry of its size.</P>
    <P>In the past three years Bord Fáilte's promotional budgets have shrunk steadily in real terms and that at a time when competing countries are increasing their allocations.  We are not keeping pace with these countries.  We are not keeping pace with inflation.  It is the height of foolishness to allow the promotional budget to decline at a time when our economy is so dependent on this industry.  Curtailment of expenditure is not in the national interest.  Instead of allowing the budget to shrink Bord Fáilte should be given additional finance and a greater impetus to enable that body to go out and fight competitively for our share of the market. Our share has dropped and it is no answer at this stage to allow tourist promotional budgets to shrink.</P>
    <P>Coming to the recent budget, the first thing we notice is the Government's compete lack of understanding about the tourist industry.  It could only be a total lack of understanding of tourism that made the Government decide to increase value-added tax and the other elements which affect the tourist industry.  The recent increases in VAT, tobacco, petrol, drink, car-hire and hotel services will undoubtedly have a dramatic effect on tourist expenditure. In particular, it will affect Britain, which is our key market.  In the British budget today they increased petrol by only 1p per gallon and on luxury items VAT has been decreased. When petrol was increased by 15p in 1974, we were told that it was to ensure that Northerners would not come across the Border to buy petrol here.  We made the case at the time that because of security that would not be so.  It was not so, and now the boot is on the other foot.  Following the British budget, I hope the Government and the Minister concerned will take a hard look at our petrol prices and do something about decreasing that 15p.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry will only progress if no serious obstacles are put in its path.  After the boom time of the 1960s tourism suffered a severe setback, particularly in the last three or four years, and this was clearly seen <Col N="1029" /> in the high percentage of hotels that went out of business in the last two years and the general slackness in hotels.  When that setback was coupled with adverse conditions in all sectors of the economy, the major part of which was clearly due to Government mishandling, it was obvious that the tourist industry required special consideration if it was to return quickly to the level of progress that had been made in the 1960s.</P>
    <P>In spite of difficult conditions and the lack of Government leadership and planning, the tourist industry, by 1st January, 1976, was showing some slight signs of moving forward.  The various interests in the tourist industry took heart and planned a major effort so as to get the maximum benefit from the better trading conditions that appeared to lie ahead. Although recession conditions prevailed on 1st January there was certainly light at the other end of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>In no business or enterprise can it be more accurately said that the customer is always right than in the tourist industry.  People in Britain, Germany, France and other countries have a wide range of choice when they are contemplating a holiday abroad.  The only way we can ensure that a worth-while number of those potential holiday makers will decide to come to Ireland is by making a holiday in Ireland enjoyable and good value for money.  The Minister for Finance and most of his Cabinet colleagues have talked a great deal in recent months about the need to keep our manufacturing industries competitive.  Workers have been warned of the dire consequences if they insist on wage increases to fully offset the increases caused by inflation. Yet we have hardly had a mention from the Government side of the House of the equally present need to ensure the competitiveness of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>When a recession hits a wide section of people in any country holidays are cut down and in some cases cut out altogether.  The essentials of life must be paid for, and, therefore, expenditure on holidays is likely to be <Col N="1030" /> the first thing to suffer.  A country such as ours offering holiday facilities must, in such circumstances, ensure that charges are attractive, and, in particular, no action should be taken that would worsen that situation.</P>
    <P>A short time ago Bord Fáilte produced a tourist development plan consisting of nine volumes.  The plan is a very detailed and comprehensive set of documents, but it is only so much wastepaper if we cannot keep our prices competitive and give value for the money spent by the tourists. Last Sunday one of the papers set out the Government's 14-point plan, No. 12 of which stated:</P>
    <P>The Government will carry out a new dynamic development programme for tourism to enable the industry to overcome its present difficulties and to get back on the road to progress.</P>
    <P>Far from doing anything to overcome the difficulties of the tourist industry, the Government made difficulties for tourism, first, by their inept handling of the economy, and, secondly, by those savage and ill-judged increases in the budget of January, 1976.</P>
    <P>I want to examine the effect of that budget on the tourist industry.  In the circumstances that existed it was reasonable to expect that the Minister would have taken action to help the competitiveness of one of our major industries or, if circumstances forced him to increase costs for the industry, that he would have provided subventions to ease the burden.  Had the Minister set out to harm the tourist industry he could hardly have taken more effective action than he took.</P>
    <P>In present difficult conditions it is not easy to get tourists to come here. The ill-judged actions of the budget have made our position more difficult. The Minister placed many travel agents and hoteliers in a very difficult position because they had to either renege on their commitments to people who booked accommodation with them or run their businesses at a loss.  Some carriers, such as Aer Lingus and CIE, are semi-State bodies but the remainder are private companies.  Because tourism is basically a private enterprise industry, <Col N="1031" /> it has suffered at the hands of the Government, as has the rest of the private sector.</P>
    <P>The chairman of Córas Tráchtála spelt that out very bluntly some days ago.  In <i>The Irish Press</i> of 30th March, 1976, I read:</P>
    <P>A wide-ranging attack on the Government's fiscal policy was delivered yesterday by Mr. Colm Barnes, chairman of Córas Tráchtála, the State export board, who said that it was time for the Government to demonstrate political conviction to integrate the economic and social strategies that will once again make Ireland a land of opportunity....</P>
    <P>They see the present political climate in Ireland as hostile to business. This is a sad and serious state. Mr. Barnes, who is also chairman of Glen Abbey and the Northern Bank Finance Corporation, said that the business community saw fiscal legislation as destroying their recovery prospects.</P>
    <P>A good example of the difficulties facing tourists coming to Ireland in sufficient numbers in present economic circumstances is the poor return to Aer Lingus for their low-cost fare schemes. They introduced this scheme especially for emigrants.  In <i>The Irish Press</i> of the same day I read that</P>
    <P>...the scheduled return fare from London to Dublin will rise to £53, London to Cork £62 and London to Shannon £64.  Aer Lingus has a comprehensive list of reduced prices for certain types of travellers to Ireland which in view of soaring air fares should be doing better....</P>
    <P>The service is available at £32.50, no more than the return second class rail boat fare.</P>
    <P>Mr. Kelly, speaking for Aer Lingus, said they might have to reduce the individual services where there is no response.  He said there was no point taking off with only a few people on board.  That will give some idea of the competitiveness of the industry.</P>
    <P>I will now look at other headings in the budget which created difficulties <Col N="1032" /> for tourists.  The first is the increase in the price of drink.  There has been a great deal of discussion in recent months about the high consumption of alcohol in Ireland.  When the Minister applied those huge increases to beer, wine and spirits, many people reacted at first by saying that drink was a luxury.  It may be classed as a luxury for our own people, but as far as tourists are concerned, drink is not a luxury.  It is as much a part of their holiday package as food.  If we are to sell this country as a tourist centre we must accept these facts.  If the price of drink is increased by heavy taxation this will be a major step towards pricing ourselves out of the tourist market.  The increases applied in the budget of January, 1976, and the VAT increases applied on 1st March, 1976, have dealt a body blow to tourism, the licensed trade and the Exchequer returns.  These increases were ill-judged and created serious problems for the trade.  If they had been halved, they would have yielded the same amount to the Exchequer.  The expected increases to the Exchequer, which did not come about, will be felt by the Minister and the country.</P>
    <P>The annual report of the Dublin Licensed Vintners' Association, circulated on 30th March, claims that there has been a 40 per cent fall in takings in the licensed trade since the increases in drink prices.  They also expect a loss of jobs.  I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> that the association in their annual report claimed that there had been a 40 per cent fall in takings in the licensed trade since the latest tax increase on drink last month and warned of widespread unemployment in the industry.  The heading in <i>The Evening Press</i> was &ldquo;Drink Trade Chief Slams High Taxes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>VAT on hired cars is very serious. Hired cars are indispensable to the successful development of mobile tourism.  Did the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Finance not understand that the bulk of the Irish car hire business is transacted with tourists?  Eighty-five per cent of our car hire revenue comes from foreign earnings.  While this revenue may be small when compared <Col N="1033" /> with the total tourist earnings, without car-hire firms many tourists would not visit Ireland and their expenditure would be lost to the country.  The car-hire industry, although totally involved in tourism, has never benefited from development or interest grants or subsidies of any kind.  Now that industry is expected, without any notice, to bear a staggering increase in tax.  The Government should be concerned that the number of car-hire firms has halved since 1969.  They should also be concerned that because of this 10 per cent VAT more companies will go out of business.</P>
    <P>The increase in VAT charges for the hotel industry has come at a time when the industry has passed through years of difficulties.  The viability of many of those hotels is threatened. The inter-hotels comparison survey carried out by Stokes, Kennedy, Crowley on behalf of the hotel industry and Bord Fáilte indicated that the hotel industry has been in difficulties for some years.  This report showed that in 1974 the entire hotel industry only recorded a profit before taxation of 2.4 per cent of the turnover. The result is even more dramatic when one realises that in parts of the west and south many of the hotels have either made no profit at all or they have recorded a loss.  Nearly 50 per cent of the hotels lost money in 1974.  It is not expected, due to the VAT increase and the increased labour and energy costs, that the industry did any better in 1975.</P>
    <P>The effect of the new tax impositions on the hotel industry is viewed with great dismay by many experts. A high proportion of the benefit of the industry every year is contracted for well in advance of the tourist season.  In most cases the sales campaign takes place the previous July or August.  There are firm prices for package tours, inclusive of accommodation, and in many cases transport and car-hire prices have already been agreed.  It is estimated that 200 promoters have agreed prices at least six months in advance.  This contract activity of the hotel business is highly competitive.  The volume of this activity is critical to the industry. <Col N="1034" /> Many hoteliers depend primarily on the advance booking for survival.</P>
    <P>Do the Government not know that many of those have pre-contracted much of their business on the basis of 6.75 per cent VAT?  A brochure entitled &ldquo;Ireland, 1976&mdash;Motoring Holidays with B &amp; I Line&rdquo; has stamped on it &ldquo;holidays guaranteed, no surcharges&rdquo;.  Inside the cover it states that &ldquo;the prices published in this programme will not be subject to any surcharge during the validity of this brochure&rdquo;.  Was it not also known that many hundreds of thousands of pounds were spent on printing the promotional brochures and distributing them abroad?  At the time of the budget was it not also understood that Aer Lingus had guaranteed their prices against surcharges?  They published this guarantee in their printed literature.  If those surcharges are applied they will force people either to cancel their holidays or the industry will have to bear the cost.</P>
    <P>The country must honour our word.  Bord Fáilte have circulated this literature stating that the promoters are carrying those fixed prices for their holidays.  It turns out that the quoted prices cannot be honoured because of the action of the Minister for Finance.  If a tourist is quoted a price he expects it to be honoured. A person who finds the charge increased before he can avail of the holiday resents this.  As a tourist centre we cannot expect to be taken seriously if we renege on our commitments. The Minister, by the imposition of those taxes, has placed tourists in a very embarrassing position.  They must either renege on booking their holidays or the industry must run their business at a loss.</P>
    <P>The result of the present economic conditions is that the domestic demand is depressed and, therefore, any growth in the economy must come from exports.  In order to get the economy moving again it is essential that our exports be developed to the greatest possible extent.  Tourism is an export industry and is well placed to stimulate growth in the economy.  When one considers that the number of jobs which originated <Col N="1035" /> from the tourist industry in 1975 was 118,000 it can be seen why the needs of the industry should be given high priority by those responsible for the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister has claimed that the subvention suggested could not be paid to the industry.  He should keep in mind how substantial the contribution of this industry to the Exchequer is.  The tax content of tourism is around £30 million per year.  This shows that the tourist industry is making a very worth-while contribution to the national economy which is of particular value in our present circumstances. I understand the Minister made a statement on the Canadian flights plan.  <i>The Irish Times</i> of 31st March stated:</P>
    <P>The promoters of the flights from Canada claimed yesterday that Ireland stood to lose between $3 million and $5 million from the decision.  The Minister's action was taken after Aer Lingus complained to the Department of Transport and Power that the operator was &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; seats and would seriously affect traffic on its own services from Canada.</P>
    <P>I understand that last year the tour operators organised a series of 15 charter flights to Ireland and they carried in the region of 2,300 tourists.  They were operated by an independent Canadian charter company.  It was a successful promotion and, in the light of that success, the company decided to expand the charters this year.  They got sanction from the Canadian Government for 39 flights with a 7,000-seat capacity.  The flights were from Toronto and Montreal to Shannon and Dublin.  They were restricted. They were allowed only a 20 per cent increase on last year by the Minister. I would be glad if he would explain that decision to restrict the inflow of tourists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" />&ldquo;recognises that the aim of the Government is to carry out a development programme for tourism to enable the industry to expand; and takes note of the Government's progress to date towards the achievement of that aim.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is based on the 14-point plan referred to by Deputy Leonard.  We have been very successful. We have given the industry encouragement, tangible help and greater hope for the future in the three years I have been Minister.  I want to mention three things Deputy Leonard said.  He said tourist revenue, although declining, is still 10 per cent of our exports or something like that.  I am not sure what he said.  He said Bord Fáilte's promotional budget has shrunk in three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>He said what a tourist looks for is a holiday which is enjoyable and is good value for money.  The first two statements are false.  I thoroughly agree with the third one.  That is what tourists look for.  Tourists come here for a number of reasons.  I do not want to see this country develop into a cheap tourist market.  I do not want to see tourists flocking here because every place is cheaper, the beaches are crowded and you cannot drive your car on the road.  Our attraction as a tourist country is totally different from that. What we are seeking to sell&mdash;and what I think I have been successful in selling&mdash;is a country where the people are different, where the quality of food is excellent, where the quality of the hotels is superior to or equal to that of any other hotel in the world, where the roads are not as crowded as in other countries in Europe, and where there is good value for money. There is good value for money here for tourists no matter where they come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the complaints I have about certain sectors of the industry is the poor mouth they put on and the ullagoning they went on with which retarded progress and interfered with the good work being done by Bord Fáilte particularly last year.  Bord <Col N="1037" /> Fáilte and I said the indications were that we would have a good season, but certain sectors of the industry said we were in for a terrible season. There would have been a far better season last year but for those people who put on the poor mouth.  Business had to be in their door before they recognised the fact that there was business to be picked up from all over the world, if they would only go out and look for it, instead of complaining about what they thought would be a poor season but which did not turn out to be a poor season.</P>
    <P>Tourism revenue is not declining even taking inflation into account and the numbers coming here.  It increased in the past three years.  It increased in 1973 over 1972, in 1974 over 1973 and in 1975 over 1974.  Bord Fáilte are budgeting for an increase again this year.  I said each year that I did not want to make prophecies about what the tourist season will bring.  Things can interfere with the best prophecies and the best plans of Bord Fáilte, or anybody else in the tourist industry, at short notice, and have done so in other years to the detriment of the tourist industry.  I have figures for the first two months of this year.  If this motion were being taken next week I would have the March figures.  For the first two months of this year our figures are up on 1975.  The bookings this year are very much higher for 1976 than they were this time last year for 1975. That is an indication that people outside this country recognise the value there is to be found here, and recognise that they can come here and be quite safe in moving around the streets.</P>
    <P>There was a large expansion of tourism here in the sixties.  A great deal of money was provided to build many hotels.  Perhaps the people who went into the tourist industry at that time had not got a background in the industry.  Nor were they as professional as they might have been. Many people built hotels without any knowledge of the hotel industry, which is a very professional industry and needs a tremendous amount of personal dedication.  Many people went <Col N="1038" /> into the industry who had not got that background, that professionalism, that training in the industry.  To my mind, this damaged the hotel industry as a whole.  They lowered standards.  They dragged down prices.  They made hotels uneconomic.</P>
    <P>In 1969, and 1970 in particular, because of what was going on in this country it appeared to people outside that they could not spend their holidays here and that they would not be safe.  There was a lack of trust, an unsureness about the welcome for people across the water.  In 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972 they were not sure there was a welcome here for them. But 1972 was such a disaster that it was the worst year for tourism since 1962.  The burning of the British embassy in early 1972 had a more detrimental effect on tourism than anything else in our whole history. The fact that a group of thugs could walk down the main streets of the capital of a country and burn the embassy of their nearest neighbour had its effect.  We profess to have a friendly relationship with that country. This did untold damage to Irish tourism not just in the United Kingdom but all over the world.</P>
    <P>When I took office in March, 1973, there was gloom and depression.  For that reason one of the points of the 14-point plan was that there would be a new attitude to tourism.  I found the hotel industry extremely depressed, extremely unsure and fearful for the future.  I found the morale of Bord Fáilte and the carriers very low.  I found the people working in the field promoting tourism to this country unsure of what the future held, and half afraid to say they were Irish and selling Ireland.  This was deplorable.</P>
    <P>I felt sufficient money had been put into building hotels.  There was sufficient plant to cater for the tourist industry for many years.  Bord Fáilte recognised that in 1969 when they said grants for new hotels would be cut off but they would work out commitments they already had.  This is where Deputy Leonard is confused about the figures.  One side of the budget was diminishing because there were fewer calls on the capital acquisition <Col N="1039" /> side but the promotional side has grown by almost 90 per cent since we took office.  It is now 88 per cent higher than it was under the previous Administration.  I felt the effort should be put into upgrading standards, providing help for the hotel industry to improve, to refurbish, to provide amenities, and in promotion.</P>
    <P>I believe the people of the world want to come here.  There are discerning people in the United States of America, and the mainland of Europe, and in England.  We cannot forget that tourists from the United Kingdom have traditionally been, and I hope will continue to be, the most significant part of the tourist numbers coming here.  That policy adopted by me in 1973 of helping hotels to refurbish, of providing amenities, and promotional efforts, has paid off because every year since then the numbers coming here have increased.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry is out of the gloom and depression it suffered in 1970, 1971 and 1972.  Aer Lingus is a big promoter of tourism to this country. It is not seeking to pull the rug from under Bord Fáilte.  In the last three years B &amp; I and other organisations have gained more confidence and business. Tourism is a most important industry for a number of reasons.  We could spend hours discussing the benefits deriving from tourism.  The money earned from this industry is very important, but is it the most important and the only thing?</P>
    <P>Last year on a beach in County Kerry where there was a small parking lot near a bay, out of the 23 cars parked there 18 were owned by non-nationals. They had plates with the letters D, I, F, or GB on the cars.  The decrease in traffic to the mainland of Europe and from America last year was enormous. For virtually all of the European tourist market last year there was a drop of 15 per cent in American tourists as compared with 1974, but Ireland was the only European country to get an increase in this traffic.  This was not done by wishful thinking, by making fiery speeches or by addressing tourist bodies.  It was obtained by going out and selling and by assuring <Col N="1040" /> people they would be safe in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Last year I spent ten days in America and this year I spent eight days in promoting Ireland and between television, radio and newspapers I gave between 50 or 60 interviews.  I was asked politely what I was doing in America, I was asked politely if Ireland was good value for money and I was asked what were the attractions for Americans.  I regret to say there was one common question in all of the interviews.  It was: &ldquo;Is it safe to go to Ireland?&rdquo; I am very sorry I have to say that, as I was sorry I had to listen to that question so frequently.</P>
    <P>I was able to assure my questioners that they were far safer in Ireland than they might be in certain parts of their own country.  The same thing happened in France, Germany and in Brussels in 1974.  I am sorry to say that in the United Kingdom I got the reaction &ldquo;Why should we support you people when we see what you do to us?&rdquo; It is very sad&mdash;I put it no stronger than that&mdash;when our nearest neighbours, the people with whom we should be most friendly, who are our nearest market for tourism, can adopt this attitude towards us.  I am glad to say it is not common to all the people of the United Kingdom.  The vast majority of people there realise that those who are responsible for the reaction I have described do not represent anyone in this country, that they are not working in the interests of farmers, of industry, of the tourist trade or in the interests of ordinary people.</P>
    <P>The majority of people in the United Kingdom recognise that fact but there are still people who feel bitter about it.  It is the one market where I am not satisfied with my efforts or the efforts of Bord Fáilte in the last three years.  We have done no more than hold the figures.  We have not managed to get the very dramatic increase we got from Germany, France, the Benelux countries and the United States.  It gives me no pleasure to say that.  I should love to see British Rail ferries, the B &amp; I ferries, Aer Lingus and British Airways coming to this country crammed with people, English, Welsh and Scottish people, from the start of the season which is about this time, to <Col N="1041" /> the end of October.  There is a welcome here for them.  They can be assured that virtually everyone wants to see them here and to give them a welcome. We want to give them the good value for money that this country represents for tourists.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Financial Times</i> on 28th February last published a survey entitled &ldquo;A guide to travel costs around the world&rdquo; and it listed about 60 cities.  They included Oslo, New York, Paris Nairobi, Algeria, Port of Spain and many others and the third cheapest city was Dublin.  The two cheaper cities were Lisbon and Dar-es-Salaam. The other 57 or so cities&mdash;the principal cities of the world&mdash;were more expensive than Dublin.  I think Deputy O'Brien is the only Dublin Deputy present in the House; the other seven Deputies would not think Dublin so very cheap by standards throughout the rest of the country.  Therefore, if Dublin is the third cheapest city, we can imagine what good value Galway, Sligo, Limerick, Waterford, Cork and Killarney would be for tourists.</P>
    <P>It is crazy and it is not in the interests of the country for people to say that we are pricing ourselves out of the tourist market.  This country is great value for money.  It is very important that tourists be given value for money but the people we are trying to attract are looking for something else that money cannot buy.  They are looking for a welcome, for clean beaches, uncluttered roads and natural friendly people.  A value cannot be put on those things.  To decry our own product, to cry &ldquo;stinking fish&rdquo; is about as harmful a thing as they can do.  I have already said that they harmed the tourist season last year by their attitude.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard said the hotel industry was hurt by the budget.  However, there were three hoteliers who commented on the matter&mdash;not small or Dublin-located hoteliers.  One said that in spite of the outcry against the budgetary impositions, particularly those affecting the tourist industry, up to that time he had not received proof of a drastic cancellation of holiday bookings resulting from price rises, that in fact some sectors of the industry reported a fairly significant <Col N="1042" /> rise in reservations compared with last year.  The chief executive of another group said that his organisation had decided to absorb the VAT increases on precontracted bookings even though the profit margins on such business would be reduced.  He did not think the situation was as serious as had been represented by the Hotels Federation.  A spokesman for another hotel chain was reported as being fairly optimistic about prospects for the coming year.</P>

      <P>Every one of them. I want to give comparative figures for Bord Fáilte promotional allocations in the past five years.  In 1972-73 it was £3.26 million; it is now £6.12 million, an increase of 88 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Very much less than that.  That is an increase in real terms. Deputy Leonard said the number of people coming to the country had been down in the last three years but the figures are: 1972, 1,458,000, a decrease over 1971&mdash;and it shows how serious the situation was then&mdash;of 13.8 per cent; 1973, 1,614,000; 1974, 1,628,000; 1975, 1,688,000.  There has been an increase in each one of these three years, despite what Deputy Leonard said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident, provided nothing happens&mdash;the House knows what I mean by that&mdash;that we will again have an increase in 1976.  I am always reluctant to prophesy about tourism, knowing what can happen, but I am confident that the road on which the Government have set Bord Fáilte and the tourist industry is the right one and that the country will continue to benefit.  I introduced two new schemes for hotels and guest-houses&mdash;one was the improvements scheme to which I have referred.  I think the hotel industry did not believe I was really serious and that I would put the effort into tourism that would get results and there was a sluggish start.  Initially there was no great demand for that scheme but <Col N="1043" /> now 140 hoteliers are availing of it and another 130 hoteliers are availing of the second scheme which I introduced, the amenity scheme.  That is proof that the Government's commitment in its 14-point plan has been followed through and that the benefits are there for the tourist industry if they want to take them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard referred to Quebecair&mdash;I thought he was not going to mention it at all when he left it so long after the outcry in the papers last week; I thought he was going to ignore the matter; he did not give himself much time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I missed the Minister's broadcast and I did not see it in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain that Quebecair last year applied for permission to run 15 round trip charters into Ireland carrying about 2,700 passengers each and were granted leave. Aer Lingus held at the time that they would interfere with their regular schedule traffic.  I do not need to remind the House how essential a part of tourism promotion is the national airline.  If we allowed an open skies policy we would certainly allow our airline to go bankrupt.  Who would then promote Ireland?  Why should anybody come here unless a plane load of traffic was guaranteed to them, whether from Toronto, New York or Rio de Janeiro? They would want to come to Dublin. The schedule traffic must stop at Shannon. How could we guarantee any airline would promote our interests on the other side of the Atlantic unless it was the Irish airline?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quebecair applied this year for 39 charters&mdash;they had 15 last year.  Subsequently they said that even though they had applied for that number they did not want it because they had been unable to sell the seats and had themselves cancelled five of their charters. I discussed this matter with Aer Lingus and I had to accept their word that because of the effect of charter traffic out of Canada on Aer Lingus last year they had to cut back on their scheduled service this year.  The scheduled services <Col N="1044" /> to Ireland by Aer Lingus and Air Canada come <i>via</i> Montreal, Shannon, Dublin.  The charter traffic comes from Toronto to Dublin direct.  If we lost the scheduled traffic&mdash;and I think charters to the extent envisaged by the promoters would have meant that next year or perhaps later this year Aer Lingus would have had to take their scheduled service off that route and that would not benefit Irish tourism&mdash; not only would it come off the Montreal route but that connects with Chicago, a city with a large Irish population, and that would have gone also. Even though in 1976 we might have had sufficient tourists coming, in the long term this development would not benefit Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>I decided to limit them to a 20 per cent increase this year over last year's carrying.  If we could get a 20 per cent increase right across the tourist board this year we would be extremely happy.  In addition to these 18 charters, Aer Lingus are running charters. Another company, CP Air, which did not operate in 1975, propose to run five charters and Aer Lingus propose to run six, a total of 29 charters, almost double the number of charters flying out of Canada last year.  If all these are filled I shall be very pleased. If the number travelling by schedule traffic dropped to such an extent that Aer Lingus had to drop the Montreal-Chicago route it would not be a benefit to Irish tourism.  While I would not like to prejudge any situation, if that position arose next year I would have to look seriously at the charter situation in relation to the North American continent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain, before he sits down why it is that all the hoteliers are claiming that they are on the verge of bankruptcy and that every one of them is in the same position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard it from any one of them and Bord Fáilte have as close an association with individual hotels and with hotels as anybody else.  I heard two individuals complaining but in my view those hoteliers should not be in the business because they are not prepared <Col N="1045" /> to work; they are prepared to get a living by other people working. Any person, politician or hotelier, who is not prepared to work does not deserve to get on.  Hoteliers say privately that they had a very good season last year and are looking forward to a good season this year.  I am confident they will have a good season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the terms of the motion tabled by Deputy Leonard deploring the action of the Government which reduced the competitiveness of the Irish tourist industry. The motion also recommended that subventions necessary to restore competitiveness be provided.  I do not agree with the Minister when he said that we were not pricing ourselves out of the tourist market.  Because of rapidly rising prices and the Government's failure to curb inflation, we are pricing ourselves out of that market.  Undoubtedly, we would have more tourists if we were more competitive and in order to ensure this competitiveness there should be a greater investment of the preservation and improvement of our natural environment.</P>
      <P>The Bord Fáilte plan published recently is great on paper.  It deals in a concise manner with the requirements necessary to attract tourists between now and 1980.  However, there is no provision for the financing of the plan.  It has been costed and we have been told how much will be spent in the next four or five years but a suggestion was put forward that local authorities and public bodies should contribute without those bodies being consulted as to their capacity to pay.  Bord Fáilte, and the regional tourism organisations, the joint publishers of the plan, saw their role as assessing the needs of tourism and the preparation of overall plans and policies.  They decided it was necessary to do this because of the absence of a national physical plan. By action, incentives and encouragement they hope to ensure the consistent development of tourism activities. The projections in the plan are fine on paper but I should like to know where the money will come from to finance all the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1046" /> A number of elements here appeal to tourists; the basic emotional response to Ireland as regards its culture, romantic heritage and distinctive way of life and scenery, the atmosphere of tranquility and the friendliness of the Irish people.  These factors must be supported by high standards of service together with comprehensive facilities and amenities for all tourists.  There is no doubt that conservation is essential for the future of tourism.  The physical environment now faces a severe threat and the Government should spend more money on conservation.  More money should be spent on the prevention of pollution from agriculture, urban and industrial effluent, the destruction of cities, towns and villages through inappropriate redevelopment, bad civic design and indiscriminate ribbon development.  There is a need for the prevention of the spoiling of the countryside by badly sited development, overhead wires, river drainage, abandoned cars and defaced signposts.</P>
    <P>In most cases these problems and conflicts are the result of legitimate land uses such as housing, industry, agriculture and recreation.  I am aware that the Government intend doing something about water pollution but, unfortunately, no provision has been made for the payment of grants to the local authorities responsible for carrying out the proposals outlined in the Bill which deals with water pollution. We must take into account that local authorities are probably the greatest pollutants in the long run and the Government should make grants available to help them combat pollution.</P>
    <P>We must also remember that our coastline must be protected.  It is interesting to note that even though we have about 3,500 miles of coastline we have only 342 miles of sandy beaches and only 80 miles of those beaches are used for bathing purposes.  Those sandy beaches used for bathing are an important national asset and they must be protected.  The Government should introduce a scheme of grants to help local authorities provide recreation facilities in such places.</P>
    <P>Abandoned cars and defaced sign posts are also a big problem.  Many public dumps are along our national <Col N="1047" /> and tourist routes.  Immediate action should be taken to ensure that local authorities provide proper refuse tips. Legislation should be initiated and grants should be made available to local authorities to enable them to close down illegal tips and signpost legal tips so that the public can be made aware of them.  Refuse tips should be sited in such a way as to make as little disturbance as possible in areas of high tourist value.  All reasonable steps should be taken to conceal their existence.</P>
    <P>Public toilets should be provided in built-up areas, particularly in areas visited by tourists which become overcrowded during the peak tourist season.  There is no point in building public toilets unless some effort is made to ensure minimum standards of operation. Plans should be made at a national level for carrying out at local level.</P>
    <P>The cleanliness of our beaches is also very important.  The condition of many beaches must surely give tourists a very bad impression.  There are numerous tourist facilities which could be improved and developed because we have great natural resources. Action should be taken to increase access to more waters for game fishing.  More boats should be made available for hire, and signposting to less well-known waters could be improved.  These schemes could be carried out through Bord Fáilte, as well as the restocking of depleted waters.  Better shore facilities, such as car parking and shelters, should be <Col N="1048" /> provided for anglers.  As far as sea fishing is concerned, more shore access should be provided by signposting and the provision of tourist information centres at a large number of places in all costal areas.  A number of boat slips and mooring places should be provided in smaller towns along the coast, particularly along the east coast.  Deep-sea fishing boats should be available in more areas.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of progress has been made in recent years in relation to horse riding and pony trekking, but this could be expanded by the provision of new centres in areas where the terrain is suitable.  Horse riding and pony trekking provide recreation for the tourist who is not so young and not so fit.  In many areas these facilities would be welcomed by the local authorities if they were given the necessary financial aid.  Indoor recreational facilities should be provided in areas where there is a real shortage, especially in family holiday centres.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the proposals in the Bord Fáilte development plan. I do not think that local authorities and public bodies should be concerned with entertainment.  I fully agree with the suggestion that as much State investment as possible should go into recreational facilities and that they should be maintained by local authorities.</P>

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>1.  Apart from the fact indicated in Note 4 below, it is not appropriate to relate the figures in column 2 with those in column 3 above.  Of the total shown in column 2 as collected in motor taxation, approximately 33? per cent was retained by the Exchequer by virtue of the Finance Acts, 1966, 1970 and 1973, while there was a voted contribution of £5.356 million to the Road Fund in 1975.</P>
    <P>2.  The figures for motor taxation collected, including those for Galway, are the latest available.</P>
    <P>3.  The amount of motor taxation collected shows in relation to Dublin the total collection for the entire Dublin area, city and county including Dún Laoghaire, and likewise in relation to Cork the total collection for the entire Cork area, city and county.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation is the licensing authority for the Dublin area and Cork County Council is the licensing authority for the Cork area, in Cork the motor taxation offices in the city and county were amalgamated during 1974 and similarly the Dublin city and county offices were amalgamated some years ago.</P>
    <P>In relation to Limerick and Waterford the amounts shown as collected cover the collections in each case in both the corporation and county council taxation offices.</P>
    <P>4.  In addition to the amount of Road Fund grants shown in column 3 above, a sum of approximately £679,000 will be allocated for approved works on bridges, and so on.</P>
    <P>5.  The figures in column 3 above show, in the case of each county, the total allocated in Road Fund grants to all the road authorities in the county.  Details for individual authorities were given in reply to Question No. 20 on 9th March.  The up-to-date figure for the total allocated to Kerry County Council is £639,452.</P>

      <P>While Road Fund grants are allocated in certain circumstances for specific road improvement schemes, road authorities are not required to provide to my Department information of their annual expenditure on improvements to a particular road or route.  The information sought by the Deputy is not, therefore, available in my Department.</P>
      <P>In determining grant allocations for 1976, I have had particular regard to the need to protect the employment of road workers.  To this end I have substantially increased block grants and upkeep grants which generally have a high labour content and the increase to County Galway for these purposes in 1976 is £123,550.  I was satisfied that in present circumstances, the allocation by me of further resources specifically for the improvement of national roads in County Galway was not essential.  Should Galway County Council so decide, they are themselves free to devote portion of their block grant to works on the Galway-Clifden road.</P>

      <P>The following statement gives for each county the present (a) basic weekly time rate of wages paid to forestry workers for a 40 hour week (b) weekly rates of wages, excluding service pay, paid by county councils to road workers for a 40-hour week and (c) minimum weekly rates payable to adult male agricultural workers under the Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) (No. 2) Order, 1975.  These rates apply to a 44-hour week in the period November to February inclusive and to a 50-hour week during the remainder of the year. In the case of forestry workers an incentive bonus is payable in addition to the basic weekly time rates. The fourth phase of the national wage agreement is included where applicable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>The task force on child care services was set up in October, 1974.  It submitted its interim report to me in <Col N="930" /> September, 1975, and this was published on 18th November, 1975.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that the full implementation of the majority of the significant recommendations made in the report is not possible in the short term.  Even if all the necessary resources of finance and trained personnel were available, it would still take a considerable time to fully implement the recommendations. However, the position is further aggravated by the financial constraints arising out of the present economic situation.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this, however, my Department are pressing ahead with the formulation of an implementation programme on the basis of views which have been obtained from the Minister for Education and the Eastern Health Board.  In addition to this, some progress has been made in relation to the implementation of recommendations 2.0.12 and 2.0.13 through the provision of accommodation at Newtownmountkennedy for 17 travelling children in need of residential care.  The Eastern Health Board had been asked to urgently examine the feasibility of adapting an existing premises for use as a residential centre for severely disturbed boys and girls, recommendations 2.0.6 and 2.0.9 of the interim report.  An early meeting is being arranged with the agencies concerned to assess in detail the need for additional accommodation for homeless boys; the extent to which existing accommodation can best be used to resolve the problem; and the provision of such additional accommodation as may be required.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I am most anxious that all possible steps should be taken to improve the services through the implementation of the recommendations made in the interim report and, having regard to the complexity of the issues involved and the constraints on availability of resources, I do not think that there has been any undue delay in acting on the report.</P>

Capital resources for this year were such, however, that it has not been possible to allocate the necessary resources for this project.  The matter will be kept under review in the light of the out-turn for 1976 and the capital allocation for 1977.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was awarded and paid from 9th May, 1975, a maximum rate non-contributory old age pension of £13.25 a week which included an increase of £4.40 in respect of his wife.  He has received increases in pension of 70p a week from 3rd October, 1975 and of £1.40 a week from 2nd April, 1976, bringing his pension to £15.35 a week which is the maximum payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> A statutory condition for the receipt of contributory old age pension requires a claimant to have not less than 156 employment contributions paid in respect of his employment. Only 48 contributions, however, are recorded as paid in respect of the employment in this country of the person concerned and he fails to qualify for a contributory pension on his Irish insurance for this reason.</P>
    <P>In view of his British insurance, however, his pension position is being examined further in conjunction with the British Department of Health and Social Security to see whether, on a combination of his Irish and British insurances, he may have pension entitlements from either or both Departments under EEC regulations. Final decision awaits determination by the British Department of his British entitlement and notification of the position to my Department.  The British Department has been requested to expedite its determination.</P>

    <P>As I indicated in my reply to a Parliamentary Question by Deputy Wyse on 25th February last, the Government fully appreciate the employment problems caused by the present recession.  All sections of our population including young persons have been affected.  The real solution of the problem will occur when there has been a general upturn in the economy.  In the circumstances, the Government's strategy has been designed to mitigate the domestic effects of the present international economic crisis by tackling the problems of inflation, unemployment and under utilisation of capital investment.  As part of the strategy, the Government's public capital programme has been increased to £396.3 million which is an increase of over £100 million on the 1975 figure. At the same time, there is an awareness of the special problems of youth unemployment and measures of direct benefit to school leavers have been introduced in order to help alleviate the situation.</P>
    <P>The measures taken include the expansion of the activities of AnCO to enable 9,000 people to be trained in 1976, the introduction and expansion of the youth training programme, an increase in the number of training places for apprentices in AnCO centres and employers' establishments and additional training courses in the regional technical colleges.  Many of these measures will benefit from aid from the European Social Fund.</P>

However, over the past six months there have been some further complaints about the quality of the supply in the area, due mainly to the installation of extra equipment such as bulk milk tanks.  The majority of these complaints have already been dealt with and further improvement works have since been carried out.</P>

      <P>I have no evidence that excessive profits are being taken on potatoes either at the wholesale or retail levels.  I understand that the existing high prices are attributable to a shortage of supplies both in this country and throughout Europe.  I do not consider, therefore, that a public inquiry as suggested by the Deputy, would be useful or appropriate.</P>
