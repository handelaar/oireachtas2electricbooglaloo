    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if it is proposed to amend the regulations governing the sale of alcohol so that sales may not be made in such premises as supermarkets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all.  I think I should make clear that the granting and renewing of licences for the sale of intoxicating liquor is governed by statute and what is suggested in the question could only <Col N="516" /> be effected by statute.  This aspect of the licensing laws has remained substantially unaltered since 1902 and in the interval a pattern of equities has become established by reason of which any proposal of the kind advocated could scarcely be implemented without compensation in one form or another.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, premises of the kind referred to are far from being the only premises which sell liquor for consumption off the premises and there could be no guarantee that any prohibition on the sale of liquor in supermarkets would result in the elimination of abuses caused by the availability of liquor for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I shall consider all the suggestions that have been made to me in regard to the licensing laws but I am not yet in a position to say what if any, legislation will be introduced in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware, of course, that alcohol is sold in other premises apart from supermarkets for consumption off the premises.  The big difference is that in the supermarkets the liquor is for sale on open stands while in other off licences it is behind counters where young people cannot get it so easily.  Also, in the case of supermarkets assistants are so busy that they cannot check the age of a person buying the alcohol&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All the Ban-Ghardaí are employed on police duties which include prison duties.  On security grounds I must decline to indicate how many Ban-Ghardaí are on duty in the prisons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether all the Ban-Ghardaí or practically all of them in the Force at present are involved in prison duties and because of this Ban-Ghardaí are not available for police duties?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>When are the present vessels due to be withdrawn from the service in view of the fact that other navies have withdrawn theirs? They are now 20 years old and are classified as unseaworthy in other navies.  What forward planning is being undertaken to protect the existing <Col N="519" /> and proposed extension of our fishery limits?  Will the examination be completed at an early date so that our fishermen, who are vulnerable to poaching, will be protected?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the three minesweepers are concerned, I have no information suggesting they are unseaworthy and an order has been placed with the Verolme Cork Dockyard for a second protection vessel similar to the <i>Deirdre</i> which it is expected will be delivered in November next year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach tell us what positive plans have been made to protect our fishing?  At this stage the Government must be able to tell us what policy they have in mind for the protection of fishermen.  In view of the fact that ships similar to those in our Naval Service have been withdrawn from other navies, can the Taoiseach give any further information than that a ship is being built at the moment?  Is there any intention of replacing these three vessels in view of our proposed extended fishing limits?</P>

I am not saying the ambulance service, particularly for accidents, is as good as it should be, but these heart ambulances are available in only about three cities in Britain.

      <P>There is some evidence that the suggestion that there was large-scale shooting of swans is not correct.  It is possible there was shooting of swans for meat during the Emergency, but the authorities at Bridgend do not suggest that this is so.  According to a letter in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> from the chairman and secretary of the County Donegal Game and Wildlife Council, their investigation does not confirm that this wholesale slaughter is taking place.  As the Donegal gun clubs and game preservation societies have investigated this allegation and can find no evidence to substantiate it, my investigation will continue, but I could assuage some of the Deputy's fears by saying that it seems to be a red herring.</P>

If there are incursions from the Six Counties, and I understand there are, and the swans are being killed for the purpose of providing dog meat, that does not have to manifest itself at the Bridgend post.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the number and variety of applications for special leave from various sectors of the public service, my predecessors and I have consistently maintained that, outside very special and limited cases such as serious domestic distress or jury service, special leave with pay can only be allowed where the purpose of the leave is directly related to the officer's official duties.  I do not consider that I could justify departing from this practice and, therefore, imposing charges on the Exchequer in the type of case referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>State employees have various possibilities open to them to enable them to take part in these activities without burdening the taxpayer.  They can use part of their annual leave, they can be given special leave with pay on a recoupment basis or they can elect to receive special leave without pay. In either of these two latter situations, local or functional community efforts would be a far more suitable source than public funds from which to enable the activity to be subsidised.</P>

      <P>It would be unwise to assume.  Were there to be any departure from the well-established practice in this area there would probably be an unlimited number of <Col N="530" /> applications for a lot of worthy purposes.  If sports, for instance, were to qualify for leave of absence with pay, then why not many meritorious activities such as participating in pilgimages, works of charity and so on?  The system has worked fairly to date and I am sure the Deputy and others have contributed privately towards the loss of pay sustained by people participating in charitable work or sports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

The Minister's reference to pilgrimages and works of charity is not relevant.  I am talking about international sport, such as the Carrolls All-Star Team.</P>

      <P>There have been innumerable applications from public servants who have sought to participate in the kinds of activities which I set out on the basis of getting leave of absence with pay.  I do not think that the taxpayers should be asked to contribute towards the pay of people who are absent from their work, no matter how worthy the motive or desirable the activity, particularly when there are other ways in which the community can give such support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

      <P>I assume that the question relates to the directive dated 16th June, 1975, on the disposal of waste oils.  It is expected that the directive can be implemented by the date indicated by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The principal requirements of the directive are that member states shall take the necessary measures to ensure the safe collection and disposal of waste oils and that, as far as possible, disposal is carried out by recycling. My Department have been involved for some time in the preparatory work for implementation.  For example, local authorities have been asked to consider means for giving effect to the directive and to assist in assembling the information on the extent of the problem in their areas.  This information is required as a basis for further decisions on implementation measures. I may say that waste oils are already being collected for re-use on a substantial scale by the private sector and local authorities have been asked to co-operate by providing collection depot facilities, in appropriate circumstances.</P>

    <P>The total number of dwellings recorded as completed and the indicators of housing starts for 1975 and 1976, respectively, are not directly comparable because of the change in the new house grant scheme with effect from 1st January, 1976.  The Department of Local Government had occasion recently to draw attention to the fact that there appears to be a significant number of cases where applications are not being received promptly for certificates of exemption and certificates of satisfactory completion of houses.  The need for the prompt submission of these applications was stressed.</P>
    <P>Arising from the change in the new <Col N="535" /> house grant scheme, it is not possible to indicate the total number of dwellings authorised or begun during the period January to September, 1976. Consequently, it is not possible to give the percentage change compared with the corresponding period in 1975. Notwithstanding these reservations, it is expected that, over the four-year period ending 31st March next, the total number of dwellings completed will be of the order of 100,000 or 25,000 dwellings a year on average.</P>

      <P>I wish Deputy Faulkner would read the reply to the question. Regarding the specific question which Deputy Faulkner's supplementary refers to, he may or may not be aware that the number of houses which have been built over the past four years has exceeded the 25,000 target. This year even if the figure falls short it will still represent 100,000 houses in four years which is 30,000 odd more than his Government ever could do at the best even in the Swinging Sixties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the first two or three years of the present Administration the plans were prepared and some of the houses were being built during that time, but as the Coalition have had to take responsibility for their own business in relation to house building, the number of houses is now beginning to fall?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Thankfully, the plans were not prepared for local authority houses after the first six months.  The houses that were then being built were so bad that I would not consider it right to ask any human being to live <Col N="536" /> in them and I changed them.  The house plans had to be changed after approximately six months and since then all the plans and schemes are those on which this Government worked.</P>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner also seems not to understand that when his Government were leaving office the amount of money which they were making available for housing in the year 1973 particularly for local authority houses, would not have allowed them to exceed this over slightly 4,000 houses which they built the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I can fully appreciate why the Minister does not want to reply to any question or supplementary question that I put down.  Is the Minister aware that because of his policy in relation to SDA loans there are more families now on the waiting list for local authority houses at a time when there are less local authority houses being built?  Does he not accept that the fall in the number of local authority houses built is a calamity in these circumstances, very particularly in a situation where a quarter of the building and construction workers are unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner has asked a number of questions and none of them bears any relation to the others.  I assume that his effort is to try to make the matter more confused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of local authority houses I repeat that the best Fianna Fáil could do with regard to them was slightly over 4,000 houses in any one year.  This year, even at a reduced number, we will have over 6,500 local authority houses built.  Last year we had 8,794 local authority houses built, so I do not know how Deputy Faulkner can talk about the reduced number of local authority houses.  I would also point out that the reason why there are more people looking for local authority houses is that quite a number of people had given up any hope of ever getting a local authority house.  As the leader of his party admitted here just 12 months ago, it was sometimes as long as seven years from the time a person <Col N="537" /> went on the housing list until he could be rehoused by a local authority.  That has now been done away with. Regarding SDA loans, the people who require money to build their own houses will now get that money under the new scheme which was announced recently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister answer the question instead of giving the same type of reply as he has been giving over the past few months? Would the Minister agree that the prospects for the future are poor and would he at this late stage show some concern for the building and construction industry, one of the most important industries we have and one which is presently leading the unemployment league table?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, Deputy Faulkner has been almost complaining about the fact that I do not give him the answer he wants.  Perhaps he does not ask the question which would get that answer.  Anyway, I have given him the correct answer to what he has been asking.  With regard to the building industry, perhaps Deputy Faulkner would do a little bit of checking.  As far as house-building is concerned it represents only about 40 per cent of the building industry, so again he is wide of the mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising further out of the Minister's reply, that does not get away from the fact that there are 30,000 building and construction workers unemployed at present. Would the Minister agree that the fact very many young people who would wish to build or buy their own houses through proper SDA loans are unable to do so, that this is the real reason why the numbers on the waiting list for the local authority houses have increased and that this is a disgraceful situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that every year more local authority houses were built than ever before, Deputy Faulkner is saying something to amuse himself.  He must know he is not telling the truth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>I refer to Deputy Colley's effort on one occasion.  Would that be due to inability or unwillingness?  I have given an answer to every question I have been asked.

      <P>The numbers were 3,119 and 1,060 respectively.  The percentage change was 66 per cent.  The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that in the same periods the total numbers of loans approved from all sources were 5,324 and 5,176 respectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy Faulkner understands that to do what he and some of his partners are suggesting when they are in Opposition&mdash;they were not too anxious to do it when they were on this side &mdash;would result in the necessity to provide an extra £50 to £60 million. Since that money was being provided by another source, the building societies, there was no necessity and the money is being very carefully used to deal with sanitary services, as Deputy Faulkner is aware.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because the local loan levels were within easy reach of the price of houses at that time.  Would the Minister agree that the local authorities, the building and construction industry, the trade unions and even the Labour Party have demanded that this increase be made and that the Minister still refuses to do so? This is basically what is destroying the private sector of the building industry and what is creating the crisis in the building industry at the present time.  This is part of the reason why so many people are unemployed in the building industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The crisis in the building industry is a fiction of Deputy Faulkner's imagination if he is talking about the house building industry. With regard to the question of what <Col N="540" /> Fianna Fáil would do if they were here, in November/December, 1972, a paper was issued by that party which said it was expected that over 20,000 new houses would be required by the 1980s.  At that time they were only building 14,000 to 15,000 annually over a four-year period.  That, compared with the 25,000 plus now being built, shows the codology Deputy Faulkner carries on with here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister cannot expect satisfaction with a situation where the number of SDA loans approved has dropped by 66 per cent since 1973 particularly in circumstances, as I already pointed out, where there are so many people unemployed in the industry which is capable of providing that employment if it were properly financed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>May I repeat that Fianna Fáil were only able to build an average of about 14,000 to 15,000 houses over any four-year period compared with our 25,000?  May I also point out that, although it is true that 22,500 houses were listed as having been completed in the last year Fianna Fáil were in office, 1,500 of those were built the previous year, but there was not money to pay so they were not included until the next year.  It should be, instead of 19,000 one year and 22,000 the next, 22,500 the previous year.  Deputy Faulkner is aware that his party have been calling for a reduction in the amount of public expenditure and his leader stated in the House that in relation to the number of houses being built there were too many local authority houses being built.  He does not deny that.  In view of that is it not a lot of cod to listen to Deputy Faulkner here today?  The Deputy cannot deny that.</P>

At the moment the reason people cannot build their own houses is that they cannot get loans.  If those people have to look for a loan from the building societies they have to have investments in them.  This is the reason people who were able to build their own houses three or four years ago are not able to do it now.  That is the reason for the long list.</P>

In any event, all of the ewe flock are heavy in lamb at that time of the year and it is looking for trouble to handle them roughly. Therefore, is it not absolutely necessary that some method other than winter dipping will have to be found for the elimination of scab?</P>

    <Title>Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Bill, 1976 [Seanad] [Private Business]:Second Stage (resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the County of Louth and Borough of Drogheda (Boundaries) Provisional Order, 1976, which was made by me on 19th October last.  The order provides for the extension of the boundary of the Borough of Drogheda to take in part of County Louth and part of County Meath.  The total area being added to Drogheda is about 1,715 acres, including some 100 acres of tidal or marsh land.  The extension of the boundary of Drogheda involves a consequential alteration of the boundary of County Louth in order to include the area transferred from County Meath to Drogheda Borough.  Both extensions are provided for in this Provisional Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Articles 25 and 27 of the schedule to the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898, specify the procedure for the alteration of the boundary of a county or borough.  Following petitions to the <Col N="566" /> Minister for Local Government from Drogheda Corporation and Louth County Council, there was a public inquiry at which all interested parties were afforded an opportunity to express their views.  I considered the report of the public inquiry and made a decision on the matter which is now formalised in the Provisional Order. The extension cannot, however, become effective until the order is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas, hence the necessity for the present Bill.  In accordance with the relevant Standing Orders, the Bill was introduced in the Seanad and completed its passage through that House last week.  It is necessary that the Bill be enacted before the Christmas recess if the extension is to come into force as from the 1st January, 1977; this, being the beginning of the financial year, is the date most suitable for the local authorities and the one which will cause least inconvenience for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The Corporation in support of their petition for a boundary extension made the case that the existing area of the borough&mdash;1,486 acres&mdash;was totally inadequate to meet development needs.  I was satisfied on the basis of the evidence given at the inquiry and the report of the inspector who conducted it that an extension was justified but I was not satisfied that a boundary extension on the scale sought was justified&mdash;this would have involved an increase of 4,189 acres which is almost three times as much as the existing area of the borough.  While the areas of land being added to the borough under the Provisional Order amount to less than half the acreage sought by the corporation, the result will mean more than doubling the existing area of Drogheda to a total of about 3,201 acres.</P>
    <P>The areas being added to the borough extend north of the River Boyne into County Louth and southwards into County Meath and they are contiguous to the existing borough boundary.  It is desirable for the proper planning and orderly development of these areas that they be brought under the control of the <Col N="567" /> Drogheda Corporation, since already parts of these areas are becoming both residential and industrial suburbs of Drogheda.  The extension of the boundary will help the corporation to play an even more positive role as a development authority under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts.  I would, indeed, expect that the corporation, as a matter of urgency, would review their development plan to meet the needs of their expanded area.  By virtue of a provision of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, they can, in fact, bring forward an entirely new plan for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Drogheda is a compact and densely developed town and is already compelled to overspill the existing borough boundary to find accommodation for essential development.  For quite some time, Drogheda Corporation itself has had to seek land outside of the borough to meet its statutory obligations.  The extension of the boundary will meet future population growth and development needs as well as bringing within the borough existing overspill development. This includes some 200 houses built by Drogheda Corporation in the area being transferred from Meath. The population of the borough increased from 17,909 in 1966 to 19,762 at the 1971 census and has continued to increase since then.  The population of the area now being added to Drogheda is estimated to be of the order of 2,000, occupying some 500 houses.</P>
    <P>Provisions consequential on the extension are included in the provisional order.  These follow the usual lines and provide for such matters as the preparation of official maps of the altered boundaries of the three areas involved, the continuation in effect of resolutions and orders, as appropriate, arrangements in regard to registers of electors, bye-laws, polling districts, and any necessary financial adjustments as between the three authorities in relation to property, debts and liabilities.</P>
    <P>The provisions of article 16 and the Second Schedule are an important feature of the order.  They ensure that <Col N="568" /> ratepayers in the areas being added to the borough will be cushioned against increases in their rates bills by providing for phasing-in arrangements under which the rise to Drogheda rate levels will take place over a 15-year period.  Under these provisions ratepayers in the areas being transferred, who were liable for rates in the current year, will pay in 1977 only that proportion of the Drogheda rate which the rates in their present rating area bore to the Drogheda rate in 1976, this proportion is 61 per cent in the case of the Meath ratepayers and 68 per cent in the case of the Louth ratepayers.  These ratepayers will not be liable for full Drogheda rates until 1993.  These generous phasing-in arrangements, together with the continuation of the agricultural grant reliefs on land being transferred to urban areas as provided for in the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1976, provide a very considerable easement for ratepayers who otherwise might have found themselves paying much higher rates as a consequence of the boundary extension.</P>
    <P>In commending the Bill to the House, I would ask for the co-operation of Deputies so as to ensure that it will have a speedy passage in order that the boundary extension can become effective on 1st January next as provided for in the provisional order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has pointed out, this Bill is for the purpose of confirming a local government provisional order relating to changes in the boundaries of County Louth and County Meath and the borough of Drogheda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand why the Bill is introduced at this late stage of the session.  We are now in the final week of the session and I had hoped the Bill would have come before the House earlier.  If I am to judge by section 2 of the Schedule and also by what the Minister said at the end of his speech, it is hoped that the order will come into operation on 1st January, 1977.  As the original provisional order which, to all intents and purposes, was exactly similar to <Col N="569" /> the Bill was sent to the local authorities concerned on 19th October I had hoped that the Bill would be discussed in the House before now. A considerable amount of administrative changes must be made.  Had it been possible to bring the Bill before the House last May or June I would have thought it would have facilitated the local authorities concerned, as well as giving the House an opportunity to debate it thoroughly.</P>
    <P>Drogheda is a town of immense historic importance with charters dating back to 1229 so far as the borough is concerned on the County Louth side of the Boyne and to 1247 so far as the borough is concerned on the County Meath side of the Boyne. The present borough which straddles the Boyne is held under charters of James I and William III.</P>
    <P>The importance of the town is emphasised by the fact that a parliament sat there under the Lord Lieutenant, Sir Edward Poynings, and it was that parliament that enacted Poynings Law which had such an immense influence on the course of Irish history in later years.  Drogheda suffered the massacre which occurred during the Cromwellian period.  St. Oliver Plunkett walked the streets of the town during his ministry as Archbishop of Armagh and he regarded Drogheda as the most important town in his archdiocese.</P>
    <P>The history of Drogheda is a source of immense pride to its citizens but lest it be thought that the town is simply a relic of the past I would point out that it is a developing area with a fine harbour and with the greatest potential for industrial development outside the Dublin metropolitan area.  Drogheda has shown its capacity for industrial development down through the years and apart from the industries located there in the past 20 years many other industries have roots there going back over a long number of years.  The industrial policy of the late Seán Lemass gave a fillip to the industrial development of Drogheda.</P>
    <P>In Drogheda there is a wide variety of heavy and light industries. The range covers cement, asbestos <Col N="570" /> pipes, textiles, clothing, boots and shoes, fertilisers, foodstuffs, agricultural machinery, hypodermic syringes, plastics, soft drinks and so on.  Recently with the closure of some industries and with reduced employment in others a serious unemployment problem has developed and this problem relates, in particular, to young people and school leavers.  It is of vital importance to Drogheda that every consideration be given to any proposal that can help to alleviate the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>For some time Drogheda has recognised that it was reaching the limit of industrial, commercial and housing expansion within its present boundaries and indeed it has now passed that limit.  In the past few years some of the new industries have been sited outside the borough boundary, as are some of the local authority and private housing estates.  The corporation decided that if they were to continue developing both industrially and in relation to housing and services in an orderly manner and in a way that would ensure the provision of amenities for its citizens it was essential that the present boundary be altered.  Some years ago they put in motion the machinery to achieve this objective by petitioning the Minister for Local Government to sanction an alteration to the boundary and they specified the area proposed to be incorporated within the new boundary.  This area differs considerably from that proposed by the Minister in the Bill and I will deal with that aspect later.</P>
    <P>The existing area within the borough boundary is approximately 1,486 acres.  As I pointed out earlier, this is totally inadequate to meet the growing needs of Drogheda for private and local authority sites, for the volume of industrialisation of which Drogheda is capable and for the anticipated increase in population to about 45,000 people which, it is estimated, will be approximately the figure in 1986, an increase which will obviously put a very severe strain indeed on housing sites.</P>
    <P>In reaching a decision as to the area necessary the corporation took a very proper attitude in that they concerned <Col N="571" /> themselves not simply with the minimum needs of the town but also with the projected needs in the foreseeable future.  They took the view that a rapidly expanding town like Drogheda should not be precluded from exercising control over development outside its present boundary, development which had largely arisen because of its own efforts, and the members of the corporation therefore proposed to add 4,189 acres to the town area made up of 3,041 acres from County Meath and 1,840 acres from County Louth, the bed of the River Boyne to be included in both cases.  This meant acquiring one-half of 1 per cent of the total area of both Louth and Meath.  Strangely enough, the total area proposed of approximately 5,675 acres is roughly the same area as was under the jurisdiction of the corporation when it was united by charter as a single corporation in 1412, the area then being 5,780 acres.  The area proposed by the corporation is roughly the same area as the present area under the jurisdiction of Dundalk Urban District Council.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the past, it was the considered opinion of the corporation and their experts at the time the Minister for Local Government was petitioned to permit the extension of the borough boundary that the area of 4,189 acres proposed to be added to the borough was the minimum area required to accommodate the increased population and to provide the employment outlets and the amenities necessary.  The extension of the boundary as proposed was, therefore, mainly taking within the borough what could be regarded as the natural outgrowth of the town and the necessary land to allow for projected expansion. As I pointed out earlier, some of the area proposed to be taken within the boundary was already being serviced by the corporation, which received an income from the servicing related to only portion of it, namely, the water rate.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat there is virtually no building land left within the present borough boundary.  Apart from the basic requirements of land to provide <Col N="572" /> for both private and local authority housing, it is vitally important to have land available for tourist development, for industrial and commercial activities, for transport, for cultural, social and sporting amenities, for churches, schools, recreation centres, clubs and so on to cater for an expanding population.  The greatest emphasis must be placed on industrial development because Drogheda has been particularly hard hit in recent times and the number of jobs lost has been much greater than the number of new jobs which have been actually filled.</P>
    <P>Various economic and other studies have been carried out in Drogheda which show the town as having a tremendous potential for further expansion. The people are anxious to ensure that development takes place in an orderly fashion and they, therefore, need control over land and buildings on the periphery of the town.  In deciding the amount of land required the corporation took particular note of the projected population growth as outlined in the various reports and the needs which such a growth would create.  They believed that the area in the original request was necessary and justificable if they were to proceed with long-term plans. It is, therefore, with quite considerable disappointment that I note, as a representative of Drogheda for the last 20 years and one with an intimate knowledge of its problems, that the Minister does not propose to include within its boundaries the area the corporation is on record as stating is the minimum required in the light of the future prospects of the town.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite content to permit the corporation to extend its boundaries almost to the limit of the corporation's application on the Louth side of the Boyne but he has cut down considerably on the amount of land the corporation desire to incorporate within its boundaries on the Meath side of the Boyne.  The facts are that the part of Meath coming within the borough as a result of the Minister's order is little more than the amount already purchased and owned and serviced by the corporation, an area <Col N="573" /> on which houses, both local authority and private, and industries were built, together with land owned by the corporation on which it is proposed to build a new technical school, the Rathmullen primary school and other amenities.  The remaining area consists of a relatively small piece of land on the east side of the town, if one excludes the slobland and the river bed, and a further area of land on the west side adjacent to the industrial estate.</P>
    <P>This is far from sufficient, in my view, if the town is to grow as expected and if proper and forwardlooking planning is to take place.  This is a very important matter on which the future of the town depends to quite an extent and, in view of that, the approach of the Minister is a rather parochial one.  I could understand, even if I did not accept, the Minister's stand when he was a Deputy representing County Meath and before he was appointed as Minister for Local Government and when his stance could be described by the term &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo;.  I cannot, however, understand his attitude now that he is Minister for Local Government and I believe he should alter his outlook. I can see no reason why he should refuse to accept the original proposal submitted by the corporation, a proposal which came to fruition after much thought and study of all the problems involved and something which the corporation believe necessary in the interests of the future economic expansion and the provision of houses and jobs in Drogheda.  Such industrial development for example would be to the advantage of the people of Meath as well as the people of Drogheda and Louth.</P>
    <P>When the corporation found the Minister was adamant in his refusal to alter his decision they suggested he should permit an exchange of land on the east side of the town in County Meath for land on the west side of the town, also in County Meath, and near the industrial estate, because the latter was suitable for development since it was already serviced by the corporation. This request was also turned down.  As I said, the amount of land <Col N="574" /> the corporation had originally proposed to include within its boundaries is about one-half of 1 per cent of County Meath and one-half of 1 per cent of County Louth and in that sense the corporation could not be said to be more concerned about one county rather than the other.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible that had it been feasible the corporation would have taken a larger portion of County Louth within its boundaries, but anybody who knows Drogheda&mdash;and I have no doubt the Minister knows it well&mdash;is aware that further extension in the County Louth direction is hindered by physical obstacles, for example, the fact that there is quarrying on a large scale for raw materials for the cement factory, and also the fact that there are drainage difficulties. Undoubtedly quarrying for raw materials for the cement factory will continue to extend over a large area, and extensive quarries are hardly a feasible proposition for the middle of a built-up area.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the topography of the town, coupled with the engineering advice to the corporation, determined the direction of the proposed extension, and therefore it was decided to face in general to the south of the Boyne where the lands are easily served and where there is a good network of existing roads; and equally important is the fact that the main source of water supply is situated south of the town and mains are already laid in the recommended added area.</P>
    <P>The interests of the people of Drogheda, in both Louth and east Meath, require that very serious consideration be given to the original and well-considered proposals of the Drogheda Corporation.  The case originally put forward by the corporation, which petitioned the Minister for Local Government, is a sound one and one which would be acceptable to an impartial observer.  I believe that if the Minister were to accept the original proposals of the corporation he would be making a worthwhile contribution to the growth of this ancient and vigorous borough of <Col N="575" /> Drogheda and posterity would applaud him for it, even though it might create minor problems for him today.</P>
    <P>If the Minister persists in his attitude in pushing the Bill through in its present form, then the day is not very far distant when somebody else will have to introduce a similar Bill to extend the boundary with the long and arduous planning, research and study which that entails; unless of course he adopts the proposals we had in our White Paper on Local Government Reorganisation which would allow the Minister for Local Government, on his own initiative, to make an order altering the boundary.  We had also proposed in that White Paper to remove disincentives to boundary extensions, in particular the provisions under which the urban authority may be liable to pay compensation to a county council for the loss of rate income from the added area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>No, to extend it very considerably.  Let me further remind the Minister that he recently brought a Bill before the House which he has mentioned in his opening statement, with which I agreed on behalf of my party and which ensures that the remission of rates on agricultural land at present applying to land outside the boundary will continue after the agricultural land comes within the jurisdiction of the corporation.  I made the point in speaking on that Bill that, when the Minister decided to make that change he should have included within its scope all agricultural land within the present boundary of the town.  I still feel this should be so, but I do not propose on this occasion to go into the arguments put forward by me at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the changes made in the Bill ease the problems of those whose land will be included in the new area to be incorporated within the borough boundary, and while it can be said it will not eliminate all their problems, at least these problems will be compensated <Col N="576" /> for by the new amenities which will be available to those who will in future be residing within the new borough boundary.</P>
    <P>Professor Myles Wright, in his report on the Dublin Planning Region, stated that Drogheda was by far the most important industrial centre in the extra-metropolitan area in terms of numbers, variety of plant and the employment offered.  He pointed out that Drogheda was one of the two districts which appeared to have the greatest potential for development.  I have no doubt, from my long experience of and close association with Drogheda, that what Professor Wright had to say about the town is true.  It has had a continuing growth and a continuing population increase even when times were difficult.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that now that we are deciding on one facet, and a very important facet, of Drogheda's future, the Minister is insisting on granting an area of land for incorporation in the borough which will not be capable of proper long-term development and planning.  The corporation are being inhibited in their efforts to provide as they would wish for Drogheda's future, and the situation is being created in which the town will not be able to cater for its citizens as it might do, to the detriment not only of its citizens but of many people who are living outside its borders and who are dependent on it for their livelihood.</P>
    <P>The proposed new area which the Drogheda Corporation wanted incorporated within the borough boundary is one which they decided on after very considerable discussion and after accepting the advice of their experts. It is unfortunate that the Minister appears to be determined to make available to the corporation only a small portion of the area determined by the corporation for inclusion, and an area which they believed was essential for the development of the town.  In the present day and age, long-term planning is of vital importance, and I would therefore again, even at this late stage, ask the Minister to reconsider the matter and to grant the facilities which were requested by the corporation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Faulkner for the way in which he has dealt with the Bill.  I did not agree with a great deal of what he said but, in the main, he knows Drogheda very well.  He said I probably knew it too.  I would remind him I live about two-and-a-half miles from Drogheda; I think he lives about eight or nine miles from it.  In fact, I am the nearest TD to Drogheda town in a different constituency. I was tempted a couple of months ago to slice some of it off, but I decided I would not like to disturb the peace of that little county, so I left them as they were.</P>
      <P>Of course, Drogheda Corporation looked for 3,041 acres from Meath and 1,148 from Louth, that is, a total of 4,189 acres.  In view of the fact that the existing size of the town is 1,486 acres, I think it was a bit much to look for such an extension.  The size now will be 3,201 acres.  They have got an increase of 115 per cent in the size of the town.  I have known Drogheda for 34 years.  It is a great town and there are great people in it.  One extraordinary thing is that quite a number of the people from Drogheda moved out into County Meath, not, as Deputy Faulkner says, because they had nowhere else to go but because for a long period Meath County Council gave both supplementary grants and loans when they were not available in County Louth.  The result is that there are little pockets of houses all around the town.  Then the Drogheda Corporation followed by bringing out some of the sizeable areas of local authority houses, bought land in County Meath and built in County Meath.  It is only right, in my opinion, that this should be taken back in again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Faulkner was quite correct in his reference to my policy of &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo;, which, in fact, it was at the time.  I was a member of Meath County Council and what riled me at the time was that the application was made to the then Minister for Local Government to alter the boundary and to bring part of Meath and Louth into Drogheda and part of Meath into Louth.  However, Meath County Council were <Col N="578" /> never approached about it.  As a member of the council, I was aware that if they had been approached there could have been discussions and one never knows what the outcome would have been.  It would have saved a lot of money.  I propose in legislation which is at an advanced stage of preparation, and which I propose to introduce in the next session, to include a provision which would prevent this waste of public money.  It is a waste of money in my view to have these expensive inquiries before a necessary extension is put into operation.  I do not think Drogheda Corporation thought they were going to get anything like the amount of land they asked for.</P>
    <P>It is wrong of Deputy Faulkner to suggest that Meath did not give anything. In fact, they have given 718 acres and Drogheda Corporation are well satisfied with that.  They have also got a first-class hotel and several factories which were built in County Meath.  It is true that a number of small industries which were set up seven or eight years ago in Drogheda have closed down.  However, quite a number of industries have started and Deputy Faulkner should not overlook the fact that the people who run the town and the business community have been fighting all the time for more industries.  They have been getting them and, as Deputy Faulkner is aware, there is another sizeable industry on its way to Drogheda.  When we hear the figures for unemployment in Drogheda quoted people seem to forget, if it suits them, that they cover a wide area in counties Louth and Meath; they do not represent Drogheda town alone.  A man recently told me he was finding it difficult to get workers in Drogheda town and that suggests that the situation is not as bad as Deputy Faulkner paints it.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest objections the people who would be going into the Drogheda boundary would have is that they would be losing whatever agricultural grants and facilities they were getting from Meath County Council but which are not available from Louth County Council.  What has been done is very reasonable.  After I <Col N="579" /> announced my decision in principle as to the size of the extension to be granted, Drogheda Corporation offered to cede some 217 acres of the land located in the south-east, which Deputy Faulkner referred to, for 297 acres in the Rathmullen area to the west and outside of that area to be brought into Drogheda.  On 12th December, 1973, the Department wrote to Drogheda Corporation and suggested that the matter be discussed with Meath County Council and that the Department be advised of the outcome of the discussions in the light of which the Minister would be prepared to consider the proposal.  I would have been prepared to go along with any agreement reached locally on the matter but no agreement was reached. Apart from this I was advised that technically there was no compelling reason for recommending the swop suggested by the corporation because of sewerage considerations and the development of the area requested by the corporation as a swop was many years away.  In addition, if the borough is to remain an independent planning authority it should have control over the area to the south-east, which Drogheda Corporation propose to exclude, especially if it seemed likely that private development would take place in this area.</P>
    <P>In my view Drogheda Corporation are not dissatisfied with the outcome. They have got a very sizeable portion of land on which to develop.  They have got an area 115 per cent greater than the size of the town up to now. As Deputy Faulkner is aware, the last revision of the town boundary was in 1897 or 1898 when the area was brought out as far as Black Bull on the Dublin Road on the Meath side. I suggest that the corporation work as hard as they can on the area they are getting now and if they come back in another 70 or 80 years and say they have not enough land we will consider giving them another bit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the normal provision inserted in boundary extensions enabling the authorities concerned to agree among themselves any necessary financial adjustments arising from the boundary extension.  Such adjustments would typically arise in relation to property, including land, houses, office equipment and investments, liability and so on.  Ideally, and hopefully, any such adjustment can or will be agreed between the authorities themselves and it is best that this matter be left entirely to the authorities for agreement.  In any event the matter is so complex that it would be impossible to settle it by way of formula included in an order or legislation. Subparagraph (2), however, provides for the situation where the authorities cannot agree as to the financial adjustment as between themselves and in this event the Minister shall appoint an arbitrator to determine the actual adjustment.  The normal practice is to appoint a person from the Local Government auditor division who would be very familiar with the detailed financial set up of local authorities as well as being in an independent position relative to local authorities and the Minister.  Subparagraph (3) provides that every adjustment under the paragraph, whether agreed between the authorities or determined by an arbitrator appointed by the Minister, is final and conclusive and may be enforced by an authority against another.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I have no objection to the amendment but it is an indication of the unbusinesslike way in which much of the business here is transacted.  The Bill has been circulated for a considerable time.  I know there are changes in the Bill and this particular amendment is justified at this time. The Minister will require it to ensure that the Bill is signed by the President and properly processed through the House.  Generally, the progress of this Bill over the past 18 months has been most unsatisfactory from the Opposition point of view and I am sure from the Minister's.  We experienced a number of breaks over the past 12 months and this is not the best way to process legislation.  We must have come back to the Bill on at least eight or nine occasions trying to pick up the threads where we had left them, perhaps, six months previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of procedure is most unsatisfactory and is one of the reasons why the Minister has to bring <Col N="585" /> in this amendment.  I do not suggest that adequate time should not be given.  I believe that the Committee Stage of a Bill is the most important Stage and every opportunity for discussion should be given.  Time should be available so as to ensure that when the legislation is finally passed it is accepted generally and is not repugnant to the Constitution and so on.</P>
    <P>To a very large extent, this measure has been used as a fill-in Bill over the past 12 months.  Whoever is responsible, this is not the best way to handle it.  I am sure other Bills have gone through the House in the same way.  If that happened to my knowledge I would be the first to complain about it but this is the first case of it of which I have personal experience and I, therefore, wish to lodge an objection in regard to the system of arranging business.  Especially in the last few years we do not know where we are going from day to day and what Bills are coming up.  The filling-in process for which this Bill has been used is very unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with what Deputy Fitzpatrick said and I hope the Whips on both sides will take notice of his observations. Again, this is purely a technical amendment, indeed, a semantic one. I am advised that the word &ldquo;effusion&rdquo; is imprecise in the context in which it is used in this subsection and that the word &ldquo;effluxion&rdquo; should be inserted instead.  There is no question of any change in the meaning of the subsection.  This change has been recommended for technical reasons by the parliamentary draftsman.  The words &ldquo;effusion&rdquo; and &ldquo;effluxion&rdquo; as normally used have much the same meaning, but the parliamentary draftsman has advised that &ldquo;effluxion&rdquo; is the more precise word for use in the context involved in this subsection.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, after line 43, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() The Authority shall, with the consent of the Minister, appoint a programme Council which shall as far as possible be representative of those parts of Ireland in which it is not possible to receive television broadcasts, at reasonable strength emanating from outside the State.

      <P>I would like to say a few words in support of this amendment. It seems to me to be worth while to provide people living in the single-channel area with a vehicle whereby they could indicate their choice of the programmes which would be available on the second channel.  This has been a controversial problem over a number of years. There is a good deal to be said in favour of ensuring that the Authority will have a good idea of the kind of programmes the people would like when a selection is being made for retransmission as distinct from original home-produced programmes.  Since it will be of greater value to those in the single-channel areas than those <Col N="587" /> living in the multi-channels areas, it does not seem to me to be reasonable that the choice should lie as it does at present with channel 1.  I hope the Minister can understand what I am saying.</P>
      <P>We are accustomed to having a choice of four or five channels.  The gist of the argument over the past few years concerned a wide choice slot over a second channel mainly catering for the single-channel area.  It is reasonable to ensure that the needs of those people are met first.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> During the Committee Stage we tabled an amendment along these lines.  During the debate I withdrew my amendment because, having looked at it again, I thought we were placing too many restrictions on the Authority and the people engaged in broadcasting. If you look at the wording of my last amendment on Committee Stage and this amendment, you will find that it is not compelling the Authority in any way to accept that obligation.  In this amendment I am asking the Minister to establish a programme council to advise the Authority on the type of programmes appropriate to the viewers of the second channel.  That is not asking for too much.</P>
      <P>As I said in my amendment, this council will act in an advisory capacity. When the second channel is operating it is vitally important that the people in the single-channel area will accept it.  This will fulfil the objectives for which the second channel is being introduced.  There has already been a great deal of criticism of the contents of the second channel.  There are many sections of the community who are seeking the same facilities as are available on the east coast.  It is important that their views be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said in various parts of the country that he would be willing to make multi-channel television available.  I am not sure if this can be implemented.  He has not spelled out in any great detail when that would become operational.  The important <Col N="588" /> point here is that when the second channel is operational the people living in the single-channel areas will be satisfied with the programmes RTE are capable of showing.</P>
    <P>If our national broadcasting is to survive against our major competitors, it is important that our broadcasting stations are capable of commanding the respect of all sections of the community. That is why I put down this amendment.  I believe the people will have more confidence in the Authority if they know their views are represented and that their choice of programmes is being forwarded to the Authority so that the producers will get an idea of the type of programmes the people in the single-channel areas would like to see on a second channel.</P>
    <P>Most people would like to see the idea of a second channel accepted, even if it involves a lot of taxpayers' money.  It is desirable, even in a small country like ours, that opinion be formed and that our culture be defended. On the east coast we are subjected to a lot of television competition and this poses a great deal of challenge to our own broadcasting system.  It is our opinion that the type of body suggested in this amendment would be desirable because they would represent a cross-section of the country's views, west and south, of television programmes, not necessarily the views of those now in the single-channel areas but in Dublin as well.</P>
    <P>In my visits to the country I have heard criticism of RTE programmes, I have heard people say that they are east-of-Ireland orientated, that they are from within the Pale.  I do not accept such criticisms, but if we had a body to advise RTE, their producers and broadcasters, it would eliminate that type of bias, if it exists. Our television programmes go into the homes of most of our people, in many of which there are young children, and I should like to see most of our programmes emanating from our own broadcasting authority.  If in this Bill we can make any contribution to achieving that, we should try to do so, realising of course that there will always be a certain foreign-based content. The Minister gave commitments <Col N="589" /> in regard to multi-channel viewing in Limerick, Cork and Waterford. I do not know how definite that commitment was.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I am sure the body suggested in the amendment would be drawn from Limerick, Cork and Waterford as well as from other areas, and that they will represent various viewpoints such as trade unions, business, farming and so forth.  Their advice would represent a cross-section and would be invaluable.  In reply to a parliamentary question by me, the Minister stated he would be in a position to make an announcement on the second-channel proposal before the end of 1976.  We await that announcement and we hope that in it will be a firm commitment to a full-blooded second RTE channel because it would be disastrous to embark on limited programmes only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to look carefully at this amendment.  He will find that its acceptance will contribute towards strengthening a second channel because of the universal nature of the body proposed.  We appreciate that the body proposed will not have much teeth because they would be very much in an advisory capacity, but they could be very useful to the Authority. People living in Dublin would not be sure of the type of programmes the people in the west and south would be satisfied to accept.  If a manufacturer wants to sell a product he will carry out a countrywide survey to find out the type of product that would go best.  The same principle would apply in this respect.  The body suggested would be able to help the Broadcasting Authority and they would certainly not impede the development of our broadcasting system.  What we are aiming at is the establishment of a council representative of people in the west and south.  Those producing a programme would be in a position to form a balanced opinion having got this advice.  Far from impeding the Authority, it would be a valuable contribution towards the Authority and <Col N="590" /> other people engaged in broadcasting. For that reason I hope that the Minister will see his way to accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered very carefully this amendment in the name of Deputy Fitzpatrick. I realise that it is motivated by a genuine desire to improve the Bill before the House, as indeed all the efforts of himself and Deputy Brugha have been.  I would, therefore, like to have been able to accept it but I also appreciate the fact that the change in this amendment&mdash;which, as he indicated, is not the same as that debated on Committee Stage&mdash;is that it provides for the establishment of a council which would advise rather than control the selection of material to be transmitted on any new television service.  I appreciate that that change is motivated by a desire to make the amendment more acceptable and it does move in that direction, but I am afraid it does not move enough to eliminate my opposition to the amendment even as it now stands.</P>
      <P>The basis of my objection is that we already have a provision in the Bill for the appointment of such committees in cases where the Authority wishes to do that.  The Deputy of course indicated his awareness of that. Section 5 (1) of the Bill states:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of enabling the Authority to have advice in performing its functions, the Authority may, with the consent of the Minister, from time to time appoint advisory committees or advisers. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, if the Authority think it desirable, as they might&mdash;I cannot say &mdash;to appoint an advisory committee with the sort of functions that the Deputy has in mind here they can do so.  Therefore, in those circumstances the operative character of the amendment would be to oblige the Authority specifically in the case in which they did not want to appoint an advisory committee or programme council of this kind to do so.  It would be a mandatory provision and it is really not of use.  It is not operative unless it applies to the situation where <Col N="591" /> the Authority do not want to do this. If they want to do it, they can do it under the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>The sense of that is contrary to the general sense of this Bill which is to increase rather than diminish the autonomy of the Authority.</P>
    <P>In general, for example, the Minister ceases to appoint committees.  It is left to the Authority to do so where they think that would be useful.  It seems to be contrary to the spirit of that to build into the Bill a mandatory provision for the appointment by the Authority of an advisory committee of this kind which is of use only if it is to be taken as obliging the Authority to do something which in their own best judgment of their responsibilities they do not want to do. Except for obliging them to do that when they do not want to do it, it has no function that I can see.</P>
    <P>I gave my views on the general question in considerable detail in my opening speech on Second Stage as reported in Volume 285, No. 3 of the Official Report, columns 410 and 411 and in the course of the Committee Stage on the section as in Volume 290, No. 5, columns 730 to 740.  Of course, these refer to a somewhat different amendment, as I indicated, but I have now added to those general considerations my reaction to the amendment as amended, if one can say so.  I am still convinced that it should be left to the RTE Authority to determine the best way of ensuring that the broadcasting services they provide in the future will reflect the wishes of viewers, particularly those in areas where BBC 1 and IBA programmes are not available.  They have, of course, as the Authority responsible for broadcasting, every incentive to do just that as it would be in the interests of broadcasting, from which the interests of the Authority are in no way separate, to bring that about.  In my opinion this is more in tune with the spirit of the Bill which was to give maximum freedom and autonomy to the Authority within clearly defined and understood statutory restraints. Accordingly, I am sorry that I cannot <Col N="592" /> see my way to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 49, after &ldquo;sound&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and visual&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>During the Committee Stage of the Bill again this section came up for discussion.  We find in this section that the Authority are obliged to make recordings only of sound in certain broadcasts.  We put forward the argument at that time that it would be difficult for the complaints commission to adjudicate on certain complaints which would be made to them without having a visual recording also.  Remember that when the complaints commission come into operation they will be confronted with a situation which I believe will not be workable.  It will place an obligation on them to adjudicate on certain matters without having the proper material.  When I speak of the material here I mean sound and visual broadcast to enable them to make a proper adjudication.  Especially where television is concerned, I cannot visualise how they are going to function as I would expect them to do when complaints are made to them as regards a certain television programme where a person may say that his character has been damaged in some way not by the dialogue in a television programme but in the picture and this can happen.  There will be many complaints not so much of what was said but of what was shown. If anyone in this House can tell me how the complaints commission are going to adjudicate on that type of situation I shall be glad because I have not the foggiest idea of how they are going to come to a right decision.  It is cumbersome for the Authority to have a considerable amount of these recordings kept in Montrose and various places like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is expensive, probably very much so, but the important factor is that if the programme council are to function efficiently and make balanced decisions they cannot do so <Col N="593" /> without the proper evidence before them.  In a court of law evidence and exhibits are of vital importance. Everything which reflects on the case must be made available in a court of law to help jurors and judges to form a balanced opinion.  The complaints commission will be asked to make a balanced judgment on certain complaints made to them.  If the complaint is made in relation to a radio programme, I can see that records in relation to sound broadcasting would be sufficient.  When it refers to a complaint about a television programme, there will be a serious shortcoming in the whole operation in relation to the commission deciding who is right and who is wrong because they will not have the proper material available to them.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider this.</P>
    <P>It is important that television recordings should be made available to the complaints commission when they are asked to adjudicate on the disputes which will arise.  I know that very few of them have arisen in the past but we are not legislating for the past but for the future and what may happen.  Did the Minister seek information from the three body committee which we have adjudicating on broadcasting matters?  Did he ask them if they were properly equipped with material that is at hand in relation to various issues?  Did he ask them if it is possible for them to make a balanced judgment without visual recordings of television programmes? I would like to hear their reply.  If I was on that type of commission, I would have no hesitation in saying that I could not effectively carry out my duties and be fair to all without this material available to me.</P>
    <P>Let us give the complaints commission the material they require. This half measure will not work because any decision they make will be made in the light that they had not sufficient evidence available to them.  It will be difficult for them at some future date to stand over their judgment.  It is important to ensure that we have not to come back to the House at some future date and say <Col N="594" /> that the commission cannot carry on their duties effectively.  We would be to blame for this.  That is why I have submitted that visual recordings as well as sound should be made available by the RTE Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy understands that in relation to this whole field it is not possible to achieve perfection.  A great deal of what is broadcast is live in conditions where it simply is not possible to preserve a visual record at all.  Nobody scans this, looks at it or exercises judgment and it goes out as it is.  It is, perhaps, there that the greatest danger of offence being given arises. That cannot be done.</P>
      <P>The visual material that can be preserved would not cover the whole area or, indeed, the most sensitive area.  I have discussed the question of the retention of visual material with RTE.  They advise that this would be quite a costly exercise. Retention for 180 days&mdash;as the Deputy knows this is what we have in mind now for sound material&mdash;would involve capital expenditure of the order of £100,000 at annual costs of about £15,000 at mid-1976 prices. While it might be useful in some cases for the complaints commission to have visual as well as sound recordings of programmes, which are the subject of complaint, I do not think that they will be seriously impeded in exercising their functions by not having the visual material; otherwise I feel sure that the existing complaints advisory committee would have drawn attention to any difficulties created by the lack of visual recordings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complaints advisory committee have been in existence for over two years.  Their functions are not very different from those of the proposed complaints commission.  The advisory committee have not had access to video recordings and they have not suggested that they were hampered as a result. The Deputy asked me and I should tell him that I did not specifically ask them for their views on that but they saw the draft Bill and they did not suggest any amendment of section 6. In these circumstances, I do not think I would be justified in requiring the <Col N="595" /> Authority to incur the relatively heavy costs that would be involved in retaining the visual content of all those broadcasts of which the visual can be preserved.  Accordingly, I regret I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>It may be possible for the Authority to do video tapes of some programmes.  I believe there will be many programmes that will not cause any problems to anybody.  It seems to present some problems to have every broadcast taped.  However, there could be incidents where one might have a different judgment if one was able to see the picture in addition to the sound.  I am sure that the impact of visual would have a different influence on the complaints commission to merely hearing the sound broadcast.  Unfortunately, nobody knows, although one may guess, what programmes will be controversial or difficult.  We will not know until the programmes are over.  Perhaps the Authority in approaching this, particularly in relation to current affairs programmes, may be able to consider using a video tape in place of an ordinary tape so that there will be a more accurate record of a programme available for the time specified.</P>

      <Col N="596" /> During the Committee Stage debate on this section I promised to reconsider in consultation with the RTE Authority whether the mandatory period of 60 days for retention of recordings might be increased and whether retention of visual material in addition to sound recordings would be practicable.  The result of these consultations is reflected in this amendment which provides that sound recordings of all programmes must be retained for 180 days rather than 60 days provided for in the Bill as it originally stood.  This goes a considerable way towards meeting the reservations Deputies had about this provision.  It is intended with that in mind.  If the amendment is accepted, it would mean that sound recordings of all programmes would have to be retained by RTE for at least 180 days or roughly six months and that if the broadcasting complaints commission find that this is too short it could be extended by agreement between the commission and the Authority.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central</i>): I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 52, after &ldquo;fees&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and any compensation paid to licence holders for expenses incurred due to the discontinuation of line 405&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put a parliamentary question to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in relation to the number of licensed <Col N="598" /> television sets that would become obsolete when the 405 line is discontinued. The Minister informed me that he understood this line would be discontinued around July or August, 1977 and gave me a figure of about 22,000 sets which will become redundant in various parts of the country.  I am not trying to inhibit the expansion of the second channel.  I realise that when a second channel is in use it will be impossible for the 405 line to continue.</P>
    <P>The holders of these 405 line sets are generally the poorer sections of our community.  I understand that these sets were last manufactured in this country about ten years ago.  The more affluent sections of our community do not use these sets any more.  Many organisations collect and distribute these sets to the poorer sections of our community and in many cases this is the only type of entertainment they have.  I would like to know how the Minister will compensate these people.  I am not advocating compensation for people who can afford to replace a set.  I am speaking on behalf of old age pensioners and so on who cannot afford to replace a set.  It is unfortunate that the 405 line has to be discontinued.  If it is for the advancement of television and the second channel, we must accept it but I am asking the Minister to state that in some way we will compensate old age pensioners and the weaker sections of our community.  Twenty-two thousand sets constitute quite a considerable number and quite a considerable number of people will be affected.  If they were in a position to buy a new television set.  I would not sympathise with that category.  They could have phased out the set in the past five or six years.  Unfortunately, the people we are referring to will not be able to replace their sets and the same will apply to charitable organisations who help them.  It is obvious that many old people will be deprived of television entertainment after the discontinuation of the 405 line.  That will be a pity.</P>
    <P>I think some provision can be made for those people.  I accept that RTE are short enough of finances without <Col N="599" /> making the necessary deductions here but I would remind the Minister that he told the House in reply to a parliamentary question that he would consult with the Department of Social Welfare.  I am not sure how that Department will be able to help in the matter.  I should like some indication from the Minister of what will happen the old television sets being used by the most needy section of the community.</P>
    <P>Many parts of the country will be seriously affected.  I understand that in west Mayo some 4,500 sets will be affected.  One reason is the discontinuation of the 405 line as well as the withdrawal of the wavelength on which they operate currently.  The majority of sets in use in some parts of the country will not be operational because of the change in the wavelength that services the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister's comments on how he might compensate the section on whose behalf we are speaking.  We are genuinely concerned that they may be deprived of any television entertainment in the evening of their lives.  Charitable organisations will not be able to replace the sets because people will not give away new sets.  Many of the people who were able to purchase television sets realised some time ago that the 405 line sets were being phased out and that was the reason they discarded these old sets and gave them to charitable organisations.  Consequently, the recipients, the needy people, will be affected seriously as a result of the discontinuation of the 405 line.</P>

      <P>When the Minister answered a question on this matter some time last week, I asked if there was any possibility of converting the sets to another line.  It is unfortunate that most of those using the old sets are in the category least able to buy new sets.  Many of them are availing of the free repair services they have been getting through various organisations. It is a very generous service operating in this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> One of the reasons for phasing out the 405 line was that the channel will be required in the future but it seems rather a pity that such a large number of people&mdash;the Minister's reply to the question mentioned 22,000&mdash;may be deprived of television entertainment because they will not be lucky enough to get new sets.  I agree it is not easy to see how the amendment could be operated but Deputy Fitzpatrick's motive in putting it down is a good one and I am sure the Minister shares the feeling behind it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the motive is a good one and I am glad that Deputy Brugha also appreciates that such a provision would be difficult to operate in practice.</P>
      <P>During Committee Stage on this section I informed Deputies that I could not agree to compensate those affected by the proposed cessation of 405 line television sets&mdash;Official Report, Volume 290, columns 1286-7 refer.  I reiterated this in my reply to a parliamentary question on 25th November, 1976&mdash;Official Report, Volume 214, columns 800-802 refer.</P>
      <P>All of the sets in question must be more than 12 years old and most, if not all, are probably due for replacement. I recognise, as Deputies opposite have stressed, that some of the disadvantaged members of the community may have these sets still and that there may be hardship involved for them in changing the sets.  I am drawing the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that charitable organisations have provided people with television sets and it has been argued here that when the 405 line sets go out of commission it will not be possible to replace them.  However, I do not altogether accept that in that the 405 line change is not the only reason people give up a certain type of set. Television sets considerably junior to the 405 line sets would be obsolete from the point of view of some television users.  For example, we know that an increasing number of people are getting rid of their black and white sets and going over to colour sets so that a certain number of the former, <Col N="601" /> which are not 405 sets, should be available.</P>
    <P>Owners of 405 line sets will not be the only people who will be inconvenienced as a result of changes necessary in connection with the introduction of the second television service.  In some other areas people will need new aerials to receive the existing service and in other areas viewers will have to adjust their aerials and/or acquire VHF sets to receive the second service when that comes into operation. The principle of compensation in such cases could not be accepted and the question of deducting such compensation from licence fees paid to RTE would not, therefore, arise.</P>
    <P>On other points made, the advice is that it is not practicable to adjust these old 405 line sets to operate on 625 lines.  Apparently the cost of repairs would be more than the present value of the set.  On the point about the means test, even if a means test were introduced there would be claims for compensation for sets no longer in working order.  Accordingly, I am sorry I cannot accept this amendment.  As I have said, I will draw the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare to the problem to which Deputies opposite have adverted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central</i>): This Bill has taken about 18 months to go through this House. Naturally, any Bill that may improve broadcasting is desirable and there are sections which will certainly be helpful to the Authority and to broadcasting in general.  When first circulated there was a section with regard to broadcasting the BBC in its entirety which has since been deleted.  That deletion <Col N="602" /> will contribute to broadcasting generally.</P>
      <P>Broadcasting plays a vital role in moulding attitudes and I would like to see our national broadcasting station made available to all parts of the country.  The majority of the people in the North should be in a position to receive RTE and there should be an exchange of programmes between both parts of the island.  Let us hope this development will come about.  It is one which could contribute towards peace and harmony.  I would like to see dialogue between North and South.  We must change hardened attitudes and the best way that can be done is by showing how we live. Again, we should see the way of life of people in the North.  Only by frank discussion will a community evolve that can live in harmony.  I believe RTE can play a vital role in this.</P>
      <P>Television here is comparatively young.  It has contributed substantially to enjoyment.  It is important to ensure that our way of life is properly projected.  I am not asking for an insular orientated programme all day long but we must ensure that our identity and cultural values are protected within the EEC.  Member states will ensure that their identities and cultures are projected.  We must do likewise.  In the European context the challenge will be all the greater. People will demand more.  They will want to know more about the Community and how it is developing.  It is important that our Authority should do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be interested to hear the Minister say when exactly he intends to have the second channel operational and for how many hours it will operate.  If it is confined to just one or two hours a day, the audience will be lost.  In selling any product it is the initial impact that is important.  That is how one gets one's customers.  If there is not a proper impact, getting customers becomes much more difficult. Everything must be done to ensure that RTE will attract as wide an audience as possible.  Even though people may buy newspapers produced elsewhere, they always buy the native product as well because there is more <Col N="603" /> localised news in the native product. The same applies to broadcasting on the second channel.</P>
    <P>Criticisms have been voiced by all shades of opinion in the past.  On the second channel there must be complete impartiality and, if there is, those responsible will have nothing to fear.  The development of programmes in the coming year will be a test of impartiality.  We are facing an election year.  Broadcasting will play a bigger role than ever before in the forthcoming election and we shall certainly be anxious to see the way in which these political programmes are formulated.  The Authority can prove themselves by showing their impartiality as regards these programmes over the next six months or whenever the election is called.  I hope they will show their independence irrespective of who is Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and regardless of Deputies from this or the other side of this House who would try to influence them in any way.</P>
    <P>During electioneering, Ministers, not the present Minister, have changed their minds about certain commitments on policies which they have promised to carry through.  I would be anxious to ensure that promises made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs are not made for electioneering purposes, that if he announces that the second channel will be established in its entirety, that the commitment will be carried out in full not just providing one or two hours' viewing.</P>
    <P>Disappointment has been expressed in Cork as regards television viewing. Provision was made in Cork for the recording of programmes and it is unfortunate that when a survey had been carried out and 90 per cent of the people indicated acceptance they were informed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs that because of copyright difficulties they could not go ahead with these programmes.  The Minister should have seen to it that everything was in order before the survey and wiring were carried out.  It was hoped to have the service operating by 20th December.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> The Minister has made commitments to various cities throughout the country such as Waterford, Galway and Cork that multi-channel viewing will be available to them.  The Minister should be explicit in stating what problems will be encountered and how soon he will be in a position to provide this service.  It is important that people know where they stand before capital expenditure is embarked on with these organisations that are seeking it at the moment. Full information should be available as regards cost, problems of copyright and so on, so that people will not be placed in the same position in which the Cork viewers have been placed. Making a vague commitment that he would not stand in their way is not good enough.</P>
    <P>There are certain elements in this Bill which will be a factor in the expansion of RTE.  I hope it expands as it should in the years ahead and plays its role the same as any major broadcasting company in the world.  I would like to convey my congratulations to the staff of RTE and particularly to the director general for the manner in which he has performed the functions of his office.  The handling of broadcasting in any country is a delicate matter in relation to keeping a fair balance within the various sections of the community.  I believe he has done an excellent job.  There are many groups and organisations, each of which would like to see their point of view being put forward.  They are quite justified in seeking that, but the Authority must try to find a common denominator, try to please the majority of the community, which is a very difficult job.</P>
    <P>We in this House can contribute constructively to these matters by putting forward our views.  There is nothing wrong with being critical provided you are fair.  As I have said, I will be looking forward to seeing what form the political programmes will take and how they will be constituted. Have they been drawn up already?  Who will supervise them?  I shall be interested to know what developments have taken place along these lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first amending Bill since the original Broadcasting Act of 1960.  In particular section 17 is replaced by section 13 of this Bill and new wording is introduced in relation to the culture of the people of the whole island and in relation to questions such as the encouragement of the Irish language. I do not quarrel very much with the change of words because I believe it is not so much words that can help situations as goodwill that one finds on both sides of the House here.  Our national broadcasting service should, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, reflect life on this island, and it should do so partly because we are what we are but also partly because it is necessary to counteract the very strong influence coming from across the water and the United States.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Irish language it has become obvious over the last six months that there is a favourable public reaction to popular programmes that are bilingual or entirely in Irish. A change has taken place in this area and we should have regard to it.  It is important that at a time like this when there is goodwill towards the language in evidence that the Authority should have a special regard for what they may be able to do by way of an expansion of the type of programmes that have become so popular.  I can think of no better way of bringing the language into more general use than by an intelligent use of radio and television popular programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned Northern Ireland.  In spite of the fact that our signal is only received in a small part of that area it is important that our programmes should be mindful of the need for understanding and peace on this island.  Programmes should reflect the need for reconciliation amongst all the people of Ireland. This is a crucial time in the history of the people of this island and it is important that our station should be careful and restrained in dealing with Northern issues.  What needs to be emphasised more and more in the use of broadcasting are the common interests we all share on this island because it is those interests I expect <Col N="606" /> will bring us together eventually.  I should like to compliment the RTE Authority, and the staff, on the contribution they are making to our community in general.  In spite of all the controversies that may have occurred over the past 16 years I believe radio and television are making a considerable contribution as is only right with a national broadcasting system.</P>

      <P>We have devoted, as it is right that we should, a very considerable amount of time to this Bill.  There has been a long discussion interrupted, as Deputy Fitzpatrick made the point&mdash;I share his regret about it&mdash;for sizeable periods by the demands of other business. The provisions of the Bill were exhaustively debated in the Seanad and in this House and I propose, in concluding, to be brief and confine my remarks strictly to the major measures contained in the Bill.  Deputies opposite have used their discretion, as is their right, to open up the whole area of broadcasting more widely. Some of the matters they have raised are matters on which I shall be making statements at an appropriate time.  In concluding on this Bill it is better that I stick strictly to it.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said it was important that the Authority should have independence, irrespective of who is Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I used the word &ldquo;impartiality&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a note of the word &ldquo;independence&rdquo; but we will not quibble.  I am sure we all wish that the Authority should have independence and impartiality, irrespective of who is Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. I should like to point out that when this Bill becomes law, and we are now in sight of that, the Authority will have a greater degree of independence and autonomy than they ever had before.  That is the most important aspect of this Bill and it is the enshrinement of that principle for which historians of broadcasting will think it memorable.  Up to now we have had a situation where a Minister <Col N="607" /> could dismiss&mdash;that is still the case&mdash; an entire Authority without any need to justify or any need for the Oireachtas to consider the matter. From the time this Bill becomes law that will cease to be the case.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas will have to agree to such a removal or, indeed, to the removal of individual members of the Authority.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies have criticised that as cumbersome or an abandonment, or abdication of ministerial power and responsibility.  That is a matter of judgement.  I do not see it in that light and the Government do not see it in that light.  We think that the degree of autonomy which is established by this is of considerable importance for confidence in the future of public service broadcasting here.  However, we will be content to abide by the verdict of the public and of the future in relation to that.  It is also a fact which tends to buttress the independence of the Authority that the old power under which the Minister could prohibit the broadcasting of any matter or matter of any category no longer stands and directions can now be issued only in a particular statutorily defined category of cases, broadly in the area of incitement to crime and matter tending to undermine the authority of the State.  That is important.  For the first time the line is clearly drawn in what areas may the State intervene in broadcasting. The State may intervene there but the Minister has not got the power, as he has now, to prohibit the broadcasting of anything he does not happen to like.  Theoretically, it would be possible under existing law for a Minister to prohibit broadcasts by Members of the Oireachtas.  That power is there.  It is not conceivable that any Minister would use that power in that way but I do not think it desirable that the powers should be so broadly drafted, that it is technically possible and that, perhaps, certain dangers exist which might lead to abuses in critical times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important that henceforward any directions issued will have to be laid before the Houses of the <Col N="608" /> Oireachtas.  For example, the direction recently issued by me in relation to Provisional Sinn Féin, and so on, will lapse when this Bill is passed and if I wish a direction of that kind to be in force, as is probable henceforward, I would have to lay that before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Those provisions are central.  Curiously enough, it was suggested to me by a journalist from outside the country today that the measures being taken are restrictive of broadcasting freedom here. Anybody who examines the Bill and compares it with the existing law will see that the reverse is the case.  This directly strengthens the autonomy of the Authority and thereby it increases broadcasting freedom.  It does not increase it to infinity.  Definite statutory limits are imposed in this area of incitement to crime and undermining the authority of the State.  It is our deliberate intention that those limitations should remain, should be enforced, should be open and should be under the authority of the Oireachtas.  Those are the main provisions of the Bill.  We believe that it will lead to a definite improvement in confidence in the broadcasting Authority and in the independence of the Authority.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to thank those Deputies who have contributed to this debate and, in particular, Deputy Fitzpatrick who has come in at every stage of it and also Deputy Brugha, Deputy Briscoe and some others.  I should like to say that it has not been often possible for me to accept their amendments although in some cases&mdash;one case at least&mdash;I have introduced a significant amendment based on their intervention.  I already accepted in the Seanad a number of amendments from their party but irrespective of the acceptance or non-acceptance of amendments, I believe that a number of important points were made by them in the debate of which the Authority will take note.  The record of this debate&mdash; not merely the Bill but the record&mdash; will be a help and not a hindrance to broadcasting.  I accept that their concern in this matter is quite as genuine as ours on this side of the House.  I <Col N="609" /> think one of the best aspects of the Bill has been the message of concern now prevailing in the Oireachtas for the strengthening both of public service broadcasting and of its autonomy under statutorily defined and understood and debatable limitations applicable in one particular area only.</P>

      <P>I agreed in the course of the debate on Committee Stage to accept, in principle, amendments which Deputy Faulkner proposed to these sections. Section 12, subsection 6 and section 13, subsection 5 require the registrar to notify a society of his decision to refuse to register a copy of an alteration of rules or of a resolution in connection with it or of a change of name and to give the reasons for his refusal.</P>
      <P>Section 27, subsection 5, requires the registrar to notify an applicant of his refusal to confirm a union, transfer or undertaking to fulfill engagements and to give reasons for the refusal.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 34, to delete &ldquo;to vote or&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>In the course of the debate on Committee Stage I agreed to reconsider the age limit provisions in section 17 (5) and section 53 (2) of the Bill.  As it stands, the Bill provides that a person under 21 years may be admitted as a member, but while he is under that age he shall not be entitled to vote or to hold office.  Deputy Faulkner had proposed on Committee Stage that the reference to 21 years in the case of each of the two sections be altered to 18 years.  I have looked at the implications of this and I find that a person under 21 is still, technically, an infant and, consequently, cannot enter into a binding contract or, what is more important to those entering into the contract with him, can repudiate any contract he enters into if it suits him.  The holding of office could involve the office holder in entering into a contract and I cannot, therefore, proceed with an amendment on the lines which Deputy Faulkner had in mind.</P>
      <P>What I am proposing is to reduce the age for entitlement to vote from 21 to 18 years by deleting the prohibition on entitlement to vote in section 17 and amending section 53 (2) to provide that a person under 18 shall not be entitled to vote at a meeting.</P>
      <P>The amendments I feel, will meet, as far as it is possible, what Deputy Faulkner proposed.</P>

      <P>Again, I accept what the Minister has said and we appreciate the fact that he has agreed to the amendment.  While he states <Col N="611" /> that from a legal point of view it is not possible to do anything about the holding of office, it is rather a pity that we cannot also give a person of 18 years of age the right to hold office because there will be many electors and they will not elect a person unless they think he is suitable for the position.  Personally, I am a great believer in giving youth responsibility as I showed when I was Minister for Education by appointing students to governing bodies of universities.  However, if the Minister states that from a legal point of view it cannot be done, we have to accept that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 14, line 55, after &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, within six months of receiving the application for such permission,&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>During the Committee Stage debate I agreed to consider the principle of an amendment put down by Deputy Faulkner to section 19 (7).  He proposed that a time limit of two months be applied where the registrar was refusing an application for permission to advertise.  I pointed out that while I agreed with the principle, I thought two months was too short a time.</P>
      <P>What is involved here is that where a society, to which section 19 applies, makes application to the registrar for permission to advertise, the registrar, under subsection (5) must be satisfied on a number of matters before he can give permission.  These matters are set out at paragraphs (a) to (f) of the subsection. He must consider how the society has carried on its business, whether it had complied with requirements as to founder shares and Central Bank deposit, the state of its liquidity and reserves, whether it is solvent, and whether any loans to directors are outstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that a two-month time limit could be unduly restrictive on the registrar in circumstances where, for instance, following examination of an application, he found it inadequately documented and had to seek additional <Col N="612" /> information from the applicant. The assembly and forwarding of this information by the applicant could take some time.  A time limit that was too short might force the registrar to refuse, through lack of information, an application which he would otherwise approve.  I am, therefore, suggesting six months, which I feel sure will meet the principle of Deputy Faulkner's proposal which is to ensure that the applicant gets a decision within a specified and reasonable time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 27, to delete lines 40 to 42 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;37.&mdash;(1) The Registrar may with the consent of the Minister for Finance require a society to maintain&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister on Committee Stage and having studied his reply on section 37, I decided to submit once again an amendment to this section, firstly, to underline our objection to the very considerable State involvement in certain aspects of building society business and, secondly, because I cannot say I was convinced by the Minister's arguments.</P>
      <P>Might I add in passing that the Minister on a number of occasions pointed to the fact that certain matters were already discussed in the Seanad?  I do not regard this as being relevant because matters can be discussed in both this House and the Seanad and can be changed in either House or both.  If the Opposition feel strongly on a particular point, it is only natural that they should make their feelings felt on every occasion possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I pointed out that the Government were proposing a number of masters for the building societies, that I believed this would lead to too much bureaucratic control and would ultimately reduce the capacity of societies to attract funds which are needed now more than ever before.  I pointed out also that the <Col N="614" /> building societies were very uneasy about the fact that there would in future be four masters in control.  I have had no reason to change my mind on this matter, even though the Minister stated on a number of occasions during Committee Stage that the societies were quite content with the position as set out in the Bill.  If the Minister believes the societies are happy with the situation, then he has been misinformed, or else what the societies said to him was different to what they told me.</P>
    <P>I have changed this amendment quite considerably from the amendment put down on Committee Stage. In the Committee Stage amendment I proposed that the registrar would deal with ratios after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  In this new amendment I am proposing that the registrar should deal with ratios with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  This is an effort on my part to try to close the gap between the Minister's approach and our approach to this matter.  The registrar will continue under this amendment to be the initiator.  Whatever he decided on, he would have to convince the Minister for Finance that he was taking the proper decision before a change could be made, rather than the position which would have pertained in relation to my Committee Stage amendment where the function of the Minister would be, in a sense, purely advisory.</P>
    <P>However, the important aspect of the matter so far as we are concerned would be that the registrar, who would have a deep and intimate knowledge of the building societies structure, should be the one to make the decisions which he would make on the assessment of the needs of the societies, of their members, of their borrowers and so on, and no outside influence would affect his judgment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, taking the broader view of the economy as a whole, would be in a position to refuse permission to proceed in a certain fashion if he felt it was not in the national interest.  On the other hand, the Minister for Finance would be unable to force decisions which he might <Col N="615" /> feel necessary because of short-term considerations which have nothing whatever to do with the good of the building societies, the building industry or the objectives of the building societies but which related more, perhaps, to his own needs for finance at the time.</P>
    <P>The adoption of this amendment will assure investors that their investments will not be devalued because of such short-term considerations and will ensure a continuous and regular flow of money into the societies.  I have already stated when speaking on Committee Stage that the growth of building societies over the years has been phenomenal.  This is first of all a tribute to management and workers alike, but it is also a tribute to the trust with which the general public view the societies.  This trust has grown with the years, during a time when the societies were left to a very large extent to their own devices.</P>
    <P>The only legislation governing their growth was passed 100 years ago. They were then very tiny financial institutions. We now agree that this legislation is very out of date when we are no longer dealing with tiny financial institutions but with very large financial institutions.  Despite the inadequacy of the older legislation and the many loopholes that exist, the building societies continued to grow and develop.  Apart from some very relatively minor failures, the whole movement can claim to have been an outstanding success.  Again, let me emphasise that I am referring here to the general growth of the industry and not to such things as rules, regulations, interest rates and so on, which have been, and can be, bones of contention.</P>
    <P>I feel that in this respect the societies could with advantage create a much better understanding between themselves and those borrowing from them if they spent even a fraction of the time and money used for the purpose of attracting funds to ensuring a better understanding of their methods and procedures, the reasons they take particular action and in attempts to overcome some relatively <Col N="616" /> minor problems, which can very often escalate into very serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate that the case I am making is that the societies have proved themselves without the State interference proposed in this Bill.  It is always wise to leave well enough alone.  Many new and commendable features have been introduced in this Bill which will benefit the societies and the nation as a whole, but in our view this very considerable State interference is too much and will have detrimental effects.</P>
    <P>As I already pointed out, Ministerial control is not appropriate to building societies.  The objective of a Minister may not coincide with the needs and desires of members, both investing and borrowing.  When two Ministers are involved, you can have a conflict of interests.  I believe a single agency of control, such as the registrar, is the ideal where discipline could be exerted on the societies not only in their day-to-day management but also in the medium- and long-term policies.</P>
    <P>In that context this amendment would ensure that the Minister would take the good of the community into consideration by exercising his powers outside of direct political influence and would be seen by the public to be doing so.  In this way investing or borrowing members of societies would not regard the societies as an arm of the State and this would ensure that the inflow of funds would not suffer.</P>
    <P>The strongest reason why the registrar should be the sole administrator in control is that elsewhere in the Bill he is given very extensive powers of supervision.  Part III comprises eight sections giving the registrar wide powers of management and requiring him to be constantly informed of the day-to-day operations of societies.  He will need to establish a close system of monitoring the activities of societies so that he can act quickly to prevent any of them from getting into difficulties or to overcome outside events.  Such a person, with a qualified staff, is the obvious person to establish management arrangements appropriate to the circumstances of the day in regard to all or particular societies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> Section 62 provides that the income and expenditure account and balance sheet of a society shall contain such particulars as the registrar may direct, and section 70 provides that every society shall submit an annual return to the registrar and such other information and returns within such period as the registrar may from time to time direct.  These powers are already being given to the registrar, all directly linked to the control of societies and to their management ratios under section 37.</P>
    <P>During Committee Stage discussions on the Bill the Minister said the powers vested in the registrar are much greater than those of the British registrar.  My study of the 1962 British Act in no way leads me to accept the Minister's opinion.  There, the registrar is the sole adviser of the building societies where the movement is several hundred times bigger than ours in money terms and in the number of societies.  No other person or agency has control under the 1962 Act and the Treasury acts only in specific circumstances.  Many thousands of millions of pounds have been invested and lent by those societies without a penny being lost.  The registrar's powers there have been exercised in such a way that he has rarely had to use the full rigours of the law.  The 1962 Act and the powers given to the registrar have been found to be fully effective during the 1960s and the 1970s, when the societies were growing at a rapid rate.</P>
    <P>We should concentrate on our objectives here, which are to help the people to build homes or to purchase them, to ensure a steady inflow of funds to the building societies.  We accept the right of the State to be involved but we must be careful that the trust which the people have in the building societies because they believe them to be free from any outside interference will not be lost.  If it were, the result would be that the inflow of funds might dry up. We want to ensure this will not happen. We know that during the years, when there was less control of them, the building societies succeeded in growing at a very rapid rate and in securing the trust of their investors and of those to whom they lent money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> What worries me is that by what appears to me to be inordinate powers being granted to the Minister, this trust might be lessened.  I would add that my reference to &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; is not a reference to any particular Minister. One does not know what may happen in the future.</P>
    <P>In the past, from the point of view of attracting funds, the building societies were very successful.  We want to make them even more successful because that is the way in which money will become available for those anxious to build their own houses.  I have tabled this amendment for the reasons I have given, because I believe if the amendment were accepted it would strengthen the Bill and ensure that in the future an even better inflow of money would be available to the societies.  We are all anxious for that and I ask the Minister to reconsider his attitude in regard to this aspect of the Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I support Deputy Faulkner. If the Minister for Local Government had been here five minutes earlier, he would have heard the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs expounding the great virtues of the Broadcasting Authority Bill because it conferred more independence.  That makes sound sense of this amendment.  Unfortunately, the Minister now present does not hold the same views as his colleague.  The Minister for Local Government feels that the restrictions must be enforced by the two Departments, that they must have a say in the running of the building societies. This attitude does not contribute satisfactorily to the future expansion of building societies.  We must show them that we have trust in them.  The more trust placed in the people who run them the more they will respond to that, and eventually that type of organisation expands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner has welcomed the Bill in its broad aspect.  What he criticises is too much involvement of Government bodies.  He believes that that will slow down the day-to-day operation of the building societies. The challenges which will be facing building societies in the future will be <Col N="619" /> greater than those faced in the past. Regarding the difficulty of attracting money, we know that when building societies started in this country there were very few of the financial institutions which are available today in which people invest money.  Confidence is of vital importance: confidence in the society, confidence in the institutions in which people place their finances.  If the public feel that their investments are being scrutinised in any way&mdash;and I would be the last person in the House to damage the reputation of any building society&mdash; that would be disastrous.  For that reason I would like the authority of building societies removed as far as possible from Government interference. We know that the Bill will envisage a certain amount of Government involvement but there should be as little as possible.</P>
    <P>Investors today are among the most sophisticated people in the world. They know every trick in the trade. They change their money from one country to another.  We know how they operate.  We have seen the British operation recently as regards devaluation and such factors and how money leaves one country when more return can be got from it in another country.  These people study the composition of the institutions where their finances are held.  They have time to do it; it is their way of life.  I know that we are not dealing with that type of person here, we are dealing with small investors, but in future it may be necessary to encourage funds from all sectors of our society. I wonder if the Minister has seen newspaper reports in the past three or four days that there is a downturn in the money coming into building societies.</P>

They are contributing substantially to the building of houses. There are thousands of people who could not possibly have the luxury of their homes today if it had not been for the contribution made by the building societies.  For that reason it is for everyone in this House to ensure that anything we say or do will not damage the building societies.

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It is a basic fact that in running anything the fewer people implicated in it the more efficiently it will work.  A registrar, who will naturally be the person running the affairs of a society, will know the day-to-day operation and at times may have to make quick decisions.  He is operating within a financial world where a letter to the Department of Finance or of Local Government will, perhaps, have to wait a fortnight for a reply or to get a decision.  That would not be very beneficial to a building society.  They would be broke in a short time if that did happen.</P>
      <P>It is all very fine to say that we are giving them a certain authority through the registrar.  He will see that before making an important decision both of these Departments would have to be consulted.  When you place a registrar, or anybody, in this situation and he has to go to other Departments or sections to get decisions you will find eventually that he will not give of his whole potential because he is afraid that if he makes a decision the two Departments may not stand over it and this will impede his full operation in the role which he will occupy. It is of vital importance to the whole structure of building societies that the more authority and autonomy we give to the registrar the more he will give of himself to ensure that the position which he occupies will be upheld and strengthened.  I would like to see as much authority as possible being given to the registrar with proper terms of reference in this Bill.  Here again we see the Minister for Local Government keeping control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Banks and various institutions carry an enormous amount of public funds. They do not have to apply directly to the Department of Finance as regards the ratio which they must lodge with the Central Bank.  The Central Bank have the authority to decide these things.  In conjunction with the associated banks they do their job very effectively.  The Central Bank are subject to the Department of Finance but they have their own authority. That type of tight arrangement is better than a cumbersome arrangement <Col N="622" /> where a registrar may have to wait for weeks to get a decision from the Department of Local Government or the Department of Finance.  That will not contribute anything to the expansion of building societies.  I do not know why the two Departments had to get involved.  The amendments Deputy Faulkner has down will go a long way towards relieving this situation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look again at Deputy Faulkner's amendments.  The people who know how an organisation or society can run are the people who have been working in it.  They know what will be to their advantage and disadvantage.  The Minister might say that they have not objected to various sections of this Bill.  If he inquires again he will get a different view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would ask them if they would like to be directly under the Central Bank.  I know the answer he would get.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I did not say they wanted to be under the Central Bank.  I said how well the operation of the Central Bank towards the associated banks works.  I did not say that building societies should be under the Central Bank.  Many of those in charge of building societies have worked very hard in building up the societies and know what finance and money is about.  They know how to attract money into building societies.  Those are the people the Minister should consult because they will make the societies work.  The Minister should look again at Deputy Faulkner's amendments and he will find if they are accepted they will be a contributory factor to the expansion of this great industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The series of amendments, Nos. 7 to 10, are due to the fact that Deputy Faulkner, and Deputy Fitzpatrick to a lesser extent, are under the impression that in some peculiar way the Minister for Finance will have the right to say what funds, specifically surplus money, may be invested.  I want to make it clear for the 15th time that the Minister for Finance will simply lay down the investments in <Col N="623" /> which surplus funds can be put by the registrar who will decide what, if any, funds will be put in there.  He will draw up a list, I assume once, and he will add to it or subtract from the list but not the money.  The money will be dealt with by the registrar.  It is wrong that anybody should give the impression that it is otherwise.  Once we get that clear we know where we stand.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the prescribing of ratios by the Minister for Finance, this is aimed at ensuring that societies will be safe repositories of investors' funds.  The existence of these ratios and compliance with them should lead to an increase in the confidence of the public, the direct opposite to what Deputy Fitzpatrick has been saying.  If there has been an outflow it has been tremendously high over the year and because of the bank strike it was abnormally high during a period and it dropped down again.  It could be that there is a reduction.  A temporary recession is not unusual from time to time, particularly at this time of the year.  I would hate to think that anybody in the House would say something which would suggest that there is a danger to the investors in building societies because nothing could be further from the truth.  We must be very careful that we do not slant things.  It might be politically advantageous to say it but it would be disastrous for the nation and for the people who invest in building societies if this happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding ratios in the United Kingdom is that the Building Societies Bill, 1962, does not itself require the maintenance of ratios.  Any society which wishes to enjoy trustee status must conform to requirements laid down in regulations by the Treasury under section (1) of the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959.  These requirements include the maintenance of specified ratios related to liquidity and reserves.  The prescribed requirements must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of the chief registrar. It will be seen that in the United Kingdom it is not the chief registrar but the Treasury which lays down the ratios, nor is it the chief registrar <Col N="624" /> acting with the consent of the Treasury.</P>
    <P>The matter was debated at considerable length on Committee Stage yet I feel it is necessary to go into some detail once more and to clarify the position so that there can be no misunderstanding of what is involved. First of all, let us look at the position under existing legislation.  At present there is no control over the relationship which must exist between assets and liabilities, except that provided for in the Building Societies Act, 1942, under which a society may not accept on deposit an amount exceeding threequarters of the amount secured on mortgage.  We did not re-enact this provision as it was considered too rigid and inflexible a control.  That is number one.</P>
    <P>The absence of more comprehensive controls up to now can be explained by the fact that the legislation which we are now up-dating was passed so long ago when the scale of building society operations was so much smaller.  There have been developments in other fields.  The need for controls in the form of ratios was recognised in the Central Bank Act, 1971, which provides that licensed banks must maintain ratios.  It is this type of control that we are talking about in section 37.  I do not think there is any disagreement about the need for and the desirability of the controls proposed.  I do not think there is any dispute between one side of the House and the other.  The issue is as to who is to exercise the control.  The amendments seek to give these powers to the registrar.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely that the registrar should have wide powers and, in fact, he will have.  He will, for instance, in section 19, have complete control, without reference to any other authority, to grant permission to advertise. In section 29 he can appoint inspectors and conduct an investigation into the affairs of a society.  In section 31 he may, entirely on his own initiative, suspend the raising of funds by a society.  In section 32, again acting entirely on his own initiative, he is empowered to require a society to suspend advertising.  In section 34 he <Col N="625" /> is given very wide powers indeed to obtain documents and to enter premises. I am referring only to those powers which occur in the sections leading up to section 37 in the text. There are many others.</P>
    <P>To suggest that the registrar should be given wide powers is one thing, but to follow that principle into giving him full powers in every matter, even where it has been demonstrated that this would be to the disadvantage of the societies, is going too far.  The better control is that proposed in the Bill giving the powers to the Minister for Finance after consultation with the experts in the various fields, including the registrar.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to consider the question of trustee status in this connection. We are all in favour of trustee status being conferred on deposits with building societies.  Although this is a matter for the Minister for Finance I think it would be appropriate if I were to clear the air a little on what this involves.  This is something which I thought had been clarified but it appears as if some people are not clear about it.</P>
    <P>Persons or institutions charged with the responsibility, as trustees, for the funds of others may invest those funds only in securities which it is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance to specify in accordance with the Trustees (Authorised Investments) Acts of 1893 and 1958.  These securities must conform to certain requirements which will satisfy the Minister for Finance that they are sufficiently safe as a medium of investment and the fact that the securities can meet these criteria confers the hallmark of trustee status.  Where this ties in with what I have been saying about the exercise of controls under section 37 is that before a building society can enjoy trustee status it must meet, among other things, requirements laid down by the Minister for Finance under the Trustee Acts as to its liquidity and reserve ratios.  He will, in fact, for the purpose of trustee status, be prescribing ratios for any society which wishes to enjoy trustee status.  For this purpose it could not, for instance, be requirements laid <Col N="626" /> down by anybody else, such as the registrar, acting with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The responsibility of the Minister for Finance in connection with trustee status is one of the principal reasons why the Minister for Finance is the person empowered in section 37.  The fact that he will exercise the control helps to hasten the day on which trustee status can be conferred.  The proposal that the registrar should control ratios would not help in any way towards getting trustee status and would be establishing two separate authorities for deciding ratios.</P>
    <P>Another equally important reason why the section is drafted in the way Deputies find it is that the Minister for Finance, who will consult the Minister for Local Government, the registrar and the Central Bank, is the person with overall financial responsibility and has available to him sources of information and advice on financial matters which no other authority could command but which are necessary in taking decisions on such matters as these ratios.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate that Deputy Faulkner has made a fairly substantial change in the amendments he is now putting forward from that which he proposed on Committee Stage.  He proposed then that the controls exercised under section 37 should be exercised by the registrar, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, while he is now proposing that it will be the registrar, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who will exercise these powers.</P>
    <P>Apart from what I have already said I find the amendment unacceptable because it places the initiative for deciding these very important ratios on the registrar in the first instance.  This would require him, in addition to all his other qualifications, to be skilled and knowledgeable in these highly technical matters without having available to him sufficient means to keep himself fully informed on the overall financial structure which will be an important factor in deciding ratios.</P>
    <P>The section as drafted requires that the Minister for Finance consult the <Col N="627" /> Central Bank, the registrar and the Minister for Local Government.  This in itself is an acknowledgment that the devising of ratios can be a very complex matter in order to provide a proper balance.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the amendment proposes that the registrar would take the initiative and decide the ratios.  Then the Minister for Finance would be asked to consent to the registrar's proposal. As I see it, the Minister for Finance could only consent or refuse to consent and could not initiate action even though his advice and information sources might point to the necessity for action.  Furthermore, the registrar would not be required to consult anybody and could act without advice, or with only limited or only one-sided advice if he so wished. The section as drafted provides a better procedure with the proper controls to ensure that a decision is not taken without proper consultation and gives the additional assurance that the person taking the decision is directly answerable to this House.  Before this went into the Seanad we altered one of the sections because of the fact that, following consultation with the building societies, we found there was a certain automation which they would prefer.  We did not go the whole way with the building societies, because as I explained in the Seanad and in this House, this Bill is not solely for the purpose of protecting and building up building societies.  It must also have protection for the ordinary investor as well as the person who is borrowing money.  That is why the sections are drafted the way they are.

      <P>&ldquo;77.&mdash;(1)  The Minister may in the interest of the orderly and proper regulation of building society business and having regard for the demand for loans for house purchase, on the recommendation of the Registrar, and after consultations with the Building Societies Advisory Council, make regulations in relation to the purposes and amounts of loans by societies&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>What I have said in relation to section 37 applies here.  This section as it stands proposes to give the Minister power to make regulations to regulate the purposes and amounts of loans made by societies, the purpose for which loans can be made and the maximum amount which may be lent to a body corporate.  I am simply proposing to add the Building Societies Advisory Council.  I am mainly concerned with the section because of the fact that there is a number of controlling agents involved, just as there was in section 37.  The commercial management of the societies under the powers given to the Minister under this section would be very difficult.  I pointed out earlier that interference in the society's business of the kind which we envisaged under this section could create problems in relation to secondhand houses.  I will not deal with that again as it is already on record.</P>

      <P>Section 77 is a very different matter, where we are concerned with the conditions for the <Col N="629" /> making of loans and, because of the size of the contribution the societies make, the availability of funds for the housing programme must also be taken into account.  I am already on record at some length during Committee Stage in explaining the reasons why the section has been drafted very deliberately in this way so as to give due weight to the authorities that need to be involved.  I could not agree that these regulations, even if they have to be made, should be formulated without proper consideration of all the factors involved.  The procedure proposed by Deputy Faulkner would not ensure that this would be so.  The section as it stands provides the proper balance and was drafted in this form after very careful consideration.

      <P>This Bill should be seen as a second attempt on our part to protect the Irish fishing industry and to secure its future.  On Wednesday, 8th December, 1976, this House authorised the Government to make an order extending Irish fishery limits to 200 miles.  On that occasion we sought to persuade the Government at the same time as they were making that order to make another order reserving the first 50 miles of the 200 miles exclusively for Irish fishermen.  That seemed to us to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were very much aware that the making of an order extending our fishing limits to 200 miles as and from 1st January, 1977, was a very important step from the point of view of our fishing industry.  It was something that in normal circumstances everyone in this House would welcome.  Fishermen, all those engaged in the fishing industry and members of the general public interested in the subject would give a warm welcome to the decision of the Government to extend our fishing limits to 200 miles.  However, because the Government refused to make the order we asked them to make concurrently <Col N="631" /> with the principal order, this extension of our fishery limits to 200 miles is illusory and is not guaranteed to confer any benefits whatever on Irish fishermen or on the fishing industry. Indeed, it is likely to be detrimental to the Irish fishing industry as things are developing.</P>
    <P>Very briefly, I want to trace for the House the background against which we are putting forward this legislation. The measure speaks for itself.  We are seeking to amend the Maritime Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act, 1964, by taking out of that Act the existing section 3 and inserting another new section 3.  We are seeking to lay down in statutory form what should be the position in the future in regard to our coastal seas and the fish therein.  It is worth while to read section 2 of our Bill which sets out the proposed new section 3.  It states:</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Act of 1964 is hereby amended by the deletion of subsections (1) and (2) and the substitution of the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Fishing in that portion of the exclusive fishery limits of the State which lies inside the line every point of which is at a distance of fifty nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline shall be restricted exclusively to vessels operating from ports in the State.</P>
    <P>(2) With respect to the portion of the exclusive fishery limits of the State which lies outside the line every point of which is at a distance of fifty nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline, the states the fishing vessels of which may fish in that area and the conditions which they must observe while so fishing shall be determined by any regulation hereinafter adopted by the Council of Ministers of the European Economic Community in accordance with the provisions of the treaties governing Ireland's membership of that Community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our intention is perfectly clear and straightforward.  This is our second attempt to secure the future of the <Col N="632" /> Irish fishing industry.  We failed to persuade the Government to make an order concurrently with the principal order.  We are now returning to the fray and we are asking the House to legislate for the position.  We are asking the House to legislate in a simple, straightforward manner.  If this Bill is passed, the situation will be clear. Ireland will have new fishery limits of 200 miles.  The first 50 miles will be reserved exclusively for vessels operating from ports in the State.  The Bill stipulates that with regard to the other 150 miles out to 200 miles that portion of the seas will be governed by Community legislation in accordance with the obligations of our membership of the EEC.  This step is urgently necessary now.  If the House does not pass this legislation a totally disastrous situation will arise with regard to our fisheries as and from 1st January next.</P>
    <P>European fishing in general has been going through a bad time and for some years catches have been decreasing by somewhat in the order of 10 per cent to 12 per cent per annum. Our fishing industry has deteriorated in line with the general deterioration on the European scene.  The increase in fuel prices that occurred at the time of the oil crisis coincided with the drop in the price of fish throughout the world, and in particular white fish.  The United States introduced certain restrictions on Eastern European countries and others which had been supplying the US market.  They were prevented from doing so and they proceeded to unload their catches on the European markets.  Prices for white fish were depressed at the same time that catches decreased.  The catches went down because of the dramatic and catastrophic falling off in the herring catch and in our case the decline was almost entirely due to the decrease in the catch of herring.</P>
    <P>That is what has prevailed in the past five years.  However, there is another important and significant development, namely, that other countries throughout the world, 20 South American countries, the United States, Canada, Norway and Iceland proceeded to introduce 200-mile limits.  From their point of view that <Col N="633" /> was an excellent development, but it meant that fishing fleets which previously had fished in these waters were now to be excluded and were seeking fresh grounds in which to fish. The only worthwhile grounds left for them were the European waters, in which ours were the principal waters, and we now have a situation&mdash;let us face it&mdash;where deep water fleets are tied up at the quay walls in Grimsby and elsewhere waiting until 1st January to start fishing within the new 200-mile limit we declared here last Wednesday.  That is the reality of the situation.  It is very much a question of naked power fishing politics. Fleets in which there has been very heavy investment have been denied waters in which they fished for decades and they are now looking for new grounds and getting ready to start fishing in Irish waters and other European waters from 1st January and this presents us with a very serious and critical situation from the point of view of the future of our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>It is clear to anybody who considers the situation that the only way in which the future of Irish fishing can be secured and guaranteed is by this country declaring that the first 50 miles of these new limits will be reserved exclusively for Irish fishing. There is no other way.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs who is in charge of our negotiations in this area does not seem to understand the position.  He replied at some length here to the debate on his own motion and our motion last Wednesday.  I have read his speech carefully and I find it depressing and disturbing and I have analysed it carefully because it seems to me that he does not really understand the realities of the situation.</P>
    <P>He talked at some length about his great achievement in securing in The Hague talks a promise that Ireland would be allowed to double her catch over the next three years.  We pointed out to him that, as far as the first of these three years is concerned, 1977, he received a major setback in the proposals the Commission have sent him in confidence, but everybody knows what they are.  They certainly <Col N="634" /> do not tie in or relate to the alleged great promise made to him that Ireland would be able to double her catch over the next three years.  What disturbed me most was his stating he had succeeded in getting this promise about doubling our catch without deviating one iota from our demand for a 50 mile limit.  In other words, in his mind he sees this as two separate issues and, from some of the things he said, it is clear he regards the promise of doubling our catch over a three year period as most important.  I quote from the Official Report of 8th December, column 373 of volume 295:</P>
    <P>Let us be clear on this.  What is important for us is not any particular means of securing that objective.  The most important thing of all is to get it recognised that Ireland is in a special position, that this special position requires that we should have a continued and progressive development in fisheries when every other country is to be cut back and to get this as far as possible quantified in a form which is clear-cut and specific and guaranteed, and quantified it has been on the remarkable basis of the doubling of the catch in three years. </P>
    <P>It is quite clear from that that the mind of the Minister for Foreign Affairs is focussed on what he calls his great achievement on getting a promise we can double our catch over a three year period and, in his mind, that is a separate issue altogether from our having a claim and demand to an exclusive limit of 50 miles.  That is a fundamental mistake the Minister is making.  These two things are meaningless when separated.  A promise of doubling our catch over a three year period is nonsense unless it is allied to our procuring a 50 mile band.  What hope is there of our doubling our catch if the nine member states and third countries are going to have freedom of access under some régime to all the waters between 12 miles and 200 miles?  There is no possibility of our doubling our catch.  We can double our catch within the next three years mainly through the exploitation of non-traditional species but I do not <Col N="635" /> think we have any hope, and I believe everybody in the industry who knows the score will agree, of doubling our catch in the next three year period with our present fleet in traditional areas.  But we can double our catch if we add a 50 mile band and if we have the capacity to exploit certain non-traditional species which have not formed part of our catch up to now. That is the only way it can be done. We cannot double or attempt to set about doubling our catch without an exclusive 50 mile band and I believe in his heart of hearts the Parliamentary Secretary, who knows a great deal more about the realities of the situation than does the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will agree with me in that.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister for Foreign Affairs does not really understand the basic issues.  He got very upset when I made certain accusations against him.  In the course of parliamentary give and take I may, unfortunately, have appeared to be impugning his personal honesty and integrity.  I have no wish to do that, but his reaction does not come very well from a member of a Government, some of whose colleagues concentrate on personal character assassination, and why he should get so worked up about a legitimate parliamentary attack by me in this area is something I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>At the end of his speech last Wednesday the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated that he was very hurt that his integrity should be impugned here in the course of parliamentary debate.  That is a rather finicky attitude for any parliamentarian to adopt about the cut and thrust of parliamentary debate and, if he feels that way about things, then he should have a word with some of his colleagues about the things they say from time to time about people on these benches.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, those who supported him and a number of commentators in the media stated rightly that this is a very serious matter, with long term implications for us economically and socially, and that it should be dealt with on the highest <Col N="636" /> level and should not be made a matter of party political scoring.  I agree with that but, if one examines the speech made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in dealing with our motion, one finds that a great deal of it was devoted to simple partisan politics.  He seemed more concerned with proving that as a result of the negotiations accompanying our entry into the Community the Fianna Fáil Government left him in a very difficult position. A great deal of his speech was devoted to that aspect.  I do not think that is true and I hope in the course of this contribution to reject that.  But whether it is true or not, it does not contribute constructively to the present situation. As I say, he seemed far more concerned with scoring that cheap political party debating point than in outlining the present position and what is possible.</P>
    <P>I believe we put forward a reasonably convincing case on the legal arguments in the debate last Wednesday. The Minister for Foreign Affairs did not rebut our legal arguments.  He simply made <i>ex cathedra</i> statements that we were wrong legally.  He did not prove how we were wrong, and I am inviting the Parliamentary Secretary to rebut the legal arguments which I am now going to make.  Last Wednesday the Minister for Foreign Affairs contented himself with saying flatfootedly that we were wrong and that the law was not as we suggested it was, but he did not adduce any arguments in favour of that.  He wanted the House just to accept his statement that such was the position.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs occasionally falls into the error of thinking that if he talks quickly enough and at sufficient length he will persuade everybody of the validity of his case.  That will not do in this instance.  We are putting forward a very specific, factual and legal argument to him and we want it rebutted if it can be rebutted.  We believe our argument is the one which he should be using, and that if, for instance, the French Government had the sort of legal basis we think we have for our claim, they would use it and push it to the ultimate limit.</P>
    <P>The first step in the establishment of <Col N="637" /> an EEC common fisheries policy was taken by the Community by the adoption of Regulation 2141/70.  I have already mentioned, and I want to repeat, that that regulation was rushed in by the original Six in order to put themselves in a strong bargaining position in anticipation of the enlargement of the Community.  That being so, I want to dispense with any suggestion that there is some strong moral case which the original Six can make in regard to fisheries and that we in Ireland are being hostile to the genuine Community spirit in insisting on a 50-mile limit and insisting on protecting the Irish fishing industry in the way we are pressing for.  There is no such moral basis.</P>
    <P>The next development was the enlargement of the Community, with all the discussions that took place in connection with that enlargement, eventually resulting in the Treaty of Accession which was incorporated for technical or protocol reasons into the Act of Accession.  The interesting thing is that in the Act of Accession Articles 100 to 103 modified in a very substantial way Regulation 2141.  That regulation was a very simple statement of the fact that there was to be a common fisheries policy, and all the member states of the community could fish in each others waters.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to note that Articles 100 to 103 applied not just to the three new member states but to all the nine member states.  This is a very significant point which I want the House to take note of.  We had the regulation establishing the common fisheries policy which applied among the Six.  It was amended and modified by these articles of the Treaty of Accession.  In every other case in that Treaty of Accession all the regulations and directives which constituted EEC policy at the time were derogated from or amended in some way in the case of the incoming three members, but there was no instance where they affected the rules obtaining between the original Six except in the case of fisheries.  The authority for that is a man called Puissochet in his work <i>The Enlargement of the European Communities,</i> and I want to quote what he says about fishing rights in page 276:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> 3.  Article 100 provides the possibility of derogation from the principle of non-discrimination established in Regulation No. 2141/70 for a period of 10 years, and not limited to the new Member States, but extending to all the Member States, new or original.  It constitutes the only instance in the Act of Accession of a provision amending an existing Community rule in respect of the original Member States.  As we know, the rule underlying the negotiations and the Act of Accession is based on the complete preservation of the Community patrimony among the six original Member States and the immediate or progressive endorsement of this patrimony by the new Member States.  Fishing rights represent the only instance in which a temporary retrograde change in relation to the status of the law before accession became possible. </P>
    <P>It is important that we realise that in the case of fisheries a very significant change took place.  There is no gainsaying&mdash;and the words Puissochet used confirm this&mdash;that Regulation 2141 was amended and modified by the Treaty of Accession and what now governs Community law in regard to fisheries is Regulation 2141 as amended by the Treaty of Accession.  That is a simple statement of the legal position. My argument is strengthened by the fact that the fisheries Articles 100 to 103 apply to all the nine member states, not just to the incoming three. Therefore, because it applied to all the nine member states, the six original members as well as the incoming three, it clearly was amending Regulation 2141.  I go on from there to quote from Article 100 of the Treaty of Accession, paragraph 3 of which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>If a member state extends its fishing limits in certain areas to 12 nautical miles, the existing fishing activities within 12 nautical miles must be so pursued that there is no retrograde change by comparison with the situation on 31st January, 1971. </P>
    <P>I want to draw particular attention to the words: &ldquo;If a member state <Col N="639" /> extends its fishing limits in certain areas to 12 nautical miles...&rdquo;. Clearly, the Treaty of Accession, amending Article 2141, contemplated only 12 nautical miles and nothing else.  The wording there makes it clear that there was no question in anybody's mind that anything else was involved except a regime covering 12 nautical miles.  I am told by my lawyer friends that in all matters of contract and in all matters of international law there must be consensus <i>ad idem</i> or else the treaty or the contract is set aside.  I suggest that there was a consensus <i>ad idem</i> governing 12 nautical miles and that was all that was in anybody's mind.  The intention of the parties was to legislate in the Treaty of Accession for 12 nautical miles and no more.</P>
    <P>How could one have consensus <i>ad idem</i> about something which did not exist at that time?  In 1970 or 1971 there was no 200-mile limit.  There was nothing known to anybody in the Community except six and 12 miles. Therefore, there could not be a consensus <i>ad idem</i> on anything outside 12 miles and I submit that it is incontrovertible that the wording of Article 100 makes it crystal clear that the Treaty of Accession, amending regulation 2141, only applied to six and 12 nautical miles.  When this new matter of 200 miles comes in, there is no Community law governing the waters from 12 to 200 miles.  It is a new situation which must be legislated for afresh.  That is my argument and in putting it forward I am aware that I have the full support of the British Government and the British House of Parliament for it.  The British dealt with the situation by doing exactly what we are asking the House to do, by legislating for it.  They brought in a Bill, the Fishery Limits Bill, on 25th November, 1976.  The first section of that extends the fishery limits to 200 miles while section 2 (1) states:</P>
    <P>The Ministers may be order designate any country outside the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man and, in relation to it, areas within British fishery limits in which, and descriptions of sea fish for which, fishing <Col N="640" /> boats registered in that country may fish. </P>
    <P>In other words, that section confers on British Ministers the right to legislate for the 200-mile limit by order. Clearly, the British Government's position is that there is no Community legislation governing this new situation and they will legislate for it by British order.</P>
    <P>That was borne out by a statement made by Mr. Silkin in reply to an oral question on Common Fisheries Policy in the House of Commons on 9th December, 1976.  I should like to quote from Hansard, volume 922, column 608 of that date:</P>
    <P>Mr. Wall: I recognise the right hon.  Gentleman's difficulties, but is he aware that the industry is becoming increasingly concerned at the lack of progress?  Will he confirm that in legislation now passing through the House he has the power to impose an exclusive 50-mile British fisheries limit?  Does he propose to use those powers? </P>
    <P>Mr. Silkin, who was replying on behalf of the Government, said:</P>
    <P>I say that it is vital to have the necessary powers.  As for the 50-mile limit as an exclusive zone, the powers lie within the Bill. </P>
    <P>Clearly, the British Government take the view, which is our view, that the situation is not covered by the existing Community legislation; that it can be legislated for and must be legislated for by the British Government. They have the power under their legislation to create an exclusive 50-mile limit and that is what we are asking the House to do for the benefit of Irish fishermen.</P>

I maintain that we have the same power, that Community law and legislation do not prevent us from doing so.  We have a valid sustainable legal case to do what we are asking to be done in this Bill.  That is the only way that the future of the Irish fishing industry can be secured.  Anything else is confusing the issue.  Deputy Esmonde was very cross with me because I accused Deputy Garret FitzGerald of misleading the public on this issue.  I maintain whether intentionally or unintentionally that he is misleading the public.  It is misleading <Col N="642" /> the public to suggest that we have some security or some guarantee in a promise which he got in Brussels to double our catch because we cannot double our catch unless we have an exclusive 50-mile limit.  I submit that there is nothing in existing Community law or legislation to prevent us legislating here as we are suggesting, to declare a 50-mile limit exclusive to Irish fishermen and hand over, if that is wished, from 50 miles to 200 miles to the Community to lay down the régime.  That is the only way we can be protected and there is nothing in existing law to prevent that. Regulation 2141, amended by the Treaty of Accession, can only be changed by amending the Treaty of Accession, by renegotiating it.  That Treaty governs the transitional period and we are in the middle of it now. This Bill does not conflict with any statutory legal obligation of ours within the Community and there is no reason why the House should not adopt it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say something about the background and the politics of the debate in which the House is now engaged.  Essentially, the demand which the Opposition is advancing and with the object of which the Government agreed and is strongly working for, originated in a calculation soberly made by the Irish fishing industry in regard to its future.  It is a demand which has been taken up by the Opposition and is being stridently pressed by them.  In the noise generated by the making and the reiteration of this demand there are a few background features being lost sight of and there are some elements in the making of the demand which I think our people, whatever industry they are interested in or work in, should look at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the Government is being called on very stridently and exigently to extract us from obligations into which our predecessors entered.  I will concede&mdash;it is a point that is a principal part of our attitude on this question&mdash;that there has been a major extension of jurisdictional responsibilities, <Col N="643" /> a major change in international law and possibilities of the kind which the developments of a few years have brought, such as virtual unanimity in the international community that there is such a thing as a 200-mile limit that will be generally agreed on.  I accept that introduces a new element in the situation.  It is very arguable, and it is a point which we are arguing, that against the background of this quite unforeseen circumstance the common fisheries policy to which we assented in 1972 should be renegotiated, and renegotiated having regard to the very strong social factors which apply with particular force in our case in regard to the economy of our west coast.  That is a point which the Minister has been unwearying in making and it is a measure of the success with which he has been making that case and of his diligence in making it that the Opposition have to run so fast to keep up with us that we are debating this subject here twice within a week.</P>
    <P>Understandably and naturally, we are being battered by the Opposition to extract what we hope to extract, a concession which, in fact, under the law, rightly or wrongly as it stands, we are not entitled to.  I shall not make any cheap political points&mdash; cheap ones are ones made against you; substantial ones are ones you make&mdash;but it is only fair to say that it is not the case that the 200-mile limit which is now more or less universally part of the international law landscape was no more than a cloud on the horizon the size of a man's hand in 1972.  That is not the case and a Government watching what it was doing and having regard to the long-term necessities of the Irish economy might&mdash;I do not say would&mdash;have had regard to this possibility because this was an area in which, unlike any other area, we would be called on to make a major contribution to the common pool of the European Community.  In no other area would we be called on to contribute very substantially more than some of our richest partners&mdash; the case has been quite the opposite&mdash; but this was an area in which we <Col N="644" /> might have said, had the Government of the day foreseen it&mdash;I make no special point of that&mdash;&ldquo;This possibility will, or may involve us in contributing to a pool of some of the richest countries in the world an asset of enormous value and we must reserve the right, should we find ourselves in possession of that asset&mdash; because, as Deputy Haughey rightly says, nobody at that time had it&mdash;to hesitate before contributing it to the other states without regard to our own interests and in particular to the social importance of the fishing industry in areas which in other respects are highly disadvantaged.&rdquo;  That was not done; it was neglected or omitted.  But I think it is important or at least seemly for an Opposition which has that weakness in its stance&mdash;it was presiding over our accession and very strongly urged the people, as did my own party, to commit ourselves to European integration and Communities&mdash;a party which is now so strident and gleeful in pointing out what appear to be rocks or pitfalls in the way of our Foreign Minister, to put this topic in some perspective and admit what I never hear admitted in the context of the fisheries debate, that we have been very substantial beneficiaries as a people because of our adhesion to the EEC.</P>

The other House this afternoon debated a motion which was the same as the one debated here last week, to extend the limit to 200 miles for other states for fishery protection in general and, in the course of that debate&mdash;I hope I am not out of order in giving some general impressions&mdash;that relative state of our country being a beneficiary was never mentioned from the Opposition side.  There was no word about the benefits.  There were only terms of abuse for the partners who <Col N="645" /> contribute from their own pockets to the benefits we enjoy.  Terms of abuse were used against the Dutch, German, British and Danish people who were described as having raped, scraped, scoured and looted the sea bed.  The sea bed which was under discussion then, at those points in the debate was not the sea bed under our territorial waters but the high seas in those days which were the common property of mankind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have named no names but I shall leave the subject for the moment.  Another aspect of the matter which has been very much absent from the discussion in the heated atmosphere recently generated has been the sheer political and economic necessity of which, for once, we are the victims in this debate.  We are the <Col N="646" /> recipients of the brunt of it and it would be only fair and seemly if the circumstances were put squarely to the people.</P>
      <P>The reason why the renegotiation of the common fisheries policy is so extremely difficult for our Foreign Minister, why he is meeting such ferocious opposition to what might appear to be a simple thing for the benefit of only a small fraction of Europe's population on our west coast is a reason never put before the people by the Opposition in this debate. It is that the very large fishing populations&mdash;they are not all fat capitalists; most of them, I presume, are ordinary fishermen, the same as our own, running the risks of the sea and suffering the same tragedies as ours&mdash;have been excluded because of the extension&mdash;the very thing we are talking about here&mdash;of conventional fishing limits in general in all countries to 200 miles.  Because of that extension applied by Iceland, the Faroes, Norway and Denmark they have been pushed out of fishing grounds which they have fished since the Middle Ages and on which generations of their families have been reared.  I am not weeping for British, French, German or Dutch fishermen &mdash;their own people can do that for them.  We must think first, and all the time of our own but we are part of a community and it is only fair to our partners in the Community to recognise their difficulties and it is only decent in debate to make sure that the public have a clear and full picture of what we are discussing.  It is not being made sufficiently clear that the reason why the renegotiation of fishery policies to get us what we are all looking for, namely a 50 mile exclusive limit, is that we are looking for that at the very moment the other northern European states of whose economy fishing is an important part, are most motivated to resist it because their own available waters have been so substantially squeezed.  I hope that point will be understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make the point, about the exigencies pressing on fishermen of our partners, on the one hand, and the point about our being very substantial <Col N="647" /> net beneficiaries of the EEC of the other, in no way to weaken or throw in any kind of a doubtful light, or to make less respectable, the claims of our own fishing industry.  This Government have given nothing but evidence of their determination to recognise the fact that we get a fishing regime which will give us an exclusive band and other measures to ensure that the fishing stocks on which the development of our industry will increasingly rely, will not be taken from under our noses.  It is also essential, in fairness to ourselves that we may understand the world in which we are living, and in fairness to our partners from whom we are not ashamed to take money, to put these things into some perspective and weigh them up when deciding what tone of voice we will use when criticising failures, difficulties, pitfalls or snags, in a commitment which we freely laid upon ourselves in 1972.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey stopped short of saying something which the senior Fianna Fáil speaker said in the Seanad today&mdash;that unless we got our way on this, we ought to think twice about staying in the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is being very unfair in making that implication about me.  I have always been a committed European.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if the way I am trying to make this point appears to reflect on Deputy Haughey.  I make <Col N="648" /> it unequivocally clear that I do not accuse him of having any such wish or advocating any such policy.  I am sorry if, by bringing him into this rhetorical turn intended to draw attention to another member of his party, I should have appeared to involve him.  Nonetheless, it seems to me that there is no great clarity of mind about this in the Opposition, because I heard the firm statement a few hours ago that unless we got our way in this we ought to think again about our continued membership of the Community.  The same Senator, who led Fianna Fáil in the Seanad, said that we should take a leaf out of the Icelanders' book and that opinion was echoed by another Fianna Fáil speaker.</P>
      <P>No one looking at the cod war could fail to be stirred by what the Icelanders achieved.  Common justice requires us to remember that they were out against not just the easily conjured up might of the British Empire, but against a lot of fishermen who were not to blame for the fact that they had been brought up in the supposition that there was nothing to stop them, in law or otherwise, from fishing in Icelandic waters or in waters within 200 miles of the coast of Iceland. The spirit and determination showed by the Icelanders was admirable.</P>
      <P>To say in one of these Houses that we should take a leaf out of their book ignores the fact that the Icelanders have no partners in a community. They are not part of any European Economic Community. They have no one to look out for but themselves.  If they observe the laws of humanity and other international laws, good luck to them.  To suggest that we take a leaf out of their book ignores completely the difference of the situation between that country and this.  It may not be intended by Fianna Fáil Senators or Deputies, but I say it is irresponsible to try to soup-up feeling here to the point where the Government will be expected to behave as the Government of Iceland did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are legal constraints on us, and constraints from the consequences of which we have derived very considerable benefits, which prevent us <Col N="649" /> from emulating the Icelanders.  We cannot do it and the reasons must be clearly stated.  We are committed to a regime of partnership which carries some disadvantages as well as very considerable advantages, and the Icelanders are not.  The disadvantages in this case will not be borne by anybody but a small number of people&mdash; fishermen.  I do not forget that fact. The fishing industry, like any other industry big or small, is entitled to be defended by whatever Government are in power.  I say that because I hope I will not be accused of making little of the disadvantages of our membership merely because it will fall on a relatively small number of people. They are as entitled to protection as the bigger section of the community&mdash; the farmers or industrial workers.</P>
    <P>I wished to draw the attention of the House to the general features of this debate.  It is important to make these points, even though they have been made before.  I have noticed them surfacing so much in the debate that we must keep this matter in some perspective and we must have regard to the fact that we cannot go into a community, derive benefits from it and cry when we are called on to make some sacrifice.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear again that I and the Government see the merit in Deputy Haughey's and Deputy O'Kennedy's argument.  It is part of the Government's case that we must be allowed to renegotiate the fishery policy in such a way as to take account of the necessity for its future development.  There can be no future development if our resources are worked out, or harvested in such a way that the capacity of fish species to reproduce themselves is extinguished. That cannot be allowed and we will not go along with it.  The House may remain assured that the efforts of the Government, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of fisheries will not be relaxed, nothing will be left undone and no effort will be left unapplied in order to secure specifically the outcome of a 50-mile band.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say in general terms about the situation in regard to our exclusive fishery limit and the <Col N="650" /> political atmosphere which has been generated around this question&mdash;in my view generated somewhat belatedly.  It is a legitimate and important area of debate and I would like the fight to take place in a fairer, more reasonable and more generous atmosphere than it has appeared to do so up to now.</P>
    <P>I want to make it plain, and I am given a lead into this by what Deputy Haughey said a few minutes ago about the British Parliament, that, apart from the reality of lobbies, this Bill cannot pass through this House without doing radical damage to other parts of our law to which it is repugnant and with which it is not consistent.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, the difference between the British and Irish here is that unlike the British we have written into our law, into the European Communities Act of 1972 which was enacted by the Oireachtas before the last change of Government, a provision that Community regulations apply directly here as though they were domestic law, and they will override domestic law as is laid down in one of the articles of the Treaty of Rome and subsequently applied by the European Court in two cases, to the effect that they will override even new legislation.  In other words, for so long as Community law obliges us to share territorial waters with other member states, a Bill of this kind is repugnant not just to Community law but to our law as well because the Community law applies directly here, as the Drogheda Boundary (Confirmation) Bill which was passed here today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy was very angry with the Minister for Foreign Affairs for having been so angry with him for saying the Minister was deceiving the House.  Several columns of the Official Report were wasted on that exchange last week.  I hope the Deputy, who is such an advocate of cut and trust in parliamentary politics, will put up with it if I say he is deceiving the House by creating the impression that the British are about to impose an exclusive 50-mile limit, if that is what he means.  That is the impression that was created and perhaps intended to be created.  If the Deputy means that the British are on the point of declaring an exclusive 50-mile zone from which they will exclude everyone else, I should like him to say that plainly so that he can be shown to be wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said is that the British have legislated to give themselves the power to designate by order a regime which will be established with a new limit and that therefore they regard themselves as free to so legislate in the British Parliament. I did not say what they are going to do or what they are not going to do. I merely said that they think they have the legal right to do this, that they have so legislated, and so have we.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not say they think they have the legal right to do <Col N="652" /> it.  If I understand correctly the way the British work, if they were to do so unilaterally no English court would be able to rule them out, but we cannot do it that way because although it might square with our internal laws it would be in conflict with our Community obligations which are canonised, so to speak, in our own law.  In Britain they have a different way of doing it.  I will take the Deputy's word for it that the British have given themselves the power to draw a 50-mile limit.  We have that power too, if we look at the four corners of Irish law, but if we apply that power we are doing something which is what the Bill seeks to do, namely to do something which is in conflict with the rest of our law and, because the European law is canonised by our law, it is in conflict with that also, whereas if the British want to do it they will be in conflict only with European law and they would have to argue it in some tribunal outside their country. Whether I am right or wrong in that off-the-cuff distinction, I want to draw attention to the implication that the British are about to do what this Bill proposes to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Rightly or wrongly, the Deputy gave the impression that the British were about to keep stretches of water to themselves and that we were not, although our legal situation within the Community is the same.  I do not believe that.  Carefully concealed in section 2 (1) of this Bill is a characteristic attempt to have something both ways.  It states:</P>
      <P>Fishing in that portion of the exclusive fishery limits of the State </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" /> which lies inside the line every point of which is at a distance of fifty nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline shall be restricted exclusively to vessels operating from ports in the State. </P>
    <P>Usually, phrases like that, which are the guts of the Act, are defined in a definition section.  That phrase is not explained and there is no part of our fishery legislation which can be used to construe it.  In other words, if this Bill became law, a judge would be asked to explain what &ldquo;operating from ports in the State&rdquo; means.  Does it mean that only Irish fishermen who are domiciled in ports of the State, or does it mean something less than that? Does it mean people who land fish at the port and go sailing off again? If so, this Bill is absolutely useless, even from the Fianna Fáil point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The more I listen to the Parliamentary Secretary and read the observations of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on this subject the more I become alarmed at the Government's attitude.  If one had been listening carefully to the Parliamentary Secretary one would readily have perceived the uncertainty in his attitude about what we consider to be a straightforward right that must be procured for Irish fishermen, the exclusive right to fish the inner 50-mile zone of our waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of the burden of what the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy John Kelly, had to contribute to this debate, along with being testy, petulant and over-defensive, fell a great deal short of that.  There was a great deal of excusing, of pointing out that we as distinct from the Icelanders for instance, were members of a community and had to accept the obligations of a community.  The inference was very plain that we would have to settle for a good deal less than the demand of not only the fishermen and the people in the fishing industry but, I would say, the whole nation, because this has become quite a national issue.  There is <Col N="654" /> a great deal of evidence in the study and contemplation of what Deputy Kelly, the Parliamentary Secretary, has just had to say that would demonstrate that the Government have surrendered on this issue already to some extent at any rate.  The posturings of the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;I understand he is in Moscow now&mdash;are to a great degree diversionary, just to keep the show on the road and to implant gradually the idea that something less than the simple demand of the fishing industry for an exclusive 50-mile limit will eventually have to be accepted.</P>
    <P>The concession by the EEC of the right to the Irish fishing industry to double their catch&mdash;if they are able to double their catch in competition with Community fishing vessels from all over the Community in their own waters&mdash;is trumpeted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs as if it were a really wonderful victory.  If we assume that the industry had the capacity to expand and the ability to enlarge itself to the degree that the catch could in time be doubled, that doubling would have to take place in competition with vessels from the other countries in the Community whose presence in Irish waters seems to be accepted as a foregone conclusion by the Minister and by the Parliamentary Secretary as well.</P>
    <P>The optics are different.  I was looking through the record of the proceedings of this House for the 8th December, 1976, in Volume 295, columns 365 and 366 of the Official Report.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs devotes a great deal of attention to the strange reporting of discussions by the European Parliament in October of a motion from a British Labour Party Deputy, Mr. Prescott, from either Hull or Fleetwood, which proposed the establishment in the Community of what he called conservation service which would allow fishing quotas to Community vessels in the conservation zones.  This was supported by Deputy Kavanagh of the Labour Party.  The Fine Gael members of the Parliament were not present at all.  The motion was opposed by the Fianna Fáil Deputies who were immediately accused by Radio Éireann to begin with and other media people thereafter of failing to <Col N="655" /> support the 50-mile zone for Irish fishermen.  What the Fianna Fáil group very conscientiously and deliberately did was they withheld support from a proposal which would bring Community fishermen into the six-mile limit, into the shore-line of Irish fishery waters under Deputy Liam Kavanagh's and his socialist friend Mr. Prescott's motion.  Lo and behold, the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the columns of the Official Report that I have referred to returns to this bending and twisting of the facts in seeking to represent that the Fianna Fáil Deputies in the European Parliament failed the fishing industry in some way or other.</P>
    <P>Of course, the facts are quite the reverse.  One solitary Government Deputy of the five in the European Parliament at that time&mdash;all the others were absent for some reason or other&mdash; supported the motion from the British socialist groups in the European Parliament which would permit the fishing of Irish waters by British fishermen, French, German, Dutch, Danish, the lot, and Fianna Fáil were accused of failing the Irish fishermen because they opposed this.  That was the situation.</P>
    <P>Why should the Minister for Foreign Affairs want to misrepresent the position so?  The record of the European Parliament is there for anyone who wants to consult it.  It is quite clear tonight, listening to the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Kelly, that they want to divert attention from their own disbelief in the possibility of securing the exclusive 50-mile limit for Irish fishermen and Irish fishermen alone of their own waters.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred at great length to the impositions and obligations that membership of the Community imposed.  We must accept the obligations of community.  Very well then, the Commission proposal is that the Community will share out Irish fishery waters amongst themselves and the Irish will get a share.  That is the proposition being supported by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>Simultaneously on another front the Irish Government are looking for some recompense because they are <Col N="656" /> not allowed to share the market place for farm produce that all the other countries of the Community are allowed to do.  Irish food producers, whether they be producers of meat or dairy products, must pay enormous monetary compensatory amounts to the European Community before they are allowed into the European Market.  The Treaty of Accession very clearly gives the right of access to the markets after the accession period.  We are paying accession monetary compensatory amounts as well.  The level of the monetary compensatory amounts at present is anything between £80 and £100 per steer going on to the European Market.  We are not allowed the freedom of the market place by the Community that the Parliamentary Secretary is so anxious that we should bear the burden for.</P>
    <P>There is a very dire, clear and visible need, visible not only to Irishmen but to all fair-minded Europeans as well, on all kinds of social grounds. The great social need in Ireland is for the exclusive protection of Irish fisheries for Irish people.  On conservation grounds as well as for Community purposes it is vital that the fishing stocks be allowed to breed and propagate in a lightly-fished area as we would like Irish fishery waters to be if they were confined to Irish fishermen alone to fish in.  We are making that case for fisheries.</P>
    <P>We ought to be making the case&mdash; I do not think we are doing it very effectively&mdash;that if membership of the Community imposes obligations it also confers rights.  One of the basic rights would be access to the market place with our food products.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries knows very well, as every other Deputy in the House does, that we do not have this free access to the market place.  We have to pay crushing border taxes before we are allowed to enter into the European market.  Therefore the concern of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach with the niceties of our obligations to the Community is quite touching in the context of the brutal refusal of the Community to permit us to sell our goods <Col N="657" /> on equal terms with the other members of the Community and the Community market.  The reality is that in every country but ours, probably, there is an over-developed fishing capacity which has fished out all the available fish in their own coastal waters.</P>
    <P>This applies to the Germans, the Dutch, the Belgians, the French, the Danes and the British.  Simultaneously, the Norwegians have given notice of their intention to establish a 200-mile limit.  The Canadians and the United States Government have given similar notices as, of course, have the Icelandic Government, very important and vital in the case of the British fishermen who are fishing for their very valuable cod fisheries in the Canadian and American waters.  They will be driven out of those waters. All this over-fishing of the fishing capacity of the other members of the Community means that they will turn their greedy eyes on Irish waters and begin to share out with the Irish what belongs to the Irish.  We are being tuttutted by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach because in protesting that those fisheries belong to the Irish alone we are in some way antiCommunity or falling short of our obligations as Community members. This is not so.</P>
    <P>The sooner we realise our feeble position, both in numbers and in political muscle within the European Community, the sooner reality will find its way into the thinking of the Government.  One has only to look at the peculiar Community behaviour of Governments like the Italian Governments who introduced 50 per cent import deposit schemes without consulting anybody and had them ratified retrospectively by the Community when they had done it for six months in order to shore up their economy. We have only to look at the antics of the French over many years.  We have only to look at the arrival of the British in the Community, which was followed almost immediately by a process called renegotiation and the first referendum that was ever held in England as to whether they would stay in the Community.  We have only to <Col N="658" /> think of these things to realise that however idealistic the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries might be, the reality is that unless a vigorous line is taken to protect national interests in the Community, in its present development at any rate, our national interests will go under to the stronger opposition that we encounter.</P>
    <P>Contemplation of the contribution made last week by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and tonight by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach must fill the Irish fishing industry with a great deal of apprehension and dread because written plainly and largely across every word he said is a fear and a doubt in the cause they profess to serve.  I do not see why the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister should simultaneously show such commendable zeal from the Community action point of view and at the same time boggle so badly at the knees in relation to the vital defence of this rightful demand of our fishing industry.  They tried to wrap the robe of Community responsibility around themselves and say that the Irish must not be selfish and must not demand what belongs to them for themselves but must share it with our greedy neighbours.  At the same time they must accept being shut out of the Community market by those same Community partners.</P>
    <P>There is a great inconsistency in the attitude of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  I call it to the attention of the Irish fishing industry because it appears that there is a great need for them again to underline to the Government the undeniable and fundamental need there is to secure a no nonsense 50-mile exclusive limit for the reasons I have been discussing and that nothing else will do.  Notable in the contributions of the Minister and of the Parliamentary Secretary was their great preoccupation with the legalities.  I accept that the Parliamentary Secretary is a professor of law and that the Minister is also an academically qualified person but perhaps they fell into the trap of being <Col N="659" /> over-preoccupied in their academic fields.  I was a bit dismayed by the absence from what they said of any expressed concern about the people actually involved in this, the people who catch the fish and whose living is made from fish.  The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary were more concerned about the niceties of the legal position and whether or not the quotations from Hansard by my colleague, Deputy Haughey, were in place in a discussion on fisheries.</P>
    <P>We are discussing the right of a section of our people to live in their own country from their own resources and the expansion of those resources in the future for the people of this country.  It was quite obscure in the contributions of the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary that there was any particular preoccupation with this. I seriously suspect that there is a kind <Col N="660" /> of an unspoken tacit readiness to retreat, a line I believe to be defensive and which I believe is not quite possible or feasible to hold.</P>

In the Minister's case, he is satisfied simply to put back into the Bill the very same section as the Committee deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say, first of all, that that is hardly a very democratic way to proceed. The House set up this Special Committee to deal with this legislation. The Committee went into the Bill in great detail and in their wisdom decided to delete section 16 as it <Col N="668" /> stood.  Our motives in deleting this section were clear.  We did not regard the section as it stood as satisfactory. We felt it was an inadequate proposal, that it would not achieve the objective the farmers of the legislation had in mind.  On that basis, we voted to delete it.  I do not think it is good enough for the Minister to say he is not in the least influenced by what the Special Committee did, he is going to put the section back in again.  That is a very flat-footed, undemocratic approach. The Minister should have acknowledged in some way the existence of the Special Committee and the consideration they gave the Bill.  He should have also acknowledged the action of the Special Committee in deleting section 16 as being inadequate.</P>
    <P>One would think that a person interested in our parliamentary procedures like the Minister, a person who wanted to see the special committee system work, would take account of what the Special Committee did and come back to the House with a revised and improved section 16. Instead, we have the proposal of the Minister to automatically, mechanically, reinsert the section which was deleted.  We criticised the original section 16 because we did not believe it would be successful in achieving its objectives.  The original section dealt with the situation where a person who had lands which would be suitable for development as a nature reserve would, in agreement with the Minister for Lands, have an order made establishing a nature reserve on those lands, a very desirable and commendable thing. Undoubtedly, there are many such properties where people would be very agreeable to have them transformed into nature reserves with the full blessing and approval of the Minister.  We would all hope that that process would gather momentum and it would become a very valuable process in the establishment of nature reserves throughout the country, thereby making an important contribution to conservation and the preservation of wild life.</P>
    <P>We questioned the Minister closely at the Special Committee about the advantages which would accrue to the <Col N="669" /> owners of these lands as a result of their having these orders made.  In fact, it transpired that there would be no real positive benefit accuring to the owners of the land; there would be nothing to tempt them to seek to have this procedure invoked.  It would not be an attractive proposal from the point of view of the owner of private lands. It seemed that the only thing the Minister could put forward as an attraction was the fact that if these lands were transformed by ministerial order into private reserves the penalties which persons committing offences on the land would incur would be heavy.  We suggested that that was not any great advantage at all, that it did not seem to us that any private citizen who had such suitable lands would be tempted to ask the Minister to make an order turning them into nature reserves simply because if he did so poachers would be more heavily penalised if they were caught.  That is what is behind our proposal.  We want to put in a new section 16 which will have some power. Simply, we are doing two things.  We are amending subsection (5) of the Minister's section by adding the words after &ldquo;situate&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>and the Commissioners and every such planning authority shall have due regard in the performance of their functions to the existence of such order. </P>
    <P>When an order is made by the Minister transforming one of these areas into a private nature reserve a copy of that order is sent to the planning authority and the Commissioners of Public Works but there the matter ends.  The order can be ignored by those bodies. We want to ensure that when the order is received by the planning authority or by the Commissioners of Public Works they shall, from that moment onwards in carrying out their functions and duties and in discharging their obligations have regard to the existence of such an order.  In other words, they will proceed to operate as a planning authority or as the Commissioners of Public Works in the full knowledge and having due regard to the fact that a private nature reserve has been established on these lands.  We want them to take that into account in their planning and other activities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> We want to make a much more important additional provision.  We want to add an additional subsection, subsection (6):</P>
    <P>The Minister may with the consent of the Minister for Finance make available for the management, maintenance, and betterment of a nature reserve on any land in respect of which the Minister has made a recognition order under this section such service and assistance as he may deem appropriate&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>The addition of that subsection would make section 16 worth while because then a number of things would happen. A public spirited person would come to the Minister for Lands and say he had so much land which he felt would be very suitable for the establishment of a nature reserve and if the Minister would agree he would make a recognition order and these private lands, would, by virtue of that order, be transformed into a nature reserve.  The Minister would then send a copy of that order to the planning authority and the Commissioners of Public Works and that would ensure the future protection of that nature reserve because those bodies would be put on notice that they would have to have regard in their activities to the fact that this nature reserve existed on these lands.  In addition, the Minister, and his Department, would be able to assist in a practical way with the establishment, maintenance, management and the betterment of the nature reserve.</P>
    <P>The Minister has these resources at his disposal and the services of these experts which the private citizen would not have.  We could have a situation where a recognition order would become an empty formula.  In theory, certain lands would be transformed into a private reserve by the recognition order, but, in fact, nothing more would happen.  That is the sort of situation we want to avoid.  We want to ensure that where a nature reserve is, in theory, established that it will, in fact, become a real viable important nature reserve.  The only way that can be achieved is by the Minister and his Department taking an active part in the management and running of the <Col N="671" /> nature reserve.  This seems to us a very sensible proposal.  We have provided that this can only be done with the consent of the Minister for Finance. That is a necessary proviso because in so far as expenditure of public moneys would be involved the Minister for Finance would have to agree.</P>
    <P>There would not be any loss to the Exchequer in what we propose.  It would not really cost the taxpayers anything.  From what I know of the Minister's officers and officials in this area they could almost certainly run the nature reserves in such a way that expenditure involved out of the public purse could be reimbursed.  Even if it were not, the Minister would simply be supplying to these reserves services which already exist.  I would not think it would be necessary for him to create any new machinery or appoint more staff.  I imagine what would be involved principally would be advice. There might be some practical things to be done which would involve actual expenditure but, generally, the service the Minister could provide would be provided by the existing structure of the wildlife section of his Department. They are very dedicated people with great interest in their work and I could readily see them, provided they had the statutory backing we propose, undertaking the management and betterment of private nature reserves without any significant extension of Departmental expenditure.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend these two additions to the existing section to the Minister.  If he adopts them, he will have a worth-while mechanism at his disposal to enable him to create nature reserves on private property and he will be able to ensure that they become a reality since he is supplying all the necessary assistance and advice necessary to make them worth-while propositions.  These are the main considerations behind our amendments. I think the Minister is being a little lax in the discharge of his parliamentary obligations in simply proposing to reinsert section 16 as it was, the exact section that the Committee deleted.  It makes a farce of the Committee proceedings if he does <Col N="672" /> that.  The Minister could extricate himself from that undermocratic position by adopting our new section 16 instead of his own.  If he is worried about what subsection (6) might involve by way of expenditure of public moneys, he always has the fallback that it can only be done by consent of the Minister for Finance and he can be sure the Minister will not tolerate excessive expenditure under the section.</P>
    <P>We think that the procedure that has been thought up is good and could become a very important and valuable process in this whole matter.  Many areas could come within the ambit of section 16 and many people would be glad to avail of it but we want to be sure that it is worth while doing it, that it is attractive to them.  Quite a number of people would be prepared to ask the Minister to make a requisition order in respect of their land if they could be certain that he was in a position to provide this help and those services for them after the order had been made.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend our section 16 because we think it would create a useful process which would be beneficial to the whole area of conservation of wildlife if he were to insert in the legislation the provisions we propose in these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>At the Special Committee the Minister's predecessor made I think the case for the spirit of the amendments which we offer. He said, as reported on page 71 of the Wildlife Bill, 1975, Special Committee:</P>
      <P>...Some private individuals and organisations make a very worth-while contribution to wildlife conservation by devoting their lands as nature reserves&mdash;sometimes at considerable financial cost.... </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what he said in respect of the reserves which are referred to in our amendments in what was the original section 16 of this legislation.  We are concerned that the people to whom the Minister referred should get proper recognition, that their voluntary efforts and the contribution they are making to conservation&mdash;which we hope <Col N="673" /> would have the effect of encouraging others to do likewise&mdash;would at least get the recognition and protection we have envisaged in our amendments and which we think is more manifest in our amendments, as compared with, as Deputy Haughey said, the throwback we are getting from the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage when the Minister was asked to indicate the purpose of section 16 he seemed very much at a loss and could only repeat, as reported on page 71 of the Wildlife Bill, 1975, Special Committee that:</P>
    <P>There will be much stiffer penalties for offences committed on such lands.... </P>
    <P>That is the measure of the respect and regard the Minister shows in this legislation for the wonderful efforts by private landowners in regard to conservation.  We think that is not enough.  What the Minister indicated makes very little of the wonderful contribution often made, as he said himself, at considerable financial cost. We hope our suggested new section would give recognition to what is being done and also give muscle to the legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to cover ground already covered adequately by Deputy Haughey as is his custom in regard to anything to which he applies himself but I refer again to subsection (2) which states:</P>
    <P>Before making a recognition order the Minister shall consult the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the Minister for Transport and Power, the Commissioners and any planning authority within whose area the land to which the proposed order relates, or any part of such land is situate. </P>
    <P>Again, I ask the simple question, a question which is often asked by the child very succinctly and briefly, what is it in aid of?  What contribution is being made to conservation? What encouragement or exortation to preserve or conserve is in section 16 (2)?  There is nothing.  People familiar with legislation, especially planning authorities, know there is nothing to be gained by showing <Col N="674" /> something to a planning authority. Unless provision is made in the appropriate legislation, it gets no regard.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) substantiates my earlier comments on the superficiality of this legislation.  It cannot be taken as an indication of any real concern on our part to introduce the legislation to give teeth and muscle to legislation dealing with conservation.  I realise that the Minister and his advisers hope this legislation will pass expeditiously.  In that regard I ask them to bear with us while we make our comments on this legislation which is less than perfect.</P>

      <P>This discussion hinges around the point whether things can be done as they are or whether the amendment should be accepted. Everything that could be done under the amendment can be done under the general provisions of section 11.  It is as simple as that.  My predecessor, Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i>, at column 72 of the Wildlife Bill Special Committee, D 22, No. 7 stated, and this puts the matter in its proper perspective:</P>
      <P>With all respect, we will have to agree to differ on that.  I accept Deputy Haughey's <i>bona fides</i> and the point put forward by him, but I think it is not necessary to make the amendment he proposes.  I do not think it would be in the interests or the spirit of the Bill to do it. </P>
      <P>I have carefully considered the representations of the Opposition and there is no desire to put democracy outside the door, but I am quite clear, having appraised myself of their desires, that the power is there in any case under section 11.  Therefore, I see no reason to amend this Bill at this point and I cannot accept the other amendment.</P>

      <P>There is not much comfort in speaking when one has the idea from the very beginning that one is not likely to meet with much success.  The Minister has come here with understandable and plausible reasons for not being able to accept our amendment.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to the new section 17 and provides that:</P>
      <P>The Minister may with the consent of the Minister for Finance provide to the owner or occupier of land in respect of which a designation order under this section is in operation, such advice and assistance as he deems necessary for the protection of the fauna concerned. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 as it stands does not provide the assistance to which the amendment refers.  In our view, without such a provision the section is weaker.  The case made in respect of section 16 and the spirit and the approach of the Minister and his Department to all persons, agencies and institutions involved, and with whom he hopes to co-operate in conservation and preservation, is embodied in this amendment.  The Minister will not get in this or any other area co-operation or respect for legislation unless he indicates that he appreciates the efforts being made by private landowners or voluntary organisations. <Col N="676" /> The section does not refer to voluntary organisations but to contributions which we anticipate may be made by occupiers of land.  As it stands, the section does not allow the Minister the freedom I suggest he would like to have.  It does not allow him to co-operate in the fashion I have indicated and it is in that spirit that we offer him this amendment.  Our purpose is to have the Bill finalised in a form which will be as near perfection as possible and we venture to say our amendments would make a contribution in that direction.</P>

      <P>The basic amendment here is amendment No. 21 affecting section 32.  Arising out of the Committee debate on the section I find it necessary to move this amendment in order to exempt from the prohibition in subsection (1) acts which are lawful under other statutes.  A case in point is where section 14 of the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1965, allows a landowner to lay poison on his own land provided he posts notices, notifies the Garda and securely stakes the poison to the soil.</P>
      <P>It would be unreasonable to deprive a landowner of this relief against marauding animals, in defence of his crops or stock and it was never the intention that the section should do so.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> The purpose of the endorsement&mdash; which would appear on a resident's firearm certificate in respect of a shotgun&mdash;is to transform the firearm certificate into a licence to hunt, first of all game birds which are the subject of an open season order under section 23, subject to the terms of that order, and secondly, hares which are the subject of an open season order under section 24, subject to the terms of that order.  In other words, the endorsed certificate would entitle the resident sportsman to shoot specified game birds during the open season only and hares in the open season only, provided the open season order under section 24 permitted the shooting of hares as distinct from other methods of hunting, for example, beagling, harrying or coursing.  I am satisfied that the proposed amendments of subsections (5) and (8) clarify the intention of the endorsement.</P>

      <P> 30.&mdash;(1) It shall not be lawful for a person, without the permission of the Minister, to hunt fauna on or over foreshore belonging to the State or on or over land belonging to the State and which is either covered by any inland waters or comprised in the lakeshore accretion from any lake.</P>
      <P>(2) Any person who contravenes subsection (1) of this section shall commit a trespass and may, if the Minister thinks fit, be sued by the Minister for trespass in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>(3) Nothing in this section shall operate to prejudice any legal proceedings which may be instituted apart from this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These provisions were opposed during Committee Stage debate on the basis that they were too sweeping against the traditional foreshore wildfowler or that they should be confined to protected species.</P>
      <P>I would stress that this is a very desirable section in the context of wildlife conservation.  There is no intention whatsoever of banning the traditional sportsman who shoots over foreshore, but it is very evident that some control is essential to stop malpractices by many non-sportsmen who shoot at anything that flies on the foreshore and very often with the wrong type of weapon.  This type of shooting is reprehensible when one hears of various species of wild birds being found dead and wounded on the foreshore.</P>
      <P>There is little point in confining the section to protected species as very often the unsporting person who indulges in this type of indiscriminate shooting could not identify one bird from another.  In any case we must also consider the disturbance factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> As I have said, the genuine traditional sportsman will have nothing to worry about.  Permission will be readily forthcoming for him, but the omission of these provisions from the Act would leave a glaring loophole in our conservation laws.

I can visualise an amount of difficulty and perhaps the legislation would be mocked at.</P>

      <P>I am not at all happy that these provisions are totally enforceable in every part of the country at every moment in time.  However, on the foreshore there are a number of species of birds and there have been occasions when with the wrong weapons people have just shot everything in sight.  This is not what we want.  We want also to be clear in our minds that we are able to protect a certain species.  The only foreshore shooting I have ever done in my life was that of golden plover which was done at low water and this was I think at a place where you would not take many golden plover, but there are other places around the country where you will take a lot.  We want to have the right to protect these birds wherever they are.  It will be difficult and we have to concentrate on the more vulnerable spots, but in happier times when there is no subversion it will be possible for the Garda Síochána to watch the foreshore at the relevant times of the day. I have said that it is at low tide that you shoot golden plover.  That is all right, but if the Garda know that is so then a patrol car could go down to the beach in a very short time and <Col N="682" /> could observe what was happening there.</P>

Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan),</i> to indicate whether or not he visualised the situation where he would be giving permission to people who traditionally had access to the foreshore, that from now on he would be the licensing agent for local people who hitherto had access to the foreshore.  Does this section give such people such permission?</P>

      <P>A question was raised in the debate and is now raised by Deputy Tunney whether persons who, say, through seaweed, had the right of way across the foreshore, would now be foregoing that right?  That is not so at all.  The object of this section is to enable the Minister to regulate public access through or use of the foreshore nature reserve, whether on State or private lands, and the refuges for <i>fauna</i>, but only to such an extent as is necessary to conserve our wildlife values, and in the case of private reserves only at the request and with the consent of the order.  The Deputy may take it that persons who walk across the foreshore for their own convenience or take seaweed from the foreshore or land articles from boats on the foreshore, provided they were not in conflict with common law, will continue to have the same rights as they always had.</P>

      <P>On the question of common law I was rather surprised that the Minister said when we questioned him on this point in respect of people specifically in the Connemara area who went to the foreshore to draw seaweed, that legally speaking they were not entitled to do that.  I <Col N="687" /> took that as an indication from him that perhaps he was going to prohibit the exercise of that traditional right in future.  If he does I cannot see him meeting with success or that there would be much co-operation from the people of maritime areas.</P>

      <P>I think we are at odds.  What my predecessor said is correct in that most of our foreshore is owned by the State but practice and precedents have come in and persons have taken the seaweed for use as fertiliser and so on.  This has been accepted and there is no change at all in this nor does this legislation cut across that situation.  All those people will be fully entitled to go down with their tractors or their donkeys with panniers on each side or a cart and horse and take what they always took before.  This legislation had nothing to do with anything except with game and <i>fauna.</i> The Deputy may take it that my predecessor was correct but he and Deputy Tunney found themselves at odds.

      <P>I would like to express my gratitude for the welcome this Bill has received from both sides of the House and, in particular, to record my personal appreciation of the exacting way in which the provisions of this long and complex measure were examined and discussed by the Special Committee.  I will be the first to acknowledge that the amendments which arose from these discussions have been most valuable.</P>
      <P>This is a very important volume of legislation on wildlife&mdash;the first for over 45 years&mdash;and it updates several old laws going back, in some instances, as far as penal times.  Apart from establishing a new national charter for the conservation and development of our wildlife resources, it will provide a badly needed statutory framework for this country's inevitable involvement in and contributions to the wildlife scene at international level by for example, facilitating the ratification of two major international conventions which have already come into force, namely, the Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> Let us just summarise the main advances being made in the Bill in the field of wildlife conservation.  It identifies and settles on one Minister, the Minister for Lands, responsibility for the conservation of wildlife&mdash;wild birds, wild animals and wild plants. It enables the Minister to initiate and engage in research and surveys related to wildlife and to promote public knowledge of wildlife values.</P>
    <P>It provides for the setting up of a fully representative Wildlife Advisory Council to advise the Minister.  It provides for the first time statutory protection for all wild birds with the exception of a few pest species.  It provides for the first time statutory protection for our less common wild animals and marine mammals.  It provides the means to protect our rare wild plant life.</P>
    <P>For the first time the essential habitats of protected fauna and flora can be afforded statutory protection through the establishment of nature reserves, including marine reserves, and the designation of refuges for fauna.</P>
    <P>There will be a noticeable strengthening of our hunting laws:</P>
    <P>Only qualified persons with lawful access to sporting rights will be entitled to hunt game during statutory open seasons;</P>
    <P>Individual bag limits can be imposed;</P>
    <P>Open seasons can be suspended in the interests of conservation of species;</P>
    <P>Hunting licences will be introduced for the first time for both resident sportsmen and visitors to the State;</P>
    <P>Hunting on State foreshore will be subject to the permission of the Minister;</P>
    <P>Hunting rights over a three-mile limit of our territorial seas will be vested in the State;</P>
    <P>Hunting at night will be prohibited;</P>
    <P>Hunting of protected wild birds and animals from mechanically propelled vehicles, vessels or aircraft will be banned;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> Unsuitable firearms and indiscriminate mechanical and electrical devices will not be permitted in hunting, nor will certain traps, snares, nets, decoys, lures and dazzling devices be allowed. </P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the ringing and tagging of wild birds and wild animals will be subject to licence. There will be new restrictions on the burning of growing vegetation near woods, nature reserves and refuges. The person who deliberately or through gross negligence causes such a fire will, in addition to facing a conviction and fine, face a claim for the resulting damage or loss.</P>
    <P>The practice of falconry can be regulated under licence if the occasion demands.  It will be an offence to trespass on another person's land in pursuit of any wild bird or wild animal whether it is a protected species or not.</P>
    <P>The possession, sale and purchase of protected fauna will be severely restricted.  The import and export of wild fauna, alive or dead, and of flora will be subject to licence.</P>
    <P>There will be new powers to acquire land in the interests of wildlife conservation. Other State and semi-State authorities will be obliged to liaise with the Minister for Lands in the interests of safeguarding valuable habitats of wildlife.</P>
    <P>That then is a list of the main advances being made by this Bill. By any standards I suggest that it is a formidable and impressive list.  It is my earnest hope, that on its enactment, the overall philosophy of the Bill will be favourably received and its principles and provisions actively supported by the general public.  In the final analysis, it is in their interests that a measure of this kind must be seen to work, so that the conservation of our irreplaceable wildlife heritage for the benefit of this and future generations may be assured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Tunney, who is in charge of this legislation on behalf of the Opposition, has agreed to give the Minister this Bill this evening.  That <Col N="692" /> is a generous and sensible decision on the part of Deputy Tunney because we would like to spend a lot more time on this Bill.  There are aspects of it that still cause us some disquiet. I should very much like to have the opportunity of dealing with section 68 regarding the onus of proof because I do not think that is a good section. There are a couple of other sections, section 57 which deals with the creation of rights of way and section 56 which deals with the right to hunt on or over territorial seas of estates vested in the State.  There are a number of those matters which I should have liked to have had a last attempt at changing or persuading the Minister to change.</P>
      <P>This is a situation where we cannot let the best be the enemy of the good. It is important that we get this legislation on the Statute Book.  Deputy Tunney and I are concerned at the state the Government are in at the moment and that anything can happen, and if we let the Dáil adjourn before Christmas without this legislation it might never get on to the Statute Book.  It is better, all things considered, to have the Bill enacted rather than to run the risk of having it lost, perhaps for a long time.</P>
      <P>This is very important legislation. I do not think many Deputies are as concerned about it as they should be. I do not think Deputies generally realise the importance of what we are trying to do in this legislation.  I hope it will usher in a new era in regard to the environment as a whole as well as the conservation of wildlife.  It is very important that the Minister for Lands now has this power and has the function&mdash;we tried to make it a duty&mdash;of conserving our wildlife.  I believe this legislation will have very far reaching effects and implications and that it goes away outside the mere confines of conservation of wildlife. It will have an enormous impact on our future as a community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully support the Minister.  I hope he will direct his efforts to try to get more and more people, especially our young people, interested in the countryside, the environment and the conservation of wildlife.  We will have <Col N="693" /> to concentrate on this area to an increasing extent in the future.  I hope that this legislation will only represent a starting point in that whole area.</P>
    <P>The Minister, who is a countryman, is interested in sporting activities and rural life.  I hope he will take a very special interest in this area and treat it as a very important part of his ministerial functions.  He is very fortunate in having the type of people in the Department that he has, men and women who are dedicated to this work.  They have the right approach and the right outlook.  They seek to achieve their objectives by persuading and advising and by helping people. I should like to express my gratitude for the assistance I have received from them from time to time.  I hope to receive a great deal more in the future.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to see this legislation as just a piece of technical legislation dealing with wildlife only. It should be seen to have far wider implications than that.  I do not want to go into that area but I hope that the enactment of this legislation and its operation by the Department in the same way as they carried out their functions up to now and the same sort of spirit will have an enormously beneficial effect throughout the community. The wildlife we have today is not ours to dispose of as we see fit. It was passed on to us and it is up to us in our time to treat it as a heritage and to do what we can to preserve it, to strengthen it and to hand it on to the next generation perhaps better than when it was transmitted to us.</P>
    <P>There has been a steady, unfortunate, regrettable deterioration in this whole area of wildlife.  This legislation will give us an opportunity to make a significant new start and arrest the decline that has been taking place.  It will give the Minister's office the powers and scope that they need. I welcome the legislation and would like to spend more time on it to improve it in various ways, but we have not the time, and it is better to have the legislation with the defects in it than not to have it at all.  I commend the Minister, his predecessor <Col N="694" /> and his Department on at last being successful in having this legislation put on the Statute Book.  As far as we are concerned the Minister's predecessor was a bit too restrictive in his approach, but on the other hand he met us on a few points, and for that we express our appreciation.  I would like to commend the Department and particularly the Minister's advisers on very comprehensive and important legislation which is now going on to our Statute Book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will open by commenting on the speed with which the business has been completed.  I use a phrase which we hear more often on sad occasions&mdash;it came suddenly in the end.  In relation to this legislation I have said before, and I repeat, that I looked upon it as an extremely important piece of legislation.  One has not to search very far to find reasons for it, but certainly anybody who moves through our countryside today, with even one eye open would have to realise that in respect of fauna and flora we have begun to move to the point where there is serious depletion and an amount of devastation.  It is sad too, when one thinks of the need there is now to explain to one's children that not so long ago there was nothing strange about hearing a lark, that Shelley's skylark did exist, and that an chuach and an traonach were really birds that came to, that existed, and could be heard in Ireland, and that the wildlife which gave such an attraction and a fascination to the countryside some years ago was a reality.  Now in many cases it is only a memory.  Irish life is and will be all the poorer for that.  In so far as this legislation attempted remedying that position it had to be accorded quite a welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very disappointed in the approaches manifested by the Government side especially on Committee Stage.  The Committee consisted of six members of the Opposition and six members of the Government.  It is sad that in all those committee meetings, this legislation did not have the benefit of more than half a dozen very short succinct and irrelevant contributions by Members representing the <Col N="695" /> Government on that Committee. Apart from anything else that is an offence to democracy.  What is more disturbing is that in this House last week a Minister, who shares responsibility with the holder of the office of Minister for Lands in respect of the preservation of wildlife, chided this House, and Members of this side of the House especially, because we dared hold up legislation which he thought was vital to the life of this country.  Under the legislation which the Minister for Labour regarded was vital to the life of this country it is envisaged that any employer who contemplates rendering any employee unemployed or unemployable may have his house visited and his books examined by authorised officers of that Minister's Department.</P>

      <P>In this House, compliments and credits of that nature serve to coax the speaker from the paths on which he finds himself, although it need not always be an erring path.  It is very appropriate to defend this legislation against that which was purported by another Minister as being more important than legislation which allows officers of his Department to visit and inspect books and the homes of employers.  I do not intend pursuing it any further than that.  It can be said that the legislation <Col N="696" /> is somewhat cumbersome.  It is certainly copious, and one must entertain certain doubts about its enforcibility. The legislation is not specific enough and various agencies including the agency of the Garda may be tempted to shy away from helping to enforce the legislation.  There is too much dependence in the legislation on exhortation. Exhortation has a place in the life of the country but in a matter that is so vital I would prefer to see more specific, clearly cut provisions.</P>
      <P>Those of us who have an interest in wildlife and its preservation must ask other Departments and other institutions to co-operate with us in matters which are not specific to this legislation, but with regard to insecticides and pesticides.  It would be foolish to assume that having enacted this legislation we can retire from the scene happy in the thought that what we hope for will be provided.  I do not think that will be the case.  It would be very unwise of us and would be a poor compliment to the legislation if we assume our work is now complete.  On the contrary, our work has just started.  I hope that by implementing the provisions of this legislation it will leave us and our countryside all the richer.</P>

    <P>The information sought by the Deputy, in so far as the cost to the <Col N="546" /> Exchequer of unemployment benefit is concerned, is not available.  This benefit, like the other social insurance benefits, is payable out of the social insurance fund.  The fund is financed by contributions by employers, employees and the Exchequer but the amount of the Exchequer contribution is not apportioned between the different benefits.  It is estimated, however, that the amount of unemployment benefit which will be paid in 1976 will be in the region of £44 million.</P>
    <P>Unemployment Assistance is paid directly from the Exchequer.  It is estimated that the cost of unemployment assistance&mdash;including the amount paid to smallholder recipients&mdash;will be in the region of £50 million in 1976.</P>

      <P>Payment of unemployment assistance was made to the person concerned on the basis of a weekly rate of means of £4.77 derived from land the rateable valuation of which was £12.40.  Following reinvestigation of his means, it was ascertained that he had rented an additional holding in January, 1973, the rateable valuation of which was £12.50, but had not reported the fact to the Department. A deciding officer accordingly reassessed <Col N="549" /> his weekly rate of means at £9.58 with effect from 1st January, 1973, and at £19.15 from 31st March, 1976, when amending provisions regarding the calculation of means derived from land in the specified areas came into effect.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question relates to the sick leave arrangements for established and industrial civil servants.  As already indicated in a reply to a parliamentary question on 28th October, 1976 by the Deputy it is a cardinal principle in superannuation, applicable to industrial and established civil servants, that unpaid service, including sick leave without pay, does not reckon for pension purposes.

    <P>A sum of £3,102.59 was received from the Council of Europe in respect of the expenses of witnesses who were summoned by the Commission on Human Rights.  Further recoupment of expenditure (about £5,000) is to be received from the Council.  The expenses of witnesses produced on the initiative of the Irish Government are paid from Irish public funds.</P>
    <P>Taking the receipts into account the total net expenditure on the case to date has been £130,108.97.  In addition to the above expenditure a considerable amount of work on the case was performed in the Offices of the Attorney General and Chief State Solicitor.  It would be extremely difficult and time consuming to estimate satisfactorily the cost of this work, and, therefore, no such estimate has been done.</P>
