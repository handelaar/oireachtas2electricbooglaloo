    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will make a statement on reports regarding the setting up of vigilante patrols in some areas of Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the reports referred to.  To the knowledge of the Garda authorities, there is no vigilante group operating in any area in Dublin city and the Garda authorities are not aware of any proposal to establish one.  It is, of course, heartening to note that there are many citizens who would be prepared to assist the Garda and indeed without the support of the mass of the <Col N="872" /> community the Garda cannot effectively discharge their duties.  Co-operation between the Garda and the public in combating lawlessness can take many forms.  One suggestion I should like to make now is that residents' associations and other community organisations in Dublin might contact the Garda public relations office at the Depot and explain their local problems in detail with a view to establishing whether some specific measures are possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates that this suggestion of vigilantes stems from the fact that people in the city are not satisfied with the present strength of the Garda and they are driven to this by desperation. I am sure the Minister is not in favour of the vigilante corps, but unless the Minister can satisfy the people that the forces of law and order are adequate to deal with the problems, vigilante organisations might start despite the Minister's or our wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would deprecate any move in that direction.  I am glad that the Deputy agrees with me in that regard.  I appreciate the concern of citizens in certain parts of the city when there is an outbreak of vandalism. If citizens or a residents' association in any such area contacted Garda headquarters they could discuss their problems with the Garda who have the capacity in certain instances if the need is there to give extra attention to particular areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that when the residents' association contacted the Garda station men would be available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the Garda station be contacted. I am suggesting that Garda headquarters be contacted and the Garda public relations office and the matter could then be taken up with the district or division in question to see what assistance could be given to the residents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that frustration and desperation is driving communities to consider <Col N="873" /> vigilantes and these vigilantes would be completely unnecessary if there were enough gardaí on the beat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is concern among citizens, but it is important not to exaggerate the concern or the problem and the House should remember that the Garda force has been increased by over 900 men since 1973 and that the budget has gone from £23 million to £57 million. These are all indications of the Government's earnestness in tackling these problems.  As the Deputy is aware, a further 500 gardaí will be recruited to the force.  We will have to look at the manpower situation as it develops over the next 12 or 18 months and if more men are required I have no doubt that the Government will consider that request favourably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the fact that the Government have done nothing whatsoever to recruit the extra 500 men which the Government decided was necessary last June is a serious reflection on the Government at present with regard to ordinary policing in our cities and towns?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if intending applicants for admission to the Garda Síochána during the past 12 months have been <Col N="874" /> given leaflets at local Garda stations concerning conditions of entry which specify that holders of leaving certificates with passes in Irish and English would be exempt from the entrance examination for admission to the force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard  Mr. Daly Mr. Daly  Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt, Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Leonard</b> asked the Minister for Justice the number of applicants for entrance to the Garda Síochána who have exemption by virtue of the leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>In case of any misunderstanding, may I first of all say that the last recruitment of gardaí&mdash;apart from recruitment of candidates for the Garda Band, or other specialised purposes&mdash; was based on a competition held in May, 1974, the closing date for which was 15th March, 1974.  Holders of the leaving certificate were exempt from that examination but they were nevertheless subject to the requirement that their applications should be in by 15th March, 1974.  All leaving certificate holders who applied before that date and who were qualified as regards age, height, and so on, have since been offered appointment.</P>
      <P>Prospective applicants for admission to the force, whether holding the leaving certificate or not, who applied subsequent to 15th March, 1974, were informed that their applications would be considered whenever the next entrance competition would be announced. Meanwhile they were given information as regards the regulations then in force.  This of course involved no commitment that the regulations would not be changed, as they have been at times in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next competition, due to be held shortly, has not yet been advertised. Nevertheless, already the Garda authorities have on hands applications from over 1,600 persons with the leaving certificate as well as over 1,200 persons without the leaving certificate. It is reasonable to expect that when the competition is advertised there will <Col N="875" /> be a significant further number of applications.  Accordingly, the present regulations must be changed; there is no choice in the matter.  Even if one could disregard altogether the equitable claims of those who have not a leaving certificate it would be essential to apply an equitable and generally acceptable method of placing in order of merit the leaving certificate holders since there may be three or more such applicants for every vacancy.  In practical terms, in present circumstances that means that they must be required to do a competitive examination.  I emphasise that this would be so even if only the leaving certificate holders were to be considered.</P>
    <P>In fact, however, entrance to the Garda Síochána has never been confined to leaving certificate holders and it would be a serious injustice to the many applicants who have looked forward to competing for places in the Garda Síochána, and who have studied with that in view, were they to be denied the opportunity to do so when vacancies are being announced.</P>
    <P>Since a selection process must be applied in relation to leaving certificate holders and also to non-holders of that certificate, the obviously fair system at this stage is that they should all do the same competition which will be conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
    <P>There may be other possible systems, such as one that accorded marks or points for different grades in, say, the leaving certificate but any such system presents its own difficulties and in any event would certainly be open to the charge of being arbitrary and highly unfair if introduced without an announcement being made well in advance.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated in a public statement that the matter will be further studied in the context of future recruitment&mdash;I would stress that I say &ldquo;studied&rdquo; and I am not implying that changes will necessarily be made&mdash;but, for this next competition at all events, I am fully satisfied not only that what is proposed is fair and equitable to all but that it is the only system that can be used at this juncture that would be <Col N="876" /> fair and equitable.  The examination itself will, I am assured, be carefully designed to be a test fair to the general body of candidates and will not, for instance, be geared to particular texts which would give any group an unfair advantage.</P>
    <P>I ought perhaps to emphasise, since some people appear to be unaware of the fact, that provided a candidate is acceptable as far as age, height and so on are concerned, entry will be strictly on merit as ascertained by the Civil Service Commissioners in the examination they will conduct.  Furthermore successful candidates will be called in the order in which they are placed in the examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say when he decided not to allow exemptions in Irish and English to intending applicants who had been successful in these subjects in the leaving certificate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the precise date of the decision but it was arrived at recently.  Matters such as these take the form of internal discussion in the Department between my officials, the Garda authorities, the Civil Service Commissioners and myself but if the Deputy wishes to have the exact date on which the decision was taken, I can ascertain it for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>To say the least, I am surprised that the Minister is not in a position to give us the date on which the decision was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can obtain that information for the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad if the Minister would do that because he must be aware that this decision has an important bearing on the question of recruiting 500 extra men into the force.  The Minister is aware, too, that practically all those 2,800 young men who are interested in joining the force were issued with leaflets which stated specifically that the procedure in the past has been to allow exemptions in Irish and English to those holding the leaving certificate. Naturally, these people understood <Col N="877" /> that this exemption would apply to the current recruiting campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with that question in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say why those people were not told earlier of the changed situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They have now been informed through the medium of the public Press that exemptions will not be given to leaving certificate holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not unfair to those 1,600 men who have been under the impression that because they held the leaving certificate they would be exempt from taking the examination in Irish and English that they find now that they must sit the examination in competition with those who have just left school and who, consequently, would probably have a better chance of success?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree that the changed situation is unfair to those people.  As I said, there are also 1,200 applicants who do not hold a leaving certificate but who have expectations of joining the police force. It would be unfair to those people to exclude them and to accept applications only from leaving certificate holders.  As I indicated already, the examination to be set will be a fair and equitable test for all applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say when the examination will be set, when the competition will take place and when we can hope to see the first batch of these 500 new recruits begin their training in Templemore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should hope that the first batch will be called for training as early as possible next spring.  I cannot say on what date the examination will be held but I understand that it will be early in the new year.  This is a matter for the Civil Service Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been over by now if the commissioners had been given the go-ahead but the Government have done nothing in <Col N="878" /> this direction since the announcement of June last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that this recruitment has not proceeded more speedily.  The Deputy seems to be endeavouring to make the point that there is some lack of desire on the part of the Government to increase the force as announced but as I have indicated the force has increased by 900 during the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that there is an urgent need for the additional 500 men which the Government talked about last June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of Garda recruits that can be accommodated at Templemore Garda Training Centre; the length of the training period; and if, having regard to the time which will elapse before all these recruits are fully qualified for service in the force, he will state the net effect the intake will have on the total strengh, taking normal wastage into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The net effect of the decision to increase the strength of the force will be that 500 extra gardaí will be added to the ranks, that is, 500 over and above what will be needed to offset wastage, and that, accordingly, the strength of the force will be approximately 9,000 as compared with the present strength of approximately 8,500.  About 200 Garda recruits can be accommodated at the Garda Training Centre, Templemore, and the training period is 22 weeks.  Normal wastage will, of course, continue during the period when recruits are being trained and while it is not possible to forecast with accuracy when the force will reach the new strength of just over 9,000, it would appear that it will do so in about 18 months from the time the first batch of recruits begin their training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of people charged, the nature of the offence, <Col N="879" /> the number of people convicted and the sentences rendered under each of the following Acts since 1972 or the date of enactment: Offences Against the State Act, 1939; Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972; Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976; Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act, 1971; Criminal Law Act, 1976; Emergency Powers Act, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1st January, 1972, 462 persons have been charged and 328 persons have been convicted of offences under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939; eight persons have been charged and seven persons convicted of offences under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972; and 175 persons have been charged and 144 persons convicted of offences under the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act, 1971.  There have been no prosecutions under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976 or under the Criminal Law Act, 1976.  No offences were created by the Emergency Powers Act, 1976. Compilation of the other details sought by the Deputy would entail the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the annual number of incidents of bombing, arson, robbery, assault, hijacking or other crimes since 1st January, 1972 which his Department believe are related to terrorist activity; and the number of people charged and the number of people convicted in connection with these crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Crime statistics are not, and in the nature of things cannot be, compiled on a basis which would provide the sort of information sought by the Deputy.  The question of whether a particular crime constitutes, or is related to, terrorist activity involves not only an analysis and assessment of the motives of the perpetrator or perpetrators but also a definition of what in fact is meant by the term &ldquo;terrorist activity&rdquo;.  Even if the difficulties inherent in such an exercise <Col N="880" /> could be overcome and an acceptable assessment made in relation to crimes for which those responsible have been detected, there is no way in which such an assessment could be made in relation to crimes as yet undetected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will initiate legislation to amend the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 (i) to enable women who seek refuge in the battered wives' home in Harcourt Street, Dublin to bring an action in the Dublin Metropolitan District for banning the husband from the family home rather than to have to return to the local court in which the home is situated and (ii) to enable the parties to proceedings under the Act to receive legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first matter, the 1976 Act provides, as one of the choices available, that proceedings may be brought before a district justice assigned to the district where either party ordinarily resides. Ordinary residence is a question of fact&mdash;and may of course include residence with relatives or friends. Whether it would include a stay in the institution mentioned would presumably depend on the facts of the particular case.</P>
      <P>Because of this and apart from other considerations, I do not consider that I would be justified in introducing an amendment of the law that would distinguish between people staying in a particular institution and others.</P>
      <P>As regards legal aid, I refer to my reply of 20th October in which I stated that I consider that it would be inappropriate for me to take any decisions in regard to legal aid in cases such as this in advance of consideration of the report of the Civil Legal Aid Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say when the report from the Civil Legal Aid Committee will become available? He must be aware that in the meantime there is severe hardship in <Col N="881" /> respect of the types of cases mentioned by Deputy Collins in his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say when the report will be available.  The committee are aware of my anxiety to have the report as quickly as possible.  I know they are working extremely hard on this matter and I have no doubt that they will report as soon as they are in a position to do so fully and competently.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is merit in the question as to where proceedings should be taken and I can see the hardship involved in this regard for the people in question but, as I have indicated, the Act provides for proceedings being brought in the district where the party ordinarily resides. That would be a matter for the courts to decide in any particular case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily because there are many other considerations that would have to be taken into account in changing the jurisdiction of the District Court.  This would require some study.  It is not as simple a matter as it might appear.  Because proceedings may be brought in the district in which either party resides I wonder whether there is a big problem here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that a number of medical laboratory technician students who have completed three-year courses at Kevin Street College of Technology, Dublin are being dismissed by the hospitals in which they are employed; and if he will take immediate steps to have the undertakings given to these young persons honoured by having their employment continued in the hospitals concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a number of medical laboratory technician students who have recently completed their training course have ceased to be employed in student posts. No firm commitment to employment as medical laboratory technicians in the hospitals in which they train is given to such students.  I understand that about 24 recently qualified medical laboratory technicians are experiencing difficulty in securing <Col N="883" /> employment.  Twelve posts have been recently advertised, or are about to be advertised, and I am exploring with the health boards and voluntary hospitals the possibility of other posts being filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many of these persons embarked on this career as a result of an AnCO leaflet which indicated to them that when they were qualified, posts would be available in hospitals?  Is it not a fact that students who have pursued diligently and assiduously one of these courses and have qualified are being dismissed in order to make way for other students coming out of the technical colleges and going through the course who have to be accommodated in hospitals for these courses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty in all this, and not necessarily in respect of laboratory technicians, but fewer posts have become available in the last three years since the lifting of the ban on the employment of married women.  While not the sole factor, that has been a factor.  Another factor has been that for many of those who present themselves to the three schools of technology in Dublin, Galway and Cork, it is absolutely impossible to guarantee a permanent position because of the factors I have indicated. I believe there must be some rationalisation or some plan whereby there will be some limitation on those who present themselves to these colleges.  I think the Deputy will agree that there is no point in turning out qualified members of any profession without having regard to the requirements, in this case in respect of medical services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year a total of 69 qualified; 45 have got positions and 12 positions have been or are to be advertised.  Ten have already been advertised, the closing date being some time in the middle of next month.  There is another advertisement for a technician for the Blood Transfusion Service. There is this balance of five and those who qualify this year.  As far as I can ascertain&mdash;and I have made inquiries, there was no commitment&mdash;whether <Col N="884" /> there was a difference between &ldquo;commitment&rdquo; and &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; I do not know&mdash;by the health board hospitals or the voluntary hospitals to take in the students who had completed their course.  I am concerned about the balance of 12 who cannot get employment in any of the hospitals.  In the past week, since the Deputy put down the question, I made inquiries to the health boards and the voluntary hospitals as to whether these technicians can be fitted in in accordance with personnel requirements in these hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for having obviously given the matter some attention but may I direct his attention to two particular aspects of the matter by asking if he is aware that to some extent the difficulty for qualified persons is caused by the fact that there is an agreement in the case of Dublin with Kevin Street, and the hospitals that students undergoing a course of training will be taken into these hospitals to enable them to continue their course and that the intake of students is responsible for qualified students being put out?</P>

      <P>Is it not largely true that the hospitals have an agreement with Kevin Street that they will take in the students and that is responsible for qualified persons who have secured their diplomas being put out?  Further, is the Minister aware that many students who are qualified and who are under notice to go are fully engaged in their work and that their services are needed in the hospitals but because of economy measures they have been laid off?  As I understand the Minister is sympathetic, will he go very fully into the matter and endeavour to ensure that these young <Col N="885" /> people with very high leaving certificate qualifications who go into these careers will not be laid off at this stage?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to previous similar questions in February of this year and December, 1975, there is not a separate fund for pay-related benefits.  In accordance with the provisions of <Col N="888" /> section 5 of the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973, income from pay-related contributions is paid into the social insurance fund.  Pay-related benefits, as are also the costs of their administration, are paid out of that fund and the amount of any surplus on the operation of the pay-related benefits scheme contributes towards the reduction of the overall deficit on the social insurance fund.</P>
      <P>Because of this there is no surplus as such arising from the pay-related benefit scheme, but for the Deputy's information figures for the income and expenditure under the scheme in each year since its inception are set out in a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Each case is taken on its merits and, therefore, there is no such thing as a fixed upper income.  I could help the Deputy by telling him <Col N="892" /> that in years past there have been very great relaxations.  That means that anyone who is near the stage of being in want will get a special allowance.  We disregard in full increases in the various social welfare benefits since January, 1969.  As from 1st October, 1964, the first £60 of military service pensions, disability pensions and Connaught Rangers pensions have been disregarded in the case of applicants under 70 years of age and the first £30 where the applicant has reached 70 years.  The increases granted in such pensions since August, 1965, are also disregarded.  The value of the labour of children under 18 years of age, the first £50 of gifts in cash from brothers or sisters or from children at home are disregarded.  The assessment of the means of children under 18 years of age have been relaxed and all social welfare payments in respect of children are disregarded.  The assessment of the profit from the contributions of members of the family over 18 years of age who are living at home have been relaxed and no profit is assessed on a contribution of £7.70 per week in a rural area or £8.20 per week in an urban area.  That is not really an upper limit, but it is the figure where the income coming into the house is disregarded.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Cronin</b> asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that, as a result of his decision on housing subsidies as communicated to Cork County Council (Northern Committee) by letter of 29th October, 1976, the ratepayers of North Cork will have to pay an additional 39p approximately in the £ PLV; if he will state (i) why he made this decision, (ii) why his decision was not made known before the estimate for North Cork had been agreed by the local committee, and (iii) why the explanatory circular letter did not issue, as stated, within a few days; and if, in view of hardship caused to ratepayers, he will now reconsider his decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from Cork County Council that the rate struck for 1977 in respect of North Cork shows an increase of 99p in the £ over that for 1976 of which 39p is stated to have arisen from the change in housing subsidy arrangements announced on 29th October, 1976, and 60p is due to other reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decision to change the housing subsidy arrangements was made after long and careful consideration of all relevant aspects, including representations made to me urging that greater discretion and responsibility should be given to local authorities in regard to the level of expenditure on the maintenance, improvement and management of their housing estates.  The decision was <Col N="894" /> notified to all housing authorities on the day on which it was made.  Representations subsequently received were also examined fully by the Government who considered, however, that their original decision should stand. Accordingly, the circular letter detailing the revised arrangements was issued on 19th November.</P>
    <P>Before making their decision, the Government had regard to the massive increase in Exchequer housing subsidy&mdash;from £5.8 million in 1972-73 to nearly £30 million in 1976.  For 1977, on the amended basis, the subsidy must still be increased by several million pounds.  Secondly, the Government have given unprecedented relief to local authorities by the transfer of local authority housing and health charges to the Exchequer. If the pre-1973 arrangements for financing these services were still in operation, rates for 1977 in many areas would be over £5 in the £ higher than they will be.  Thirdly, it has proved to be administratively very difficult to ensure that expenditure on the maintenance and management of rented local authority houses would not be allowed to escalate unreasonably, simply because the State was bearing practically all the net cost involved. Several circular letters from my Department have had to be issued in an endeavour to secure reasonable controls.  The response of most local authorities was reasonable and responsible and, in general, the new subsidy arrangements have given rise to little, if any, difficulties in these areas.  Unfortunately, commitments in respect of repairs and maintenance still tended to get out of hand in some other areas and, in the interest of the general body of taxpayers, action had to be taken to deal with this situation.</P>
    <P>It is a rational arrangement that local authorities who are responsible for assessing and collecting rents on their houses should be allowed to use those rents and the major part of the proceeds of sales of their rented houses for the purpose of maintaining and managing their housing estates.  The State will bear the loan charges in full on the provision of <Col N="895" /> these houses and administrative economies, both for the State and the local authorities, should result from the new arrangement.</P>

      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is no.  Unfortunately, the answer given to me by the Department deals with the statistics for local authority houses.  In fact, local authority houses as such are only listed once as new houses.  If sold at a later stage as new or second-hand houses, they are not included for the purpose of making up the number of houses erected during the year.

The priority, even for Kilkenny County Council, might not include the area which the Deputy referred to.  It is No. 3 on the priority list at the moment.

      <P>This is No. 4 on the priority list, and the area in the previous question is No. 3.  There are two large schemes before these, which I assume the Deputy would rather see completed than the smaller schemes.  Some local authorities are making provision for starting small schemes on their own initiative.  Therefore, I would not like to say that they would not be done in the coming year, but if they are depending entirely on State funds, I would say that Kilkenny would deal with the two larger schemes first and the two referred by the Deputy will come after that.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic Acts do not enable me to make the wearing of reflectorised arm bands compulsory <Col N="900" /> for pedestrians and cyclists.  Even if such statutory authority were available to me, I feel that the problem is best dealt with by way of persuasion having regard especially to the enforcement aspects of a statutory requirement. The promotion of the wearing of reflective arm bands by pedestrians and pedal cyclists has represented a major part of the National Road Safety Association's programme since the end of 1974, and in 1975 as a result of the association's efforts approximately 250,000 reflective arm bands were bought and the association say that these are being worn. This year the association have again mounted a considerable promotional campaign in this regard, both through the media and through a variety of organisations.  I expect that the promotion of reflective arm bands as an important safety aid at night will continue. Cyclists are, of course, obliged to have a front and rear light and a rear reflector on their bicycles.</P>

It is estimated that some £50 million, including over £20 million from central funds, will be spent on roads this year, almost double the amount spent in 1972-73.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is over-painting the picture. Because of a variety of different weather conditions there are parts of the road system which suffered deterioration this year and which would not in a year with more normal weather.  For instance, roads across bogs tended to be affected this year because of the prolonged drought.  In other seasons other roads could be damaged because of a considerable amount of ice which, fortunately, we have not had for the last two winters. There is no pattern of overall deterioration.</P>

This year's report was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 22nd November, 1976, will shortly be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities and will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As far as budgetary policy in this country is concerned it says &ldquo;current budgetary policy will have to be restrictive and ensure notably that the net borrowing requirement of the central Government registers a further relative decline in 1977.  This would mean that it should not exceed the figure contemplated in the budgetary outlook for 1976.  This guideline implies a strict limitation in the rate of growth of expenditure, which should be below that of gross domestic product in value, or, should the occasion arise, further fiscal measures&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw attention again to the fact that I agreed to withdraw my amendment to the section because of a promise by the Minister that the necessary steps would be taken immediately after the passing of this Bill to have trustee status conferred on building societies. That statement by the Minister for Local Government was supported by <Col N="915" /> the Minister for Finance, who had just come into the House around that time, and I would be hopeful therefore that in a relatively short space of time after the passing of this Bill the necessary steps will be taken to ensure that trustee status is conferred on building societies in order to ensure a steady inflow of money to the building societies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) does not deal with that.  It is a new requirement on the lines of section 20 of the Central Bank Act.  It is designed in the interest of investors so that they <Col N="917" /> will be aware of the financial state of the society in which they are investing. The contents of the statement required by section 61 will be determined by the registrar and will contain details similar to those in the society's balance sheet.  The cost to the society of implementing this section will not be significant.  That is what is dealt with under subsection (2).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course.  Deputy John O'Leary raised this question.  If someone investing money or saving money in a building society applies for a loan at the same time as someone who is not investing money or saving money, and there is only a limited amount available, naturally the person who is saving or investing would be entitled to priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The question raised by Deputy O'Leary was related to those who had money in the society in one form or another versus those who had no money in the society.  The point here is some people will have their money in the form of shares and some in the form of deposits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I wanted to get clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the vast majority of building societies insist on a person <Col N="918" /> taking out a share even at the time of the allocation of a loan, if the person has not already done so?  That person then has an interest in the society, can turn up at the annual general meeting and vote.  There is a vast difference between shares and deposits.  A shareholder has the right to vote at the annual general meeting but a depositor has not the same right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is missing the point and what he is suggesting would not be very popular.  If a depositor wants to borrow money to build a house naturally that person has established his <i>bona fides</i> with the society, but if someone who has not deposited money with the society wants to borrow and if money is available, as it has been practically all of this year, he will be able to borrow the money. What the Deputy is suggesting is that the person should be asked to take out some shares or to invest money even at the time of withdrawal.  Is it suggested that such a person should borrow £500 from a bank and then borrow the £6,000 or £7,000 necessary from a building society?  That would not make any difference and it would not make him have much more interest in what he was doing.</P>
      <P>The present system is working very well.  If a person wants to borrow money he goes to a society.  If a society had a considerable amount of money to lend, as has been the case, they will give it to the person concerned if they are satisfied with his <i>bona fides.</i> It would be a pity if a person could not borrow money unless he was a depositor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not understand what I said.  I did not make any suggestion, I merely asked a question.  Is it not a fact that the vast majority of building societies ask or even insist that a person who is getting a loan should take out even one share with that society?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>With regard to the matter of shares and deposits, I understand that a person who invests money or who has shares can vote in respect <Col N="919" /> of certain matters in relation to the society while a person who has money on deposit cannot do so.  Neither of them has any rights over the other with regard to obtaining loans.  Why have we a situation where some people are investing in shares and others are simply depositing their money with a society?  I should like the Minister to tell us if there is a fixed ratio so far as the societies are concerned between the number of shares issued and the deposits.  I do not think there is any such ratio but I wonder why we have a situation where we have shares and deposits neither of which confer any advantage over the other but where both persons invest money in the society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <P>No.  The next four sections deal with the arrangements that will apply in the case of a merger of two or more societies or a takeover of one society by another.  In the building society law a merger is described as a union of societies while a take-over of one society by another is described as a transfer of engagements of one society to another.  In all cases the consent of each society is necessary.  Section 25 provides that two or more societies may unite and become one society and it sets out the procedure to be followed.  A union of societies must be approved by a special resolution of the members of each society involved.  There is no limit.</P>

This is the number one guarantee.  Secondly, <Col N="922" /> when he is not satisfied that section 28 has been complied with, that is that a statement of the financial position of the society has not been made available, or where in his opinion confirmation would not be in the public interest or in the interest of the ordinary and proper regulation of building societies' business, he may refuse.

      <P>It does not necessarily follow that that would be so.  The section provides for the following procedure in relation to a proposal to transfer the engagements of one society to another or to undertake to fulfil the engagements of another society.  Their proposal must be approved by a special resolution of each society, so it would have to be in the interest of the society that was making the transfer, and in addition they must either obtain the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the total value of shares in each society or be confirmed by the registrar under section 27.  Here we have a double thing.  Either the registrar agrees or two-thirds of the shareholders who have not less than two-thirds of the value of the shares in the society.</P>
      <P>When the proposal is approved by the members at a meeting and obtains the written consent of two-thirds of the shareholders&mdash;subsections (1) (a) and (b) (i)&mdash;the society undertaking to fulfil the engagements shall notify the registrar, and the registrar shall register the transfer and issue a certificate of registration in a prescribed form.  As in the case of a union of societies under section 25, this procedure is in effect a re-enactment of the 1874 and 1894 Act provisions, except that a special resolution calling for a simple majority is substituted for a three-fourths majority in those Acts.</P>
      <P>Where the proposal is proposed at a meeting and the written consent of two-thirds of the shareholders is not sought, an application may be made to the registrar to confirm the transfer or undertaking in accordance with section 27.  This is in line with section 2 of the 1974 Act.</P>

The proposal in the Bill is that the registrar may require security of such amount as he considers reasonable for payment of the cost of the investigation or meeting.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important section.  I am glad Deputy Faulkner has given me an opportunity of elaborating on it.  This section empowers the registrar in certain circumstances to direct a society to suspend, for a period not exceeding two months, the acceptance of any funds or the making of any payments which have not been authorised by him.  The registrar may exercise this power where a society is being investigated under section 29 or where he is of <Col N="926" /> opinion that abuses are taking place or a society is running into financial difficulties.  The section sets out the procedure to be followed in the issue of such a direction, and various other consequential matters.</P>
      <P>In view of the gravity of the measure, a limit of two months is being placed on the period of operation of such a suspension, but provision is being made in section 33 whereby the registrar may apply to the High Court to have this period extended.  Provision is also being made to enable a society to appeal to the High Court against a direction.  The purpose of the section is to protect both the general public and a society's members where it appears that the society is running into financial difficulties or abuses may be taking place.</P>
      <P>Section 21 of the Central Bank Act confers similar powers on the Central Bank in relation to the issue of a direction as are contained in section 31 (1) and also empowers the bank to seek an order extending the period in which the direction may remain in force.  Similar provisions are contained in the British Building Societies Act, 1962 with the difference that the British Act does not specify a limit of two months, and the direction requires the consent of the Treasury.</P>
      <P>It has been the policy throughout the Bill to give the registrar as much discretion as possible in the exercise of his functions, consequently the approval of the Minister for Local Government to the issue of a direction is not provided for.</P>
      <P>The section also sets out the conditions in which the registrar may give advance notice of the issue of such a direction, requires the publication of notice, and sets out the rights of members, shareholders and depositors and the duty of a society to which a notice has been issued.  How it is done is set out in the various subsections. Does that answer Deputy Faulkner's question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent. The only reason I raised it was that it appeared to me rather strange that, if the registrar considered what he <Col N="927" /> could do in these circumstances would not be prejudicial to the members or to the creditors or to the orderly and proper regulation of building society business, why it should not be &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;will&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of giving the registrar power to decide one way or the other.  We all agree there must be somebody who has the overall control in most of these issues.  This is an issue on which we believe the registrar would have a better idea. We are giving him the right to decide. He will decide whether or not it will be in the best interest of the society to issue the notice.  There could be urgent circumstances in which he would have to do it immediately.  If that were so, to lay down that he must give notice would prohibit him from doing so and might cause the collapse of a society.  If he is doing his job properly, that will not happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would not prohibit him.  It would ensure that he would do it.  The note on the side of the section reads: &ldquo;Power of Registrar to suspend raising of funds, etc.&rdquo;.  Everything in subsection (3) relates to the fact that what he does in these circumstances will not be prejudicial in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

This section empowers the registrar, in certain circumstances, to issue a direction to a society in relation to its advertising. The circumstances in which the registrar may exercise his powers under this section are identical to those in which he can exercise his powers under section 31 to prevent a society from accepting any funds or making any payments.  The purpose of the section is to enable the registrar, on his own initiative, to exercise effective control over the advertising of a society where the society is being investigated under section 29 or where he is of opinion that abuses are taking place or that the society is running into financial difficulties. As in the case of section 31, provision is made in section 33 for an appeal to the High Court against a direction issued under this section.  It is important that this should be written into the Bill so that a society which was in difficulties could not continue to solicit funds through high powered advertising.</P>

      <P>Generally, this section confers powers on the registrar to control the matter and form of advertising or other means of soliciting deposits or subscriptions for shares in the interests of accuracy, fairness and propriety of advertising.  The powers conferred by this section are separate from those contained in section 32. That section enables the registrar to issue a direction to a particular society in the specific circumstances, whereas the powers contained in this section are of a general nature.  Any question regarding expenditure on advertising will come under section 76 dealing with powers to make regulations relating to management of societies.  The section is based on section 57 of the British Act.</P>

      <P>He could say: &ldquo;You cannot do this.&rdquo;  It would be more negative than positive.  In the past societies advertised offering fantastic rates of interest, for instance, which they were not entitled to offer.  When you looked for the small print you discovered it related to something else. That is misleading and the idea is to prevent that sort of thing from happening. It has been known for societies to advertise very high rates of interest to investors without stating <Col N="930" /> in their advertisements that these rates apply only to funds invested for up to two years; advertising that money is &ldquo;withdrawable on demand&rdquo; when, under rules, notice may be required; or advertising appearing to advertise fixed rates of interest when there is no such thing and the rate quoted is that currently paid.  A number of societies did that sort of thing and caused a certain amount of embarrassment.</P>
      <P>I remember one evening seeing in a window an offer of 15 per cent interest. The whole window contained an advertisement for a building society.  There was very big lettering on the top left hand corner showing 15 per cent interest.  I went to the trouble of checking it and I found the 15 per cent interest referred to something entirely different, to another business.  The ordinary person passing by who had a few pounds to invest might be taken in and, having gone into the society's office, might consider it embarrassing to go out again when he found he had been fooled, or he might not discover at all that he had been fooled until the rate of interest came along much later.  The contents is the important thing, to say that they cannot do that sort of thing.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This section is desirable because this is a deception I have seen practised for a considerable time in regard to the lending of money not alone in building societies but in many other financial institutions.  We have seen such notices as: &ldquo;10 per cent payable over two years.&rdquo;  We all know that 10 per cent payable over two years is equivalent to 21 per cent, in effect.  That type of deception should be shown up.  Many people are under the impression that they are getting £200 repayable weekly over two years at 10 per cent, but the real charge is much higher.  As the Minister says, if a society advertises a rate of 15 or 20 per cent for a particular time it may be for £5,000 or £10,000 over two years.  Therefore it is right that this provision should be inserted.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his Second Reading speech, stated that this was not a political Bill and that the objective of discussing it here was to improve the Bill.  I agree fully with that.  I doubt very much if either one side or the other here could race out and expect to get an enormous change of heart in the electorate in relation to this Bill, although it is a very important measure.  However, I hope that the proposals we put forward here will be considered in a nonpolitical light, particularly in relation to sections 37 and 38, where the amendments we have submitted highlight our objections to certain facets of the Bill, facets which we feel will inhibit growth and will ultimately result in less rather than more money being subscribed by the public to the building societies, to the disadvantage of would-be borrowers and to the disadvantage of the construction industry generally.</P>
      <P>This is a particularly important matter at present.  In 1974 there was a considerable fall in the intake of money into the building societies.  It increased considerably over the past couple of years due to external reasons, and in more recent times it has been in difficulties again.  What we want to ensure is that when the Bill becomes an Act it will be such that more money rather than less will be subscribed.</P>
      <P>I found it somewhat disconcerting, in listening to the Minister's Second Reading speech on this Bill, when he said there were particular aspects of the Bill on which he proposed to stand fast even before he knew what amendments we were likely to put down or what arguments we were likely to put forward in support of these amendments. This was an unusual procedure. I would like to stress that our only interest in putting down the amendments we are now discussing is to improve the Bill and to ensure that the building societies will continue to grow apace and to ensure that they will fulfil the objective of housing more and more of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> The figures given by the Minister in his opening statement of the huge increase in income and housing activities of the societies over the years underline, in my view, the great public confidence in them as financial institutions, and it reflects credit on the management and on the direction of the building societies at a time when they worked very largely on their own and when State interference or State control and direction were minimal.  Looking at this record, would it not be reasonable to say that we should continue to keep State interference at a minimum, while at the same time ensuring, through the participation of the Government, that the building societies, now that some of them have become enormous financial institutions, should be so supervised to ensure that both their members and the State as a whole will benefit from their activities?</P>
    <P>One of the main purposes of the Bill is to control the formation of building societies so as to protect the public.  I think it is true to say that all the present building societies accept the need for this and agree that stringent measures should be taken to ensure that control in this field is exercised by the Government to this end.  On the other hand, when we look at the phenomenal growth of the movement here over the years, I think we must accept that, so far as commercial activities are concerned, they have been a success.</P>
    <P>We must concern ourselves with that aspect of the Bill and try to estimate whether extra State interference would be to the advantage of the future growth of the building societies.  Nobody questions the right of the State to ensure that the management of the building societies is above board, that the money is utilised for the important social purpose of housing and that rogue societies are investigated.  But one is entitled to question whether the control to be exercised by the Minister will be to the advantage of building societies and their members and to the realisation of their objectives, which are our objectives. We believe that it will not, and it is <Col N="934" /> for that purpose we have put down our amendment.</P>
    <P>I am not concerning myself with particular complaints, such as interest charges to mortgagees and other controversial matters.  I am concerning myself with the commercial aspect of the Bill and the right of Ministers to interfere excessively in the commercial life of the societies, a pursuit for which neither Ministers nor civil servants are trained.  It is not enough for the Minister to say that Ministers will not be able to involve themselves in the day-to-day business of building societies.  It has already been proved that forced changes in policy can alter the day-to-day administration of the societies without appearing to interfere with them.</P>
    <P>Section 37 provides for the control of ratios by the Minister for Finance. The heading on this section has been changed from &ldquo;Control by the Minister for Finance&rdquo; to the more innocuous &ldquo;Ratios and Investments&rdquo;. The detailed amendments introduced, although welcome, do not remove the detailed control by the Minister and the Department of Finance.  We accept that some form of financial control is necessary in the interests of depositors and borrowers.  We question whether this control should be exercised directly by a Minister of State.  The financial world is notoriously influenced by irrational factors.  We would not like to see building societies' funds being affected by irrational factors, or the irrational fears of the investing public.  In an operation such as this, stability is of prime importance.  There could be some withdrawals of funds from building societies because of fears of action by a Minister for Finance, and that type of withdrawal would not be in anyone's interest.  For this reason we have proposed amendments which would retain public control and remove it from the political arena.</P>
    <P>When we first discussed this Bill we had two ideas in relation to it, both ideas involving a considerable increase in the powers of the registrar.  In one case the financial overseeing of the societies was to be entrusted to the Central Bank, which plays a similar <Col N="935" /> role in relation to other financial institutions.  In the other case we felt that the financial policing should be the duty of the registrar.  The amendments which we have now put forward relate to the latter case.  These amendments grant the power to the registrar of requiring realistic ratios between assets and liabilities, though they do require consultation with the Minister for Finance, which is a reasonable protection.  In this case no regulations are involved.  Therefore the argument in favour of retaining the power of the Minister for that purpose does not hold water.  The amendments reduce the amount of consultation and bureaucracy in the administration. There is no reason for the Minister for Local Government, who is not directly involved with financial matters, or the Central Bank to be consulted because our amendment states that the Minister for Finance should be consulted.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister for Finance from consulting the Central Bank or the Minister for Local Government should he consider it necessary to do so.  In some circumstances the registrar might consider it necessary to consult the Minister for Local Government or the Central Bank, but I do not see why he should be tied to it on every occasion, particularly when he must consult the Minister for Finance.  If we follow the line I am suggesting we will have an opportunity of establishing an executive with the proper power, status and responsibility.</P>
    <P>The text of the Bill involves so much intrusion by Ministers and Departments in executive roles that no initiative is possible.  The formation of building societies must be controlled by the State in the public interest. The commercial aspect of building societies has been well managed in the past.  The fact that they have grown so much in recent years is proof of this.  While fully accepting that the State has the right to see to it that the objectives and so on of the building societies and of the State are carried out in relation to the money collected by the building societies, the commercial activities of the societies <Col N="936" /> should be completely outside the political scene.  The form of my amendments may not be satisfactory from the draftsman's point of view.  However, if we could come to some arrangement under which there would be less possibility of influence on the political side, we would be ensuring in the long term a better flow of money into the societies and in that way serving better the purpose for which the building societies were established.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made a reasonable case unemotionally.  We could make this a much better Bill if we could reach some agreement, particularly on the commercial side of societies' activities, to have appointed a registrar, with sufficient power and well-qualified staff, who would control building societies activities in the administrative and financial spheres. I hope I have made a reasonable case in relation to the development of building societies activities in the point of view.  They have done well and are serving a real purpose.  The Bill, in its entirety, is a worth-while one and serving a real purpose.  But we would be more assured of the future of building societies and of a regular inflow of money to them were investors to be certain that there would be no political intervention in the future.  I am not accusing the present or any Minister of political intervention, but it can happen.  I may have been somewhat lengthy in my comments on the first amendment but I felt it necessary to outline my point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner's arguments were advanced in the Seanad. The reason I said at the beginning of the Second Reading that I was not prepared to change my mind on this was because this matter was very fully discussed in the other House.  Indeed, I would compliment Senators on the detail they went into in making the case Deputy Faulkner has just made. It is a point of view, but one that has to be decided by the House.  I quite agree with Deputy Faulkner; I said it was not a political Bill.  Of course, it is not; but somebody must decide. If we were in agreement on this, as <Col N="937" /> we were on all other matters, then it would be plain-sailing.  But we come to a point where we believe that one set of circumstances is different from others.  In this case we believe that what we propose in the Bill&mdash;following certain changes made at the request of Deputy Faulkner's colleagues in the Seanad&mdash;is the way it should be dealt with.</P>
      <P>The building societies themselves must be protected, but so must investors and borrowers.  It would be very foolish of us to pretend that activities should proceed, that the Government had no interest at all in them and should stay out of them. I do not think that is the way to do it.  For that reason the Bill, which necessitated a tremendous amount of work, was introduced and debated fully in the Seanad.  Most certainly I would not say in this House that I did not propose to accept any amendments had we not had the discussion in the Seanad already.  The Bill has already passed the Seanad, an unusual but not an entirely new procedure.</P>
      <P>As far as the question of security is concerned, I think Deputy Faulkner missed out on one thing.  If we are to give status to the societies, then there is no way in which what Deputy Faulkner suggests could happen.  Possibly he overlooked that fact.</P>
      <P>The seven amendments and two sections are bound up together.  In order to make the case properly I would have to touch on the other amendments and section 38 as well as section 37, so that we might know what we were talking about.  The seven amendments relate to the two sections.  They are important sections whose purpose and intent make explanation necessary in order to appreciate the overall position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 37 deals with liquidity and reserves.  I do not have to stress the importance of adequate liquidity and reserves to an organisation which operates on a technique of borrowing short and lending long.  The purpose of this section is to enable the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government, <Col N="938" /> the registrar and the Central Bank to require a society to maintain a specified ratio between its assets and liabilities.  It is reasonable to expect that any prudent and properly-managed building society would maintain a reasonable level of liquidity and reserves.  However, it is necessary to lay down minimum standards in the interests of the building society movement as a whole, and I consider it only reasonable that the authority for laying down these standards should be the Minister for Finance, who has responsibility for and the information about the financial institutions of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The same principle arises in relation to the two.  Therefore, it is necessary that they be dealt with in this way.  There is one point I should like to make, again not a political one.  Members of the Seanad, when discussing the Bill, referred in a number of cases to what happened under the 1962 Act in Britain.  They asked over and over again: &ldquo;Why can we not do this? &rdquo;.  In this section we are giving a lot more freedom to the societies and the registrar than in Britain.  In Britain they had to refer to the Treasury for practically everything, even any minor move they wished to make.  We are not doing that; we are making it far more flexible. That is a point that should be appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 38 deals with the way in which a society may invest surplus funds.  This is very important.  In this connection &ldquo;surplus funds&rdquo; is a misleading phrase in that such funds are far from being surplus in the sense of not being needed.  They are a society's funds which have not been given out in the form of mortgage loans.  They <Col N="939" /> are essentially liquidity assets it must have available while loan approvals mature and in anticipation of demands for payments or in anticipation of demands for withdrawals by investors. They normally comprise at least 10 per cent to 15 per cent of a society's total assets.  Obviously a society could not afford to keep all such funds in cash in a non-interest bearing manner.  The present position is that societies may invest these funds only in accordance with the provisions of the Building Societies Acts.  Such a situation is considered to be too inhibiting on a society's freedom to invest its surplus funds to the best advantage of its members and to be too inflexible for future use.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 38 is to enable a wider field of investment to be available to societies by giving power to the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and the Central Bank, to prescribe as necessary from time to time the appropriate investments in which a society may invest such funds they do not consider necessary to keep in the form of cash. The section, then, enables the registrar, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Local Government and the Central Bank, to fix the limit of investment in the various prescribed securities.  I take the view that the section, as it stands, is a good example of how the old provisions have been updated.  The section gives the power to the Minister for Finance to prescribe the range of investment.  The registrar has the power to fix the limits of a society's holdings in the different types of prescribed investments.  The prescribing of a range of authorised investments in this way by the Minister for Finance is a logical extension of his powers under the Trustee Acts.  If we are to achieve trustee security status, this seems to be the proper way to have the matter dealt with.  The registrar's day-to-day involvement with the societies gives him the expertise to fix the limits as between the various investments.</P>
    <P>The objective of the amendments before us is effectively to transfer the <Col N="940" /> power under both sections from the Minister for Finance to the registrar and, in addition, to eliminate any statutory requirement for consultation with either the Central Bank or the Minister for Local Government.  I hold strongly to the view&mdash;for the reasons I have given&mdash;that matters of liquidity reserves and disposal of surplus funds are of major importance in the affairs of building societies, requiring the involvement of the top level financial authority in the country, acting on the advice of the experts involved in other financing spheres.  For this reason I consider that the Minister for Finance is the appropriate authority to take decisions in both these sections and his nomination in this respect is in line with the principle on which the Bill is constructed, which gives the policy making functions to the appropriate Ministers while it gives the registrar wide powers of supervision. For these reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already pointed out in relation to commercial activites that the building societies had been successful.  I do not know if a registrar controlling these matters would be acceptable in relation to trustee funds.  The Minister appears to think they would but I have no guarantee.  The societies themselves controlled these two aspects up to now and, except for a couple of unfortunate incidents, they have carried out their functions in a reasonable manner.  Many of the views that I have expressed in relation to section 37 could apply, perhaps, in greater measure to section 38 which gives power to the Minister for Finance to prescribe investments in which a <Col N="941" /> society may hold its surplus funds.  I am not convinced of the ability or the expertise of a Minister or of civil servants to prescribe investments for building societies.  I feel it would be reasonable for somebody looking at this from the outside to assume that the decisions made by the Minister and the Department of Finance could relate more to their own financial problems than to the interests of the societies.  A decision to invest surplus funds in a particular line is basically a commercial decision made by the society based on the society's evaluation of its expected yield, the risk and on when it might need funds for its lending mortgages.  This section limits the freedom of the societies to exercise their commercial judgment. It also opens up the possibility of a Minister for Finance who is having difficulties with filling the national loan taking the easy way out by prescribing that building societies should invest in his particular loan against, perhaps, the better commercial judgment of the societies themselves.  This could be a dangerous clause which could affect the outlook of investors in building societies and that is part of the reason why I have put forward this amendment. If this clause affected the outlook of investors in building societies, it would equally affect the ability of the societies to attract funds particularly if they had to compete with other less restricted institutions.  Our proposal is that the registrar would prescribe investments.  If the registrar had a properly trained staff and had the opportunity of consulting with the Central Bank, the Minister for Finance or anybody else he felt necessary, he would be the appropriate person to prescribe investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worthy of note that compared with the Bill which was originally introduced the Minister has given the registrar a new role in subsection (3) of this section in the fixing of limits for certain types of investments.  If the registrar is judged competent to do this, he should also be regarded as competent to prescribe investments. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this situation.  The Minister mentioned that the reason the new <Col N="942" /> sections were introduced was that certain conditions must be fulfilled if trustee status is to be conferred on building societies.  I believe that a competent registrar assisted by a competent staff would ensure that the ratios were in keeping with what the Government would expect.  The registrar would be much better placed to assist and give advice if necessary or at least to appreciate the problems related to the investment of surplus funds.  There is a danger particularly in relation to section 38 that there is a possibility of political intervention in the sense that a Minister wishing to fill a national loan and not being able to do so might insist on the building societies investing their surplus funds in this not because he felt it was to the advantage of the societies but because of the financial problem which faced him at a given time.  Our main concern here should be that the investors in the building societies will have confidence that there cannot be any intervention in a form which will dilute the value of their investment. People suffer from irrational fears in relation to the investment of money and I am convinced that we must assure the public that there will be no intervention in the commercial aspect of the operations in the sense that there can be in the Bill at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a comment which Deputy Faulkner picked up.  I am afraid I misled the House.  The Deputy asked who controlled the situation at the present time with regard to investment and I said that there was no control because trustee status was not involved.  That is not correct.  At present they can only invest in trustee securities and these are specified by the Minister for Finance so this takes away some of the arguments that Deputy Faulkner has made.  I am sorry for my mistake. In fact, the present position considerably widens the scope for investment and while it is true that the Minister for Finance can decide, the registrar is the person who decides what proportion can be invested in what securities.  The Minister for Finance is the person who must lay <Col N="943" /> down the criteria for trustee status. The present position is that a society may invest funds in trustee securities only when it is ruled so permitted. This situation is considered to inhibit unduly, a society's freedom to invest surplus funds to the best advantage of its members and the purpose of the section is to make a wider field of investment available to the societies and to break away from total dependence on the list of authorised trustee investments.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;surplus funds&rdquo; is somewhat misleading since the funds to which the term refers are not only far from being surplus but constitute one of the critical elements in a building society's financial structure.  Surplus funds are those funds which are held by a society to enable them to meet withdrawal demands, loan payments and other capital commitments.  If a society devoted too high a proportion of their funds to mortgage loans, neglecting to hold on to an adequate level of so-called surplus funds, the stability of the society would be very much in danger in the event of a sudden drop in the level of investment in the society or a high demand for withdrawals, either of which circumstances could be brought about merely by ill-founded rumour.  Comment in this House, too, could result in that sort of situation.  A society obviously could not afford to keep all their surplus funds in a non-interest-bearing manner.  Provision is being made, therefore, to make a range of suitable investments available to societies.  A society's surplus funds normally constitute 10 to 15 per cent of their total assets.</P>

    <P>Subsection (1) provides that the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and the Central Bank, may prescribe the investments in which a society may invest their surplus funds. This provision replaces section 25 of the 1874 Act and section 17 of the 1894 Act which are being repealed. Under those provisions a society, if permitted by their rules, may invest surplus funds in trustee securities.  The range of authorised trustee securities is set out in section 1 of the Trustee <Col N="944" /> (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958 and amending regulations made under that Act by the Minister for Finance. The full list is as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  securities of the Government, including savings certificates;</P>
    <P>(b)  securities guaranteed as to capital and interest by the Minister for Finance;</P>
    <P>(c)  stock of the Bank of Ireland;</P>
    <P>(d)  securities of the Electricity Supply Board;</P>
    <P>(e)  securities of the Agricultural Credit Corporation Limited;</P>
    <P>(f)  securities of Bord na Móna;</P>
    <P>(g)  real securities in the State;</P>
    <P>(h)  securities or mortgages of a county council, the corporation of a county borough, the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire, the Dublin Port and Docks Board, the Cork Harbour Commissioners, the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, and the Waterford Harbour Commissioners;</P>
    <P>(i)  subject to certain conditions, debentures or debenture stock quoted on a stock exchange of any industrial and commercial company registered in the State;</P>
    <P>(j)  Bank of Ireland loan stock;</P>
    <P>(k)  shares of Allied Irish Banks Limited;</P>
    <P>(l)  in an interest bearing deposit account with the Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks Limited, Guinness and Mahon, the Post Office Savings Bank or a trustee savings bank in the State;</P>
    <P>(m)  in British Government securities inscribed or registered in the State.</P>
    <P>The view that co-operative bodies such as building societies, trade unions, industrial and provident societies, should be allowed invest only in trustee securities dates back to the 19th century, a period when it was considered that Government stocks ensured maximum safety and steadiest income.  Ordinary shares were regarded as carrying a considerable degree of risk.  At a time when inflation was not a major factor and when regulation of the stock exchange <Col N="945" /> and investment media was less developed than now, these views were probably well-founded.  The effect of these legal restrictions at present, however, is to inhibit unduly the freedom of building societies to invest their surplus funds to the best advantage of their members.  In periods of rapid inflation and when the gilt-edged markets are under heavy pressure, societies face the risk of capital loss as happened, for example, in 1974.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the subsection is to break away from dependence on the list of trustee authorised investments. The Minister for Finance, who is in close touch with the institutions and the financial markets, is being given power after consultation with the Minister and the Central Bank, which also has considerable expertise in this field, to specify a range of investments suited to the particular needs of building societies.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the registrar can decide on the question of proportion.  There is no element of risk here.  On the contrary, it is a tightening up of the existing situation.  Also, the matter has been discussed with the societies and they have not raised any objections in regard to it.  In fairness to everybody I should point out that a good deal of research has been put into this question.  It would be wrong at this stage to opt for something that would be entirely unproven.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that if a society do not invest their surplus funds in securities they may keep them in cash or in current or deposit account with the Central Bank, a bank licensed by the Central Bank under the Central Bank Act, 1971, the Post Office Savings Bank, a Trustee Savings Bank in the State, the Agricultural Credit Corporation Limited or the Industrial Credit Company Limited.</P>
    <P>This subsection provides an immediate and significant widening of the powers of societies to invest surplus funds to the best advantage. Under existing legislation societies can deposit funds only with an associated bank, the Post Office Savings Bank, a trustee savings bank and one or two <Col N="946" /> other banks operating in the State. The new proposal will enable a society to avail of a much wider range of institutions offering a wide range of deposit facilities at varying maturities and attractive interest rates.</P>
    <P>The right to place funds with the Central Bank will extend to building societies a privilege heretofore only enjoyed by banks.  Its exercise would, of course, be subject to the agreement of the Central Bank, which has approved the making of the provision in the Bill.  The Central Bank provides a wide range of deposit facilities at varying periods of notice. The placing of funds with the bank by societies should help bring them into closer relationship with the Central Bank and this is considered desirable.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that the registrar, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank, may specify limits on the proportion of surplus funds held in various types of investments.</P>
    <P>Under the subsection the registrar would be able to classify investments into various categories and would have the power to specify different limits for different classes of societies.  This would enable him to take account of the different size and financial resources and activities of the various societies.</P>
    <P>It is considered desirable that there should be less supervision of the actual distribution of investments held by societies.  Building societies are now major financial institutions disposing of a substantial volume of funds. Surplus funds are required to meet future commitments and it is important that every possible step be taken to avoid depreciation or loss.  It is also important that they should be readily realisable.  It is necessary therefore that a society should have a suitable spread of investment which would take account of all these requirements. In this connection the report on building societies issued by the National Prices Commission in 1974 showed that building societies in Ireland have tended to invest more in longer-dated securities; the effect of <Col N="947" /> this is to give them a somewhat unbalanced portfolio and increase the risk of loss when the stock markets are under pressure.</P>
    <P>It would be more appropriate that financial institutions like building societies should hold a larger part of their portfolio in short-dated securities and it is the intention that the registrar should use his powers under this section to secure in time a better balance in the societies' investments. This would be done in consultation with the societies and there would be no precipitate action.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that building societies may invest in Central Bank reserve funds provided the bonds are specified by the Minister for Finance under subsection (1) and that the Central Bank consents to such investment.</P>
    <P>Central Bank reserve bonds were instituted under section 48 of the Central Bank Act, 1971.  They are securities which the bank may issue only to licensed banks and the banks may dispose of them only to other banks or to the Central Bank.  The terms of issue including issue price, conditions and rate of interest are determined by the Central Bank.  In general the Central Bank has issued bonds with a maturity of up to three years, which would make them suitable for building societies provided the other terms are satisfactory.  There are a number of bonds on issue to licensed banks at present.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) provides that a society may continue to keep their funds invested as at present even though the 1874 and 1894 legislation is being repealed.  Similar provision is being made in the event of changes in investments authorised under subsection (1) of this section from time to time.  There is a similar provision in the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958 for the benefit of trustee funds.  A provision of this type is necessary as a trustee or a society should not be required to change investments suddenly and thereby risk loss just because particular investments had ceased to be authorised.</P>
    <P>In view of all the circumstances <Col N="948" /> involved I would ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.  We have copperfastened the position so that regardless of which party may be in power there will have to be consultation on these matters between the Ministers for Finance and Local Government, the Central Bank and the registrar.  The registrar is the person who will decide on the amount that may be invested.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Faulkner has said, this Bill has merit but it would be more meritorious if the Minister were to accept the Deputy's amendments.  The Minister has told us that he is copperfastening securities in this legislation but as I see it there is an element of over-kill here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the other way around.  We have widened the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think that there remains at least some of the simple idealism that was present in regard to building societies at the time of their foundation 100 years ago. We must allow for the changes in our society and we have decided certain safeguards are needed and we have them here but I feel that the Central Bank Act, 1971 also has merit and this subsection is very much influenced by that Act.  This, however, is in an entirely different context, the Central Bank being the supreme financial structure of the State dealing with national finances, whereas this Bill deals with certain forms of savings which we hope people will practise. Therefore, we must look at it in a different way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Saying that we copperfasten safeguards here reminds me of a previous section under which the advertising of societies is controlled by the registrar. The Minister does not suggest to the registrar that he should have the Minister for Justice examine all the advertisements being issued by societies to attract funds to see if they are false or misleading or otherwise objectionable. It is left to the good sense of the registrar to decide this.  The Minister might also leave to the registrar in co-operation with the Minister for Finance the task of examining the <Col N="949" /> ratios of the societies.  The fact that building societies have done so much since 1894 under that ancient piece of legislation and were able to become, as the Minister said, major financial institutions at present, and did this without too much State interference, speaks for itself.  It is suggested in subsection (1) that : &ldquo;The Minister for Finance may, after consultation with the Minister, the registrar and the Central Bank require the society to maintainel&rdquo; I believe that this is clumsy State interference.  We should certainly have the Minister and the registrar and we might even substitute the Minister for Finance for the Minister for Local Government to ensure that the Government have some say in the matter but we do not have to drag in the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>We should try to preserve the early idealism which inspired the progress of the building societies.  I believe in private enterprise with certain safeguards. This Bill has any amount of safeguards in it.  I suggest the Bill will be better legislation if the Minister accepts Deputy Faulkner's amendment which is far more in keeping with the spirit of building societies than subsection (1) of section 37.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Faulkner's amendment to sections 37 and 38.  Up to now in this Bill the registrar has been the chief figure but in sections 37 and 38 the Minister for Finance appears to become the chief figure when it comes to the control of ratios between assets and liabilities and prescribing for the investment of surplus funds of building societies.  The registrar will be a most trusted official.  He should have, as the Minister said previously, wide discretionary powers.  He is undertaking substantial duties and responsibilities under this Bill in relation to building societies.  We should go the whole way as far as he is concerned and give him power as regards control of ratios and prescribing where surplus building society funds should be invested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a danger that with sections 37 and 38 as at present worded the registrar may be hindered in initiative <Col N="950" /> in regard to building societies.  In their present form these sections could affect the flow of money to the societies.  There is always a fear among the public about investing money when there is wide discretionary power in the hands of the Minister for Finance as there is in these sections and the public may shy away from the building societies to some extent.  I hope this will not happen but there could be fears that the funds of building societies could be used under these sections for other purposes in an emergency.</P>
    <P>We definitely detract from the role of the registrar and from his functions under these two sections.  It is quite likely that in relation to building societies this Bill will provide the basic legislation into the next century and, as the Minister said, it is a matter for this House to decide what form the Bill should take.  The registrar should be given the key role in sections 37 and 38.  Acceptance of Deputy Faulkner's amendment would certainly strengthen the power of the registrar and also improve the standing of building societies and their ability to attract funds.</P>
    <P>Investment of surplus funds is a very important matter but I believe that a good registrar who is well qualified and has good experience in commercial life could easily decide, in consultation with other people, how these surplus funds should be invested. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent him from investing these surplus funds in the authorised trustee investments listed by the Minister, nothing to prevent him from investing in the very same way as the Minister for Finance could invest after consultation.  Building societies have been successful in this country to date, mainly perhaps, as a result of the experience, commercial knowledge and business acumen of their executive staffs.  There is certainly a difference of opinion between the Minister and this side of the House as regards the role of the Minister for Finance.  The vital role in this section should lie with the registrar and if we give him the powers and functions we are giving him we should go the whole hog and give him the key <Col N="951" /> and vital roles and functions under sections 37 and 38.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on these two sections and the amendments.  I have no doubt of the sincerity of Deputy Faulkner's amendment and his desire to see the position of the registrar strengthened, and I yield to none in my desire to see the registrar being a person who has power, who has ability and who has an adequate and highly trained staff with him to act as watchdogs for the public and indeed to help the building societies if such should be necessary on occasion.</P>
      <P>However, I support the Minister in these two sections because it is impossible to legislate exactly for what may happen far in the future.  As has been said, this is non-political.  I have been connected with this Bill from the early stages and I have felt that one gets down almost to the philosophical or medical reason as to why the registrar should be there and what exactly he should do.  In this case I think that, whilst I have said that I wish to see a powerful and competent registrar in existence, he will be a man&mdash;unless he happens to be a woman&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not consider that until I uttered those words.  Finance and investment are what we are dealing with in these two sections; we are not dealing with legal questions, we are dealing with financial questions.  That person chosen for the job could not and never will have the financial ability which is backing up the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank.  Therefore, the building societies would be put under a very less strong team if the amendment was accepted and the arbiter of the investments of the building societies was just one individual and his staff, no matter how competent, compared with the two Ministers concerned, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government, and the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Governmental interference may not be necessary but in so far as it is <Col N="952" /> necessary, the Minister in this Bill does not make it mandatory on the Minister for Finance to prescribe.  It is permitted; he &ldquo;may prescribe&rdquo;. The Bill does not say he has to prescribe. He may not, in fact, prescribe to the extent that we think he might. When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean those Members of the House at this moment who are nervous of such prescriptions on the part of the Minister for Finance. He may not make them, but if he does he will make them in the full light of day, in consultation with the most skilled people that this country can offer in the realms of finance and of investment of large sums of money and investment of funds which are in the nature of trustee funds. The Minister for Finance and the Central Bank are doing that in the ordinary course of their business all the time.  The registrar will not be.  He may happen to be a very skilled financial person.  Lots of individuals are but still more individuals do not enter into that field.  The week before last when we were on Committee Stage I think I heard the Minister or somebody across the floor of the House say that the registrar would probably be an accountant.  Accountants are skilled financial people but not necessarily skilled financial investors and advisers in exactly that field.  Therefore these functions should be carried out by the two Ministers and the Central Bank in the full light of day with the full backing of the Government.</P>
    <P>If they are going to try to force the building societies into some form of investment which the building societies think they should not invest in, they in that unlikely event could appeal to the House with the full power that this House has to control Ministers and/or the Central Bank on certain occasions.  That is a matter that could become highly political and it simply could not happen except by what used to be called a Russian imperial ukase when the Russian Government said a long time ago, &ldquo;You do it; mind what we say&rdquo;.  That does not and could not happen in a democratic country such as we have here.</P>
    <P>On balance we are going to do <Col N="953" /> better with the Ministers and the Central Bank than we would with the registrar because the registrar would be in behind, sheltered by the anonymity of his office and by the civil service regulations which would make it more difficult to investigate. The Ministers could be answerable in this House if they were felt to be pressurising any building society. The building societies will be in a stronger position if they are advised by the two Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Maybe not so much between Ministers but there may be other people involved.  First, the Departments of Local Government and Finance must agree when the commercial enterprise tries to take decisions, some of which might be short-term and should be reached quickly.</P>
      <P>As the Minister and Deputy Dockrell said, there are many competent people in the Department of Finance, I do not dispute that, but those in the Department of Local Government do not specialise in investments and ratios.  These people are very well qualified in their own field but finance is a different field.  I believe this will slow down the expansion of companies that have done exceedingly well in the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said there is a guideline laid down as regards where they should invest and once they abide by that they have a free field.  I am against the infringement of too many Departments on private enterprise.  I do not <Col N="954" /> disagree with the fact that if trustees status is coming to building societies, certain standards would have to be upheld. I cannot see why we must have two Departments trying to find a common denominator.  Then there is the Central Bank.  They have all the qualifications and experts on investments and ratios and have been operating successfully in the associated banks down through the years.</P>
    <P>I can see reports being issued by the Central Bank which are in conflict with Government policy and taking a stand as regards certain ratios with which Ministers might not agree.  This is the type of problem in which some building societies might find themselves. They will be caught in the middle.</P>
    <P>The registrar should be given powers because he will be a qualified man.  When he is selected he will have all the qualifications necessary to deal with the type of investments the company wish to invest in.  By extending this we are introducing something new with which building societies were not confronted previously. They had guidelines as regards investments but they did not have to take on the Central Bank or the Ministers for Finance and Local Government when carrying out their duties.  This is too much of an infringement on the financial institutions and does not contribute to a flourishing business, or enhance the status of the building societies.</P>
    <P>Of course we must protect investors' money.  There are many insurance companies who have invested millions of pounds of policy money.  They are protected to a certain degree by legislation but this type of restriction was not put on them.  I cannot see why a decision may not be taken by the society without the consent of both the Minister for Local Government and Finance.  This will slow down proceedings. Building societies can be prepared for hundreds of letters to pass between those mentioned here.  The Minister did qualify that by saying that the registrar would be in a position to invest money.  Everybody knows that short-term investments are counted by the day for interest purposes. Surely these companies will not <Col N="955" /> have to get decisions from the Ministers for short-term investments?  I sincerely hope the registrar will be in a position to invest this money in trustee funds.</P>
    <P>I believe we should try to give these companies as much autonomy as possible.  The majority of building societies have proved themselves. There is a section in this Bill which tells how difficult it will be in future to establish a new building society. That is a safeguard on which I congratulated the Minister.  All the safeguards in this Bill are desirable.</P>
    <P>As I say, under this section there will be too much interference by Departments in a private enterprise. We do not want a building society to be another semi-State body which does not take any responsibility.  That does not lead to an expanding business. That is what we are doing by bringing in the Ministers for Finance and Local Government.  In my view this type of regulation does not contribute anything to the Bill.  I would like the Minister to explain why he could not modify that considerably and still be in a position to give building societies trustee status.</P>
    <P>I understood the Minister to say that we needed these regulations before they could qualify for trustee status.  I doubt that.  I often wonder how these investments will go in the future.  Gilt edged may have been all right in the past but there are some insurance companies which have done very well by putting some of their funds into equity.  If profits are to be made in this way the building societies might as well invest there as some of the biggest insurance companies in this city.  I am aware that this is not their line of business but I can see nothing wrong with them buying shares of equity and making capital gains on them if it means that interest rates are reduced.  It is possible that it is illegal for them to do it, but with inflation raging at almost 20 per cent they probably will have a rethink with regard to their outlook and have a look at the other fields insurance companies are operating in.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="956" /> We are concerned to see that building societies are not slowed down in their activities, and this could happen if they must wait for decisions from two Departments.  I agree with Deputy Faulkner's amendment which suggests that the registrar should be given more powers.  The guidelines will be laid down for him and I would rather see him consulting with the Central Bank than with the Departments of Local Government and Finance as to how he should invest money.  We are having too much of Government infringement on private enterprise.  The less of this we have the more businesses will expand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Somehow or other we have turned completely away from the matters under discussion.  Deputy Fitzpatrick talked about the right to invest in equities and this is what we are trying to do, because at present they cannot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This will give them the right to do that.  They cannot do it now.  Is anybody suggesting that if a building society wishes to invest an amount of money they must first go to the Department of Finance, on to the Department of Local Government, then to the Central Bank before going to the registrar?  As I said before, a list will be drawn up and the registrar will decide how much can go into any of the suggested investments on that list.  It is possible that once a year that list will have to be revised, upwards or downwards.  Building Societies may leave the money they have in existing investments even though the investments are not covered by the list.  They have the option to leave their investments as they are.  I cannot understand what has happened to the discussion because it has gone completely off the rails.  Deputy Fitzpatrick seemed to suggest that civil servants would not have the expertise to do certain things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy suggested it.  The registrar will be given a lot of authority and he will decide where the funds will be invested.  The only time the Central Bank, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance would come in to it would be when a list of suggested investments would be drawn up.  I can see no great socialist plot to go in on private enterprise in this.  The money we are talking about is money invested in the main by people with small amounts to invest throughout the country.  Deputy Dockrell, who knows a lot about building societies, confirmed what I said earlier.  The societies see nothing wrong with this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore was not comparing like with like.  He related section 35 controls to those under sections 37 and 38.  Section 35 covers matters of routine day to day administration and is appropriate to control by the registrar. Sections 37 and 38 deal with highly important matters impinging on national housing and financial policies in which Ministers, answerable to the Dáil and Seanad, must concern themselves to the limited extent proposed in the Bill.  We are considering financial institutions which will lend this year about £100 million of the savings of Irish investors and will finance the purchase of about 12,000 houses, new and old.  It could not be accepted that important issues should be subject only to the control of a public official whose decisions cannot be reviewed or influenced by the Dáil or Seanad or by the Minister responsible for these houses, for national financing and housing policies. We have put in this section for the purpose of giving a wider range to the societies, and nobody objects to that.  We have also agreed that there will be a list of investments and we give the registrar the right to decide the amount which can be put in each. What are we arguing about here?  I am sure everybody agrees that there should be somebody other than the registrar to select where the investment should go?  The registrar will decide the amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was fully discussed in the Seanad and most of my explanations <Col N="958" /> were acceptable.  I introduced certain amendments and I do not see why we should have the same thing again.  I am not saying that Deputies have not the right to raise these matters.  Deputy Faulkner faulted me for saying that I would not be prepared to accept amendments.  The reason is that I am sure the way we are doing this is correct.  I am sure the Opposition, when they consider this, will agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that this matter was discussed in the Seanad does not preclude us from discussing it here.  If we feel we can elaborate and clarify our views on this matter, we are entitled to do so.  Deputy Dockrell has a simplistic approach to it.  He thinks that, because the Minister for Finance, with due financial advice, operates the control of ratios between assets and liabilities and the investment of surplus funds, everything will be all right.  That Deputy is aware that, if the Minister was short of funds at any time and made a regulation whereby certain changes to his advantage could be made in relation to financing of projects, that regulation could be discussed here but not changed.  The majority would troop in behind the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This cannot be done. No Minister for Finance will have the right to direct where the funds go. That will be done by the registrar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to return to the point in relation to the control of ratios, the proportion of the liquid assets as against total assets. These liquid assets include Government stocks.  The Government could insist on a higher ratio and demand that the extra money should be invested in their stocks.  This might help the Minister in the short term but it could create considerable problems for building societies.  What the Minister said in relation to our amendments and the sections would pertain irrespective of whether the Ministers were involved or whether the registrar was in charge.  He said the building societies had not objected to this provision. That was a rather negative way of putting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> After Deputy Dockrell spoke the Minister said that his contribution was proof that the societies were satisfied but, so far as I am aware, that is not in accordance with the facts.  The building societies were from the beginning totally opposed to the amount of interference which would result from the Bill.  They were concerned that so many different bodies&mdash; the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Local Government, the registrar, the Central Bank and, through the registrar, I suppose the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;were involved. Understandably that was causing them very considerable concern. I asked initially why all these Ministers and so on needed to be concerned. The Minister said the Minister for Finance lays down the conditions for trustee funds.  I accept that that is true, but I cannot see what difference it would make if the registrar in charge saw to it that the conditions were fulfilled.  I cannot see why all these other Ministers and the Central Bank should be involved.</P>
    <P>We should get back to basics and ask ourselves what is our purpose in regard to this Bill?  What is one of the most important purposes, apart altogether from ensuring that rogue building societies and societies which cannot stand on their own are refused permission to continue in operation? Our purpose ought to be to ensure that the inflow of money is such that we can attain the objective we have, namely, that the societies should play an even greater part in the provision of housing. Money is a very sensitive article and the fact that the Minister can intervene or interfere, even if he does not do so, could result in investments being made which were not as good as the society might believe they should be and this will affect those who are investing and less money will inevitably be invested.  It is very important that we should ensure that there will not be any interference and, irrespective of what the Minister may say, I still believe that the Minister in one way or another will be able to influence to whatever extent he may desire in difficult financial circumstances the investment of the surplus <Col N="960" /> funds.  He will also have too much power in relation to the control of ratios between assets and liabilities.</P>
    <P>We are not trying to score political points.  I do not think that would be possible in regard to this Bill.  What we are trying to do is impress on the Minister that we have very strong feelings in relation to these two sections and we believe it would be wise to take that fact into consideration and try to meet the points we have made.  The amendments we have tabled may not be as perfect as they should be but if we can reach a situation where we can be assured that the registrar will be the person in control of the administration, with considerable control in relation to financial matters, subject to the Minister for Finance, and that there will not even be a suspicion that the Minister for Finance could intervene or interfere as the exigencies of his own situation arose, then we would have a better Bill and a more satisfactory Bill where the building societies are concerned, where we on this side of the House are concerned and, I am sure, on the other side also, and also where those who will be anxious to borrow money to build houses for themselves are concerned.</P>

      <P>Deputy Faulkner is on the wrong argument.  The Minister for Finance cannot dictate where the funds go.  If the Deputy reads the section again he will realise this is so. It is, of course, a matter of opinion. Deputy Faulkner and his colleagues may feel they have the right of it. At the outset I said this is not a political Bill.  This is a matter of opinion and the House must decide. I would be shirking my responsibilities if I said I would amend this because I believe this is the right way to deal with this matter.  I am sorry I cannot meet the wishes of Deputy Faulkner and his colleagues but I believe the right decision has been taken and I must stand over it.  I have gone into this as fully as I can.  I showed I was prepared to improve the Bill, but to do what is suggested would make it not a better Bill but a worse Bill, and so I cannot possibly accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Look at section 38. Subsection (1) provides:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister and the Central Bank, may prescribe the investments in which a society may invest such portion of its funds as are not immediately required by it for the purpose of the society.</P>
      <P>That very clearly specifies that the Minister for Finance, while he consults the others, makes the decision and prescribes the investments in which the society may invest.  This circumscribes the situation.  We would regard the two sections as being the extreme from the Minister's point of view and possibly he would regard the amendments as the extreme from our point of view.  Could we not meet somewhere in the middle and reach a conclusion which, while not entirely satisfactory to both, would be at least satisfactory to some extent?</P>

Subsection (3) provides that the registrar, after consultation with the Minister, the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank, may fix limits in respect of investments in securities or in a specified class or classes of securities and the registrar will be able to classify the investments with regard to different limits for different classes of securities.  Someone must say what the money may be put into and, after consultation, the Minister for Finance specifies what this will be and the registrar then decides what proportion of the money can go into a particular investment.</P>

If the registrar made the decision he would be taking all the action, exactly what Deputy Faulkner is suggesting in his amendment and which I do not think is right.  The section states that after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and the Central Bank the Minister for Finance makes a decision.  The registrar, taking that list, decides where the surplus funds can be invested and the amount that can be invested.  This will not be done in a day.  The declaration may be made once a year or it might not be made for two years.  The Minister will simply update it and that is the only reason for the change.

Furthermore the members may be unaware of the real cost, including tax, of a director's services where a tax free scheme of remuneration applies.  It is new to building societies legislation but it is similar to section 185 of the Companies Act, 1963.

      <P>For the purposes of this section an auditor of a society is deemed to be an officer of the society by definition.  Subsection (1) provides:</P>
      <P>Any provision (whether contained in the rules of a society or in any contract with a society or otherwise) for exempting an officer of a society from, or indemnifying him against, any liability which by virtue of any rule of law would otherwise attach to him in respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust of which he may be guilty in relation to the society shall, subject to subsection (2), be void.</P>
      <P>This is as provided in section 200 of the Companies Act, 1963.  It is the practice in drafting rules for a society to provide for the indemnity of officers or auditors against costs, losses and expenses incurred in the discharge of their duties.  The purpose of the subsection is to ensure that they are not protected in the case of negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust.  If somebody inspected a house and charged the person borrowing the money for a report, this would be a different situation altogether.

Any member may provide a communication relating to the affairs of the society and request the secretary of the society to issue the communication to all members. If the secretary is satisfied that the application is made in good faith, he shall comply with the request.  The secretary may refuse to comply with such a request but must give the member the grounds for such refusal.  The member may then refer the matter to the registrar as a dispute.  Provision is made so that the registrar may, having heard the representations, direct the secretary to comply, subject to such limits or conditions as the registrar thinks fit.</P>
      <P>It will be noted that the purpose of the section is to provide a formal procedure to enable a member to communicate with other members.

    <P>Since building society directors act as the custodians of the savings and deposits of the public, it is only right <Col N="975" /> that existing and potential investors should be able to obtain reasonable particulars of the persons who manage the affairs of the society.</P>
    <P>These provisions, which are new to building society legislation, are based generally on section 195 of the Companies Act, 1963.  The following particulars must be kept: his present surname and forenames and any other former names, and his present residential address.  It will be noted that this section requires not only the current name and address of a director to be included in the register, but any other former names as well.  It is not considered necessary to make exemptions in the case of certain former names as is done in section 195 (12) (d) of the Companies Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that a register under this section shall also contain the following particulars relating to each director: his business occupation, if any; and any other directorships held or bodies corporate incorporated in the State.

      <P>Section 75 (1) prohibits the giving of commission in consideration of or in connection with the introduction of mortgage business to societies.  Does this stand on its own? Is it apart altogether from the rules of <Col N="976" /> the society or does a society provide for such requirements in its rules?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It stands on its own. Section (1) provides that a society shall not give commission in consideration of, or in connection with the introduction of, or an undertaking to introduce, mortgage business.  The purpose of this subsection is to prohibit a society from paying commission to any person, such as a broker, for introducing mortgage business or for undertaking to do so.  In the normal course of events, demand for mortgages exceeds the supply and it is therefore not necessary for a society to pay commission to attract customers for that sector of building society business.</P>
      <P>It is not unusual that somebody would set himself up and that a person looking for money to build a house would go to this person who would introduce him to a society and get a commission for doing so.  That commission does not come from the society.  It comes from the unfortunate person who is buying the house or borrowing the money.  Since he or she could do that simply by going to the society, it is not considered a good idea that somebody should use what could be referred to as his influence to get it for the borrower.</P>

      <P>Section 75 (6) says that an officer, solicitor or surveyor shall not accept any commission and so on.  It would appear to me that the definition of an &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in section 2 does not clearly cover staff.  I am just wondering if a branch manager, for example, would be included in &ldquo;officer&rdquo;.  Could he, for example, receive commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would depend on the facts of his case, whether he was or was not an officer.  It includes a manager or a secretary.  The section prohibits an officer, solicitor or surveyor from accepting commission in connection with the effecting of an insurance policy, including life assurance when the policy is used as additional security for a loan, where the society makes an addition to a loan to enable payment to be made of a premium on <Col N="977" /> the policy, where the policy is taken out to comply with the terms of the mortgage.  This is in line with section 74 (3) of the British Act of 1962.  That Act stipulated that the prohibition applies if the policy was effected through the society or if the society nominated or selected a person by whom the policy is to be issued.  The idea again is to prevent people cashing in on those who are borrowing money, getting money which should not be required.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 46, lines 24 to 29 to delete subsection (1), and substitute as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Minister may, in the interests of the orderly and proper regulation of building society business and having regard to the <Col N="978" /> demand for loans for house purchase, on the recommendation of the Registrar, make regulations in relation to the purposes and amounts of loans by societies.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 77 is, in my view, very controversial, and I think the building societies themselves are concerned about it.  It proposes to give the Minister power to regulate the purposes and amounts of the loans made by societies. Specifically he could regulate the maximum amount of a loan, the purposes for which loans could be made, and the maximum amount which may be lent to a body corporate.  These powers are new.  As far as I could gather, the Minister had intended going somewhat further by regulating the conditions on which loans could be offered.</P>
    <P>I suppose in one sense&mdash;it depends on the way you look at it&mdash;the new powers could be looked on as a back door to nationalisation; in another sense they could be regarded as a necessary response to abuses which have crept into the operations of building societies in recent years.  I would like to emphasise that we deplore as much as the Minister or anyone else the granting of loans on business premises, of loans to companies or, in fact, of any loan which does not help to house a family.  We also have sympathy with the view that the resources of societies could be spread a bit wider by giving more loans for smaller houses.</P>
    <P>However, we have learned, and I think the Minister has also learned, of the pitfalls of endeavouring to regulate loans too closely.  When the Minister, because of the power given to him over the societies for the granting of the subsidy, regulated closely the amounts and the types of loan, at one stage, a completely false housing market was created, where the demand for secondhand house collapsed and this had a severely damaging effect on the market for new houses, because many prospective buyers could not sell the houses in which they were living.</P>
    <P>I think this was a mistake and that it is now recognised as a serious blunder which had a detrimental effect <Col N="979" /> on the building industry.  The interference referred to earlier was not in the best interests of the societies, the investors and the buyers, although a small number did benefit.  To avoid the risk of a recurrence of such decisions this section should be amended by placing the initiative with the registrar who will not be motivated by short-term political considerations. During the passage of the Bill through the Seanad the Minister conceded something similar.  We did not oppose section 76 because of the Minister's concession.  I would ask the Minister to consider the amendment which reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, in the interests of the orderly and proper regulation of building society business and having regard to the demand for loans for house purchase, on the recommendation of the Registrar, make regulations in relation to the purposes and amounts of loans by societies.</P>
    <P>The amendment was specifically framed to overcome the objections to amendments in the Seanad in that only the Minister can make regulations. We would prefer to have the regulations made by the Minister so that they could be discussed in the House.  It is very important that it should be seen that the Minister cannot interfere in the manner in which he could interfere under the Bill as it stands and that the registrar should make recommendations and the Minister make the necessary regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment proposed by Deputy Faulkner would be to delete all reference to the Minister for Finance and to secure that any regulations under the section were made &ldquo;on the recommendation of&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;after consultation with&rdquo;, the registrar.  The amendment would also seem to imply that these regulations would be a more common feature of building society business than I had in mind.  It is fair to say that in drafting the amendments Deputy Faulkner took a look at section 76 where he found that regulations under that section would be <Col N="980" /> made &ldquo;on the recommendation of the registrar&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is a simple matter to justify the position of the registrar in section 76 because that section deals with the administration of the societies themselves and it is the registrar's function to oversee these matters.  Section 77 is a different matter, where we are concerned with the availability of funds for the housing programme. The section has been drafted in a very deliberate way so as to give due weight to the authorities that are involved. The Minister for Local Government is empowered to make regulations with the consent of the Minister for Finance and after consulting the registrar regarding the amounts and purposes of loans.  I should say here that I do not envisage a permanent requirement for regulations of this nature.  They would only be made in the circumstances outlined at the commencement of subsection (1)&mdash;when the Minister considered it expedient and when the interests of the orderly and proper regulation of building society business and the demand for loans warranted it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner referred to the period when interference by the Minister for Local Government dried up the secondhand house market.  If Deputy Faulkner was as close to it as I was at the time he would realise that it was necessary action.  When it became possible to change the regulation it was done with very good effect.  If the situation had continued, the money being given to the societies for house building would have wound up financing houses for those who were not as badly in need as those who actually benefited.  The Minister for Local Government is the Minister charged with responsibility for the housing programme and in discharging that responsibility he has to have regard to its financial implications and to the contributions which will be required from the various financial sources if the programme is to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is involved since he is the person with responsibility for the provision of State funds for all services including <Col N="981" /> housing.  As regards the registrar, he will be in close touch with the societies and will have readily available to him a steady flow of information on the affairs of the societies.  He will know, for instance, the pattern of the societies' lending programmes, the level of inflow to societies, the extent of the demand for loans, the extent to which they make loans for new or previously occupied houses, the percentage of the purchase price which the average loan represents and other information relevant to the consideration of whether it would be expedient to consider the making of such regulations at any time.  To adopt Deputy Faulkner's amendment would require the registrar to be an expert not only on building society affairs but on the overall housing programme and its financing.  We have heard a great deal about the need for a strong and independent registrar and I am fully in agreement with that, but to burden him with responsibility for the housing programme as a whole is going too far.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputy Faulkner to withdraw his amendment.  The type of regulations to be made under this section might include regulations to ensure that a society did not, for instance, have a high proportion of their mortgage assets tied up in a small number of large loans or devote an unduly high proportion of funds to business lending.  The intention is to ensure that commercial lending policies are not adopted by societies but that due regard is had to the demand for home loans of moderate amounts.</P>
    <P>During Committee Stage debate in the Seanad I stated that the societies have in the main been very conscious of their social responsibilities in regard to the amounts and purposes of loans, and I stand by that statement.  The present Bill is intended to last a long time and to cater for almost any foreseeable circumstances.  I feel that justice would not be done to this comprehensive legislative measure if the provisions of this section were not included.  I am strengthened in this conviction by the inclusion in the British Building Societies Act of 1962 of the very elaborate provisions relating <Col N="982" /> to special advances.  Those provisions were intended to limit the making of large loans and the making of loans to bodies corporate to within 10 per cent of a society's total lending. Although the method adopted in the British Act has come in for some criticism, the purpose of the provisions is obvious.</P>
    <P>Prior to March, 1973 no controls were exercised over the lending policy of building societies in this country. As from 23rd March, 1973, controls have been exercised administratively in conjunction with the operation of the composite tax arrangement and the payments between May, 1973 and February, 1976 of the special subsidy on shares and deposits.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner said that the building societies were very much opposed to this.  We have no evidence that that is so.  We have been in close contact with the building societies during the preparation of this Bill.  The Bill was not drafted for the purpose of pleasing building societies.  We want to ensure that the building societies will be able to work within the regulations. To be fair to them the building societies are now doing a good job in regard to providing money.  Up to £100 million will be provided this year. To say that the building societies would not be pleased with a particular section is no argument for deleting that section.  On reflection, Deputy Faulkner will agree with this.</P>

      <P>I could not accept the reasons given by the Minister for the manner in which he interfered with the provision of loans.

      <P>The Minister said he could not unload the whole responsibility for the housing programme on to the registrar.  That is not what is intended here at all.  The Minister said that if he were to do so it might happen that all the money would be poured into a few very large houses.  I would take it that the registrar appointed would be a fully qualified and intelligent person, one who would recognise the function of the building society, that its business was to get in as much money as possible in order to loan it to people for the building of houses.  I have no doubt but that he would perform that function.  He would know what were the objectives of the building societies and would ensure that the money was expended in the manner one would expect.  I want to underline the fact that there was interference by the Minister and, as the Bill stands, he can do it again.  Perhaps, for the purpose of housing statistics, he might feel it more important to have a number of houses built rather than ensuring a steady flow of house building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get away from the political aspect of it, I put forward this amendment for the same reasons as those put forward in relation to sections 37 and 38, that is, to have as little State interference as possible.  We recognise the need for control.  We recognise the right <Col N="984" /> of the State to control to a considerable extent the activities of building societies. But we felt it was overdone in this Bill, that the Bill would be much more effective&mdash;one in which the public would have much more confidence&mdash; were there to be less control exercised by various Ministers.  We would not have tabled the amendment had we not thought it would make the operation of the Bill more effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner and his colleagues have been quite reasonable in their approach to this Bill so far. But I am quite sure he will agree with me that we could not allow a situation to recur which did obtain when I first took an interest in these matters officially, when there was at least one building society lending more money for the purpose of purchasing land, hotels and pubs than for house building. Nobody would suggest that this should be the situation.  Although it is most unlikely that anything like that would happen again&mdash;certainly I am sure present building societies would not become involved&mdash;they, like myself, will not be there forever.  I believe it necessary that we have this type of control, that we have it in this way and that it will be administered in a reasonable manner.  We would not be doing our duty if we allowed a loophole in the Bill which permitted that type of thing to recur.  There is no question at all that the registrar will not be consulted. But the registrar will not be somebody sitting, waiting day and night to advise building societies on every facet of their business.  There will have to be some means devised by which a general policy will be handed out, that will operate in the normal way and I believe that the section as drafted, does that.  The amendment suggested by Deputy Faulkner would weaken the section and it would be a mistake if it were accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Deputy Faulkner's amendment rather than weakening the section would strengthen it.  I believe building societies have a very important role to play in the housing drive.  I agree with the Minister that these regulations are necessary to ensure that <Col N="985" /> they do so.  We do not want to weaken the Bill in any way.</P>
      <P>If one looks at amendment No. 23, to section 78, one will see that it would tie building societies down to giving loans only on residential property.  I believe that Deputy Faulkner's amendment would achieve what the man in the street wants to see done&mdash;designate the type of loan, the amount, and ensure that every possible penny is loaned for house building only.  Certainly we would never advocate loans being given for the building of hotels, publichouses, supermarkets and so on.  We want building societies to play the role intended for them, that is, to help in the housing drive.  Deputy Faulkner prepared his amendments after long consultation and study of the deliberations in the Seanad.  The Minister has said that we have been very reasonable. I suggest that the Minister might take another look at this if not now then overnight.  I know the Minister will contend that he did so in the Seanad but the Bill would be strengthened in its passage through this House by the inclusion of these amendments and prospective householders' interests also would be better safeguarded.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that our whole purpose for being here is to push the housing drive.  Therefore, we cannot miss an opportunity on any Bill of ensuring that every possible penny goes into housing.  I assure the Minister of the sincerity of this side of the House in relation to these amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>I am anxious to be co-operative about this, but, before the Bill ever saw the light of day, there was a great deal of work and research put into it, and discussions were held with various people involved in building societies, with the whole provision of housing and so on.  Then, in the Seanad, we had a very useful debate, on which I have already complimented Senators.  Nothing new has been introduced here this evening. Since that is so it would be a mistake for me&mdash;having told Senators I could not accept their amendments&mdash;to decide now that I could accept an <Col N="986" /> almost similar change to that suggested by them.  I am not being unreasonable but I believe that the section, as it stands, is a better one than if Deputy Faulkner's amendment was accepted.</P>

      <P>In page 46, after line 56, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) A society may make loans only on residential property.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think this is an amendment with which anybody could disagree.  It sums up our total commitment on this Bill, that of seeking to provide more dwellings.  Despite what the Minister said about having built so many houses in the past few years&mdash; and I have always felt we should take housing out of politics&mdash;here is an opportunity for this House to endorse the wishes of most of our citizens who are interested in housing.  We could ensure that the building societies will direct their considerable assets on to the housing drive and this would supplement to a great degree the great part being played by local authorities and housing agencies.  This would surely strengthen the Bill and would be a very popular amendment. Despite the many houses that have been built over the years, we are still very short of houses and the private sector which accounts for most of the building needs every incentive that can be given and every penny we can spare.  To invest in housing not alone brings financial reward but it brings satisfaction to a person when he knows that he is making his money do the most good.  I can see no objection <Col N="987" /> to this amendment.  I strongly recommend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in opposing the previous amendment stated that one of the problems was that one building society had issued loans for various things apart from housing and, therefore, if the Minister is anxious to tie up that situation this amendment offers the opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that the last section having been passed there is no necessity for this.  Another objection to this amendment is that at the present time as Deputy Moore said, and for some considerable time to come, we have a situation where all the money that can be provided from building societies will be necessary for house building but we could reach a stage before the end of the life of this Bill when more money would be available than would be necessary.  The last Building Societies Bill lasted nearly 100 years so within the next 100 years who knows what is likely to happen?  Deputy Faulkner's amendment would mean that in the event of such a thing happening no money would be spent on anything except as the amendment says &ldquo;a society may make loans only on residential property&rdquo;.  Under the previous section the regulation will be made that that is what must be done. We would be right to say that in 30, 40 or 50 years' time if there was a surplus of money in building societies which was not required for housing they should have to hold on to the money, that they could not spend it or loan it on anything else except residential property.  I would ask Deputy Faulkner to look at that aspect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot imagine a situation in future where we may have too much money for houses.  The fact is that the Minister wanted to refuse the previous amendment on the basis that it might be used for purposes other than the purpose of residential property and now the Minister is changing foot by not accepting this amendment.  Having listened to the Minister's argument, I must say I am not thoroughly convinced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This section states:</P>
      <P>A loan made by a society shall not exceed the valuation in accordance with section 79 on the freehold or leasehold estate offered as security for the loan.</P>
      <P>I understand that it has happened in Britain that people who had good salaries but had no capital were given a grant which was higher than that but I do not know whether I can make a very strong argument on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) provides that a loan made by a society shall not exceed the valuation of the property on the security of which the loan is made.  Subsection (2) provides that, in determining the amount of a loan, a society may take into account the value of any additional security other than freehold or leasehold estate offered in respect of the loan.  This is a re-enactment of section 3 of the Building Societies Act, 1942.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) empowers the registrar to issue a direction in relation to the classes of additional security, other than freehold or leasehold estate which may be taken into account by a society in determining the amount of a loan, and to direct the conditions or arrangements which shall apply to the taking into account of a specified class or classes of additional security. Existing law does not lay down any requirements regarding the classes of security that may be taken as additional security.  In the British Building Societies Act, 1962, the permitted classes of additional security are set out in the Third and Fourth Schedules to the Act.  Powers are conferred on the chief registrar in section 26 (5) of that Act to extend or vary the classes of additional security.  The proposal in the subsection is more simple and flexible and is so worded that it can take account of the types of security and arrangements that are within the <Col N="989" /> ambit of the British Act.  That meets Deputy Faulkner's point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most important functions in the management of a building society is the assessment of the adequacy of the security offered for a loan.  The purpose of this section is to ensure that satisfactory arrangements exist for the valuation and assessment of the security being offered for a loan and that such a valuation and assessment is carried out in an impartial manner.  This section will place a responsibility on every director to satisfy himself as to these arrangements.</P>
      <P>There are two distinct elements involved in the arrangements: firstly, a written valuation report on the property involved must be prepared by a person who is not an officer of the society and, secondly, the assessment of the adequacy of the security must be carried out by an officer or officers of the society, by reference, <i>inter alia,</i> to the written valuation report.  A valuation report prepared by a person who has a financial interest in the disposal of the estate may not be accepted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore asked about this earlier and Section 79 is where it comes in.  Existing legislation is silent on the detailed arrangements to be made in connection with assessment of the adequacy of security taken by a society and of the persons who may report on the value of such security.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that the tourist industry is failing to make an adequate contribution to the national economy, due to the failure of the Government with regard to prices, its introduction of penal taxation and its failure to give guidance and adequate support to the industry.</P>
      <P>The end of the tourist season is the appropriate time to discuss the tourist industry.  We will have an opportunity to examine our successes or failures and prepare ourselves for the next season.  After last year's budget we on this side of the House feared the effects that the increases in the price of petrol, drink, tobacco and tea imposed by the budget would have on the tourist industry.  Our fears were justified and following the budget we tabled a Private Members' motion at that time, that the House deplored the actions of the Government which had reduced the competitiveness of the tourist industry and we recommended that subventions necessary to restore competitiveness be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that occasion some speakers claimed that there was an upsurge in the tourist market and predicted an increase in tourist numbers for 1976. It was stated then, also, that bookings in April, 1976, were at a much higher level than was the case for the same period in the previous year.  However, an examination of the Bord Fáilte monthly tourist statistics for August, 1976, discloses that the number of tourists from Britain was 47,000 fewer than in the previous year or 88,000 fewer than the target of 858,000.  The actual number was 817,000.  An increase of this nature in itself should be sufficient to cause a good deal of concern to those involved in the promotion of tourism.  The same statistics show that there was a marginal increase in the number of tourists coming from North America. The increase was from 256,000 to 269,000 or, approximately, 5 per cent. So far as Continental tourists were concerned there was an increase this <Col N="991" /> year of about 11 per cent&mdash;from 188,000 last year to 207,000 this year. There was no change in the numbers coming from Northern Ireland or the number of day trippers to this country.  But we must take a very serious view of the fall-off in actual numbers and of the failure to reach targets or, indeed, to be anywhere near the targets set.</P>
    <P>I notice from the Order Paper that the Government have tabled a motion counter to the one I have put down. In this they claim to have put tourism on a better footing than was the case before they assumed power almost four years ago.  It is difficult to imagine anyone involved in the tourist industry being prepared to accept the Government's claim in this regard.  On the contrary, those in the industry consider themselves to have been abandoned by the Government.  There is no foundation for the Government's claim to have improved this industry. Rather, their performance in this sphere can be likened to the case of a man, having had too much to drink and setting off for home in his horse-drawn cart.  The reins fall on the road but everything will be all right provided the horse knows the way home.</P>
    <P>There is no control by the Government in regard to the direction in which the tourist industry is going. They are to be blamed for not influencing in any way the rate of progress in the industry.  The fact that the industry is not in even more serious difficulties is a tribute to the imagination, the dedication and the ability of those involved both in the public and the private sectors of the industry.  However, the morale of those people is low now.  They have not been receiving any guidance.</P>
    <P>In regard to improving the situation the Government should consider it a priority to designate the tourist industry as a service industry.  Tourism is an export industry.  It contains all the benefits for the economy that any other export industry contains but has the advantage of not requiring the importation of vast quantities of costly raw materials.  By any reasonable <Col N="992" /> test, tourism is an export industry but it is not credited as such in regard to matters of taxation.  It is only fair and just that it be given this classification which would go a long way towards off-setting the ill-effects of the Government's tax measures which are proving so detrimental to the industry and to all those employed in it.  There is no valid reason for refusing to comply with the request for this classification of the industry apart from the consideration that the Minister for Finance might not be able to hive off as much from the industry during the next few years as has been the case up to now.  However, I am of the opinion that the expansion that would result from a designation on the lines I have suggested would prove of real benefit to the Exchequer in the long term.</P>
    <P>One can only come to the conclusion that the Government's actions in relation to tourism are based on the policy of expediency.  The Minister for Finance is making desperate efforts to grab money from any source even if his policies will prove in the long term to have ill effects for all of us, to grab some more money in taxes to help them out of a situation which, to a great extent, was created by themselves. As far as tourism is concerned it is a case of the Government killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.</P>
    <P>I should be very interested to hear in the Minister's reply what are his proposals for the industry following the year that has passed.  He should certainly look at the employment potential of the industry because earnings from tourism filter through our economy in a dramatic way.  They have a multiplier effect and have widespread benefits.  It has been said on good authority that 10 per cent of banking and insurance business here results from tourism and about 20,000 jobs in the wholesale and retail trade; that it gives about 4,000 jobs in the entertainment field; 7,000 jobs in the textile industry and about 2,000 jobs in the drink and tobacco industry.  Viewed from the agricultural side&mdash;and at the present time it would be well if we could use more of our agricultural production&mdash;I have seen figures given in respect of usage of <Col N="993" /> agricultural produce by the tourist industry and it was estimated that it absorbs about 2.5 million gallons of milk per year, 36 million eggs, 2,000 tons of butter, 6,000 tons of meat and 15,000 tons of vegetables.</P>
    <P>When one examines those figures, especially those for meat and milk, in the light of our present situation and in the light of the earnings of tourism and the form of revenue it brings in, one realises that support for the tourist industry means, first and foremost, jobs, not only jobs available on a large scale in the tourist industry and related industries, but also filtering down through the whole economy. The fact that up to the present 112 hotels have been sold since 1973 has resulted in a loss of about 3,500 bedrooms, about 15 per cent of the total available.  It is estimated that there is a direct loss of about 2,500 jobs.  This is only in one section of the tourist industry.  Pronouncements made last week at a seminar are worth repeating: it was stated that for every 15 extra American or 37 extra British tourists persuaded to visit Ireland, one new full-time job is created.</P>
    <P>If the tourist industry achieves the target set for 1977, it was claimed that approximately 3,500 additional jobs would be created.  This is why we must make every effort to hit the target. If we had fulfilled the projection for 1976, the industry would not be in its present situation.  These reasons alone, ignoring the help to our balance of payments given by such earnings, make it vital that some positive action be taken to help tourism. No other sector of the economy I think is as capable of creating jobs in such numbers and with such speed.  It has been said that at present tourism generates about 110,000 jobs.  I think, if given Government backing to meet the target and accelerated growth, it could generate as many more jobs in the next 10 years.  That is why I think it is so important to assist the industry at present.</P>
    <P>A number of positive proposals have been repeatedly submitted by members of the tourist industry to alleviate their present problems.  Of these one was duty-free facilities between <Col N="994" /> Britain and Ireland; another was a proposal which we have continuously urged since the last budget and it is the granting of petrol concessions for tourists by way of voucher at the point of entry.  Had this been introduced when first suggested, certainly we would not have had the fall-off in British tourists that we had in the past year.  It was also proposed that there should be export tax relief for certain sections of the tourist industry and it was suggested that a tourist credit corporation be set up to aid the industry to raise capital at favourable rates at a time of vanishing profits.  It was suggested that special attention be given to transportation and that a national selling agency should be formed. Those suggestions merit careful attention.</P>
    <P>I think there should be careful definition of the national interest, the tourist interest and the airline interest in regard to scheduled and chartered flights.  The current constraint on Aer Lingus to show a profit might not be in the national interest.  In their efforts to minimise losses they may be forced by the Minister into a situation where they come dangerously close to inhibiting rather than aiding the influx of tourists.  At present their aim seems to be to create profits while I think it should be geared to generating the maximum number of tourists for this country.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has been much discussed and which requires urgent and serious consideration is the concept of a national tourism selling agency.  Such an agency would involve not only the public sector but also the private sector and it probably would be the perfect vehicle for the co-ordinated market of Ireland as a tourist centre.  I notice that in the papers the Minister is quoted as saying in regard to the Cork Harbour development plan that there would have to be central co-ordination so that the best national use could be made of available port resources and available finance.  I would ask him if he would use the same argument to sustain a proposal for a national <Col N="995" /> tourism selling agency for the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Once again it could be said that any aid given to an industry which enables it to increase the numbers coming into the country would automatically increase the number of new jobs available.  The jobs, it should be noted, would not be jobs in the tourist industry alone but also in all facets of the economy, in the services, in food, in entertainment, and all of those would be required by the tourist organisers.  As everyone knows, at present jobs for our people are desperately needed and the tourist industry has the potential to make many jobs available.</P>
    <P>The two best-known benefits of tourism are foreign earnings and employment.  Our share of the total export earnings has declined somewhat over the last few years in real terms, but tourism is still a major earner of foreign exchange and last year we earned around £160 million or 10 per cent of the total current account earnings.  About half of this was in sterling, and with our record of public borrowing abroad and a widening balance of payments deficit it is very obvious that tourism has a renewed and increased significance in this field.</P>
    <P>Many export industries require a high level of imports in order to manufacture their export products. This is particularly true of some intensive industries such as the chemical industry.  Also, many of those industries are wholly or partly foreign-owned so that the profits to non-resident parent companies represent a further outflow of overseas earnings.  Tourism has a very low level of import requirements, estimated at something in the region of 9 per cent, and also has predominance of Irish ownership and control.  This is not surprising, because, after all, we are selling Irish goods and services and their Irishness is a large part of their attraction.  We also have sufficient expertise and sufficient plant in the tourist business and we have seemingly the know-how.  What remains is to attract those additional people to make use of all that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> There are other ways in which tourism contributes to the national economy.  For instance, for every £1 spent in Ireland by a foreign tourist it is estimated that 68p is generated as Exchequer revenue.  Last week it was stated that the State earned over £85 million from foreign tourists last year. This multiple return of investment certainly should fully justify State expenditure on tourism.  Tourism also plays a major role in the field of regional economic imbalance, and when we link those strands together we have one irrefutable fact and that is that despite the present setbacks that tourism has faced, it is still a major force for economic growth.  The total foreign and domestic tourism expenditure contributed 6½ per cent of last year's GNP; 4½ per cent of this from foreign tourism.  If we take the multiplier effect of tourism it would be responsible for about 2¼ per cent of the GNP and if we have a 10 per cent increase in real tourism earnings it would generate a large increase on that.  It might not seem a great deal but if we consider that the GNP increased by only 19 per cent between 1968 and 1975 and that it is forecast to increase at best by about 4 per cent this year&mdash;it fell by something like 4 per cent between 1974 and 1975&mdash;we can appreciate the potential of tourism.  That is the way we should view it.</P>
    <P>Selling tourism is a highly competitive field of endeavour and the methods employed to sell tourism with decent facilities are important.  The selling of tourism is very costly and we should ensure that the money invested in its promotion would yield the best possible result to the largest number of people possible.  While more money is needed we should have a look at the present structure, at the present agencies involved in the selling of tourism.  At present it is sold by semi-State and private interests.  It would be good if we could say that those individual interests have worked well to yield the greatest result to the economy.  Unfortunately, that has not always been the case.  A certain conflict arises between State, semi-State and private interests, and there is no doubt that the national interest suffers <Col N="997" /> as a result of that.  We have the National Tourism Council and they, I think, have not yielded the return that had been hoped for.  That to a great extent is a conflict of interests.  A serious examination of the functions of the various State and semi-State agencies and their association with private interests must be undertaken and a working formula devised because we cannot permit conflict to harm the development of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>A major example of this conflict has been the question of charter flights. When we discussed this last it was suggested that the Northern troubles posed the greatest threat to tourism. One of our Ministers, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, recently spoke rather unwisely when he said that there were murderous gangs infesting our island.  The Government were using the Northern troubles, world economic conditions and decisions in Brussels as an excuse.  The Northern troubles have been used continuously as an excuse for lack of progress in the tourist industry.  Many of our visitors from Britain are well acquainted with conditions here and clearly understand that the troubles are limited to the north-eastern part of the country.  I do not believe those troubles are creating the problems they did a few years ago.  This view was reinforced by a statement last week by the deputy director general of the British Tourist Authority when he spoke at the National Tourism Council seminar in Cork.  He gave it as his opinion that Ireland was losing British tourists because a holiday here was becoming very expensive, rather than because of the troubles in the North.  He went on to give as an example the fact that a British holidaymaker could have a two weeks' holiday in Spain for £65. How far would that go in one of our seaside resorts?</P>
    <P>Because of the high cost of promoting tourism it is wasteful to have a multiplicity of promotion campaigns in various countries.  Co-operation in promoting tourism is more effective and economical than a series of individual efforts.  Even with a rationalisation of the functions of various State <Col N="998" /> and semi-State agencies and the maximum amount of co-operative effort within the private sector, we would still not have achieved the ideal structure for selling tourism.  In this highly competitive and costly business, our best hope would be a national selling agency to embrace all those interests. Such an agency would be the ideal vehicle to market Ireland as a tourist centre.  At present when nations must join together in larger groups, such as the EEC, to be effective, the combining of all functions in one agency makes good sense.  Because of the conflict of interests mentioned, the setting up of a national tourist agency would require leadership by the industry and firm backing by the Government.</P>
    <P>I raised by way of parliamentary question some time ago the reports which appeared in the <i>Evening Press</i> on 2nd November, 1976, and in <i>The Irish Times</i> for 4th November, 1976, dealing with travellers' objections to conditions.  This takes on an added significance when we look at the number of tourists from Britain.  According to Mr. Hogan, chairman of the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain, addressing a meeting in London attended by members of his committee and representatives of various travel organisations, the Irish in Britain are treated as second-and third-class citizens when they travel to Ireland.  I asked that this be fully investigated and if those accusations did not stand up to examination, that should be made known and the results spelled out.</P>
    <P>Again I ask the Minister to consider those submissions and even at this late stage to do all he can to ensure that the people in the tourist industry will be in a position to meet the targets which are set for next year and the years following and that we will not be coming back to this House pointing an accusing finger at the Government and the Minister in charge saying: &ldquo;You have neglected an aspect of our economy which could be a good money earner and job creator.&rdquo;  It is important that the Minister look at this as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;tourist industry&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;has shown a recovery since 1973, having previously been in decline since 1969, and commends the contribution which the Government, in accordance with its stated aim on taking office, has made towards that recovery&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the chance of talking here on tourism and I am glad this motion was put down.  In his concluding remarks Deputy Leonard said he hoped he would not have to put down a motion accusing the Government and the Minister of failure in the tourist industry in time to come. I hope he will put down such a motion, even if he does accuse the Minister because he must have some vehicle, some whipping boy.  I am happy to be it as long as we can have more intelligent and informed discussions on tourism.  Tourism is not debated here often enough.  I have shown my concern for the industry and I have travelled to many countries promoting Ireland as a tourist destination.  I believe we have something special to offer in the tourist line but I would not accept that this country should be a destination of mass tourism.  Last April, in the course of a debate initiated by Deputy Leonard, I expressed the view that this should never be our aim.  We are selling something different and unique and it cannot be sold at giveaway cut prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Leonard said that a speaker at a seminar last week pointed out that one could spend two weeks in Spain, staying in a hotel, for £65.  He told us that the hotel industry is nonprofitable and depressed and that some hotels are shutting down.  If Irish hoteliers were getting £65 for a two-weeks stay and if all taxes and excise duties were taken off what they were selling how many people would be employed?  What level of profitability would there be?  What wages would be paid to the people employed in the <Col N="1000" /> hotels offering those prices?  It is not on.  We are a different country.  We are members of the EEC and we are trying to bring to our people a standard of living equal to that enjoyed by people living in other European capital cities.  Deputy Leonard seems to be proposing that we should reverse that trend and have a policy of low wages, cheap products and poor hotels.  He did not say that but that would be the effect of what he suggested. People will pay for what they get and if they get a quality product they are willing to pay a bit more for it.  That does not mean that people are free to charge what they like; there must be competitiveness, an important element in a tourist product. We are not selling a cheap product here; we are not selling poor food or cheap accommodation.  We want our hotel staff to be well paid and our hoteliers to make money. They are the constraints within which the hoteliers and the tourist industry operate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard quoted figures for August and I should like to give him the latest figures.  I am sorry this debate was not left for January when we would have all the figures for 1976.  I shall try to initiate a debate in the early part of every year in future on tourism so that we can compare a full 12 months' figures with the figures for the previous year.  I should like to add that I listened to all suggestions and I have a completely open mind and I am acceptable to all suggestions for solutions to the problems the tourist industry has.  The figures I have are for the period from January last to October. At that stage the number of tourists from Britain was 708,400 compared with 739,000 the previous year, a drop of 4.1 per cent.  For North America the figure is 252,000 compared with 239,300, a growth of 5.3 per cent.  For the Continent of Europe the figure is 188,600 for this year compared with 169,900 for 1975, a growth of 11 per cent.  For what are termed as &ldquo;other areas&rdquo; there has been a growth of 0.4 per cent, from 25,800 compared with 25,700 in 1975.  This means that for the first ten months of this year there was a fractional increase <Col N="1001" /> in the total tourism picture compared with the previous year, from 1,173,900 to 1,174,800 so far this year, an increase of 0.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>From my point of view those figures are not satisfactory.  The &ldquo;other areas&rdquo; is a different area because it extends around the world.  It is virgin territory as far as Bord Fáilte are concerned but they are putting as much of their resources as they can afford into promoting tourism in those areas.  The number of tourists coming is small but I hope it will grow.  There was a very satisfactory growth in the number of tourists from continental Europe and if we could have got that growth in the other categories I would be satisfied. As regards prices in North America, continental Europe and &ldquo;other areas&rdquo; our prices are extremely competitive. This country is extraordinarily good value for people from Europe, North America and the &ldquo;other areas&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I was in a good hotel in Brussels last week&mdash;it was not a grade A hotel&mdash; and I paid 195 francs for one whiskey and two bottles of beer&mdash;the rate of exchange is about 55 or 56 francs to the £.  That meant that I paid more than £3 for those drinks.  Bed and breakfast cost me £27 and I was charged 35 francs&mdash;about 60p&mdash;for an orange juice I ordered with my continental breakfast.  I was amused to hear Deputy Leonard, for the second time in 12 months, talking about pricing ourselves out of the tourist market.  Compared with the prices continentals have to pay for hotels, food, transport and drink things here are ridiculously cheap.  People come here because it is cheap to holiday here.  The North Americans consider all our prices cheap, with the exception of petrol, but Americans would consider petrol anywhere in the world very expensive.  It is roughly six times dearer in Italy than it is in North America; four times dearer in France; three times dearer here and about 2½ times dearer in Britain.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the House what a writer in the travel resorts section of <i>The Washington Star,</i> Mr. William M. Fine, in the issue of November 14th, 1976, said about Ireland.  The <Col N="1002" /> writer is publishing director of <i>Harpers Bazaar, Town &amp; Country</i> and <i>House Beautiful.</i> Obviously, he is a man of a good reputation and his judgment would be accepted by people in the United States.  He talks about Ireland and the price of petrol. For American citizens it is dear.  That is true.  He talks about the golf and the hotels, not grade A hotels.  He lists seven or eight and he talks about how cheap they are.  He says good food is plentiful in Galway.  He says Galway is known for fish&mdash;Galway Bay prawns, black sole and plaice. Smoked salmon is sky high in price this year, almost seven dollars, and he has exclamation marks after that because it is so cheap by American standards.  He lists three or four places around the country&mdash;some of them I do not know&mdash;and he says how marvellous they are.</P>
    <P>He starts off the article by saying: &ldquo;Having just completed my 75th visit to Ireland, over a 17½ years' span, I have begun to understand some of the subtleties of that Mystical Isle&mdash;&mdash;perhaps just well enough to comment on them.&rdquo;  He makes the point &mdash;it is a point I made here last week and again this evening&mdash;about quality.  He quotes the new director general of Bord Fáilte and says he has a unique quality outlook for Irish tourists.  He says: &ldquo;During the last ten years, I have found small touches of this `quality' all around Ireland.&rdquo; This is what we are selling.  We are selling quality and this is a really firm basis for a growing tourism market. Quality is building good hotels. Quality is a proper backup of professionalism in running these hotels which will give the hoteliers a return on their investment.  Quality will give Irish food a reputation carried back by people who visit here and thus create a demand outside the country for that food and that drink, or whatever it is.  Quality in our style of life, and the extent to which that quality style of life is transferred or transmitted to those who come here, to my mind, is really what tourism is or should be about.</P>
    <P>We take the profits and we create the jobs.  We have our access transport. We have all the various semi-State industries <Col N="1003" /> sucked up by tourism.  In the final analysis, when we talk about tourism and why it is really important in world-wide human terms, we are talking about people meeting people. The higher the quality of life and the more of that high quality we can transmit to those who come to us or garner from them, the more benefit there is from tourism in patriotic terms.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Leonard that the problem of the North of Ireland is not the only problem, but it is a big problem in the United Kingdom market.  It is difficult to be precise in calculating how much one problem or another affects the drop in tourist numbers from the UK this year.  The first problem is the economic situation in the UK.  It is similar to the American situation in 1974 with the American economy under seige and an unwillingness on the part of Americans, therefore, to move outside the walls of their economy.  Tourism is, of course, paid for by all of us and what is left over when we have met all our expenses.  If there is a high level of unemployment, fewer people can afford to travel.  This was a significant factor in the drop in tourists from the UK this year.  Ireland was not the only country which suffered.  Europe and the rest of the world suffered a drop of between 17 and 26 per cent as compared with 1975.  That includes Ireland, but the drop here was 4.1 per cent for the first ten months as compared with Spain, Germany, France and other places.  We did not fare so badly.  The problem deserves special attention.  It is something that cannot be left to chance.</P>
    <P>We cannot, of course brush aside the Northern Ireland problem.  The bombing of four hotels in July, the murder of the British Ambassador by soulless, moronic sadists who seem to think they speak for the people when they engage in such savagery, had an impact. If one were an Englishman looking at his television last July, without having booked his holidays, and one discovered the ambassador of one's country had been murdered in one's nearest neighbour's country, what would one's reaction be?  I do not <Col N="1004" /> think I need answer the question. Until we wipe out that scum and stop them in their mindless violence, which they protest is patriotism, which is the basest form of sedition and treachery, in both parts of this island, until this scum are totally discarded by everybody in the country, tourism will have a problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard said the morale of the tourist industry is low.  That is not so.  If we have succeeded since coming into office in doing anything for tourism, we have certainly succeeded in raising morale.  When I came in I found all sectors of the industry&mdash; hoteliers, carriers, car-hire people, travel agents&mdash;depressed, fearful and lacking confidence in the future of the industry.  Things have changed dramatically.  In the hotel industry at this time there is probably more confidence, more faith in the future and more willingness to make an investment in terms of cash than there has been since 1969.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard stated that 112 hotels have closed since 1973 with the loss of 2,500 jobs.  It is true that if those hotels were full the jobs would not have been lost.  However, I do not think the people in Bord Fáilte who are responsible for standards in the industry would weep over all the hotels that closed.  It was unfortunate that some of them closed but others had outlived their usefulness.  Like any other business an hotel needs continual investment in refurbishing and in promotion.  This also applies to management personnel.</P>
    <P>New ideas, drive and initiative are necessary, as is a sense of urgency and purpose.  That sense now exists in the hotel industry and it is notable that hotels put up for sale are now being sought and bids are being made for them.  That was not the case in the last six or seven years.  It is happening because people have a sense of being on a winning side.  That is the real mark of confidence, the sign that the policies I have been adopting for the past three years have been successful.  People now regard the hotel industry as one in which they are willing to invest their time and <Col N="1005" /> money.  Deputy Leonard said it was a criticism of me that these hotels closed but, at the same time, he pointed out that we have sufficient plant.  If that is so we must have had too much before because the figures do not add up.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a few comments on the matter of access transport.  When Opposition Deputies spoke on this matter they were speaking out of both sides of their mouths at once.  Deputy Leonard said with regard to the Aer Lingus charter policy that it might not be in the national interest for it to show a profit.  I presume he meant that I should issue charter licences to other airlines and instruct Aer Lingus to drop their prices, to become a full-time charter airline and to be subservient totally to the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is a measure going through this House where I am seeking sanction to allow Aer Lingus to invest in extra capital.  Deputy Barrett and Deputy Leonard said that those people who spoke about Aer Lingus changing to a charter airline and who criticised Aer Lingus policy on charters did not know what they were talking about.  I do not know which Deputy is voicing the official Fianna Fáil line because there is a contradiction between what they have said.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus are a commercial body and they are there to make a profit. Their losses have been very high in the past few years on the North Atlantic route.  However, the last option I would accept is that they should come off that route.  They serve tourism and are available to carry charters from en route destinations in America but they must remain on the North Atlantic route as a scheduled carrier.  That means flying at specific times and on specific dates all the year round.  An abandonment of that policy would not be in our national interest because it would mean that there would not be anybody selling Ireland in the United States.  People who want to come here for other than tourism purposes would not be able to use the Irish airline.  I must look at this in a much broader <Col N="1006" /> way than just from the tourism point of view.  It might be in the tourist interest for Aer Lingus to abandon that policy&mdash;I am not sure of that&mdash;but I would not be in favour of their doing it.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to a matter about which there has been a number of questions in this House.  The message does not seem to have got across yet.  I am referring to the number of cheap fares available to people in the United Kingdom who wish to come to Ireland.  There are many special offers and I will mention some of them. There is the special family fare that, for the price of two normal fares, allows free travel for two children between three years and 14 years plus two infants.  Those children may travel free with their parents who pay normal fares.  There is also the air coach service. This service combines air travel based on the excursion fare between Dublin and United Kingdom airports; it quotes travel from the United Kingdom airports to London and eight major provincial centres.  There is also the &ldquo;All-the-Way&rdquo; facility.  This gives a special price reduction for air travel; there is also a coach to take a person to his destination.  There is the &ldquo;Fly-Drive&rdquo; which quotes a special air fare plus a car at this end.  There is the fare that allows a man to have his wife travel with him at half fare.  There are the youth fares that give a discount of 25 per cent on the excursion return fares available to young people between the ages of 12 and 21 who travel between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The Irish continental lines have special fares also.  Children under the age of four years travel free.  Fares for children between four years and 14 years are approximately 50 per cent less than normal fares.  The B &amp; I have special fares.  There is the Wednesday special fare; there is the four-day mini-tour as well as day and weekend excursions.  I would like if Deputies would bring these fares to the attention of people living in their own areas, not just to the attention of relatives in England.  If we can spread the word that these fares are available perhaps we will have more tourists from the United Kingdom in the year ahead.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the motion in the name of Deputy Leonard.  I was interested to hear the Minister quote the amount he was charged for hotel accommodation in Brussels.  However, he should have told us the wages of an ordinary working man in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should tell that to Deputy Leonard.  It is a pertinent point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant because I am sure the wages there are much higher than they are in this country. I believe tourism has become such an important industry in recent years that it should be given every encouragement by the Government so that the maximum returns can be made to the economy.  Some of the measures which the Government have introduced, particularly the penal taxation on petrol and the continuing increase in food prices, can only lead one to conclude that the Government are not interested in promoting tourism.  Those commodities are essential to the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>The contribution of tourism is twofold. In economic terms it helps with the balance of payments, generates employment and assists the progress of regional development.  In social terms it has a significant impact on the quality of life by fostering national culture, traditions and civic pride and bringing about greater understanding between people.  It is, therefore, imperative that the Government be to the forefront in creating the right climate for the attraction of tourists to the country.  I am not referring to the weather.  The climate I would like to see is that prices are right, proper amenities are available, that there is a good transport service, good hotel accommodation and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of holidays in Ireland in 1974, between visitors and home holidays, was 4.37 million.  Expenditure in Ireland in that year was £146.7 million.  This is a substantial figure and an excellent contribution to our economy.  By 1980, according to the Bord Fáilte plan, it is hoped that the number of holidays spent in Ireland will increase by 29 per cent to <Col N="1008" /> 5.829 million and that there will be a real increase in revenue to 32.4 per cent.  Did Bord Fáilte, when making those projections, take into account the rapidly increasing food prices which we have had, the increase in hotel charges, the increased petrol charges and increases in the price of drink, cigarettes and all kinds of entertainment?  Those items are very necessary for a good holiday.  If we price ourselves out of the market we cannot expect to attract people who can get cheaper holidays elsewhere. We all know that petrol can be bought for 10p per gallon cheaper in Northern Ireland than it can here. Why could the Government not introduce some scheme which would enable tourists to purchase petrol at at least the same price as it can be bought in Northern Ireland or Great Britain?  If such a scheme were introduced it would attract many more tourists to this country.  It would show that the Government were determined to build up this very valuable industry.  I believe such a scheme would be easy to operate.</P>
    <P>We see, as a result of successive Coalition budgets, that the price of drink is prohibitive.  It is much higher than it is in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  Some years ago the reverse was the situation.  Irish people look forward to their annual visit to their homeland to visit their families and friends.  Now it is becoming a bit of a nightmare because once they step on to Irish soil at Dún Laoghaire, Dublin Airport, Cork Airport, or Shannon Airport, they can see the grim reality of the economic policies of the Government staring them in the face.</P>
    <P>The amenity grants introduced some years ago by Fianna Fáil have been withdrawn.  This helped local communities improve facilities in their area and made them more attractive to tourists.  I recall many useful projects started in Country Galway under this scheme.  There were many more on the drawing board which had to be scrapped because the Government decided to terminate those grants.  I do not believe those grants were costing the <Col N="1009" /> Government a lot of money.  It was a pity they were withdrawn because many car parks, improved bathing facilities and so on were provided in tourist areas.</P>
    <P>I do not expect it can ever be measured how much harm the Government's declaration of a state of emergency in the country has done. People living in Europe who hear that there is a state of emergency here would not be very happy about coming to spend a holiday.  The average Irishman would not feel like going to a country where a state of emergency operated.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment Bord Fáilte on the National Tourist Development Plan 1976-80, which they have produced.  This is an excellent plan. They have tried to come to grips with the many problems as they see them. They have offered suggestions how those problems might be overcome and how tourist facilities can be improved in the various regions.  That plan cannot bear fruit unless adequate funds are made available at local and national level to enable Bord Fáilte to put it into operation.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure for those plans is something in the region of £50 million over the next five years.  So far as I recollect, about £30 million will be provided by Bord Fáilte.  The balance will have to be provided by the local authorities and other bodies interested in the promotion of tourism. I hope that money will be forthcoming and that Bord Fáilte will be able to push ahead with their plans to develop this very important industry.</P>
    <P>One criticism I would offer is that they tend to concentrate their attention too much on areas with natural amenities.  This was highlighted recently at a meeting of Galway County Council when Ireland-West submitted a programme to the council offering in the region of £20,000 for small amenity schemes if the council backed their proposal £ for £.  All those schemes were located in the Connemara area which, as we all know, has many natural amenities.  We agreed to give Ireland-West this money.  We felt that since we had supported the other <Col N="1010" /> amenity schemes it was important to avail of this offer by Bord Fáilte to ensure that this necessary work was carried out.</P>
    <P>We were disappointed that some of the work was not done in the eastern part of the country where there are areas which could be developed.  When Bord Fáilte or Ireland-West come to us again for money, I hope they will submit a scheme for the other part of the country and no doubt we will give them whatever help we can by way of a supplementary grant, as we did on this occasion.  There are many more areas in the west which require the attention of Bord Fáilte, areas which are not as fortunate from a natural amenity point of view, which could be made more attractive for tourists if an-all out effort were made to provide facilities, to develop the amenities, to provide the right type of hotel and guesthouse and the right type of entertainment for visitors.  This type of activity creates employment, particularly during the summer season when so many school leavers are anxious to get employment.</P>
    <P>The western region has been very fortunate in the past in having a large labour pool to draw on especially for seasonal operations in hotels and other forms of accommodation and for servicing other tourists products. The hotel and catering school at the Regional Technical College in Galway provides an excellent service as a training centre for all sections of the accommodation industry.  The provision of a four-year management course will ensure that in future a pool of trained personnel will be available to the accommodation industry in the region and in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the students who were attending this catering school in Galway and who were promised a degree were denied that degree. That was a shame.  I know it is not in the area of the Minister for Transport and Power but I would ask him to have a word with his colleague the Minister for Education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I felt very sad for them on the day they hoped to receive their degree but it turned out to be a diploma. Naturally they did not accept it.  In the interests of the industry it is important that those students should be encouraged to enter this profession as a career.  They were promised a degree and the Government should stand by that promise.</P>
      <P>One matter in regard to which we must all be very careful&mdash;and it has become more noticeable in recent years&mdash;is the danger of pollution to our lakes and rivers.  We have some very valuable lakes and rivers from the tourism point of view and therefore valuable to the national economy. People can come and fish those lakes and rivers freely and be assured of good entertainment.  It is important that we should be on the alert against pollution.  Public bodies who have an interest in this matter should be most careful.  So far the western region has not been over-industrialised and there was no great danger of pollution but with the advent of industrialisation it is evident that certain industries will be located there which will discharge pollutants.  Every effort should be made to reduce to the minimum the danger of this happening.  Recently we heard criticism offered by Mr. Lally about the location of industry in Killala.  When those industries are being located, every effort should be made to ensure they will not cause pollution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I tabled referred specifically to Skerries harbour&mdash;Skerries harbour as it is and as it will be in the light of the much publicised agreement in The Hague a number of weeks ago.  I am bitterly disappointed with the answer given to me by the Parliamentary Secretary, which gives no hope to the fishermen at Skerries for the expansion of their fleet and the provision of proper landing facilities for them for the future. It casts doubt on the sincerity of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his pronouncements from The Hague in relation to the expansion of the fishing fleet as he envisages it over the next couple of years.  The Hague Agreement, as I understand it, promised roughly 300 extra boats into our ports over the next three years, a doubling of our catch over the same period. How can this be done if there are no proper harbour facilities?</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary stated that the Fishery Harbour Centres Act of 1968 envisaged five major harbours in this country and Skerries was not one of them.  The 1968 Act never envisaged the type of expansion we have seen and that is envisaged over the next couple of years.  What we are talking about now is a 200-mile limit for Europe and, I hope, if we are not sold out by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, a 50-mile limit exclusively for our own fishermen.  If we are to see the extra 300 boats, if we are to see the 50-mile limit and what it promises to us, how can we operate on the basis of the 1968 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are problems on the west and south coasts, but I want to talk about the east coast now.  The main harbours of the east coast are Howth, Skerries, Balbriggan and Clogherhead.  Howth had an intensive expansion campaign <Col N="1013" /> about four years ago.  A great deal of money was spent on it, and no matter how much more money is spent on it, it can still only deal with the same size boats as they have now, and it is chock-a-block at the moment.  No matter how much the inner harbour is deepened, nothing can be done with the outer reef.  Balbriggan needs deepening and improvement to the harbour walls, something I have raised with the Parliamentary Secretary on a number of occasions, and Clogherhead needs extra facilities; but for both of them they would be merely improvements of existing harbours.</P>
    <P>The one great hope for the eastern fishermen is a new harbour at Skerries.  The Parliamentary Secretary ignored the depth of the question I tabled to him last week and instead of answering the question I asked him about a completely new harbour, he merely spoke about an extension of the existing harbour.  In the light of The Hague Agreement and the possibility of a 50-mile exclusive limit for our fishermen, the expansion of the existing harbour would be of no benefit to the Skerries fishermen.</P>
    <P>The existing situation in Skerries is this: there are roughly £10 million worth of boats there.  There are orders and potential for a further £10 million worth of boats within the next ten years.  Between £20 million and £25 million worth of boats will be in the Skerries harbour within the next two to two and a half years. There is a ludicrous situation even with the existing fleet in Skerries. The boats pull in at night-time.  They are three or four abreast to the harbour wall.  A half a million pounds worth of a boat pulls in in low water.  If they are not in early, the crew have to unload their catch and carry it across four or five decks to the harbour wall.  It is pulled up by ropes on to the quay and then taken by truck to the Dublin market.  If the crew want to take ice on board they bring the ice along in a wheelbarrow to the harbour wall and again take it down by ropes and across a number of decks to their boat.  When we are talking in terms of an investment of £250,000 or £500,000, such procedures <Col N="1014" /> for loading and unloading are ludicrous.</P>
    <P>If there was a factory being opened in the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency in Cork, in Galway or in any other constituency and if the Government, the IDA or whatever State authority was involved had invested £500,000 in it, I have no doubt that there would be three or four Ministers down there opening it, a very good dinner at which all local dignitaries would be invited to celebrate the occasion.  Here is a situation at Skerries where £500,000 worth of a boat operates in conditions which prevailed at the time of Our Lord in the Sea of Gallilee.  In his reply to my question last Thursday the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>I will provide a State contribution for the improvements needed at this harbour but I must obtain first an engineering report and an estimate of cost from the Office of Public Works on the works proposed. I understand that that office has placed a contract for a boring survey as a preliminary to drawing up the engineering report.</P>
    <P>May I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should not insult the intelligence of the Skerries fishermen by talking any more about boring surveys.  They have listened to that since this Government came into office.  They have listened to promises about boring equipment being sent to Skerries.  The boring equipment eventually arrived; one hole was dug and those involved took off never to be seen again.  No survey has been done and no proper report has been prepared. I gather there is a further boring survey under way and that a contract has gone out for it.</P>
    <P>The time for the petty thinking attached to providing a mere extension to Skerries harbour is gone.  It might have been all right a few years ago but not any longer.  The extension of the existing Skerries harbour would merely exacerbate an already difficult situation.  All it would do is extend the harbour into shallow water.  That would not accommodate the bigger <Col N="1015" /> boats, the 85- and 90-footers that are on order and being awaited.</P>
    <P>I shall tell the Parliamentary Secretary a little story.  About a month ago there was a north-westerly gale on a Friday night, and at about ten o'clock at night the crews of two of the boats had to go on board and take them out in that gale.  They could not get into Howth because of the gale and the direction of the wind.  They had to go right up to Butt Bridge.  They took their lives in their hands that night.  Had they stayed in Skerries harbour their boats would have been destroyed up on the beach.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary realises that talking about extending the harbour is only nibbling at the problem.  The problem must be viewed broadly in the long term, not narrowly in the short term.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to lift himself up above mere extensions and look at the potential of the Irish fishing fleet and Irish fishing waters.</P>
    <P>The one great hope of the east coast fishermen is a proper harbour in Skerries, a harbour which will give water at all times, a safe harbour from which men will not have to pull out in the middle of the night, no matter from where or how the wind blows.  A proper harbour will mean that their half-million and quarter-million pound boats will not be sitting on an uneven harbour bed.  That is what they are doing at the moment in Skerries.</P>
    <P>What happens?  A quarter of a million pounds worth of boat pulls into Skerries harbour.  The tide ebbs and that boat is left sitting on an uneven harbour bed.  The hull gets damaged.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is unfamiliar with the situation he can check it out with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara because they have been examining it.  They have walked it.  I was with them.  They examined the bed of the harbour.  It is in a very, very dangerous condition.</P>
    <P>If the Government are really serious about it in their much talked of interest in our fishing industry they simply cannot be unaware of the importance of Skerries harbour to east coast fishermen.  The whole east coast <Col N="1016" /> fishing depends on a proper harbour at Skerries, a harbour providing deep water at all times, with proper berths, proper sale sheds, proper ioing plants and proper fuelling plants.  All these can be provided but only if Skerries is provided with a new harbour.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary talked about the Fishery Harbour Centres Act of 1968 and the development of State fishery harbour centres and says he does not propose to extend these to include Skerries.  When he makes a statement like that he is not thinking in terms of 1976.  He is thinking in terms of 1968.  I would like him to assure the House tonight that he will first of all, improve Balbriggan harbour and erect a proper harbour wall and a proper harbour bed; that he will also improve Clogherhead and survey and build a complete new harbour in Skerries which will form the basis of the fishing industry on the east coast.</P>
    <P>Skerries is the harbour closest to the fishing grounds.  If the Government are serious about the extension of our fishing limits and the doubling of our catch over the next couple of years we must have a new east coast harbour and in my view that can only be in Skerries. The extra 300 boats envisaged in The Hague agreement could not be accommodated in Howth or Balbriggan. Small boats can utilise the latter but, as I say, both Balbriggan and Clogherhead must be improved to accommodate these properly.  If there is an extension of the existing position all you will do is go into shallow water and further exacerbate an already exacerbated situation.  The only hope for the east coast fishermen with 300 extra boats and a 200-mile limit, with an exclusive 50-mile limit, is the building of a new harbour at Skerries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Burke in hoping that Skerries harbour and the fishing industry there will prosper in the years ahead.  It was interesting listening to Deputy Burke's preamble when he mentioned the question of limits.  Limits are not, of course, proper to this discussion but, since he mentioned them, it is only right that I <Col N="1017" /> should reply.  He expressed the hope that this Government will not sell the fishermen out.  The fact is this Government are trying to buy our fishermen back.  It was the Fianna Fáil Government who sold them out in 1970, 1971 and 1972.  There was no mention of any exclusive limits at all when Fianna Fáil were negotiating our accession to the European Economic Community.  I have pointed that out again and again here.  I repeat it once more now.</P>
      <P>It is not a question of this Government selling the fishermen out.  It is a question of this Government buying ourselves back.  We were sold out. Fisheries were completely forgotten when the negotiations were under way. There was just no mention of them at all.  What happened when Fianna Fáil signed on the dotted line was made clear last week by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The actual emphasis was on free access for all our European partners up to our very shores. We are changing that.  I shall not dwell further on the matter.</P>
      <P>Skerries harbour needs to be developed.  That has been said over and over again.  Let us examine its history.  An agitation commenced in the early 'fifties for much needed development works at Skerries.  After almost 20 years agitation it was decided to carry out some works there at a cost of £71,000, 50 per cent to be borne by the Exchequer and 50 per cent by Dublin County Council.  No sooner were the works carried out&mdash; the Deputy represented the area because Fianna Fáil were in office for 16 years up to 1971&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>No sooner were the works carried out than they were found to be inadequate and ultimately it became the job of the new Government to try to overcome the difficulties that existed.  I do not like to reflect on work done in the past but seemingly there was a lack of foresight in regard to the extent of the improvements needed at Skerries and we have been left by Fianna Fáil a big legacy of work needing to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1971, when money was more <Col N="1018" /> freely available than it is now and when a great deal more work could be done with the money available, we had a most peculiar position obtaining in regard to harbours.  Deputy Burke mentioned other harbours needing development besides Skerries. In 1971 this House voted £640,000 for harbour works.  In that year, when Skerries needed additional moneys for further improvements, only £206,038 was expended and the balance of £393,962 went back into the Exchequer.  That was the evolution when Fianna Fáil were in office so far as harbour development works were concerned.  That was not an unusual year.  In the previous year additional moneys went back to the Exchequer as well because Fianna Fáil were not interested in harbour development.</P>
    <P>The next chapter started when we took office.  I was out in Skerries with my advisers to examine the extent of the work required.  I felt, and still feel, that a comprehensive job is required at Skerries to meet local requirements but before public moneys can be utilised for the provision of the necessary work there it is essential that a first-class survey be carried out, designs and structures drawn up by specialists in that field and reports made on them by the Department.  My job is to ensure that any moneys expended on harbour or any other works by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are gainfully utilised for the benefit of the community.  We are doing that.  I indicated that position in my reply to Deputy Burke on Wednesday last.  This is a peculiar situation&mdash;I merely mention it in passing&mdash;that we have a question on the Adjournment here this evening because, when it was answered in the Dáil on Wednesday last, the Deputy concerned was not present.</P>

      <P>The Deputy misinterpreted the answer I gave.  We were not too satisfied with the Office of Public Works carrying out this survey so we asked that it be given to a contractor.  The estimated cost of the work for the survey is £20,000.  That will give an idea of the magnitude of the boring surveys to be carried out. Our last discussions with the Board of Works were on the 19th November, less than two weeks ago, when we asked them what was happening so far as the survey was concerned.  We were told that the contractor was ready to go ahead and was waiting on favourable weather.  Therefore, it can be seen that there has been no undue delay on the part of the Department. We are not going to spend money, as was expended in 1971, on a scheme which, no sooner completed, was found to be completely inadequate.  My case was, and is, that Skerries required a more comprehensive scheme in 1971 than was carried out then.  Of course, Deputy Burke said we did not envisage then the expansion of the fishing industry now foreseeable.  That was because Fianna Fáil were then in power.  Now that we are in power, fishing has got a new status.  Formerly, it was scarcely mentioned at all in the public press. Now it is the subject not alone of a great deal of writing in the national <Col N="1020" /> and provincial press but also of a number of editorials.  That is what we like and demonstrates the new status of fishing under this Government.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Burke that, so far as Skerries is concerned, he will have my full support.  I agree that it is a harbour needing development.  I am sorry that the works carried out there in 1971 were not of a more comprehensive nature.  We will obtain the report as early as we possibly can from the contractor charged with the job.  As soon as that is obtained we will have it examined in the Department, investigate what will be the probable cost and endeavour to get the moneys necessary to have the work carried out.  I shall not hazard a guess at the possible cost of this scheme; possibly it will be a sizeable amount and I am not ruling out the provision of a new harbour at Skerries.  I am sure Deputy Burke will be satisfied that my Department are giving close and careful attention to this question, as we are to a number of other similar ones, perhaps not of the same size or importance&mdash;other harbours around our coast.  We will endeavour to get more money for harbour development. My aim will be to distribute such moneys as equitably as possible around our coastline.  I am giving priority to this scheme at Skerries because I think it is needed.</P>
      <P>I am mindful always of the desirability of getting as much money as we possibly can for harbour development. I want to say to the fishermen of Skerries and to all the others who fish off harbours around our coast that all their representations and recommendations are receiving careful attention. We cannot undertake all of the work within a short period or even within a relatively short time.  We are trying to establish a priority list and do the most needy jobs first.</P>
      <P>When speaking on harbour development I want to say also that I am not ruling out the position of small harbours that can be improved for the benefit of smaller numbers of fishermen and their boats&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In December, 1974, the corporation were given sanction to the borrowing of £95,000.  At that time the total cost of the project was estimated at £120,000 and the balance was to be met from revenue.</P>
      <P>In January, 1976, an application for sanction to the borrowing of a further £100,000 was received from the corporation.  To enable this application to be considered, the corporation were asked for certain information regarding the revised overall expenditure likely to be involved in the project. Plans were submitted to my Department on the 19th November, 1976, and are being examined.  I am unable to consider sanctioning further borrowing for this project until that examination is completed.</P>
