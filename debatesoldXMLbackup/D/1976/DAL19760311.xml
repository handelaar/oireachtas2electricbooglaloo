      <P>In the special committee we had an understanding that if there was a desire for a relaxed debate on this stage, as far as I was concerned I would be willing to accede to any request from the Opposition, particularly having regard to the unavoidable absence of Deputy Colley from the Committee.

      <P>Before we come to amendment No. 2 I should like to propose a minor textual amendment to the amendment itself.  It affects subsection (5) (b), about half way down the green page.  Paragraph (b) opens:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this subsection&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  &ldquo;the average of branch liabilities for the accounting period....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the accounting period&rdquo; should read &ldquo;an accounting period&rdquo;&mdash;the indefinite instead of the definite article.</P>

      <P>That is all right.  The Deputy will observe there are quotation marks at the commencement of (i) and the correct quote has the indefinite article, not the definite one.  In relation to (ii), quotation marks are required from the commencement of it, before the definite article, and should end after &ldquo;applies&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I move amendment No. 2 as amended in that manner:</P>
      <P>In page 46, to delete lines 52 to 58, and to substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5)  (a) Where the average of <Col N="1767" /> branch liabilities for an accounting period exceeds the mean value for the accounting period of the assets to which this subsection applies, the amount to be included in profits under section 13 (1), or that subsection as modified by section 37, shall be an amount determined by the formula</P>
    <P>A × B</P>
    <P>&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&nbsp;C</P>
    <P>where&mdash;</P>
    <P>A is the amount which apart from this subsection would be so included in profits,</P>
    <P>B is the average of branch liabilities for the accounting period, and</P>
    <P>C is the mean value for the accounting period of the assets to which this subsection applies.</P>
    <P>(b)  for the purposes of this subsection&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  &ldquo;the average of branch liabilities for an accounting period&rdquo; means the aggregate of the amounts represented by B in subsection (3), B in section 44 (2) and the average of the liabilities attributable to pension business for the accounting period, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  &ldquo;the assets to which this subsection applies&rdquo; are assets the gains from the disposal of which are chargeable to corporation tax by virtue of section 4 (2) (6) (8) (a) of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, with the addition of assets the gains from the disposal of which would, but for sections 19 and 24 of, and paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 to, that Act, be so chargeable.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Under section 43 (5) as it stands, an overseas life office would be chargeable to corporation tax in respect of capital gains on the Irish fraction of world gains rather than by reference to gains arising from assets situate in the State and referable to the Irish branch business.  During the Committee Stage, I stated I had received representations <Col N="1768" /> on this point from the Life Offices Association and that as a result I was reconsidering the basis proposed in the Bill&mdash;I might mention these were the only representations received on the section of the Bill dealing with insurance companies.  These representations were to the effect that liability should be confined to gains on disposal of assets in the State because the computation of the basis of the Irish capital gains tax legislation as applied to corporation tax would pose very serious difficulties for these companies. The companies felt that this requirement was all the more unreasonable having regard to the fact that only a very small fraction of the world gains would in general be chargeable here.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to meet these representations while preserving the safeguards sought in the original subsection, namely, to ensure an adequate charge on capital gains where an overseas company do not invest in this country to an extent commensurate with the Irish business.  The revised subsection deals with this situation by increasing the amount chargeable under normal rules by a fraction corresponding to the shortfall in Irish investments. I might add that the draft subsection is on lines which have been agreed with the Life Offices Association.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) contains the main provisions, fixing the amount to be included in profits where a shortfall in Irish investment occurs.  The gains on Irish investments are paid separately. If the Irish liabilities are in excess of the Irish assets the gains so computed are increased by means of the formula to what they would be if the Irish assets were equal to the Irish liabilities. For example, if the Irish assets represent only 80 per cent of the Irish liability the gains chargeable would be increased by 25 per cent&mdash;that is, to 100 over 80 multiplied by the Irish gains.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) (i) brings in the average of liabilities of the whole Irish Life business&mdash;that is, life assurance, annuities, pensions, and so on.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) (ii) brings within the scope of the subsection all Irish assets whether chargeable to capital gains tax or not so as to ensure the company <Col N="1769" /> which invested in Irish assets not chargeable to capital gains&mdash;for example, Irish Government securities&mdash; can include those assets to cover a corresponding amount of Irish liabilities. If this were not allowed the charge to capital gains tax would be increased with disincentive effects on investment here by the company concerned.</P>
    <P>The reference to section 19 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, brings into the computation exempt Government securities.  The reference to section 4 of that Act covers the possibility of an overseas company investing in prize bonds.</P>
    <P>The reference to paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 of that Act covers the assets attributable to general annuity and pension business where the gains as such are not chargeable because profits from realisations form part of the trading income.</P>

      <P>Some of us who were members of the special committee had difficulty in dealing with amendments and, when it comes to the Fifth Stage, it will be in order, I take it, for me to comment on the unsatisfactory nature of the way in which the Dáil and the Committee had to handle this Bill.  I want the Minister to appreciate that I fully <Col N="1770" /> appreciate the reasons for this but I think he will agree with me that the procedure adopted was totally unsatisfactory. Were it not for two factors&mdash;the very competent staff work that was done plus the feeling the Committee had that they could have complete confidence in that staff work&mdash;and, indeed, I would go so far as to say that we appreciated the Minister's attitude in the matter&mdash;it would have been a thoroughly objectionable procedure.  The Committee was nothing more than a rubber stamp.  We know the reason for this and it will be more appropriate to mention it on the Fifth Stage.  I do not think going into detail here on this Stage would be satisfactory.  It would really only be delaying the House.  Speaking for myself, we can only take it in the same spirit in which we took it in Committee, trusting in the good faith of the Minister because in a Bill of this nature&mdash;be-hold the size of it&mdash;there are very many interrelated provisions and the whole thing is a consistent scheme.  In many ways the Bill is a good Bill and so one hesitates to go into too much detail on this stage on isolated provisions and I would prefer myself on this amendment, therefore, to take an attitude of strict neutrality.  In criticising I am not to be taken as not accepting good reasons why this amendment should be made.  That is the only attitude we can adopt and so I will not delay the House by attempting to analyse this particular amendment but I presume I will be in order in dealing with what is in the Bill on the Fifth Stage.</P>

      <P>Amendment, as amended, agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 53, line 7, after &ldquo;interest&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;becoming due for payment on or after the 6th day of April, 1976,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 52 prevents relief from tax being given in respect of interest on money borrowed for the purpose of a business carried on in the State <Col N="1771" /> through a branch or agency by a non-resident bank, insurance company or company dealing in securities and used for the purchase of exempt Government and certain other securities referred to in section 51.  Such interest is not dealt with in section 51 (2) and is therefore dealt with as a separate matter by section 52 which provides detailed rules for exclusion in computing for corporation tax the Irish branch profits of such a company. Certain non-resident concerns made representations as a result of which I now propose by the present amendment to provide that the restriction on the amount of interest which may be deducted in computing the Irish branch profits will apply only to interest becoming due for payment after 5th April, 1976.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the effect of the Minister doing this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect is a relieving provision.  It means the restriction will apply only after the commencement of the operation of the corporation tax provisions and will not apply to interest which may have arisen prior to the coming into operation of the Act.  I want to emphasise that the date is 6th April, 1976.  Corporation tax, because of transition provisions, could be operative before that but the crucial date is 6th April, 1976.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 144, to delete lines 19 to 41, and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Where for an accounting period of a service company, the aggregate of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  four-fifths of the distributable income, and</P>
      <P>(b)  one-fifth of the aggregate of the distributable investment income and the distributable estate income</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>exceeds the distributions of the company for the accounting period <Col N="1772" /> there shall be charged on the company for the accounting period an additional duty of corporation tax (in this section referred to as a surcharge) amounting to 20 per cent of the excess:</P>
    <P>Provided that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  a surcharge shall not be made on the company where the excess is equal to or less than the smaller of the following amounts&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  £500, or, if the accounting period is less than twelve months, £500 proportionately reduced, and</P>
    <P>(II)  where the company has one or more associated companies, £500 divided by one plus the number of those associated companies, or, if the accounting period is less than twelve months, £500 proportionately reduced divided by one plus the number of those associated companies;</P>
    <P>(ii)  where the excess is greater than the smaller amount on which by virtue of paragraph (i) a surcharge would not be made, the amount of the surcharge shall not be greater than a sum equal to four-fifths of the amount by which the excess is greater than that smaller amount.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These amendments are in response to representations which were received and in response also to arguments that were advanced from all sides at the special committee.  It is proposed that 20 per cent of the distributable professional and service income of a service company should be excluded from the scope of the charge.  The amended subsection (4) secures in paragraph (a) that one-fifth of the total amount of the distributable income of the service company is to be excluded in computing the amount by which the distributable income of the company exceeds the distributions made.  Paragraph (b) provides that the exclusion will not apply to the company's distributable investment income or distributable estate income.  It does this by restoring the one-fifth of <Col N="1773" /> such income which is excluded by paragraph (a).  The remainder of the amended subsection repeats the existing subsection (4) with the revised numbering of paragraphs in the proviso.</P>
    <P>The amendment of subsection (6) (b) (ii) is consequential on the proposed new subsection (4) and is made to provide definitions of the expressions used in paragraph (b) of the amended subsection (4) and to fit in section 162 with section 100.  For example, for an accounting period of 12 months the excess of a company's distributable income over the distributions made is £18,000, as follows: professional income £40,000, investment income, £20,000; total income, £60,000; corporation tax at 50 per cent, £30,000; distributable income, £30,000; distributions made, £12,000; excess, £18,000.</P>
    <P>If the section were not amended, the surcharge would be 20 per cent of £18,000 or £3,600.  By virtue of the proposed amendment the position would be: distributable income, £30,000 multiplied by four-fifths, £24,000; distributable investment income, 95 per cent of £20,000, which is the income, minus £10,000 for corporation tax at 50 per cent, which would be £9,500 multiplied by one-fifth, which is £1,900.  The £24,000 is added to the £1,900 so as to give £25,900.  The distributions actually made, it will be recalled, amount to £12,000, so the excess is £13,900 Therefore the surcharge is 20 per cent of £13,900, which is £2,780.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That compares with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>£2,780 compares with £3,600.  The reduction in the surcharge is therefore £820.  The reason for not giving total exemption, as has been urged, is that if partners were not forming themselves into a company they would be liable for the full rate of income tax on the profits of the concern, and it is obviously inappropriate to provide totally different treatments of taxpayers who are carrying on the same line of business.  There is no good commercial reason and there is no taxation reason why they should be treated differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1774" /> It can be argued validly that cases can arise where it is desirable that income can be withheld for the purpose of reinvestment in the company to cover expansion, improvement and so forth, perhaps to help a firm over a particularly difficult period.  I am accepting that argument by providing this 20 per cent relief on distributable income, and I think that is a reasonable proportion to allow firms to withhold to meet the kind of contingencies we are discussing in the special committee and to which I have just now referred.  If a greater percentage was to be relieved, it would simply enhance the massive avoidance practice to which I drew attention in the special committee whereby people could withhold massive amounts of profits in a company and from time to time liquidate the company and distribute the income so withheld tax free.  They could then form another company and proceed with the same type of operation.</P>
    <P>The members of the special committee were somewhat scandalised when they realised the extent to which this practice had grown and the very substantial profits which some people have been able to earn tax free by this manipulation of the tax system.  There was an obvious need to close off that practice, but one does not want, as one prevents the evil, to do damage.  The concession which is now given here allows a reasonable amount to be set aside to meet the kind of contingencies which are not unusual in practice and for which it is desirable to make provision. At the same time we must remember that even giving this concession puts those who are operating it in a preferential position over those who are not incorporated.  The true rate of tax of such undistributed income will be 58 per cent against 77 per cent, which it well might be and which it would be in the majority of cases were the concerns in question not incorporated but operated by people in their personal capacity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me express appreciation that the Minister and his advisers should have tried to meet the views which, as the Minister quite rightly said, were genuinely <Col N="1775" /> expressed on all sides of the House, and I think the solution which the Minister is adopting is virtually the one suggested by the Chairman of the Committee.  With a Bill of this complexity and with the necessity to preserve its homogeneity, to make amendments of the sort involved poses a very serious staff problem, and one can sympathise with the staff officers who have to deal with these problems if there is a certain cautious resistance to meeting them.</P>
      <P>This section, 162, is one of the sections that gives cause for most debate on the Bill.  I am slightly in a quandary as to whether to leave its content for more general discussion on the Fifth Stage or to deal with the content now. However, while appreciating the Minister's approach in bringing in this amendment, I think some of us disagree with the principle on which this amendment is based.  Unfortunately we are at a certain disadvantage nowadays in dealing with the Fourth Stage after special committee.  In the old days when you could have the printed <i>verbatim</i> report of the proceedings you could check your memory.  Here we have not available to us the record of the proceedings of the special committee, which will come in due course; it is merely a delay in being able to produce the document.  But because of that, one has to rely on one's memory. I am relying on my memory now and it is possible that it is not accurate. Is this where Deputy Haughey put in an amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That amendment set the ball rolling.  Deputy Haughey stated that the approach required in this section was the removal of service companies from the 20 per cent surcharge. The Minister countered that approach, and rightly so, and used the word &ldquo;scandalised&rdquo;.  I cannot say we were scandalised but we sympathised and understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people were even envious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There was undoubtedly, and there still is, a serious <Col N="1776" /> tax evasion problem here.  No responsible member of the Committee could take any other attitude than that this tax evasion opportunity should be blocked.  That is common between us.</P>
      <P>The method adopted seems to be very like the operation on a patient who had a very intractable disease of the foot which his doctor was not able to sure and so he solved the problem by chopping off the patient's head.  We have a little of this in the section.  I realise that I am straying a little but I am getting to the principle of the section and the amendment. Although appreciating that the Minister met the majority opinion of the members of the Committee present on that day, we did not vote on it, although I am sure the Minister will concede that I was the dissenting voice.  The reason I was, and still am, is that in my view the principle is wrong.</P>
      <P>What I have said on previous sections also holds here and I will not repeat it and delay the House.  There are so many ramifications tied up with this that all I can say is this: it is giving some relief.  In other words, the Minister is probably trying to save the spinal cord but he is doing a great deal of damage to the neck. Basically that is not the solution.  We are not opposing it here but there is a wrong principle in the approach.  In my opinion, what we are doing is wrong perhaps for a very right motive and we are trying to minimise the damage and injustice we are doing.  I do not like that, but there is not much we can do about it.  It would be ungenerous not to acknowledge the two facts I have mentioned, namely, that the Minister went as far as he could at that stage in the special committee and he adopted the suggestion made by the Chairman, which was probably a majority decision of the Committee on that day. I would like to record here my continued minority objection to the principle and fear that this method, by simply reducing the liability which in the first place should not have been imposed in this way, is inadequate.</P>

      <P>For reasons over which I had no control I am at a disadvantage <Col N="1777" /> because I was unable to be present in the special committee at the discussion on this section, from which the amendments the Minister put forward have arisen.  Nevertheless, I find myself in very substantial agreement with what Deputy de Valera has just said.  It is true that if there are methods of tax evasion they ought to be dealt with by the Minister, but, on the other hand, it is not true that in order to do so he ought to bring about a situation which can do serious damage to the genuine taxpayers concerned&mdash;who form the majority.  I gathered from what the Minister said that the nature of the problem relates to profits being undistributed, the company then being liquidated and it being possible to get those profits in an untaxed condition. I doubt if it will be beyond the wit of the Revenue Commissioners to devise a solution to this other than that implied in this amendment and section, a solution which will not lead to the penalising of quite a number of genuine companies and which cause the Minister to bring in, as he had to do here, an amendment to give relief from an imposition which he is making in order to close a gap which exists.  The implications of this, I believe, can be quite serious for certain activities, some of which are extremely important in the economic life of the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister has, I am certain, received representations in this regard. It seems to me, it would be worth his while to give further consideration to devising another solution which could be put forward, if necessary, in the other House.  He can be assured, if that happens, of no delay in this House in dealing, as would be necessary, with any amendments made in the other House.  However, I am at the disadvantage that I mentioned.  But if I am right in thinking that the nature of the problem relates to the manner in which profits were dealt with on the liquidation of certain private companies, surely it must be possible to relate the solution to the problem to that aspect rather than, as is being done here, imposing an additional charge on all the service companies every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1778" /> The Minister said there should not be a distinction between the taxation of activities carried on by a company as against those carried on by individuals where it is the same kind of activity.  I am paraphrasing what he said, but I believe that is the sense of what he said.  Of course, he had to go ahead and admit that there is a difference. The real problem I see is that not only is there a difference, but as a direct consequence of what is being done here certain kinds of service companies which have been in existence perhaps for many years will now be subjected to additional taxation at a time when they can ill afford any further drain on their overheads, their cash flow.  They are being subjected to this, not for reasons of revenue, not for reasons of the Minister taking the view that equity so requires it, but solely for the reason of trying to close a certain loophole of which they are not availing themselves at all.  It seems to be a wrong approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>I would again urge the Minister, even at this late stage, to see if it is not possible to devise a solution which will not affect the day to day working of ordinary service companies, who form the great majority of those being affected by this provision.  Despite the relief proposed in the amendment I doubt if it is any great relief.  In the example the Minister gave, while there is a fall in the necessary impact of the tax, nevertheless there is an increase in the impact of the taxation involved, which should not be involved under this section.</P>
    <P>There is one other drafting matter, to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention, in relation to amendment No. 5.  It occurs approximately half way through the amendment where there is a reference to section 100 (4) (5).  I assume what is intended to be conveyed there is subsections (4) and (5) of section 100.  If that is what is intended to be conveyed I suggest it might be worded that way.  Perhaps I am misinterpreting it but I do not think I have ever seen a reference of the kind which appears to be in this amendment which reads:</P>
    <P>have the meanings assigned to them by section 100 (4) (5).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1779" /> It is purely a drafting matter but I believe that could be improved.  If the Minister thinks so there would be no difficulty on this side of the House about doing it across the floor of the House.</P>

      <P>I can understand Deputy Colley's point but I am assured that this is the formula which is invariably used by the parliamentary draftsman and if we were to depart from this formula we would generate more confusion than by continuing existing practices.  The formula is used in the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>

      <P>The meaning of that is quite clear in the context.  Perhaps <Col N="1780" /> I am raising an unnecessary point but to me the reference in the amendment is almost unintelligible.  I have never seen a reference to it in that way.  The one in subsection (2) of section 21 is not similar.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is happy about it I am not making a major point of it.

I will not pursue the matter any further.  If the Minister is happy with it, that is all right with me.</P>

      <P>I was happy with it until the Deputy raised the question. Maybe I will be as happy about it when I think about it again.  The further you go into this the more you wonder whether studying it helps you. At page 139 subsection (7) we see: &ldquo;In the Corporation Tax Acts a reference to a Part, section or schedule is to a Part or section of, or schedule to, the Act in which the reference occurs, and a reference to a subsection, paragraph or subparagraph is to the subsection, paragraph or subparagraph of the provision (including a schedule) in which the reference occurs, unless it is indicated that reference to some other enactment or provision is intended.&rdquo; One sometimes wonders why it is necessary even to put that into the Bill.</P>

      <P>These statements are no more than references to help people to understand the meaning.  It is better to stick to established practices than to adopt new ones which might, perhaps, create difficulties. However, I will bring the Deputy's remarks to the notice of the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the section generally, I mentioned in the select committee a number <Col N="1781" /> of cases which show there is a need to stop some very serious abuses. I do not want to go into them all again.  I have 12 horror stories here. It is unnecessary for me to give full particulars again.  It might be desirable to put some of them on the record so that people will see there is a good reason to try to do something to stop practices which have been developing.  In a large number of cases the companies which have been formed are not necessary for the carrying on of the professions in respect of which the corporations are created.  There are some professions in which it is not permissible to conduct the profession through the form of a corporation.  To some extent this has been got around, as it were, while not in any way transferring professional responsibility to a corporation, by setting up service companies to such professions and putting aside into the service companies profits which are properly attributable to the profession rather than to the operations of the service companies.</P>
    <P>The kind of operation we are trying to stop can best be illustrated by a partnership which I will call A B and Company.  This is a firm which is carrying on a professional business which does not necessitate the formation of a company.  It has four partners. In a recent year it had profits of over £400,000.  The principal participators in these profits were Mr. M who took £12,000 and assigned £135,000 to his own family company, Mr. N who collected £30,000 directly and put £28,000 into his family company, Mr. O who was paid £20,000 directly and put £39,000 into his family company, and Mr. P who collected £7,000 and put £39,000 into his own family company.</P>
    <P>The result of that operation was that there was a loss in taxation of £62,000, which is quite a whack.  I do not think it is right that the Legislature should permit its intentions to be frustrated.  The intention of the Legislature is that people in identical occupations and with similar incomes should pay similar amounts of tax, subject to whatever personal allowances they may be entitled to.  The <Col N="1782" /> intention of the Legislature is being frustrated to a very serious extent by permitting the operation of artificial situations which people can design in order to avoid a very considerable amount of tax.</P>
    <P>Another case concerns a partnership which made up its accounts to a date in a recent year and distributed £13,000 to one of the partners and put £19,000 into that partner's family company, £13,000 to the other partner and £19,000 into the second partner's company, making a total of £64,000. The after tax income of the first family company was £10,000, all of which was retained in the company. The second family company's share of the profits after payment of tax also amounted to £10,000, none of which was distributed.  So, there was £20,000 which did not bear higherrate tax.</P>
    <P>There are innumerable cases of service companies retaining massive sums and distributing them by way of non-repayable loans to the directors at purely nominal interest rates, which are massive advantages which are not available to people who conduct their business in a personal capacity.  There are several cases of firms liquidating the service companies so as to give themselves very substantial tax free distributions.  There is one such company which I shall call company O. It provides what are called services for a professional firm.</P>
    <P>The accounts of the service company for a recent year disclosed profits of over £150,000 and the unappropriated profit at the balance sheet date was £192,000.  No subsequent accounts had been lodged but it has now been stated that the company ceased business last year.  A predecessor service company for the same accountancy firm ceased business about six years ago and on ceasing business distributed £146,000 to the partners of the professional firm by way of a bonus issue and its subsequent redemption.  Five years ago £88,000 was distributed to the partners in the same manner by another such company.  One may reasonably assume that the accumulated profits of £192,000 in the hands of the service <Col N="1783" /> company to which I have previously referred, together with whatever amounts have been accumulated by it over the last few years, have been or will soon be distributed tax-free by way of a redemption of a bonus issue.</P>
    <P>Those are not practices the House can endorse.  I am not saying the manner of dealing with them here is ideal in all respects but I suggest we are providing a measure of adequate opportunity for people who want to set aside a sum for the maintenance and development of a firm without allowing people to abuse the tax provisions and the legal system in order to give themselves massive tax-free gains.</P>
    <P>The alternative to handling it in the way we are doing in this Bill is to look through all these service companies to see who are the ultimate beneficiaries and to apportion the respective profits which the beneficiaries in those companies hope to get and to tax them at the appropriate rate.  In the cases to which I have made reference the appropriate rate of taxation would be 77 per cent, not the effective 58 per cent that will apply under this section.  We are still leaving advantages to people who have service companies. We consider we have at least closed the floodgates against the avoidance abuses that have been growing recently.  It will not be so attractive now to engage in many of these practices but it will be sufficiently attractive for those who genuinely want to provide means to develop a business to do so and pay a lesser rate of tax on income which is not distributed in order that it may be reinvested.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendment to the House.  We will see how it operates in practice and if there is a need to change it, either to tighten it or to provide some alternative system, I am certain that future legislators will be prepared to make the necessary adjustments.  If it is deemed necessary to give reliefs, they can be given.  I am not saying this because I consider one should avoid making the right decisions now or be indifferent even <Col N="1784" /> to the temporary consequences of legislation.  I am saying that we need to have a period during which the law, as amended, will operate to see if it will be effective in allowing firms to withhold a reasonable amount for the maintenance and development of firms and will also be such as to discourage in future the kind of taxavoidance practices which have operated in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a revision and amendment of the law and it is also in a sense a consolidation measure.  Broadly speaking, the Bill takes corporate bodies, namely, companies and it purports to treat them separately from the income tax code&mdash;the House will note I have not used the word &ldquo;removed&rdquo;.  The Bill proposes to amalgamate the two taxes relevant to corporate bodies, namely, corporation profits tax and income tax.  The Bill consolidates these two taxes and substitutes for them a new tax that will be known as corporation tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At first sight it appears we are doing here what we did more thoroughly with the capital legislation, namely, to remove the subject-matter of this legislation from the ambit of the <Col N="1785" /> income tax code and to set up a code itself. The House will recollect that with regard to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, the Capital Gains Bill and the Wealth Tax Bill, there was an initiation of a capital code that to a large extent was made an independent and separate code from the income tax code.  Here the intention was similar but, for practical reasons that can easily be appreciated, it has not been possible completely to separate them. It is to be appreciated at the outset that even though income tax and corporation profits tax are being amalgamated in the new tax, the provisions of the income tax code, so far as it impinges on corporate bodies, will still be relevant.</P>
    <P>The income tax code will be more intimately associated with this legislation than it was with the capital legislation.  This is inevitable.  It was done in a commendable way in that the staff work avoided the mysterious method of legislation by reference and did it as explicitly as they could in the Bill.  The Bill as a model <i>pro tanto</i> to that extent is to be commended. The staff work involved in its preparation is worthy to be considered a model.  Nevertheless, in practical terms no accountant, lawyer or company could consider this Bill without keeping a watchful eye on the income tax code as a whole.</P>
    <P>I say these things as statements of fact about the Bill and not in a critical manner.  In the complexity of the situation it was a difficulty and, by and large, a practical and commendable solution to the problem was found.  There are 256 pages in the Bill, 188 sections taking up practically 163 pages with the remainder being devoted to Schedules.  Undoubtedly, some contraction in volume of this document could have been achieved but it would have only been achieved at the expense of legislation by reference. I have no doubt that the correct thing was done here.  It will be appreciated that with a Bill of this size if the Parliament, and in a democracy such as ours, outside interests of vital economic importance to the community are to be consulted, <Col N="1786" /> opportunity to study the measure must be made available.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that an effort in that line was not made.  The White Paper was published in ample time and the Bill, taking everything into account, was circulated in sufficient time.  Representations were sought from affected bodies and this was all done in an open-handed way. Deputies had the Bill long enough to be able to make a study of it.  However, the real study of a Bill of this nature takes place on Committee Stage.  It is only during Committee Stage that we have a debate although Deputies can form their opinions after reading the Bill.  A Bill like this is extremely technical for most of us and there are very few, if any, who have experience of the whole field. We largely rely on the give and take on Committee Stage to clarify our own thoughts.  If we do sufficient home work in these circumstances then the Parliament can be an effective instrument in perfecting legislation.  That Parliament should be in such a position of preparation and have such opportunity is particularly important on a measure of this nature.  I venture to say that years of careful study by experienced and competent staff preceded the issue of such a document.  This measure is the product of careful and honest work by experts who knew what they were doing and took the trouble to study the matter.</P>
    <P>If we are to play our role in it we should be able to avail of this staff work and inject the political and other broadly social aspects in it.  I feel that one of the defects of our democratic system as it is developing is the lack of sufficient prior indication in detail to those staffs of policies to be pursued.  Therefore, they are left in the position to assume policy which, in prudence, for any staff officer would mean that he is taking, more or less, a continuation of continuing views.  That is a criticism of us and not of them.  I should like to add that I had a little experience as a staff officer and of the preparation of certain types of documents.  I am making my statements aware of <Col N="1787" /> the necessity for leadership in policy at the early stages coupled with an understanding that keeps the policy finger out of the work that staff are doing.</P>
    <P>This seems a little abstract but it is vital for the House and the public to understand where we stand with this Bill.  This is a very good document, and, in all the context, a very fair document.  However, in regard to this very fine piece of work, we have served and are serving no other function that that of the proverbial rubber stamp.</P>
    <P>I want to mention a dilemma the Opposition were in from the beginning. The Bill took a long time to prepare and was slow coming before the House.  A Second Stage debate can never be more than a preliminary, designed to give the House and through it the electors an opportunity in general policy terms to say what should not be in the Bill but more important what should be in the Bill and which is not in it.  What is in the Bill is mainly commendable in many aspects but it is what the Minister has produced and we are here reduced to the role of saying either yes or no when we should be in a position to give a critical analysis.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the dilemma the Opposition were in.  Obviously if you have a measure which is generally good you would not be justified in obstructing or rejecting it simply because you wished some matters of detail adjusted, perhaps even some fundamental matters.  All an Opposition can do is hope to be able to prevail on the Minister at Committee Stage to accept certain amendments. On the other hand, if an Opposition do not play their role it is a very bad thing for democracy.  I hope the Minister will not mind my making a political remark here on a measure which I do not think should be brought into the political field.  If there was one criticism I could offer of the Government parties when they were in Opposition it was that they completely failed as an Opposition to oppose legislation constructively.  We <Col N="1788" /> are here now trying to learn from their mistakes.  I do not know how many times I had to sit behind the Government then, feeling that I had to supply the Opposition which was not forthcoming from the opposite side of the House.</P>
    <P>Those remarks were interjected merely to emphasise the role we have in the House in regard to legislation and which we have to try to discharge in the difficult circumstances of modern time.</P>
    <P>The public should know the reasons advanced by the Minister for the urgency of this legislation, namely, that it is desirable in the interests of the country's commerce that the Bill should become law in this financial year.  I understand as well there were external considerations.  We are not an isolated country any longer, because we have relations and agreements with other countries and it therefore became desirable that this legislation should become law as quickly as possible. The Minister put that point to us before we went into Committee, and reluctant though we were to allow the Committee to become merely a window-dressing operation, that is what the facts made the Committee.</P>
    <P>The Committee went through the Bill in a short time, relying on the advice which the Minister gave to the Committee and which he in turn had available to him.  I am glad to say every member of the Committee had the greatest confidence in the advice given to the Minister and to the Committee, and even though we were a rubber stamp, will still put our <i>imprimatur</i> to the Bill confidently because of that advice.  One thing perturbed me in this respect.  We were singularly fortunate in being able to deal with two branches of the administration, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, in this matter and I regret to say I would not feel the same confidence in regard to other Departments, other areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill comes before us very much an instrument of the Minister.  We had some difficulty in proceeding at Report Stage because we did not have the verbatim report of the proceedings of <Col N="1789" /> the Committee.  Therefore at this moment I am forced to rely on my memory and we all know our memories can be inaccurate sometimes. Therefore I ask the indulgence of the House, the Minister and his advisors, if I inadvertently misunderstood some of the Committee proceedings.</P>
    <P>Let me take the Bill now and what is in it.  I have already mentioned it combines income tax payable by corporate bodies with corporation profits tax and charges it at the rate specified in the Bill.  From the point of view of financial impost there is little change but I think it is only right to remark that what little change there is is, as one might expect, will be in favour of the Revenue.  I think it is marginal but I think a little more will accrue to the Exchequer as a result of this legislation. I shall come back to that in a moment.  I am talking about the incidence of the rate of tax.  I think the rate struck is marginally, shall I say, in favour of the Revenue or, to put it in another way, nothing is given though there are reliefs later.</P>
    <P>The next point is that companies managed and controlled in Ireland, whether incorporated in this country or not, will now be captured for the purpose of corporation tax on a world profit basis.  The situation in regard to companies outside Ireland, and agencies and so on, is complex and I do not think I could attempt an analysis now.  It does not call for detailed discussion here but it certainly does call for study by all interested parties.  Not only have you got the tax but you also have embodied here the provisions of capital gains tax where corporate bodies are concerned for corporate capital gains. They are dealt with in the Act.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the income tax code and the rules under it remain very relevant.  So far as large companies are concerned that will be largely a matter for their accounting advisers.  In the imposition of corporation tax where the 50 per cent rate applies, there is a relief on profits up to £5,000 which would be 40 per cent and then an intermediate scale between <Col N="1790" /> £5,000 and £10,000.  This is evidence of an attempt to face the realities.</P>
    <P>The payment dates and accounting periods are again a matter for consideration and should have been a matter for more detailed debate than we could give it in the Committee.  All I can say is that accountants will have the problem of dealing with this.  There are certain provisions that may, so to speak, put forward, if I may put it in very general terms, the payment of tax in certain cases which could conceivably in the case of an individual company raise an additional cash flow problem at a particular time.  Whether or not that would be serious I am not in a position to say.</P>
    <P>With regard to capital allowances the position is essentially the same as it was but again there is a change in the time element and whether that is advantageous or disadvantageous may depend on the particular case.  There are procedural changes which do not go to the substance.  There are certain changes in regard to provisions for the declaration of dividends.  The most important warning here is that the income tax code cannot be ignored and all these matters are in the nature of adjustments by legislation and I think a particular judgment would be that they in themselves do not affect the existing situation very materially.  In regard to dividends or distributions, however, there is a major policy matter to which I should refer.  Capital distributions are strongly discouraged. Revenue distributions, except for changes in mechanics, appear to remain more or less the same.  It would be very advantageous from a commercial or taxation point of view to prefer revenue dividents and I rather think the reason for this policy is the consciousness of tax abuses and essentially this approach is a tax avoidance measure.</P>
    <P>One can sympathise with the Revenue Commissioners here and perhaps this is the occasion to make a remark which many people feel should be made and the remark is directed as much to the advisers of companies as it is to the directors.  It is a very unfortunate fact that company law and the advantage of a limited company has been so frequently <Col N="1791" /> used and abused in an effort to avoid the payment of tax and to secure a financial advantage through the evasion of tax which, if not legally, would be equitably due.</P>
    <P>If the Revenue Commissioners and Ministers from time to time have had to bring in legislation which has created hardship and difficulty for genuine trading companies and have had to introduce provisions which were restrictive on legitimate and commendable economic activity, it is because there has been far too much ingenuity in the past in seeking devices by which the payment of taxes can be unfairly avoided or using the code and the advantages of limited liability to defraud the Revenue.</P>
    <P>This is basically one of the reasons for Bills of this nature and annual Finance Acts.  Both the Minister now in office and the former Minister now sitting beside me will not contradict me when I say this: it is not bloody-mindedness on the part of the Revenue Commissioners or Ministers or politicians that have imposed the restrictions; it has been the amoral attitude of a minority of people who have been using the legislation provided for limited liability for wrong purposes, and in that indictment I am sorry to say one cannot exonerate all professional advisers on such matters.</P>
    <P>I am labouring this because it has a great bearing on the content of this Bill, on the understanding and appreciation of what is in this Bill.  I am labouring this because the <i>bona fide</i> trading unit which is of benefit to the community and particularly to high employment content industries suffer from restrictions that come about in this way.  Furthermore, the tendency to hold the revenue-collecting authorities of this State up to odium stems very largely from the same cause.  As far as legitimate trading and economic activity is concerned, I think that within the constraints of reality a very good job has been done.  With regard to the complaints, I can only say that if there is to be blame it should be put in the right quarter.</P>
    <P>These remarks, a Leas-Cheann <Col N="1792" /> Comhairle&mdash;and I thank you for your indulgence&mdash;are not, as I hope to show, irrelevant to the Bill, because there are a couple of sections in it which, even at this late stage, I want to urge the Minister to reconsider, if not now when this Bill is going through, at a later stage.  At least it will be on the record that there was an appeal for reconsideration in the light of experience.  I want to make it quite clear the reasons why I am doing this so that the representations I make and that have already been made in another way to the Minister will not simply appear to be those of interested parties made for selfish purposes, but will be seen as being for genuine public purposes and in the public interest.  I do not have to say we are not opposing the Bill, but the criticism I am going to make of certain sections is necessary and desirable. In so doing let us keep a balance and see the good things, too.</P>
    <P>When I was talking about the incidence of the 50 per cent and pointed out that there was perhaps a tilly for the Revenue in this change, I should also, in fairness, say that, generally speaking, the relief for losses in the Bill is more satisfactory than it has been, and questions of set-off and various matters like that have been very fairly considered and treated.  There are reliefs, and there was a sympathetic attitude shown to the remarks we had to make in the Committee.  Existing reliefs like export sales relief, Shannon relief and other such things continue unchanged. There is little effective change in the treatment of corporate capital gains, and perhaps, on balance, if there is any change at all it is not unfavourable.  I am trying to highlight some of the things that strike me here in regard to the content and effect of the Bill as a whole. In summary one can say that the measure is commendable.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters that I would like to deal with at some length. There is a recognition, and there has to be a recognition, that we are now in a wider area of economic activity than we were before our entry into Europe.  Not only is there the <Col N="1793" /> question of our relation with the EEC but there is also the international trade.  The development of the so-called multi-national companies, the closer association of the foreign companies in trading in our area and so on, have all posed problems.  An attempt has been made to be realistic about this.  We will have to accept the fact that in the give and take of trading there are advantages conferred, or rationalisation achieved, where non-Irish based companies are concerned.  I would characterise that approach as common sense but there may be people who, in a failure to appreciate the realities of commercial life, feel that we have not been restrictive enough in relation to purely home activity.  To them one has to say that we are not living in an isolated world any more and if there are criticisms of this Bill, its provisions can be justified.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises the modern tendency&mdash;I am now talking about normal commercial practice and not abuse&mdash;to group companies and to develop an organisation of companies. Until relatively recently, particularly in Ireland, the company was a corporate body, in contemplation of law, analogous to the individual and it functioned with certain legal rights and privileges.  Gradually the system has grown up of organising companies into groups and agglomerates for a concerted legitimate commercial purpose. This growth was not visualised when the 1908 Act was passed or even when the 1963 Act was passed. During the last decade this has obviously assumed different proportions. It was likely to cause problems for the companies themselves, for the trading interests concerned and for the revenue authorities.  This was rationalised in this Bill, reliefs are given and an element of order has been imported into this so far as taxation is concerned.</P>
    <P>Of course, this raises what I call the philosophical question about the desirability of the encouragement and development of these large agglomerates. Of course, that is as much a social as an economic question.  It is a particularly important question from <Col N="1794" /> two points of view that are not directly relevant to this debate, namely, the points of view of the employee and the consumer.  So far as taxation is concerned, an element of order is introduced here, reliefs are given where they should be and loopholes have been closed where possible.  That was the correct thing to do.</P>
    <P>The broader policy aspect may arise when a revision of company law is introduced.  There is a deep social question here but I would not like any feeling of confusion about the function in this Bill in that regard to emanate from this House.  This Bill deals only with a very restricted area and seems to be confining itself to its own business and making definite provisions.</P>
    <P>There was ample food and material in this Bill for debate in Committee and possibly for disagreement on detail.  If I were to make a general statement about the Bill as a whole I would say that we have not been in a position to balance the very natural and correct attitude of one aspect of the Minister's advice, namely, the need for preventing abuse and tax avoidance. We were not in a position to carry out this examination and, in that sense, we were not in a position to help. Not being in a position to help would not justify us in hindering it now.</P>
    <P>There are some provisions in this Bill on which I would like to comment, I tried earlier to put our views into perspective in proportion and I will give the reasons for this now.  I want to deal with section 84, with section 94 which makes provision for close companies, and section 162.  It would not be in order if I were to deal with them in a Committee sense, but a comment and our attitude to what they do would be in order on my part.</P>
    <P>This is not simple legislation.  I should really go back to sections 10, 11 and 12 but I cannot open up the Committee Stage debate nor do I want to.  Representations have been made to the Minister and to the Opposition that section 84 has a certain discriminatory provision against non-resident lenders.  It raises the question, first of all, of homogeneity of our thought with the European Commanity <Col N="1795" /> and also the practical question of inter-relation of foreign trade in the world today.</P>
    <P>This section would probably have the effect of making borrowing more expensive in certain circumstances because interest would not be allowable as a deduction in computing profits.  It has been urged on the Minister&mdash;I will not repeat the argument&mdash;by accountants and others that this section should be reviewed.  I will content myself now, within the confines of this debate, in referring to this section, which deals with matters to be treated as distribution, by suggesting that when the Minister brings this Bill to the other House, which is a Money Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate in the other House will, therefore, be rather restricted.  Unless the Minister feels it is necessary there is no need, in curtesy, to reply to me unless he wishes to correct a misstatement on my part or wishes to make a public statement. I will not take it in any way as a slight if he does not reply to some of the things I am saying.  I will leave section 84 with the simple exortation that the Minister still has an opportunity to consider the representations in this matter that have been made to him particularly by the accounting profession. This is customary in a Bill of this nature.  The Minister consults such people and, also, as is customary, such bodies and interests submit their comments, recommendations and provisions to the Minister.  In this case the comments and submissions have been very carefully considered by the staff dealing with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also a natural democratic and parliamentary procedure that the Opposition are very often informed of those points as well in order that they may raise them and press them.  That is a correct function of the democratic process.  We are aware of those representations but we were only able to touch on them in the committee, which disposed of as many as 100 sections in a session.  When any committee dispose of up to 100 sections while you are looking around you need to have <Col N="1796" /> a very active arm to put the stop down in time.  Would the Minister consider having the points that have been made on section 84, even at this late hour, looked at and approached in the same spirit as he approached the amendment that we had on the Report Stage, although I am afraid I took it with rather bad grace?</P>
    <P>The next part of the Bill I want to comment on is Part X, section 94, Close Companies.  Here we should also recognise that those provisions are made necessary because of the abuses in certain quarters formerly.  One fears one cannot hope for a sudden reformation of human nature in this regard. The section refers to the abuses which could be achieved if some such provision were not included.  Every member of the Committee, including the Opposition members, wish to support the Minister and his administration in setting their faces against the improper use of legislation to avoid the payment of tax.  The Minister said in the Committee that we were scandalised.  May be we were not scandalised, or even surprised, but we could well understand and realise that what the Minister was telling us was a problem, the type of ingenuity that could be used to effect a very substantial degree of tax evasion which would hit the ordinary taxpayer.</P>
    <P>When people avoid paying large sums of tax&mdash;and this should be realised all round&mdash;other people have to pay for that.  In the same way the taxpayer has to pay for social services, and so on.</P>
    <P>I mentioned on Committee Stage the person who had a refractory disease of his foot and the doctor solved the problem by chopping his head off.  That would be too strong a statement in regard to the provisions about close companies.  The Minister may very well capture a wider area than he intends to.  There may be cases, within the technical and strict meaning of the law as defined in company law which may be close but are functioning perfectly <i>bona fide</i>, and very much in the interests of the public in their economic and commercial activities, and very much in the interests of their employees and public shareholders.  In such clearly <i>bona fide</i> cases, I should <Col N="1797" /> like the Minister to consider a suggestion made in committee.  Perhaps an element of discretion should be allowed to the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners require a firm and unequivocal power which will not commit them to any inconsistency of precedent but will enable them to deal with the type of abuse the Minister has in mind but they should have sufficient discretion to deal with genuine cases also.</P>
    <P>As I said, perhaps a larger area will be captured than was intended.  The intention is to capture the private company mechanism which was being abused.  This is a problem we met on the three Bills dealing with the taxation code.  It is also intended to cover the case of a public company within the definition of the company law which could be used to accumulate undistributed profits, or something of that nature, for tax evasion purposes.  The consequence may be that some <i>bona fide</i> and desirable cases may be harshly captured in the same way as the old death duties code impinged with ferocity on the ordinary family. That code might have been fair enough in dealing with very large estates of a certain type, which were common enough when the income tax law was initiated, but it operated very harshly, indeed, on the ordinary middle class testator's family when he died.</P>
    <P>The definition of a close company and these provisions could conceivably cover a wider field than was intended, and may have unfairly restrictive and penal effects on companies which otherwise are absolutely in the clear, and primarily concerned with the interests of people other than those who are technically in control. The Minister has tried to meet what I am saying by making provisions in relation to stock quotations.  But not every company is on the stock exchange. Perhaps I speak heresy when I say what does and does not go on the stock exchange in modern circumstances may be reviewed in the near future.</P>
    <P>The other night one of the EEC Commissioners made the point that, particularly in large companies and <Col N="1798" /> groups of companies, the shareholders have not got real control now.  They are entitled to certain remuneration and, in theory, they have control at the annual meetings.  The reality is that their control has been whittled down to the right to receive monetary distributions. In the long term, the employment of the workers must be safeguarded. I have a feeling rather than something I can pinpoint that the Minister's provision in regard to close companies may be a little more restrictive than he intends.  I am not impugning his intentions.</P>
    <P>I come now to section 162.  If I say anything which is a misrepresentation or a mistake on my part, I will be obliged for a correction here and now to prevent me taking up the time of the House, and so that the Minister will not have to explain in detail afterwards. We had an amendment to the section.  The Minister showed his anxiety to meet this point.  I believe it is wrong in principle.  It is particularly harsh on service companies.  In what I said this morning I may be considered to have been severe on professional advisers.  On the other hand professional advisers fulfil a very important role in commercial activities. They are indispensable.  They are a very important element in maintaining standards and the public interest.  I want to emphasise that because it applies to the majority and also because earlier I criticised the facility with which ingenuity and advice can be used for misguided purposes.  Whether it is the lawyer, the accountant or someone else, they play an important part in maintaining public standards. Therefore, I make no apology for referring to their recommendations to the Minister and pressing them on him, even at this late stage.</P>
    <P>Responsible bodies, representing reputable professions, such as the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institue, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and others, have been almost unanimous in making these recommendations to the Minister.  To some extent, the Minister's own profession will be affected by this legislation also.  The reason I am quoting <Col N="1799" /> them is that it would be too easy to charge them with self-interest.  I am pressing their case now, not <i>ex parte</i> but because the merits and equity of the case demand that it should be presented in this House.  It is our job as parliamentarians to do this.  In our community it is too easy to impute unworthy motives.  One of our weaknesses is a lack of a certain generosity in attributing motives to those among us.  It was Johnson who remarked that the Irish were a fairminded people, they never spoke well of one another. We have that virtue to a fault.</P>
    <P>In the case of a close company a surcharge arises in certain cases.  I agree with the Minister that such companies can be set up and that they have in certain cases been used for wrong purposes but it is unfair to penalise the whole class.  One of the organisations pointed out that the 20 per cent surcharge which bears particularly on the service companies by virtue of section 162 was intended to deal with transactions that were in the nature of tax avoidance devices. That is the kernel of it.</P>
    <P>The section was motivated primarily with that objective in view. That is very well but is it fair to apply that surcharge to a company that is merely a service company and is carrying on a profession?  One must take the historical circumstances into account.  Where formerly there were partnerships, the structure of such partnerships is becoming less and less appropriate to modern conditions and we should realise this. Where partnerships were appropriate organisations in another age, today in a modern environment of complex commercial activities&mdash;instanced by the tendency to organise companies into groups&mdash;and coupled with the complexity of fiscal and other legislation it more and more makes the concept of a simple partnership unworkable in a real sense.  This is true to such an extent that the professional bodies I referred to have found it necessary to encourage their members to acquiesce and condone, later to recognise and perhaps now to encourage members legally to constitute <Col N="1800" /> themselves as corporate bodies.  This has been happening where the great number who have been carrying on that type of business have become incorporated during the years.  In these cases there was no question of tax avoidance.  It was a question of commercial desirability, the requirement of giving the service that was needed.</P>
    <P>They are service companies but they have to be organised in the modern world to give service.  The old partnership and the indefinite organisation that was sufficient heretofore is not sufficient now.  In order to give efficient service and to play their part in a modern complex community these service companies are a desirable part of the economy and should not be penalised.  I will try to bring home the point by an army analogy. In the old days soldiers went out to fight with swords and spears, one section of them on horses and another section on foot.  It was a very simple operation and the food was just carried up but nowadays in a military organisation there are staffs and services of a multifarious kind, all sorts of communications.  The same thing is happening with commerce and business.</P>

      <P>There I disagree with the Minister.  Even the Minister's own profession, which sets its face against its members being anything but either partners or individual practitioners in the older sense, is finding it necessary to have incorporated bodies developed in rather close association with them.  These bodies are not provided merely for selfish or profit-making purposes; they are a necessity to give the service that should be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The surcharge is what I am talking about.  The Minister knows the case that has been made by the Auctioneers and Valuers Institute. Another institute said much the same thing.  That institute said that the proposal may go so far as in many cases to lead to firms having to dispense with staff.  It claims that it will even contribute to the inhibition of the recovery of the economy.  Because of the importance of their service I would not discount that claim completely. The Minister has said they are all the one army but I should like to quote another point made in a case to the Minister:</P>
      <P>We would point out that were professional firms which are incorporated treated as any other company, full tax at the highest rate applicable to the individual will be recovered when and if such retained income can be and is destributed, particularly in view of the more stringent conditions now proposed in respect of distributions of any kind.</P>
      <P>If they are the same army they should be treated the same as any other company.</P>
      <P>The surcharge on service companies is, in a sense, a discrimination against professionally qualified people practising corporately in the service sectors as against persons without any professional qualifications operating corporately within the service of any other sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister took my invitation but I am sorry to hear him say that.  It is unworthy of the Minister.  This is a case where it is unfair to impute too far the motive of special pleading.  I have no <Col N="1802" /> interest in any such service companies and I want to make the case on its merits.  The stark facts&mdash;a phrase used by another body who made representations to the Minister&mdash;are that professional businesses have the same requirements for retaining profits to finance working capital as other trading entities.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister made the point that these companies did not require the same capacity to retain profits for finance working of capital as other trading entities.  On the other hand, many of these professional businesses are now major undertakings with international ramifications which are very important for this country.  It is important that the elements of these service companies here which are associated with corresponding elements in other countries should be strong and influential.  It is they who are keeping up that end of our economy as against the advisers and people in other parts of the world. If we have a service firm here which is properly linked, whether in formal association or by a trade agreement, with a corresponding body in the United States, the UK, or in Europe, it is very important that the Irish company should not only have the same expertise, the same prestige and standing, but comparable resources at its disposal.  It is important so that the interests of the commerce of this country and of the productive firms who require these service companies, and who are maintaining the basic economic activity of the country, should be adequately catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fear&mdash;I do not mean to be slighting in saying this&mdash;that the administrative approach, the so-called administrative mind, may be a little out of touch or judging the thing on the &ldquo;file&rdquo; rather than the reality when it makes the judgment.  I feel the same about the Minister when he makes a judgment.  I fear that because the tangible outgoings of these companies appear to be mainly in the area of the payment of salaries and wages they have not the same claim to have their profits treated as trading profits as other companies.  That, I suggest to the Minister, is a fallacy, a wrong and <Col N="1803" /> dangerous approach, detrimental to the overall economic situation of the country.  Many of them are now major undertakings, labour intensive in an area where we require expertise.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister for a moment reflect on the present feverish activity over the discovery of oil and the need for administrative, legal and financial advice and think of what is involved in that.  A moment's reflection should convince him of the importance of such companies and how the expertise that is there should be developed, and that far from being less useful members of the community, they are playing a comparable role with administrative entities, whether State-employed or otherwise.  Of course they have to face inflation.  I could go on at great length on section 162 but I would probably be infringing on the rules of order by imperceptibly going into Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This surcharge is a discrimination, unfair and unwise.  I know that to try to find a solution that will avoid abuse is difficult, and the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister have my sympathy and I hope my understanding in their problem.  I cannot fault them for their approach but I suggest that the wider basis of this was not appreciated.  We are all the one army and I would say to the Minister in the friendliest way that we would not be living up to our reputation as a very fair people if we took the easy way out and said these representations I have highlighted on this section were made merely for self-interested purposes. That would be unworthy of us and I do not think the Minister would want to press that point.  It is a psychological element against which we should be on our guard.  The fact that a person presses an inequity or a disadvantage because it happens to come within his own purview should not preclude him from making a reasonable representation and that should not be taken to mean that self-interest is the only motive or justification for him doing so.</P>
    <P>If that were to be the case there would be very few of us who could talk about anything with any authority. <Col N="1804" /> When all is said and done none of us can talk sense about anything with which we have not come in contact. Our judgments must be realistic, otherwise we are indulging in doctrinaire academics which have done so much awful damage in the western world in the past decade&mdash;the bees-in-the-bonnet mentality.  Either we are doing that or we are soap-boxing without knowing what we are talking about.</P>
    <P>I have been critical about professional advisory people who have misused their ingenuity, and while talking about these service groups I should like to see greater <i>rapport</i> between them and the State organisations so that there will be more working together rather than an atmosphere of cowboys and Indians.  I suppose a little of the latter game is inevitable.</P>
    <P>Speaking from my knowledge, the abusers and the slick workers are in the minority and there is very real and constructive and useful co-operation between these service professions and the organisations of the State to the common good of the community.</P>
    <P>On section 162 I have quoted these reputable bodies which are not individual firms but the bodies that represent them.  I am not for a moment suggesting that the Minister or his advisers have not considered the representations but if we take note of the trade union organisations, the employer organisations, the farmer organisations, we should immediately in fairness take note of the representations of professional bodies when they talk in general terms and resist what I fear is a tendency in the modern world to treat the professional man and the individual engaged in private business&mdash;I am not talking of the individual <i>entrepreneur</i> engaged in big company activities but the professional man, doctors, lawyers, and so forth and the men in individual businesses&mdash;as if they had not a very stabilising and important role to play and as if they were not a very important element in the matter of the custody and the preservation of human freedoms and individual dignity.  We should very strongly resist anything in the way of penalising them.</P>
    <P>Such representations are worthy of <Col N="1805" /> reconsideration.  I thank the Minister for what he did in relation to this amendment and I urge him to look at the principle I am propounding.  There are two things in this Bill which can amount to discouragement of capital distribution.  I can understand that&mdash;a case can be made on the basis of keeping money invested in industry.  I am not objecting, but when it comes to the surcharge on investment, I wonder is this not going a bit far simply to avoid&mdash;I am back in principle to section 162 but I am on wider ground&mdash; the possibility which undoubtedly is there that undistributed profits can be accumulated and subsequently distributed in such a way that they are either tax-free or subject to an altogether too low rate of tax, quite apart from the fact that there is a delay, a deliberate keeping out of Revenue money that should be paid for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I think that is the gist of the Minister's case on that point and that I accept.  On the other hand, cases can arise for close trading companies doing a <i>bona fide</i> trade, whether within the technical category of a private company or a public company, which are close because of the element of control or anything else, who may have certain possible investments which are never intended to be used for defrauding the Revenue, which in fact are, so to speak, a minor provision for liquidity and also a minor source&mdash;I am talking about genuine trading companies now&mdash;of welcome revenue in the form of a dividend return on their investments.  This can happen for good business reasons.  I find it very difficult to see in a case like that why that should be surcharged.  A particular case in point can happen.  It is not unusual for a fairly large company to be doing business with say, its bank&mdash;and banks have now gone into the category of company groups, many of them multinational&mdash;and to have shares in the bank with which it is operating. One thing that seems to be thriving in this modern world is the international financial industry.  It has happened, perhaps following inflation too, that you have had bonus issues or rights issues on attractive terms by such institutions to existing shareholders. You may have a company, which had <Col N="1806" /> some shares in such a banking institution for very good commercial reasons, that avails itself of such a rights issue and is getting a dividend that may be a small proportion, or a small proportion of its turnover, still something not to be sneezed at.  That this should be subject to a 20 per cent surtax seems to be indefensible, that is, if everything else is in the clear.  It simply means that a company cannot do that kind of thing.  It means that that rights issue, if given at an advantageous rate, would have to be declined.  It means that what would be essentially an Irish investment in another case would have to be declined.  Altogether, when one follows it through from that point of view, there is reason to fear that the provisions in regard to this close company may have unforeseen and undesirable effects because the concept of the close company has been extended so far in order to catch the person who is behaving amorally or even dishonestly.</P>
    <P>That is one aspect of it.  There is another aspect of what can happen, so much so that it would be a debate in itself on what I might call &ldquo;held securities&rdquo; of that nature.  What about a company that has some funds on deposit? I know that in the present economic recession it is very much the rule that companies are in an overdraft situation. Indeed, you could also say to me, and I would have to concede, that in periods of expansion overdrafts are very popular because everybody has the wherewithal and goes after them.</P>
    <P>The situation, as I remarked on another Bill, at the present is that we do not have people taking up the overdrafts that are available.  In any case, is it right&mdash;if you are in overdraft you are paying interest and I am not quarrelling about how that is dealt with for tax purposes&mdash;that when it is <i>bona fide,</i> and the Revenue Commissioners can easily check whether it is <i>bona fide,</i> and I have no objection to standards being laid down for the matter at all&mdash;to say <i>simplicitor</i> that because a company has, and it may be only temporary, a sum on deposit, or is in credit with its bank, it must be surcharged and no company that is in credit with its bank is going to leave <Col N="1807" /> it there and not put it to earning interest. If you have a bit of cash that you are not using immediately, surely the sensible thing would be to make it earn money for you.  But if the effect is going to be that when you are in that position, and it can often be only a temporary position, you have to pay 20 per cent surtax on it if you do not distribute it, then that is crazy.  What about a company that has made provision for money to buy machinery, a prudent institution that is not just recklessly taking chances on overdrafts, or maybe cannot get an overdraft, and delivery times or some dispute means that they keep that money on deposit temporarily, why should that money be subject to surtax?  I have warned the Minister I can be wrong.  In certain respects I can be misreading, but this is the way I see it.  Lastly, on that particular point, is it good public policy to insist that moneys are distributed in dividends? We listened to a great deal about this and I think we even heard the Minister on other elements of this Bill talking about the discouragement of capital distributions and about ploughing back profits.  We heard a great deal of talk inside and outside the House about keeping the money in the business.  This is more than ever necessary now.  The social evil, the motivation to tax evasion which the Minister is seeking to block, and rightfully so, is the desire by individuals to get cash into their hands for private purposes.  Surely to have a provision in a Bill designed to force the distribution of dividends is, to say the least of it, out of line with the concept of ploughing back and encouraging the ploughing back of profits.  If a close company has other investment interest that cannot be brought within the category of trading profit or has a deposit in the course of its business on which it is earning interest&mdash;that could happen temporarily&mdash;I can conceive that in the course of business it would be perfectly possible and, indeed, in the old economics it would have been desirable, to have a liquid reserve all the time.</P>
    <P>I know fashions are changing but I believe Dickens' economic theories <Col N="1808" /> are ultimately proving to be sounder than those of the moderns.  If a company has a monetary return it has to distribute it in dividends to its shareholders or else pay a 20 per cent surtax on it.  In other words, it is purely a case of the Revenue wanting the money or the Minister wanting the money and the social purpose is put completely in the background.  If the Minister cannot get the money because the dividend is distributed he will take the other way.  I would like him to recollect that in taking the money the other way he is encouraging the distribution of money which, from the point of view of the public and from the point of view of the enterprise and those employed in it, would be better kept in the company working for the company.</P>
    <P>This provision is in the Bill for two fiscal reasons.  One reason is quite understandable and we give it full support.  It is to prevent the abuses and I am with the Minister there. However, I think those abuses could be prevented without going as far as the Bill does.  The second reason I would like to argue and would have argued on Committee Stage is that the Minister wants the money now.  If the profits are accumulated then whatever tax payable on distribution will be deferred.  That is arguable and I do not think I would subscribe to it.</P>
    <P>Finally, having been vehement enough in presenting the case in the way I did, I wish to say in a balanced way that what I have said is pleading the case strongly without, perhaps, adequately adverting to the whole structure of how the tax is taken out of the company.  When I talked about the second element, namely, getting the money now, the fact that the profits are maintained in the company, we have to go back to earlier sections providing for the manner in which dividends are paid and the relations between companies where one company has an investment in another.  I want it to be quite clear I recognise all this but unfortunately we are not on Committee Stage and we could not deal with the matter in Committee and so the Bill has not been properly handled in Committee. It had no Committee Stage at all <Col N="1809" /> really.  However, I shall not delay the House or the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to make one or two comments.  When we were finishing the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill we felt we should say it was a good Bill and a proper Bill. In my earlier remarks I have said what is to be praised in this Bill particularly in regard to its drafting and its presentation.  It is desirable that such a Bill should come.  I believe it is the product of years of preparation. It is generally in accordance with the White Paper, another point to be noted because it shows a certain consistency of thought and there is no element of surprise.  That will be acknowledged by everyone.  There are naturally, as with all new Bills of this nature, elements of uncertainty and incidental elements of a little hardship maybe here and there and maybe a little indulgence here and there. With the exception of the matters I mentioned, particularly the close company section 62, this seems to me an acceptable Bill by and large.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the product of staff work and effort of which this Parliament and the country can be proud. It is, perhaps, unusual for us to do this but, having regard to the burden that the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and the Minister's advisers had in this revision of tax legislation, it is only right to recognise the strength, the ability and the objectivity of those who prepared this legislation.  I would have liked a little more clearsighted policy at the beginning which would possibly have made the task of these people easier but, within their terms of reference, they have done a really excellent job. Unusual as it is for us to comment on such matters here I, as a Member of the House, believe that the presentation of this Bill is in no way inferior to the best produced anywhere else. Perhaps it is very much akin to corresponding British legislation but, fortunately or unfortunately, depending on the way one looks at it, our economy and conditions here generally are closely akin, perhaps too close in the financial sense in the light of what has happened and is happening across <Col N="1810" /> the water at the moment; but, be that as it may, a good job of work has been done and all I can say to the Minister is that he and the House have been well served.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very full exposition given by Deputy de Valera there is very little I want to say or, indeed, could say that would not be repetition of what Deputy de Valera said.  However, the first point I want to make is a repetition of something he has just said, that is, to endorse fully and wholeheartedly a tribute which Deputy de Valera has paid to the staff involved in the preparation of this legislation and in advising the Minister at all stages and, through him, making their advice available to the House.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear, least there be any doubt about it, that this Bill had its genesis quite a few years ago. There was a White Paper issued in 1972 and, as a result of representations then received and further thought being given, there was a further White Paper in 1974 followed eventually by this Bill.  The matters contained in the Bill are so numerous that if one were to take them in any detail one would be here for a very long time, but basically what the Bill is doing is bringing into one code, and making necessary changes, the taxation of companies.  In the process it is bringing us much nearer into line than we were with the taxation of companies in the European Economic Community.  That is of itself desirable.</P>
      <P>Inevitably there are aspects of this Bill with which we are not happy, and Deputy de Valera has explained what those elements are.  But, subject to that, the Bill is a worthwhile measure. I am not in a position to comment on the complaints which Deputy de Valera felt obliged to make in regard to the Committee Stage of this Bill, because I was unable to be present at most of the meetings.  However, I do know that the speed with which it was dealt with, having regard to the content of the Bill, is a situation in which, as the Taoiseach would say, <i>res ipsa loquitur.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one looks at the sheer volume of this Bill and then opens it at any point <Col N="1811" /> and reads a section of it, one has some concept of the technicalities involved. If one then recalls the principle of the law, that ignorance of the law is no excuse, and therefore that all our unfortunate citizens are deemed to have full knowledge of the contents of this Bill and act accordingly, one realises how true it was for Dickens when he said, &ldquo;The law is an ass&rdquo;.  It also makes one wonder about the whole system whereby we carry on this fiction.  The fact of the matter is that, apart from a handful of experts, perhaps one or two in the Revenue Commissioners and probably not many more outside, there is going to be nobody in this country who will know in full detail what this Bill is all about.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that as a criticism of this Bill.  It applies to all Bills.  We are tending to enact legislation which is more and more complex and which has long since passed not only out of the ken of the ordinary citizen but out of the ken of many experts who are only experts in certain branches of these enactments.  I am afraid that the whole area of taxation may soon become the preserve not of the experts but of culled branches of the experts that are made up of a handful of people who, because they are advising the Minister, whoever he may be, because they are advising taxpayers, particularly large-scale taxpayers, are, in effect, determining to a great extent the practical application of our code of taxation.</P>
    <P>I say this because it is a matter that is causing me concern, because it is a matter that is becoming of increasing importance.  It does not apply only to this Bill but it applies with particular force to this Bill.  I do not suggest that the Minister has any remedy in his hands for this problem.  I am simply drawing attention to the fact that it is a problem and that it is becoming more acute.  I think it behoves all of us to give some thought to the dangers and to some method whereby we could devise a simpler system that would give control back into the hands of a much wider section of citizens.</P>
    <P>The answer lies in the phrase I have <Col N="1812" /> used, to &ldquo;devise a simpler system&rdquo;. The degree to which these matters are becoming so complex and technical is the degree to which control in this area is being lost to a very small number of people.  As I say, I do not suggest that I have or that the Minister should have the solution to this problem ready at hand, but it is important that we should be alerted to the growing danger and that we should begin to give serious thought to how the problem may be tackled.</P>
    <P>Subject to that and, speaking of this Bill itself, with the reservations already outlined, we believe this Bill is worth while, that it will be of assistance generally in the administration of tax on corporations, assistance not only from the revenue side but in many instances also from the point of view of the corporate taxpayers.  Anything that does that is worth while, and therefore this Bill has our support.</P>

      <P>I anticipate, I think not unreasonably, that while we have debated this matter since half past ten this morning, most media attention will be given to the remarks of Deputy Vivion de Valera on the question of the status and standing of Parliament, and endorsed at somewhat shorter length by Deputy Colley.  Deputy de Valera is a well-known champion of the rights, power and duties of this House, and he deserves credit for that.  On a number of occasions, as he said, when he was on this side of the House he was critical of the Government of the day for their failure to consult sufficiently with the House or to have sufficient regard for the rights of individuals as against the Executive.  On a number of occasions he was generous enough to pay tribute to the Opposition of the day for their criticism of various governmental measures.  But I suppose his period in Opposition has led him to be less generous than he used to be in acknowledging the attitude of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties when in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe he has less cause to be generous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He was referring this morning to our behaviour in Opposition. <Col N="1813" /> He used to regard us as defenders of the liberties of the people.  He has been critical of me, in particular since I crossed the House, and suggested that I had a change of personality because I defended certain Executive attitudes, stands and proposals which caused him some surprise.</P>
      <P>Out of total respect for this House, its institutions and the way it works, I want honestly to refute Deputy de Valera's suggestion that this measure has not received adequate consideration. Deputy Colley and I put our signatures to white papers which preceded the introduction of this legislation. In November, 1972, Deputy Colley issued the white paper on Company Taxation in Ireland, 150 pages long and 12,000 copies were printed. I am not sure how many were bought or used.  In March, 1974, I issued another white paper, of which 7,000 prints were made.  The interest in the original paper must not have materialised to the extent of 12,000 copies. Our white paper presented the criticisms which had been offered of the first white paper and gave the Government's reactions to various submissions which had been made, and listed approximately 20 very reputable bodies and organisations which had made specific representations.</P>
      <P>It is probably true to say that very few Bills received such detailed examination before it was even put in draft form as this Bill.  It was circulated on the 27th November last.  Out of regard for the need to allow an adequate amount of time for the reading of this legislation before the debate took place, a few months passed before we even had the Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For reasons which people who understand corporation tax and general taxation will realise, it is necessary to have this legislation passed before the end of this financial year so that those to whom the law applies will be in a position to put their affairs in appropriate form.  We referred this matter to a Special Committee.  Unfortunately, they had to work during the absence of Deputy Colley.  He understood the urgency relating to the passage of the Bill, but his colleagues and members of all parties made their contributions. <Col N="1814" /> It is of interest to note that when this Bill was debated in the Special Committee, which was only a small proportion of the total number in this House, the number of Members present exceeded the number in this House this morning.  The quorum of that Committee, was six.  Therefore, we had twice the number at any time in that Committee, and most times we exceeded the quorum, than we have in this House now.</P>
    <P>The Bill was examined in detail.  It was not passed through without amendment. There were 60 amendments to the Bill on the Committee Stage.  Some of these arose out of deliberations and comments made on the Second Stage; some came from the Opposition&mdash;two were quite significant and I was happy to circulate them.  I issued 47 amendments before the Committee met; 11 further amendments arose during the course of debate in Committee; ultimately there were five amendments on this Stage.  Considering this Bill had been in gestation for three and a half years before it came into this House for debate, in my view it is very significant that we had such a number of amendments.</P>
    <P>The moral of a Special Committee is that we can work faster and with greater precision because the Committee is held in a room where everybody is on the one level, literally and metaphorically.  People sit around a table and, as a consequence, individual contributors are not so prone to deliver orations as they might feel compelled to do when addressing the nation in this forum.  When one is in a stadium there is an inevitable feeling of confrontation in the air.</P>
    <P>We had a very workman-like passage of this Bill through the Special Committee.  We were greatly helped by the facility of having direct advice available to all the members of the Committee from our distinguished advisers from the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance. While some people might feel that this Bill has been rushed through without ample consideration, I would hope that on reflection they will realise that as much consideration was given to this <Col N="1815" /> Bill as to many other Bills of similar size, notwithstanding the fact that the actual time between the commencement of the debate on the Second Stage and now is not very great.  The Committee worked quite hard and very efficiently.</P>
    <P>A large proportion of this Bill is not creating any new law.  While the volume is large, to some extent it is a consolidation measure because it brings together in one volume existing law.  There was a need to adapt the new suit to the old body, but fundamentally, most of the law in this Bill when passed will be no more than a reflection of existing provisions, but tidying them up for the purpose of the corporation tax which itself is intended to be a tidier version of company taxation than the old combination of three separate taxes&mdash;income tax, corporation profits tax, and capital gains tax. It is a much more efficient system born out of a desire to make its operation more easily understood and to have the tools which will be used under one cover, and they are all brought together in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are two matters I would like to deal with because they were dealt with at some length.  First is section 84 and the suggestion that we should amend the Bill to permit the deduction for the purposes of a trade of interest paid by a resident company to a non-resident company even where the resident company is a 75 per cent subsidiary of the non-resident company.  The purpose of this provision is to prevent the non-resident company from financing the Irish subsidiary by way of loan capital and extracting in the guise of interest, which is tax-deductible, funds which in reality are distributions and not tax deductions.  A deduction for interest accords relief to the paying company at the full corporation tax rate of 50 per cent, whereas if there is a full distribution of the profit the tax payable by the company which they cannot inpute to the shareholders, is 23 per cent.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 84 is to prevent the loss of revenue which <Col N="1816" /> would arise if there was no restriction of the allowance of interest to a non-resident company which control the Irish company and which in respect of the interest is outside the ambit of corporation tax.  It should be noted that for purposes of corporation profits tax, which is not imputable to the shareholder on a distribution, interest paid to a person in control of a company is not deductible.  Another consideration is that if the country of residence of the parent is one with which there are double taxation arrangements on the OECD model&mdash; that is the position in respect of most companies operating in Ireland&mdash; credit would normally be given against the tax of the parent for the full Irish tax underlying any distribution. Accordingly, to accede to the request would involve the Irish Exchequer in a loss of revenue which would inure to the benefit of the Exchequer of the country of residence of the parent.  I suspect that that would not appeal to the national loyalties of Deputy de Valera, Deputy Colley or anybody else in the House.</P>
    <P>We have discussed section 162 at some length and I do not want to prolong the debate.  We had a debate on it on Report Stage but I would like to put a few further remarks on the record to tidy up what I consider are still a number of loose ends.  The purpose of the section is to go some way towards reducing the tax advantage enjoyed by a successful professional person who carries on his profession through the medium of a company where the profits are retained in the company or are extracted in capital form or in liquidation, as compared with another comparable person who carries on a similar profession as an individual or as a partner in a partnership.</P>
    <P>In the first case, the retained profits would, in the absence of section 162 bear tax at the rate of 50 per cent as compared with the rate of 77 per cent in the case of an individual or partnership. The section goes some way&mdash;this is generously acknowledged by the Opposition&mdash;towards achieving equity between the two comparable cases <Col N="1817" /> mentioned by increasing the rate of tax on the retained profits from 50 per cent to 58 per cent under the section as it has now been amended.  That 58 per cent is still 19 per cent below the 77 per cent that would apply to an individual carrying on such a profession.</P>
    <P>Section 162 is restricted in its application to professional activities because those activities depend on the professional skills and personal qualities of individuals and therefore do not require the substantial amounts of capital which are required for the generality of ordinary trading companies to finance stock in trade, plant and machinery and generally to finance the maintenance and development of the business.  I consider much of the remarks of Deputy de Valera this morning as more appropriate to a trading situation than to a professional situation.  In so far as they are related to a trading situation, the Bill is not harming such trading operations because they are not caught by the surcharge of section 162.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that there is a substantial and growing problem of tax avoidance through the medium of companies of the kind which section 162 is concerned about.  I have given examples, a few here today and more in the Committee, which show that, contrary to what is claimed, not only have the shareholders of the service companies in question been able to extract substantial sums from the companies but they have also done so in tax free form.  If we were to extend or to remove the surcharge I cannot visualise that it would be possible to prevent such continued distribution of profits in tax free form without setting up the most elaborate system of assessment which would involve fully looking through all these service companies, as I mentioned earlier today, to see who the ultimate beneficiaries were and taxing them to the full income tax level.</P>
    <P>As already indicated, what is proposed in section 162, as amended will result in a rate of 58 per cent as respects retained profits.  This is the same as the normal combined rate of income tax and corporation profits tax, for <Col N="1818" /> instance, in the years 1970, 1971 and 1972 when corporation profits tax was not allowed as a deduction for income tax purposes.  The removal from the scope of section 162 of companies carrying on professional activities would necessarily involve the introduction of alternative provisions which in principle would then have to be applicable to all close companies and I think we might not be thanked if we were to adopt that line.</P>
    <P>I have done my best to meet the representations.  I believe we have provided a measure of relief.  There are very few Bills which will ever pass through this or any other Parliament which will satisfy all interests and very few tax measures, except those that give relief.  If you give relief only to some and not to others, you generate a sense of grievance which otherwise might not exist.  I am sure we will never achieve a world in which all will be equal and all will be treated equally because we will never be able to agree on what is the appropriate measure of equality.  Even if we reached that ideal we would probably be bored with our existence subsequent to the achievement of that degree of perfection.  We have done our best.  Dáil Éireann can be proud of its handling of this Bill.  I am sorry Deputy de Valera was not here earlier.</P>

      <P>I am sure of that.  I know that the Deputy, both because of his loyalty to Parliament and his personal courtesy, would have been here.  I believe we have given the Bill a very full examination in a comparatively short time, because those who were interested in it and in a position to contribute to it were here.  Let us face it: a large number would not have been in a position to contribute to it just as there are measures which come into the House to which we would not be able to make very helpful contributions.  Those who were in a position to contribute to it contributed very well.  We were certainly greately strengthened, as I said earlier, and as I am happy once again to record, <Col N="1819" /> by the marvellous advice, skilful knowledge and personal dedication of the officers of the Revenue Commissioners and of the Department of Finance.  Those people are often called the faceless people that are resented by the public.  The public should know that they are very well served indeed by the Revenue Commissioners and by the personnel in the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>One does not have to be Minister for Finance, or indeed a Member of this House, to know that.  Most people dread the tax inspector and the tax collector, but most people who have had the wisdom to resort to their tax inspectors have found that those people they dreaded so much were, in fact, exceedingly helpful and on more than one occasion people have found that by going to their tax inspector they got advice which gave them reliefs and concessions they had not previously known were their entitlement. That is the way in which the Revenue Commissioners always work and that is the way in which, both in relation to the personal problems of individual taxpayers or in the preparation of legislation, they operate, and they are proud to do so. They serve us well and I am delighted indeed that this has been so generously acknowledged from all sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides for the implementation of the increases in rates of payment and of the other changes in the schemes of social insurance and social assistance announced in the recent budget.  It provides also for increases in the benefits payable under the occupational <Col N="1820" /> injuries scheme and for a number of minor changes in the social welfare code designed to bring about necessary improvements in its operation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is further designed to give effect to the Government's decision to extend the maximum period of entitlement to unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit.  It contains the consequential provisions for increases in the contributions payable under the social insurance and occupational injuries schemes which are necessary to ensure the proper financing of the extensive services now available.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will appreciate, a Social Welfare Bill is necessarily rather technical and can sometimes be difficult to follow.  The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill is intended to explain the basic purpose of the proposals therein as far as possible and I hope Deputies have been helped by it in their examination of the contents of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the budget statement, the increases proposed for introduction in April next will amount to 10 per cent in all weekly rates of social welfare payment.  This will involve a total expenditure of more than £25 million and will bring the overall outlay on social welfare benefits and allowances in a full year to more than £430 million nearly three times as much as in 1972-73.  Social welfare spending will account, this year, for about 10½ per cent of the gross national product.</P>
    <P>These increases consolidate the advances made over the past three years.  In the period between July, 1973, and April, 1976, very substantial increases in all rates of social welfare payments will have been given.  The rise in personal rates under the social insurance scheme will have been between 89 per cent and 110 per cent, with child dependant rates up by between 130 per cent and 160 per cent.  The growth in maximum personal assistance rates will have been between 96 per cent and 122 per cent, with child dependant rates up by between 139 per cent and 180 per cent.  The increase in the consumer price index between February, 1973, and November, 1975, was approximately <Col N="1821" /> 52 per cent so that, even taking account of price rises since last November, very substantial real gains have been enjoyed by all social welfare beneficiaries.  These gains will not be permitted to be whittled away by inflation since they represent the minimum response of a community that claims to care for its disadvantaged citizens.</P>
    <P>The budget this year was framed by the Government in the context of the very real difficulties arising from what is by far the worst economic crisis faced by the nations of Europe for 40 years.  In the present economic circumstances the major objectives of the budget might well have been restricted to tackling economic problems and, at the same time, seeking to achieve a reasonable balance in the finances of the State.  Such considerations have, indeed, been fundamental to the budget strategy of the Government. But, from the beginning of the budgetary exercise, the Government have had another priority goal.  It was made clear before Christmas that, whatever the difficulties, the interests of the less well-off in the population would be protected in the provisions of the budget.</P>
    <P>That pre-budget commitment was of the greatest importance and, by making it, the Government were concerned that it should be understood and accepted in the national community. What was at stake was the maintenance of the basic position of many thousands of men, women and children who are deprived because of age, illness, widowhood or unemployment. It was accepted by the Government that, in a time of recession, there is a special community responsibility to ensure that the poor are not called on to bear burdens which can be, and must be, borne by those in more fortunate circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Government have, in the provisions of the budget, which are reflected in the terms of the Bill, honoured their pledge in this matter. Weekly social welfare benefits and allowances have, as I have stated, been increased by 10 per cent, operative from April next.  That rate of increase is designed to maintain the real value <Col N="1822" /> of the payments made under the various schemes operated by my Department.  The Government have also decided that those April rates will be reviewed in the light of the trend of inflation during the year and that appropriate adjustments will be made &mdash;as was the case last year&mdash;to guarantee the recipients against the erosion of the purchasing power of their benefits and allowances.  The important advance made last October when weekly rates were increased has been recognised as crucial in a time of rapidly rising prices.</P>
    <P>The budget proposals for social welfare involved increases in all social assistance payments and these are provided for in the Bill now before the House.  For example, the maximum weekly personal rate of non-contributory old age pension is being raised from £9.30 to £10.25 for persons under 80 years and from £10.05 to £11.05 for persons aged 80 years and over.  The rates of pension payable where the weekly means exceeds £6 are also being increased by 10 per cent up to the point where weekly means exceed £14 and no pension is payable.</P>
    <P>The maximum weekly payment for dependent spouses who are not themselves entitled to pension is being increased from £4.65 to £5.10, so that the overall weekly payment for a non-contributory pensioner with a dependent spouse will, at the maximum rate, be increased from £13.95 to £15.35 and, if the pensioner is aged 80 years or over, from £14.70 to £16.15.  The allowance paid in respect of a prescribed relative giving full-time care and attention to an incapacitated pensioner is to be raised by 50p a week to £5.70 a week.  In addition, increases of pension for the qualified children of pensioners are being raised by 25p a week to £2.75 for each of the first two children and by 20p a week to £2.10 a week for each further child.</P>
    <P>The details of these changes and of the new table of weekly means and rates are set out in section 2.  I should explain that, for a pensioner with qualified children the means limit is greater than £14 which is the figure shown in the table, and this section enables the table to be extended to <Col N="1823" /> cases where the means are not actually shown within the limits of what is contained in the text.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for 10 per cent increases in the personal weekly rates of unemployment assistance bringing them up to £8.90 in urban areas and to £8.55 in rural areas.  There are corresponding 10 per cent rises in the rates for adult dependants and for qualified child dependants.  Thus, the rate of unemployment assistance payable to a man, wife and child in an urban area will be increased by £1.65 a week&mdash;from £16.45 to £18.10.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of this section makes provision for a change announced in the budget in respect of smallholders in receipt of unemployment assistance. It is now proposed that the existing rates of unemployment assistance&mdash;that is the rates established in October last&mdash;will continue to apply in the case of landholders with valuations in excess of £15 whose means are notionally assessed by reference to land valuation for purposes of determining eligibility for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill is designed to give effect to a major change in the special scheme of unemployment assistance for smallholders which Deputies will agree is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The budget statement contained the announcement of changes in the notional basis of means assessment under the terms of the unemployment assistance scheme for smallholders in specified areas of the country.  In a situation where farm income has risen by 250 per cent since the introduction of the scheme in 1966 there has been widespread and increasing criticism of the maintenance, unchanged, of means guidelines established ten years ago.  Many objections have been made to the whole basis of assessment which is related to poor law valuation levels.</P>
    <P>This special scheme, as Deputies are aware, was introduced in 1966 and under it the means of landholder applicants for unemployment assistance are calculated on the basis of the poor law valuation of their holdings. <Col N="1824" /> The scheme applies to smallholders resident in specified areas&mdash;the whole of Connacht, the counties of Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Kerry, Longford and Monaghan plus the congested parts of west Cork and west Limerick.</P>
    <P>Under this scheme the yearly means deriving from the use of land in specified areas are calculated on the basis of £20 per £1 of the applicant's net rateable land-valuation, excluding buildings.  Thus, the means of a person with a valuation of £10 would be taken as £200 a year, or £3.85 weekly, for unemployment assistance purposes and his entitlement to unemployment assistance, if he had no other means, would be the maximum weekly rate applicable to his family size reduced by £3.85.  This &ldquo;multiplier&rdquo; of £20 has remained unchanged since the introduction of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The amendments to the scheme now proposed will leave the position unchanged for all smallholders assessed in this way whose valuations do not exceed £15&mdash;that is, some 18,000 of the present total of approximately 23,500 smallholders in receipt of unemployment assistance under the scheme.</P>
    <P>For smallholders whose valuations exceed £15 but do not exceed £20, a new notional &ldquo;multiplier&rdquo; of £30 will replace the present £20, that is, the notional income will be increased by 50 per cent affecting some 2,500 recipients.</P>
    <P>For those whose valuations are over £20 the new multiplier will be £40, thus doubling the notional income of some 3,000 recipients.  I intend to give very detailed consideration to the long-term future of the smallholders unemployment assistance scheme in the context of the planning of the reform of all assistance schemes which is included in my Department's development programme.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of sections 5 and 6 non-contributory widow's and orphan's pensions are being improved in line with other allowances.  The maximum weekly personal rate of widow's pension will be increased from £9.30 to £10.25 a week and the payment for qualified children will be <Col N="1825" /> raised to £3.40 a week for each child. Orphan's non-contributory pension will be increased from £6.05 to £6.65 a week.  The details of these increases are given in the tables which form part of this section and, as in the case of old age pensions, provision is made to cover cases where means are not shown in the text.</P>
    <P>The new rates of widow's non-contributory pension will automatically apply to deserted wife's allowance, to the social assistance allowance for unmarried mothers and to the allowance for prisoners' wives.</P>
    <P>Section 7 raises the maximum weekly rate of payment to qualified single women over 58 years from £8.10 to £8.90 a week.</P>
    <P>The impact of these substantial increases can be more clearly understood by reference to the numbers of recipients involved.  Some 153,000 persons will benefit from the increases in the rates of non-contributory old age pension; over 200,000 persons from the rise in unemployment assistance rates; 20,000 from the increases in non-contributory widow's and orphan's pensions; and about 16,000 from the new rates of social assistance allowances. This total of about 390,000 includes both adult and child dependants.</P>
    <P>I now come to the increases provided for in the rates of pensions and short-term benefits under the social insurance system.  In the case of retirement pension and old age contributory pension, the personal rates will go up by £1.10 a week to £12.15 where the pensioner is under the age of 80 years and to £12.85 where the pensioner is aged 80 or over.  The allowances for adult dependants are being increased by 70p for those under 67 years and by 85p for those who are 67 years or over.  The allowance payable in respect of a prescribed relative giving full-time care and attention to a pensioner is to be increased from £5.20 to £5.70 a week.</P>
    <P>Thus, the pension for a couple, both over 67 years of age and not yet 80 years of age is being raised to a weekly rate of £21.30&mdash;106 per cent greater than the rate being paid three years ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1826" /> The personal rates of widow's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit are being increased by £1 to £11.00 a week, with the special rate for a widow over 80 years being raised to £11.85 a week.  Orphan's contributory allowance will be increased by 75p to £8.00 a week.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for a rise of £1 a week in the personal rates of disability and unemployment benefit and invalidity pension&mdash;the new flat rate will be £10.90 a week.  Maternity allowance will be increased to the same weekly figure.</P>
    <P>All adult and child dependant allowances will rise in line with the general 10 per cent increase.  Some examples of the effects of these changes may illustrate what the budget provisions mean to families who depend on social insurance payments.</P>
    <P>The contributory widow's pension for a widow, aged under 80 years, with three qualified children will rise by £2.05 a week to £22.10 while a deserted wife with two qualified children will receive an additional £1.70 a week, bringing her benefit to £18.40. Flat-rate unemployment benefit in the case of a man, his wife and three children will be increased by £2.50 a week, from £24.30 to £26.80.</P>
    <P>In line with the improvements in the general social insurance system, the Bill also provides for increases in the rates of the various benefits payable under the occuptional injuries scheme.  The increase in weekly rates will be broadly in line with those provided for in the various social insurance categories.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made for increases in the special rates of unemployment benefit payable in certain circumstances where unemployment continues beyond 156 days.  These rates are related to the urban levels of unemployment assistance increases which are dealt with in section 3.  The increases which will come into effect in April are intended to retain the parity between the two rates.  The basic rate goes up by 80p, that for an adult dependant by 60p, with corresponding increases for qualified child dependants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1827" /> The present pattern of the Department's expenditure, as indicated in the Estimates, includes very substantial moneys for the payment of unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and unemployment assistance, and underlines the grave human impact of the present economic recession.  The Estimate provides for an outlay of £97 million on payment related to the unemployment problem&mdash;24 per cent of the Department's total outlay on benefits and allowances.  There are now 15,000 more persons on the live register than at the same time last year.  Each and every one of these cases can result in hardship, either in financial terms or because of stress and worry.</P>
    <P>I have kept the operation of the unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit schemes under very careful review and, having regard to the overall unemployment situation, I made certain proposals to the Government which were approved.  The proposals which the Government approved were that the maximum period for which unemployment benefit may be paid to persons who are at present entitled to a maximum of 312 days benefit will be extended by a further 78 days to 390 days.  The rate of benefit payable during this extra three months is to be the same as that which applied for the 156 days prior to the exhaustion of the 312 days benefit.  Under the transitional provisions contained in section 11 of the Bill, this significant extension of the unemployment benefit scheme will apply to persons who had exhausted their 312 days unemployment benefit entitlement within 78 days of the operative date of the extension and who are still unemployed when the extension enters into force.  For instance, a person who exhausted 312 days benefit 30 days before the operative date, will get an extension of 48 days unemployment benefit.  This extension of flat-rate unemployment benefit will provide badly-needed financial support for many families who continue to be affected by the prolonged economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes provision for an extension&mdash;by a further 78 days to <Col N="1828" /> 381 days&mdash;of the maximum period for which pay-related benefit may be paid. The proposed weekly rate of pay-related benefit during this further extension of the system is 20 per cent of reckonable weekly earnings between £14 and £50.  Pay-related benefit is payable in respect of unemployment, disability and maternity benefit under the present social insurance code.</P>

      <P>As responsibility for preserving order and thereby the dignity and decorum of the House is in the hands of the Chair, I feel that I must speak seriously to Members about recent behaviour in the Chamber which detracts from its standing and, indeed, tends to bring it into public disrepute.</P>
      <P>Both the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I have been made the subject of utterly groundless charges of bias in what seems to be a mounting campaign. The disorder is compounded by open defiance of the Chair's rulings.</P>
      <P>The most recent example of this misbehaviour occurred yesterday during Question Time when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was subjected to extensive abuse and defiance.  Unfortunately, I was absent at the Council of State meeting and did not return to the Chair for some hours.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle felt then that in view of the lapse of time the matter should be treated as closed.</P>
      <P>While I now give fair warning to offending Members that the Chair will in future defend itself from unwarranted attacks and will invoke Standing Orders to deal with disorder, I would appeal to Members' sense of responsibility to co-operate with the Chair so as to ensure that this House &mdash;the supreme legislative chamber of our land&mdash;can transact its business with the dignity and high level of debate appropriate to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Current policy provides for the letting of Land Commission lands by public auction.  This is generally accepted as being the fairest system and the one least likely to give cause for complaints. Every effort is made to offer lands in lots of a size suitable to the requirements of local smallholders and all interested parties have an opportunity of bidding for lots in which they are interested.  In exceptional circumstances where hardship is seen to exist the Land Commission may make lettings by private treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I suppose it is true to say that a man who has money has a better chance of taking land than a man without money, but experience has shown and indeed common sense dictates that the fairest way of letting land is by public auction because everybody then has an opportunity to bid for it.  The Land Commission do their best to arrange that land is offered in small lots and not in big tracts, and when it is let in small lots local smallholders have a good opportunity of bidding for it, and indeed it is unlikely that outsiders will come in and bid big amounts for small areas of land.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not agree with the Deputy that the present system confers any advantage of the nature he describes.  I would say it is not perfect but I do not think it is possible to get a better system.  The ideal thing is to get the land allotted and into the hands of the people for whom it is intended with a minimum of delay, and I am urging the Land Commission to do just that.  When the Land Commission take possession of land they must let it if they are not in a position to allot it, and during that interregnum there will be complaints and, I suppose, there will be abuses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As the farmers' retirement scheme does not prescribe any minimum to the size of the holding which an applicant must hold, the benefits of the scheme are available to all small farmers provided that the lands offered are considered suitable for the purposes of the scheme and that the applicants satisfy the criteria of farmers whose main occupation is farming. Liberal interpretations are applied to these requirements.</P>
      <P>The main benefits of the scheme comprise a premium of 10 per cent of the purchase money subject to a maximum of £1,500 or twice the lease rent subject to a maximum of £3,000 for all qualified applicants; in addition those of 55 years of age or over are eligible for a life annuity of £600 in the case of a married person or £400 in the case of a single or widowed person.</P>
      <P>In the event of the death of a beneficiary the surviving spouse qualifies for a life annuity of £400.</P>
      <P>These payments are in addition to the purchase money or lease rent.</P>
      <P>A beneficiary, if he so wishes, may retain the dwellinghouse and an accommodation plot of up to two acres.  The benefits under the scheme have been widely acknowledged as being very generous and compelling and they are available to any small farmer who wishes to apply for them and who fulfils the required conditions.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> To be quite candid, I do not think it has been disappointing.  It came into operation on 1st May, 1974.  There were about 1,500 applicants and about 130 of these have been finalised &mdash;that is, even the legal requirements have been met&mdash;and that has brought in about 5,000 acres to the Land Commission. About another 130 have reached the stage where price is agreed upon and about 1,500 applications in all have been received and applications are continuing to come in at the rate of about six a week. That would be roughly about 200 acres a week.  There was one complaint about the scheme and that was it did not apply to lands let under the 11-months' system.  I was able to arrange with Brussels to have that rectified and those who are now otherwise qualified are not debarred simply because their lands have been let.  I do not believe this scheme will solve all the land problems but, as I said elsewhere, I think it will play a significant part in improving the situation.</P>

      <P>Yes.

The Minister should get in touch with his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, and see that a social welfare old age pension would be given as an incentive to old people to opt for the retirement scheme.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> With all due respect to my friends on the left and the right, no pressure was necessary from anybody in order to persuade me to have land being let included in the scheme.  I saw this shortcoming in the very early stages and had it adjusted with the minimum of delay.  A lot of the publicity and comment on this scheme has been ill-informed and not helpful.  Before the scheme came into operation, if a man retired and sold his farm for £10,000, he got no old age pension, no bonus, nothing except the purchase price. Under this scheme, if he sells his farm for £10,000 or £20,000, he gets a bonus up to £1,500 and a pension of £12 a week without a means test.  The EEC directive only requires that that pension be paid between 55 and 65 years; we pay it for life.  What Deputy Callanan wants us to do is to permit a man to sell his farm for £10,000 or £20,000, give him a pension of £12 a week or an adjusted pension, whatever it may be, and then, under the social welfare code, an old age pension, completely forgetting that he has £10,000 or £20,000.  I think that is going too far.  I was glad to see that one agricultural writer who has been campaigning for just that for several months said, in the latest edition of his journal, that, of course, nobody suggested that he should get two pensions <Col N="1843" /> and that all that he wanted was the fringe benefits.  I am having a look at the fringe benefits to see if that can be done.</P>

      <P>It was not, and I would hate to use an unparliamentary word to tell the Minister what I think of his statement.  The income derived from capital is the interest on it and it is assessed accordingly in the bank. A sum of £10,000 would not deprive a man of the non-contributory old age pension, and in saying that the Minister is demonstrating his lack of knowledge on the matter.  If a man has a contributory old age pension, he draws it together with the retirement pension from the surrendering of his land.  Deputy Callanan is right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But the question of the giving of visas is one for each Government to decide for itself, and I have no function in the matter.  If citizens have a particular difficulty, in individual cases if we are approached we will make informal inquiries to see if there is any hold-up we can encourage to have straightened out, but any such representations have to be informal.

The Deputy ought to be satisfied with the information I have given.  Contracts worth £500,000 have been placed and all these contracts are with Irish firms to be produced entirely in Ireland. I hope, and I believe, that tenders will be such that the remaining tenders, two out of 17, will also go to Irish firms.  I cannot give the type of general undertaking sought here that in all cases no foreign goods are to be purchased.  That we cannot do because it would be inconsistent with our obligations.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question on 5th February, 1976, the scientific model investigation is necessary to establish how the proposed development would affect existing sea and swell conditions at Rosslare <Col N="1852" /> Harbour.  The hydraulic research station at Wallingford had originally told CIE that they could not undertake the model investigation before September, 1976.  However, CIE have since prevailed on the research station to give them priority in regard to the study and I am glad to say that a contract for the model investigation has been placed with the station.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Scientific evidence available so far does not confirm that peat silt entering the River Shannon and Lough Derg is seriously interfering with fish life and wild life generally.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna are conscious of their obligations to protect the environment and have the problems created by peat silt in rivers under constant review.</P>
      <P>The board propose to install settling ponds to arrest the flow of peat silt and have taken other steps in connection with the execution of drainage work to reduce the movement of peat silt from bog areas into rivers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this matter the Minister told us previously that An Foras Forbartha were investigating the situation but I have not heard of their findings.  However, it has been proved that thousands of tons of peat silt are flowing into the Shannon <Col N="1854" /> as a result of Bord na Móna's operations in the area.  Is the Minister aware of the dissatisfaction of the people in Counties Tipperary, Clare, Galway and Offaly because of the lack of initiative on the part of the Department towards eliminating the problem? Is he aware, too, of a huge meeting that was held in Portumna at which representatives of the counties I have mentioned were represented as also were Bord na Móna, the ESB, Bord Fáilte and the fishing and swimming club interests?  At this meeting experts produced samples of water which proved beyond doubt the extent of this pollution in the Shannon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the meeting to which the Deputy refers and I know, too, of the concern expressed. Since my responsibility is not only for Bord na Móna but for the area of tourism I am anxious that the level of pollution in any river is not such as to affect the tourism industry.  However, I do not think that it has been proven scientifically yet that pollution in the Shannon or Lough Derg is caused by Bord na Móna.  It must be remembered that the board have been cutting turf there for more than 30 years and that there are pollutants entering the river from other sources.</P>
      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers, the one conducted by An Foras Forbartha, is with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries because they, too, are very concerned with the question of the preservation of fish life.  If it is found that the peat is the cause of pollution in the river, Bord na Móna will do everything possible to ensure that the damage is minimised by the introduction of ponds and lagoons and by keeping, so far as possible the flow of peat within the bogs.</P>

I assure him that the board are very concerned with this matter.  As the Deputy knows, they farm huge areas of turbary all over the country and they are concerned that their operations do not interfere with the amenities of the areas concerned.  Besides the development of ponds and lagoons they have taken a number of other measures which are aimed at cutting down the amount of peat silt flowing into the Shannon.  I trust that all of these measures will be successful.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained to the deputation which I received on 3rd March, 1976, concerning the proposed withdrawal of passenger services from the Limerick/Claremorris railway line, the Oireachtas gave full powers to CIE in section 19 of the Transport Act, 1958, to terminate any rail passenger or rail freight service provided the board are satisfied that the service is uneconomic and that there is no prospect of its continued operation being economic within a reasonable period.  Any decision in regard to the future of any particular rail service is, therefore, a matter for the board of CIE.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, I conveyed the deputation's representations to the chairman of CIE by whom, I understand, the deputation was received on the afternoon of 3rd March.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the chairman of CIE that, at the request of the deputation, he proposes to raise this matter again with his board and that he will communicate the decision of the board to the Galway County Manager who acted as chief spokesman for the deputation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four supplementaries that I wish to put to the Minister on this very important matter.  First, is the Minister aware that the present service from Limerick to Ballina is of no useful purpose to the public because of the unsuitability of the time schedule?  Secondly, has he considered the recommendation of a deputation he received regarding the possibility of providing rail cars to bring workers and students to Galway from such places as Ennis, Ardrahan, Gort, Tuam and Claremorris?  Thirdly, will he agree that a loss of £250,000 per annum on the west of Ireland service is very small compared with the subsidy of £500,000 a week which CIE receive?  Lastly, will he agree that the deliberate phasing out of the service is causing undue hardship to all CIE employees who have worked diligently and responsibly down through the years and does not the letter, <Col N="1857" /> dated 10th March, and sent to the deputation, indicate the amazing situation of the Minister not having any authority in regard to CIE decisions? Does this not show also a complete lack of interest on the part of the Government in so far as the people of the west are concerned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister notice that the deputation from Galway whose appointment with the Minister was for 11.30 p.m. arrived by car because to have come by train would have left them late?  Does this not remind one of the Percy French ballad, &ldquo;Are you right there, Michael, are you right?&rdquo;?  The author was taken to court by the then West Clare railway on a charge of slander but he was late arriving at the courthouse in Ennis, because, as he explained, the train was half an hour behind schedule.  The case was dismissed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer given by the Minister to me and to the other members of the deputation was that the chairman of CIE would probably consider the matter and, perhaps, grant a reprieve.  The Minister appoints the board of CIE.  I understand we are now going to appoint a committee to look into State-sponsored bodies, of which CIE is one of the biggest we have in the country.  It is no reprieve to give a reprieve and not provide a service.  I have seen reprieves in relation to the West of Ireland when they put on a coach and one would be as well off on a bicycle.  This is the kind of service CIE put on when they give you a reprieve for a couple of years. They do not put on a service to attract passengers to use the service.  We believe that CIE intend to downgrade the whole West of Ireland because we have seen their plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is true.  Deputy Loughnane says that it is a ridiculous situation that the Minister has no control over CIE but this is not a situation of my wishing or something I did personally.  This is an <Col N="1858" /> Act of the Oireachtas, which was passed by this Dáil, which deliberately prohibited a Minister from interfering with the day-to-day workings of CIE. It put the onus on CIE to run this service economically.  I have conveyed all the points raised by Deputy Loughnane and also by Deputy Callanan to the chairman of CIE.  I understand the board are meeting tomorrow and they have promised to consider them very seriously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree it is time to have a second look at this Act?  This is a very urgent matter.  Would he not agree that in working out the costings of closing a railway line many important factors are not taken into account, such as the social amenities, the value of tourism, the extra cost of making the road which carries the bus and also that a bus service runs side by side with the railway which makes it unprofitable? Those are important factors and they are all calculated to lead ultimately to the closing of branch lines.  It is time, to adopt a new, firm policy with regard to railway lines generally.  Would the Minister not agree that it is time that the Act was revised and seriously amended in relation to the closure of railways generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind looking at the Act.  It has engaged my attention perhaps more than that of any other Minister because there are more semi-State bodies under my control. The relationship with them from a Minister's point of view is quite difficult as the Deputy may know, although I am not sure he had any experience in such a Department.  I can see the reason for putting that section into that Act.  The reason semi-State bodies were set up initially was to remove them from the constraints of operating too closely within the civil service&mdash;to give them a certain amount of commercial freedom.  I would be very slow to remove that, to take away from them that freedom of action and to make them subject here for every little matter outside broad policy, which of course is a matter for the Minister, the Government and the Oireachtas.  If every small detail of their operations were subject to us, <Col N="1859" /> this would have the effect of stifling them.  That would not be a good thing for the country.</P>

That is due to the amenities and facilities provided. Would the Minister consider introducing a train system in the west which would be comfortable and similar to those in the south, which the people in Cork, Clare and Limerick can avail of?

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1976: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The extension will, in the same way as I have explained for flat-rate unemployment benefit, apply in the case of persons who had exhausted their full pay-related benefit entitlement within 78 days of the operative date of the extension and who still retain their entitlement to flat-rate benefit.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the success to date of the extended pay-related benefit system in terms of reducing the financial impact of sickness and unemployment has been of the greatest social and human importance.  It is out of the question that we should allow our fellow-citizens who have in effect been betrayed by the inefficiency and unequal working of our economic system to suffer substantial deprivation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Bill, 1975 in this House I stated that an analysis of the operation of the pay-related benefit refuted absolutely the idea that this system provided some form of bonanza for malingerers.  I pointed out then that the pay-related benefit scheme does not give the average unemployed man more than he could get if he were at work, but that it does keep his head above water.  I said then, and I repeat now, that it is the purpose of all income-maintenance <Col N="1866" /> payments to cushion a person to the fullest extent possible if he becomes unemployed or ill and, further that before people condemn or distort the working of the pay-related benefit scheme and its effects, they should think very carefully and they should examine how it operates and what it is designed to do.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly stated in this House that the development of the broad range of social welfare services demands a continual process of review and, where necessary, of reform and change.  We have in three years brought about a really major advance in many areas of social welfare and have created a new basic level of provision which cannot be reversed. Further improvements and structural progress in the system are being worked on in the Department of Social Welfare at present in active pursuit of the declared aims of the Government.</P>
    <P>Review of the system has led in this year's budget to a change in the arrangements relating to the range of benefits available to unemployed persons and section 12 of the Bill is designed to facilitate the making of regulations to implement this change by restricting the total amount of the benefits payable to a wholly unemployed person to 85 per cent of net current earnings.</P>
    <P>This decision arises from a detailed study carried out by an inter-departmental working group set up by the Government to make appropriate investigations with a view to assessing the possible disincentive effects of benefits and concessions available to unemployed persons.  The establishment of this working group followed a report prepared for me on the working of the pay-related benefit system.</P>
    <P>The study carried out by the working group was intended to look at the effects of the whole range of benefits and concessions which may be available to unemployed persons.  These include, in addition to unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and unemployment assistance, the weekly redundancy payments scheme, tax rebates, relief from tax and social welfare contributions and, in certain <Col N="1867" /> cases, reduction of differential rents. If inequalities exist&mdash;if there are situations in which people can become caught in the &ldquo;welfare trap&rdquo; where an unemployed worker could suffer financially by seeking and accepting a reasonable job offer&mdash;then this can arise only through an interaction of a number of the available concessions. This was the general conclusion of the working group and one which gives rise to very serious implications.</P>
    <P>The working group concluded that it is not possible to say whether or to what extent the levels of income available to the main groups of unemployed persons do act as disincentives to seek employment.  Incentive and disincentive relate to personal attitudes as much as&mdash;and perhaps even more than&mdash;to money.  Research being carried out for my Department indicates clearly to me that unemployed men and women want to work and that there is little or no evidence that most of the unemployed see their situation as a tenable or lasting way of life, despite improved benefits.  This is exactly what any reasonable person would expect.</P>
    <P>I must reiterate my view that certain critical attitudes of some workers worried about their own jobs, and of opponents of the social welfare and other social services, are a reflection more of the psychology of recession than of the facts of the situation.  The working group were of the view that the basic objective of the pay-related benefit scheme to which I have referred&mdash;to ensure that workers do not suffer a serious drop in disposable income on becoming unemployed&mdash;is being achieved even without the intervention of the other available scheme.</P>
    <P>The study carried out revealed the existence of certain definite anomalies in the concurrent working of a number of schemes and the logical recommendation was made that there should be a rationalisation based upon the establishment of a unified wage-stop.  This will now be introduced under the terms of the budget announcement.</P>
    <P>The new approach will be brought <Col N="1868" /> into effect by appropriate regulations which will be made shortly.  However, in general, the procedure will be along the following lines.  When a worker becomes unemployed, his or her average net weekly income prior to unemployment will be calculated on the basis of the income tax cessation certificate with appropriate deductions for tax and social insurance contributions.  A figure equivalent to 85 per cent of this average will then become the wage-stop level.</P>
    <P>The flat-rate unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and redundancy weekly payments where applicable will be calculated in the normal way. Where the total of these payments exceeds the maximum permissible income the total payable will be reduced accordingly.  Where, however, the person concerned is entitled only to flat-rate unemployment benefit no reduction in this amount would be made.  If the person concerned is entitled to a rebate of income tax an appropriate reduction in his total payments will, if this is necessary, be made to keep him within the maximum laid down.  His position will have to be further reviewed on cessation of the tax rebates.</P>
    <P>Subject to the other conditions provided for, the maximum weekly amount of benefit payable by way of flat-rate unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and weekly redundancy payments to a person who is eligible for weekly redundancy payments would then be £50.  An example of the working of the new scheme could be given in the following terms.</P>
    <P>Under the present arrangements pay-related benefit payable to a person currently becoming unemployed is based on his earnings in the 1974-75 income tax year.  If we take the case of a married man with a wife and two children who earned £2,500 in 1974-75, his reckonable weekly earnings are £50.  Under the present system his total benefit made up of flat and pay-related cannot exceed £50 which represents the &ldquo;wage-stop&rdquo; at 100 per cent.  In fact, his flat-rate benefit would amount to £21.95 and his pay-related <Col N="1869" /> to £14.40 making a total of £36.35, leaving him well inside the &ldquo;wage-stop&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed scheme this man's &ldquo;wage-stop&rdquo; level would be 85 per cent of net current pay, that is, after deduction of income tax and his share of the social insurance contribution. Allowing for wage increases over the past 18 months, his current gross weekly earnings would be about £70.  After deduction of income tax and social welfare contributions his net pay would be £54.55; 85 per cent of this is £46.40 and this is his &ldquo;wage-stop&rdquo; level under the new scheme. Accordingly, in this man's case the application of the new scheme would make no difference.  He would still receive the same amount of flat-rate and pay-related benefit as under the present scheme.  If this man was entitled to a tax rebate he could get as much as £10 a week by way of such rebate before the new 85 per cent &ldquo;wage-stop&rdquo; would apply.</P>
    <P>The new approach will apply only to new claims received as and from an appointed day.  It will do away with an anomaly which has arisen in a large part due to the operation of a number of relatively new schemes.  I have repeatedly made clear the need for review of such schemes to ensure their proper working.  It does not result from a widespread abuse and certainly does not represent a general level of benefits which is destroying the will and the incentive to find work. An adjustment was necessary and it is being made.</P>
    <P>Much&mdash;indeed most&mdash;of the public criticism of the pay-related benefit system has been ill-informed, crude and confused.  It has come from persons and groups who have shown little or no concern for the poor, or for the unemployed.  I continue to be contemptuous of critics who have never faced&mdash;and who will never face &mdash;unemployment and its attendant stresses and strains.  My job is to make provision for those who have and it is my concern to ensure that this is done.</P>
    <P>The purpose of pay-related benefit is to improve on the position under the old flat-rate system by relating both benefit and contributions to <Col N="1870" /> earnings to some degree and to provide rates of benefit which will better enable persons to maintain, during sickness and unemployment, a standard of living reasonably close to that to which they have been accustomed. I have given it as my opinion&mdash;based on my assessment of its working over a year and a half&mdash;that the system has achieved that purpose.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the increase in the rates of social insurance contributions which cover all benefits of the social insurance system. The increase in the contribution this year must provide for the appropriate share of the increases in benefits and pensions provided for in the Bill and for the general improvements to be made in the social insurance scheme.  It must also include an element for the part financing of the extension of the unemployment benefit scheme for a further three months to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Provision must also be made for the increases in contributions arising from the decision announced in the budget statement to transfer £8 million of charges from the Exchequer subsidy to the social insurance stamp as part of a phased reduction of the Exchequer contribution.  The overall increase, in the case of contributions which count for all benefits involved is £1.53, of which the employer will pay £1.03 and the employee £0.50. Lesser increases will apply where the rates of contribution do not cover all social insurance benefits.  The same section of the Bill provides also for the continuation this year of the special increase of 31p made in the Social Welfare Act, 1975, to meet the financial implications of the current abnormal unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>The ordinary rates of contribution covering the social insurance services administered by my Department, including the increase of £1.53 and the special unemployment increase of 31p, will thus rise to £5.64 a week for men, of which the employer will pay £3.50 and the employee £2.14.  For women, the new ordinary rate will be £5.56, of which the employer will pay £3.48 and the employee £2.08.</P>
    <P>The rates of voluntary contribution <Col N="1871" /> will be correspondingly raised to £1.10 a week at the low rate and £2.83 a week at the high rate.  Section 15 of the Bill provides for an increase of 39p to £1.73 in the new rate of voluntary contribution introduced in the Social Welfare Act, 1975, to cover the situation of a certain category of insured persons affected by the abolition from April, 1974, of the remuneration limit for the insurability of non-manual workers.  Contributions payable in respect of occupational injuries insurance are to be increased by 2p a week to 14p for a male employee, and 11p for a woman&mdash;all borne by the employer.  All of these new rates of contribution will be effective from Monday, 5th April, 1976.</P>
    <P>The practical effect of these financing proposals is to continue the recent trend which has shifted the balance as between the Exchequer grant to the social insurance fund and the direct social insurance contributions.  Both in relation to the social insurance fund itself and in relation to overall social welfare expenditure under insurance and assistance categories, the Exchequer share has been reduced over the past few years.</P>
    <P>The financing of social welfare expenditure, and indeed of the social services as a whole, is a matter which gives rise to a great deal of comment and concern, in particular at a time of economic stringency such as we are now experiencing.  It is my belief that a very significant change in the basis of financing social welfare expenditure is needed and the special working party established last year by the Minister is engaged in the preparation of recommendations for such a change.</P>
    <P>This is, of course, an area of some complexity and one which calls for a lot of detailed research and analysis. Until such changes can be introduced as a permanent feature of the social welfare system the present unsatisfactory and, indeed, regressive system of flat-rate contribution must continue.  I am aware that the burden of this particular form of taxation falls especially severely upon lower <Col N="1872" /> paid workers, and especially on many women workers, and that it can create difficulties for some firms.</P>
    <P>The working party on financing will, of course, take into account the developments in social security policy which are taking place at the EEC level and will seek to produce a system which will be, at once, in line with general, progressive European practice, and appropriate to our particular circumstances.  Ireland is in a very different position demographically, in terms of industrial employment pattern, and in terms of relative economic development to many of the more advanced countries with which comparisons are too often glibly made.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains one or two reform measures which have been designed to deal with gaps or anomalies in the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>There is provision for the payment of a benefit, at a rate equal to the contributory widow's pension, to a widower whose wife, immediately prior to her death, had been in receipt of a retirement pension which included an increase in respect of him because he was wholly or mainly maintained by her because of his physical or mental infirmity.  This will bring the retirement pension scheme into line with the contributory old age pension scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 18 deals with the payment of child dependant allowances to recipients of contributory widow's pensions. At present, these allowances are payable in respect of children who normally resided with the widow or the late husband prior to the date of the husband's death and, also, in respect of the children, grandchildren or step-children of the widow or of her late husband, or adopted children, who came to reside with the widow after her husband's death.  The Bill provides for payment of allowances in respect of all qualified children normally residing with the widow, regardless of the date on which they became normally resident with her.  A similar provision is being made in respect of the scheme of non-contributory widow's pensions.</P>
    <P>I began these remarks by referring to the general economic situation and to its impact on social welfare policy <Col N="1873" /> and performance.  Perhaps no Department of State is more aware of the importance of economic growth and of overall national development than the Department of Social Welfare.  My Department find themselves faced with the task of providing a part of the response to the problems created by the ups and downs of the economy, whether because of unemployment, or low pay or poverty.  Deprivation and financial need are caused by the failures of our economic system to a large degree and in a society with any claim to be caring or compassionate there must be an immediate response to such problems designed to alleviate their impact on individuals and families. This is the first rule of the social welfare system and I believe that it is my responsibility to work for the highest possible level of development and perfection of that system.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Bill now before the House reflects the impact of the current economic situation.  However, by far the most important consideration is that the progress made to date in improving the level of payments should be maintained.  This has been done.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of discussion on social welfare policy at present and, in general, I welcome this.  It is essential that the development of our policies and programmes in this area &mdash;which is of direct concern to so many of our fellow-citizens who are deprived in one way or another&mdash;should be the subject of debate and, indeed, of critical assessment.  At budget time and at the time of the introduction of the Social Welfare Bill, this aspect of public policy becomes of even greater interest because of the cost to the community involved in maintaining even our present standards of provision.</P>
    <P>I deplore, however, the tendency of some people to distort what is being attempted and what is being done. First, I regret the inaccuracy of much comment.  For example, to suggest that social welfare has been cut back in this budget is totally incorrect.  Also, to speak or write as if social welfare were just about unemployment benefit and assistance&mdash;and pay-related benefit&mdash;is to mis-state the true position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1874" /> Let me repeat that unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and unemployment assistance together will account&mdash;even in this year of continuing high unemployment levels&mdash;for only 24 per cent of total social welfare outlay.  By far the largest share of the money spent&mdash;£180 million or 45 per cent of the total&mdash;will go on pensions of all kinds.</P>
    <P>My major concern about the present criticism of the social welfare system is that it can lead&mdash;often on the basis of quite inaccurate statements&mdash;to very negative public attitudes to social welfare as a whole and to the need for further improvements in the system. Such criticism, and such attitudes, can do a great disservice to our less well-off fellow citizens.</P>
    <P>I have absolutely no illusions about the size of the problem facing a country like Ireland, with serious economic difficulties and with pressing social needs, when attempting to provide adequately for the old, the sick, the unemployed and the deprived.  Despite the very real advances which we have been able to make in recent years, and despite the great measure of expansion of our social welfare schemes which has been possible, the task remaining is a major challenge to us all.</P>
    <P>In facing up to that challenge it is essential that we get our facts right and that we assess the situation objectively and honestly.  I believe that the truth of the position in relation to social welfare policy is that success in tackling our social problems depends upon our success in evolving and implementing a total national strategy for development in all sectors&mdash;economic, social, cultural and political.</P>
    <P>I now recommend this Bill to Dáil Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that this Bill will receive reasonably expeditious consideration.  The problem we find about the way the Bill came before the House was the lack of notice we received about the matter.  We received the Bill yesterday morning and we were told&mdash;we were not asked&mdash; that it was coming before the House <Col N="1875" /> today.  We assumed it would be taken this morning but the previous Bill held up the business of the House, as it was entitled to do, until just before Question Time.</P>
      <P>Deputies should have more time to study Bills of this nature.  In this instance the Bill is very important. The first inkling we got of the extension of the pay-related scheme was in the Bill itself.  The Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party had a meeting yesterday morning and we had an opportunity to discuss the Bill in a full and frank fashion.  If we had not that meeting yesterday I would have come here without having discussed the Bill with the full parliamentary party, which would have been an unfortunate situation.  To be presented with a Bill the day before it comes before the House is not the proper way to deal with the Dáil in the first place and with the Opposition in the second place.</P>
      <P>Some of the provisions of this Bill will come into effect on 2nd April and others on 5th April.  We recognise there is a need for this measure and it will not be the Opposition's intention to hold up its implementation. Quite the contrary is the case.  However, it is now Thursday afternoon and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary does not think he will have the Bill in its totality today or even Second Stage today.  There are other Deputies on both sides of the House who will have a point of view to put on a Bill of this nature.  The Department of Social Welfare affects the structure and fabric of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite what scribes and others may think, public representatives have a certain dedication to the problems of the people.  Most, if not all, are there for the benefit of the people rather than for their own benefit.  This type of legislation goes to the heart of our society.  It affects almost 900,000 people directly or indirectly. It must have a tremendous impact on legislators.  The Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate that members of my party wish to express a point of view on the measures before us and <Col N="1876" /> the only opportunity they have in that respect is on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>It does not surprise us that we get a Bill the day before it is put on the table of the House; it is common case now.  It is the way the Government order their business and show their lack of appreciation and sensitivity for the other man's point of view.  I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary for this; it is not his problem; it is the manner in which the business of the House is ordered.  If that business is ordered in the fashion in which this Bill was ordered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Bill was circulated on Tuesday evening and was delivered to Deputies in the normal post yesterday morning.  The matter was raised on the Order of Business yesterday morning when it was pointed out that the only reason I wanted the Bill dealt with today was to ensure the maximum time possible for the Opposition to discuss it.  The Bill is before the House not by the insistence of the Government but by normal agreement with the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not my interpretation of the agreement. Obviously, the Parliamentary Secretary has information available to him which I do not have.  I accept what he has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once more, in fairness to the Parliamentary Secretary, he indicated his concern for the plight of the unemployed, widows, deserted wives and the broad spectrum of the social welfare structure.  The Parliamentary Secretary is a man concerned and a man caring.  However, he is subject to the availability of money to implement all the schemes.  It is a matter for the Government to give him the money for these schemes and he does not <Col N="1877" /> have direct access to Cabinet meetings. The money he gets to implement social welfare schemes comes directly from the Exchequer and the availability of so much cash depends on how the Government are dealing with the country at a given time.  That is the real problem the Parliamentary Secretary faces.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the 10 per cent increase in the rate of payment and the other changes in the schemes of social assistance and social insurance as announced in the January budget.  I wonder whether the Parliamentary Secretary is satisfied that a 10 per cent all-round increase measures up to the savagery of inflation and the rate of inflation we are faced with.  It appears that the Government are powerless, and leaderless, in the face of inflation and price rises.  The newspapers daily give us bad news.  It is not the fault of the newspapers that they continue to give us such bad news; they must report the news as they find it.  If people find themselves out of work the newspapers cannot report a tale of joy; they must report the loss of jobs.</P>
    <P>In today's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> under the heading: &ldquo;7.1% rise in prices in 3 months&rdquo; the Economics Correspondent reports:</P>
    <P>Prices in Ireland are again beginning to rise rapidly.  In the three months to February, prices rose by 7.1 per cent, according to a survey of the Irish cost of living carried out recently by a British group, Regional Surveys.  The rate of inflation in the three months to February would suggest an annual rate of price increase in excess of 28 per cent.</P>
    <P>While I agree that the Parliamentary Secretary was not breast-beating about the great man he was on this occasion, but with a price rise in excess of 28 per cent a 10 per cent increase as envisaged in this Bill is derisory to say the least of it.  The article in <i>The Irish Times</i> continues:</P>
    <P>The survey also points out that average consumer prices in Ireland are now some 6 per cent higher than in Britain.  However, the effect of cheaper housing, together with a <Col N="1878" /> lower burden on incomes to £5,000 makes it cheaper for a family of four to live in this country.  Those who have incomes in excess of £5,000 would be better off economically if they lived in Britain.</P>
    <P>I am glad that correspondent stressed the word, &ldquo;economically&rdquo;.  That is the only way they would be better off. The article continued:</P>
    <P>A spokesman for Regional Surveys said yesterday that consumer prices in Ireland would rise more rapidly from now on, as the effects of the subsidies introduced in last June's supplementary budget begin to wear off.</P>
    <P>That was an independent survey and it is bad news by any standards.  It must be seen in the context of the Bill which gives the &ldquo;huge&rdquo; increases promised by the Government.  In another part of that paper there is a heading: &ldquo;£ hits new low&rdquo; and another: &ldquo;Building industry job fears&rdquo;.  The story under the latter heading tells us that the volume of output in the building and construction sector could fall by a further 4 per cent to 5 per cent during 1976, according to the director of the Building Materials Federation which is attached to the Confederation of Irish Industry.  That story stated that the public capital programme for this year had been given no impetus to stimulating recovery in the building and construction sector.  Also on the front page of that newspaper there is the heading: &ldquo;30% cost rise for private patients&rdquo;.  About 500,000 people are affected by that.  They are private patients, they are not socialists, smoked salmon or otherwise.  As Irish citizens&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are going to deal with all that.  This is only an aside.</P>
      <P>The Government have a great capacity for telling the country what they have done in the field of social welfare.  While there are schemes initiated and programmes being set up and functioning, poverty continues to exist.  There is a real poverty being created by this Government.  I basically agree with the Parliamentary Secretary's well-reasoned views on the question of the extension of and the philosophy behind the pay-related scheme.  However, the House may agree that this further extension of the pay-related scheme is an indictment on the Government's incapacity and unwillingness to provide employment.</P>
      <P>Okay.  The Government have created unemployment.  We are leaderless as far as the economy is concerned.  Unemployment and inflation are not being tackled.  These are matters of record and fact.  A feeling of hopelessness pervades this area with which the Parliamentary Secretary in particular and the Minister for Labour are charged.  I know certain individuals on the pay-related benefits scheme who are benefiting by it would prefer the dignity of work rather than the indignity of unemployment and of queuing outside shabby labour exchanges for the State to provide them with what can only be described as subsistence during their period of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil introduced the pay-related scheme.  We accept that we were the authors of it.  However, our philosophy has been, is, and will <Col N="1880" /> always be that the less well-off sections of the community should be provided for.  On the considerations of the introduction of the scheme we felt that in relation to the other entitlements of people during their period of unemployment, they should be in addition, given further cushioning against temporary unemployment. When Fianna Fáil began this scheme there was reasonably full employment. The scheme was intended to carry individuals who were out of work from one job to the other.  It was not envisaged originally as a permanent feature.  We ask that the Parliamentary Secretary extend his thinking a little bit more and tell us if the pay-related scheme is to become a permanent feature of social welfare benefit.  What is the policy in relation to the scheme?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary come back in three months to look for another extension?  These are important questions.</P>
    <P>I have explained basically the Fianna Fáil philosophy behind the scheme.  It was a scheme brought in to cushion men between jobs where there was job availability.  There is not job availability at the moment nor any prospect of such.  It is an appalling position to be in.  It is not the intention of the Opposition to attempt to exacerbate the situation, quite the contrary.  The spokesman on Finance has been more than responsible in relation to his duty to the nation in the context of the present economic tragedy.</P>
    <P>In spite of the price rises and so on the Government are calling for wage restraint and pay pauses and pay pacts. While Fianna Fáil are in favour of wage restraint in the current economic climate, it must be extremely difficult for those people who are being asked for restraint, and being asked to do so by a Government who do not know the meaning of the word &ldquo;restraint&rdquo;.  If somebody is asked to do something the person being asked hopes and expects that the person who is asking would have certain standards.  The Government are now operating with a permanent mentality of economic siege.  No later than the day before yesterday we had in Dublin County Council, with the <Col N="1881" /> compliments of the Minister for Local Government, huge chunks of money being taken off various schemes, again to the detriment of those people who would be operating those schemes within the Dublin County Council.  It is appalling. People as of right and as citizens of this country are entitled to employment. The only people who can provide that are the Government by virtue of whatever economic strategy they have worked out.  It appears clear that they do not have an economic strategy.</P>

      <P>No later than last week we had the Parliamentary Secretary himself, &ldquo;Corish's call backed by Cluskey&rdquo;, and I have described the Minister, Deputy Corish's call for an economic plan as his Portrane policy. I am quite sure the local Labour branch had at least a handful of members when the Minister condemned all <i>entrepreneurs</i> and capitalists out of hand and lauded a socialist society.  The Parliamentary Secretary blandly supports the Minister's call and one can only hope that the Leader of the Government knew about the Minister's intention to call for an economic and social plan.  The Parliamentary Secretary is reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> for 5th March as follows:</P>
      <P>The call for an economic and social plan made last week by the Tánaiste, Mr. Corish, was supported last night by his Parliamentary Secretary for Social Welfare, Mr. Cluskey.</P>
      <P>Unemployment was our most important economic and social problem and could only be met by radical thinking and radical policies, Mr. Cluskey told a meeting of the Labour Party in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The time has come&mdash;in the face of this crisis of unemployment&mdash; for some very straight thinking and for some very straight talking by the Labour Party&rdquo; he declared, according to a supplied script.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1882" />&ldquo;We know from our experience in the last three years both the opportunities and also the difficulties of putting our principles into practice. With this knowledge as a guide, and with the realisation that the present difficulties of our country call for the solution which we in the Labour Party alone offer, we must now move to make a decisive and positive contribution to national policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A number of points arise from that, the first being that the Labour Party alone have the solution to the exclusion of their Coalition partner.  All I can say is it is about time they made a decisive and positive contribution to national policy because the Fine Gael Party have made no contribution whatever to an economic and social plan.  For three years we have been calling for an economic plan and so have many spokesmen on economic affairs and now the Parliamentary Secretary has decided that it is time the Labour Party made a positive contribution to national policy.  <i>The Irish Times</i> goes on:</P>
    <P>Mr. Cluskey emphasised that the basic position of the Labour Party was that burdens and the efforts which would be called for must be borne by all in accordance with their capacity to do so.  For the period ahead the whole community must be asked to work together towards a common objective which could be seen to be, and accepted as being, for the long-term benefit of all.</P>
    <P>That was a very praiseworthy call by the Parliamentary Secretary in the context of his Social Welfare brief but the way to achieve objectives is not by leaving the people leaderless and there is no real leadership in the country today.  If people are to be asked to work towards a common objective, first of all the objective must be spelled out to them by a leader.  The report of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech continued:</P>
    <P>That kind of discipline and shared effort in the community will be forthcoming only if, within a coherent plan, the way forward is indicated to concrete and lasting social, <Col N="1883" /> economic and community progress. In the context of such a plan it will be possible for everyone to accept discipline and constraints and therefore, to contribute fully in the knowledge that real advantages will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Presumably a Labour Party plan only. The report continues:</P>
    <P>Mr. Cluskey added that he believed the desired goal of full employment could not be attained unless our plans and programmes were designed to deal with injustices and anomalies in our social, legal and administrative system.</P>
    <P>We are now told by the Labour branch of the Coalition that the country is in need of a social and economic plan. I expect the Taoiseach has listened to his Deputies calling for such a plan and that all going well for the Coalition, there will not be a general election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another feature of the current unemployment situation which is being glossed over in a rather crude fashion by the Government. It is the whole question of young people in our society.  We know the Government's attitude to equal pay so it is consistent that they would decide that the 18 year old girl does not have the same right to employment as the 18 year old boy.  It is also consistent that they discriminate against women in employment just as they have been doing against unemployed women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary direct his energies in the next three to six months to provide a scheme by which young people might become involved in community effort, some scheme which will give those young people hope, because the Parliamentary Secretary will be aware that <Col N="1884" /> idleness may have a very dangerous effect on young people?  It will no doubt introduce elements of cyncism and frustration and related feelings which unemployment gives rise to particularly in the minds of the young.  If we want democracy to survive and flourish and if our democratic institutions are not to be brought under attack then we must provide work for our young people. They can justifiably ask: &ldquo;Why will you not provide us with work?  Is there any hope of work in the next 12 months?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Who can blame them for taking the emigrant ship?  Our people want work.  The Parliamentary Secretary said there is some fashionable point of view that people want to malinger. I accept there are abuses of the social welfare system and the Parliamentary Secretary has figures to prove it. Daily he must get evidence of abuses of the various schemes but I do not think he can blame all society because of a few malingerers.  It has been said there are people on the dole who are doing &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; at the same time and the Parliamentary Secretary well knows there are such people.  Are we to damn the whole system because of the few?  Quite the contrary.  The Parliamentary Secretary's function in relation to abuses is to root them out and make sure they do not happen again.</P>
    <P>It is as well to remind those people who abuse the social welfare structure that the people who are being deprived are the less well-off section of the community.  If more money were available to the people at the end of the social welfare scale, the standards could be uplifted in some fashion.  Abusing the welfare system is sheer robbery.  The Parliamentary Secretary must agree with me on this.  If we are concerned about the less well-off sections of the community, as I believe we are, then it is as well to remind these people that they are committing an offence against the laws of the State, but more particularly against their fellow citizens; against the widow living on her own; against the deserted wife; against the old age pensioners&mdash;non-contributory <Col N="1885" /> in the main&mdash;against the lonely, the sick, the indigent.  These are the people against whom these offences are being committed by those who abuse the system.</P>
    <P>When he is replying to the curtailed debate on the Bill before us, would the Parliamentary Secretary give us a general treatise on the general abuses, and the number of prosecutions he, by definition, must bring if he is doing his job properly, and I believe he is, within the limits of the resources made available to him by the Government's mishandling of the economy.  No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will answer these questions honestly and factually, and must agree with my views on those people who abuse the social welfare system.  We are a small enough nation, and to have the system abused by the few to the detriment of many is an appalling prospect.  Let us not pretend that it does not exist.  Those people who boast about getting away with it&mdash;and there are a few of them about&mdash;have nothing but the contempt of the community. They might as well be putting their hands into the handbag of some old widow who is living on her own.</P>
    <P>To return to the question of the unemployed young person and the serious effects that will have on the future of the country, apart from the fact that the young person may emigrate&mdash;and if he or she does not emigrate, may take the view that the institutions of the State are not worth supporting on the basis that those institutions will not support him or her &mdash;this is the really urgent plan I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look at and to examine, the possibility of getting one of the committees within his Department to help&mdash;and he has a few reasonably good committees.  If these committees are not capable of implementing some sort of community youth plan, would the Parliamentary Secretary set up a committee of five or six people and involve young people on the committee to get their views and in some way produce a plan as a matter of urgency, say, within three months?  He will have had time enough to study the real problem within that time, and within another period of <Col N="1886" /> two or three months he should have these people working.  The community plan has been articulated on many occasions by the leader of our party, Deputy Lynch.  Deputy Lynch stated in his address to the most successful of successful Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheiseanna at the RDS on the 14th February, 1976:</P>
    <P>Take our young people leaving school and college.  Why should they bear the brunt of the economic crisis and be demoralised by the lack of job opportunities?  We suggested setting aside a sum of £5 to £10 million to set young people to work on projects for community improvements in their own areas.  We had in mind a minimum of red tape, with young people using their skills and knowledge in association with voluntary bodies and community leaders to plan and provide these badly needed projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary would listen to the solutions proposed by the Opposition, I assure him that he would not have to be dealing with as many unemployed persons as he is dealing with at present in the context of State assistance. If I may just conclude with Deputy Lynch's very worth-while contribution on this area of unemployment and the reinvolvement of young people in society:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this way thousands of young people could be employed and would be given the chance to do something valuable and worth while, while we of the older generation, would be showing them in a practical way that we do care for them and do want to see their energies <Col N="1887" /> and enthusiasms put to work in the service of the people.</P>
    <P>That is a positive contribution by the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party to a real problem which besets this community, a community with unemployed young people, apart from our older citizens who are also entitled to work.  It is a sick society, particularly in relation to our young people.  If the plan as envisaged by the Leader of the Opposition were implemented the Government would have not less than 3,000 or 4,000 people off the unemployment register.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am doing.  I am keeping very much to the Bill.  This Bill presents a golden opportunity to offer solutions to a Government who do not appear to have any solutions to their problems at all.  If we offer these positive answers to various problems it is not unreasonable that we, as an Opposition, will not get the benefit of them, but by offering solutions we will in some way be helping the nation, as any responsible Opposition must do in a situation of Coalition-created crisis.</P>
      <P>Another feature of the Bill is section 13.  It is an unlucky number for employers and employees alike.  I consider it a direct and violent attack on the jobs of the people.  Somebody &mdash;this is not my original thinking&mdash; described it as an employment tax. The so-called socialist element in the present Government would appear to have affected their conservative colleagues in the Fine Gael Party with their syndrome that the harder one works the more one has to pay in taxes.  This increased contribution will have a disincentive effect.  It is a direct tax on the work rate of men and women and on those who provide employment. It is a penal tax, neither more nor less, and it is as well to read that into the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13 provides the new rates of employment contributions.  These increases are required to meet the <Col N="1888" /> employers and insured persons part of the allowances payable under the social insurance scheme:</P>
    <P>Provision must also be made for the increases in contributions arising from the decision announced in the budget statement to transfer £8 million of charges from the Exchequer subsidy to the social insurance stamp as part of a phased reduction of the Exchequer contribution.</P>
    <P>I shall come back to this again.</P>
    <P>The overall increase in the case of contributions which count for all benefits involved is £1.53, of which the employer will pay £1.03 and the employee £0.50.  Lesser increases will apply where the rates of contribution do not cover all social insurance benefits.</P>
    <P>This section also provides for continuing for a further year the provision made in the Social Welfare Act, 1975, for a special contribution increase of 31p to help meet the expenditure arising from the extended unemployment situation.  The Government create unemployment and then ask others to pay for their creature.  Employers will pay 21p and employees 10p.</P>
    <P>We come then to the ordinary scales.  The present rate for the employer for a male employee is £2.47 while the employee pays £1.64, giving a total of £4.11.  The proposed new rate is £3.50 for the employer and £2.14 for the employee, giving a total of £5.64 as compared with £4.11. The woman employee is no better off. The present rate for the employer is £2.45 and for the employee £1.58, giving a total of £4.03.  The proposed new rate is £3.48 for the employer and £2.08 for the employee, giving a total of £5.56.  The woman in the context of employment contribution is eight pence better off than her male counterpart.  I expect this is some sort of sop or benediction to the position of women in our society. If you do not recognise women as existing in the context of unemployment at 18 years of age when they get a job you reduce the combined employment contribution by eight <Col N="1889" /> pence.  This is a recognition by the Government that the woman is not the equal of the man.  Of course she is and she has a right to equal pay for work of equal value.  The thinking which pervades the Labour Party is crystal clear in this section 13, the bad news section, the unlucky section. The harder people work, the more you grind them down under taxes and the more they should be asked to pay.</P>
    <P>I understood that the special contribution increase of 31p announced in the 1975 Social Welfare Act was to be abandoned on this occasion.  That was the undertaking given at the time. It was to be a temporary measure. Of course, we were also told unemployment would be a temporary condition, but it goes on and on with all its tragic consequences.  The question is from where will the money come for the social welfare pay out.  We were told last Tuesday by the Minister for Finance that on 31st December, 1975, the national debt had risen to £2,600 million.  On 31st March, 1973, the national debt stood at £1,431 million. By continuous borrowing the Government have doubled the national debt from 31st March, 1973, to 31st March, 1975.  It is an appalling prospect.  This money will have to be repaid but it certainly will not be repaid in an era of quite appalling unemployment.</P>
    <P>There is another matter the Parliamentary Secretary must consider.  This 10 per cent average increase should be reviewed again, as it was last year. Is it the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary to review the situation in the light of the figures I have read out with price increases in the coming year in excess of 28 per cent?  It is an appalling prospect.  To give an increase of 50p in social welfare benefit if it were not so serious would be laughable, but it is extremely serious for those people who are most in need of protection.</P>
    <P>On the Supplementary Estimate for Social Welfare, 1975, we had a full discussion on poverty and what gives rise to poverty and the people most affected by it.  We decided generally that poverty does not necessarily relate to lack of capital or lack of cash, that <Col N="1890" /> there was another ingredient which must be taken into account when one discusses people's conditions under the heading of poverty.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated at that time that he was setting up poverty projects.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary be good enough to tell us what progress has been made in relation to these matters?</P>
    <P>The reduction of the pensionable age on this occasion appears to have escaped the memory of the Parliamentary Secretary.  Certainly I cannot find a reference to it.  As I understood it, the pensionable age was to be reduced annually, according to the 14-point programme articulated by the Government prior to the last election.  Of course we are not meant to mention this; it is probably an abuse of the privileges of the House to mention that the Government are in dereliction of their promises in this respect.</P>

      <P>It is there somewhere, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, but I cannot see it. The Parliamentary Secretary in his statement on the Supplementary Estimate on Social Welfare stated in regard to poverty and redistribution:</P>
      <P>Social welfare provision can always and too easily be reduced to merely coping with the effect of need and deprivation.  It must be recognised that in so far as poverty in our society is self-perpetuating&mdash; and it does appear to be so&mdash;then proportionately more national resources will have to be made available if society wills to end this situation. Social policies will have to be more rather than less distributive in their impact, and they will have to take effect at a rate which will ensure a proper sharing out of the increased resources of the nation. That is the challenge which faces us if we are serious about combating poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite clearly the Government are not serious about the intent here expressed honestly and no doubt sincerely <Col N="1892" /> by the Parliamentary Secretary. What we have done in this Social Welfare Bill effectively is a minimal, mechanical readjustment of certain social welfare entitlements, and that is the size of it.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary undoubtedly came into the Department in a reforming mood, absolutely confident that he could restructure all the various schemes in this well-presented booklet.  Now he comes back rather quietly to the Dáil and presents us with a Bill which mechanically readjusts upwards the social welfare entitlement. But how far upwards?  That is the question those people in receipt of the pension and the various other entitlements will be asking themselves when the increased benefits become operative.  One can only describe the increases as a pittance and paltry in their effect having regard to inflation.</P>
    <P>The increases being sought are being paid for by those people who are lucky to have jobs.  Let us be fair to the people.  We have a tremendous social conscience and the vast majority of the people are willing to pay their fair share in taxes to ensure that their less well-off brothers and sisters are not to be deprived.  However, the people also look for fair play and to be treated properly.  What is happening here is that the middle income group, and the lower income group to a lesser extent, are being crucified by the Government.  They have taken the joy out of motoring.  They have taken the joy out of the pint of stout, to the point where now the publican is going on short time and many of his staff are working shorter hours.</P>

      <P>There is no decision outstanding in this case.  The weekly rate of unemployment assistance of the person concerned was reduced as from 24th September, 1975, when a deciding officer reassessed his weekly rate of means for unemployment assistance purposes.  He appealed against the revised assessment but an appeals officer upheld the decision of the deciding officer.  An appeals officer's decision is final in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.  Payments of unemployment assistance are continuing at the appropriate rate as they fall due.</P>

      <P>Notification of the kind referred to by the Deputy as indeed all correspondence, should be addressed to the Manager, Prize Bonds Office, Bank of Ireland, 33/41 Mount Street Lower, Dublin 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prize bonds are not transferable. On the death of the sole holder of a <Col N="1862" /> bond, repayment is made to his personal representative on application. Pending repayment, the bond is eligible for inclusion in draws, as if the holder were alive, for a period not exceeding 24 calendar months following the month in which the death occurred.  I consider that this period provides sufficient time to dispose of a deceased bondholder's estate and that it is not necessary to extend it.</P>
    <P>As regards a joint holding the bond automatically becomes the property of the survivor on the death of the other holder.</P>
    <P>A bond in the name of a deceased holder falls to be taken up by the State only in the event of the holder dying intestate and there being no person entitled to his estate.  This is governed by section 73 of the Succession Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>As there is no time limit on the period in which claims for the repayment of the bond of a deceased holder or prizes drawn by such bond may be made, the advertising proposed by the Deputy is not considered necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Areas such as <Col N="1863" /> East Limerick/North and West Tipperary cannot be designated as disadvantaged unless they meet specific criteria laid down in the EEC directive. One of these relates to income levels which must be appreciably below the national average.  As I informed the Deputy in reply to a similar question on 4th December last, the data available at that time indicated that income levels generally in this area were not significantly below the national average.  Further work since carried out by my Department in consultation with local interests has confirmed this conclusion.  In the circumstances it appears that a sustainable case cannot be made for the designation of the area.  Decisions, of course, are taken by the EEC Commission and Council on the basis of whether or not the criteria in the directive are met and the level of contribution from EEC funds would not be a relevant factor.  As the Deputy is aware, claims for designation as disadvantaged have been put forward on behalf of several relatively extensive areas of the country outside the western counties.  The situation generally in regard to these claims will be reviewed by the Government at an early date, following which an announcement will be made.</P>
