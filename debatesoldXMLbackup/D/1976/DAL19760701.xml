    <P>The following motion was moved by the Taoiseach on Wednesday, 30th June, 1976:</P>
    <P>That the Dáil on its rising this week do adjourn until Wednesday, 13th October, 1976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned last night I was discussing what seemed to me to be the growing impotence of the Government, and indeed of the Dáil in general.  It is significant that at that time along with the Chairman, only a junior Parliamentary Secretary representing the whole of the Government party and two or three Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party were present.  I had been expressing the fear that the elected representatives of the people, which we are, are ceasing to be the people who exercise power in this country.  In the performance of the Government in the last three years, especially in the last three months, as the tide of economic chaos rises, the impotence of the Government and of the Dáil generally is becoming more apparent every day. The exercise of power by the elected representatives of the people, as I conceive the democratic idea to be, is passing into the hands of self-appointed undemocratic pressure groups and people who control the economy of this country to the detriment of the people <Col N="2268" /> as a whole and especially to the detriment of young people coming out of schools and colleges at the present time, and who came from the schools and colleges in the last two years.</P>
      <P>The exercise of this selfish power by these self-appointed people, these undemocratic despots who are arrogating to themselves more and more power is ensuring that young people leaving school will have a very small prospect of employment.  It is to the Government that the people must look for leadership in this regard if the democratic idea is to survive.  Anybody listening to the Taoiseach yesterday as he read his script, prepared for him, one presumes, by civil servants, could not say that there is any glimmer of hope for the young people or for the unemployed who have lost their jobs because of the sheer inertia of the present Government and their incapacity to govern.  What is notable in all their contributions to date is the sustained attack on the Fianna Fáil party and the fancied inadequacies of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary party and the Fianna Fáil front bench.  It does not yet seem to have struck the Government, or indeed the Press and the media, that Fianna Fáil are not the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conduct of the nation's affairs is now in the hands of the Taoiseach and his Cabinet and the reality is that &mdash;and this has been testified to by every reputable organisation that applies itself to the economic situation&mdash;we have never had such a state of chaos, despair, despondency and disillusionment among the people as we have now.  Never has there been such great reason to be despondent and disillusioned. In the middle of all this chaos and disillusionment we have become accustomed to hear the more pseudo-liberal Members of the Government, such as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, doing a purple patch about contraception or the desirability of divorce and the desirability of overthrowing one of the institutions that is guaranteed by Article 41 of the Constitution, the sacred institution of marriage.  In the middle of all the economic chaos they find nothing to occupy them but these irrelevancies that are despised and abhorred by the great <Col N="2269" /> mass of Irish people whether Catholic, Protestant or of the minority religions.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's speech had a little section dealing with agriculture that must have been written by somebody with an extraordinary sense of humour who painted a picture of glowing contemporary success and ignored the fact completely that the State of our cattle herd, the greatest national resource we have, is very parlous, indeed, whether viewed from the point of view of numbers or animal health.  The same applies to our sheep flock and recently the pig herd hit the lowest point in numbers for many years and it has only recently begun to rise from the appallingly low figure of 800,000.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach assures us and assures farmers from the lofty elevation of his constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown that farmers have no need to be anxious or worried about the proposals that may be made by the European Commission to deal with the surplus of dried skim powder that has been accumulating over the past couple of years in European stores.  But we have need to worry because it is proposed by the Commission to introduce a system of co-responsibility.  That means in reality the imposition of a tax on production to be levied evenly on the highly developed Dutch or Danish dairy industry and the half-developed Irish industry.  Not only that, but it will be levied on the intervention price rather than the actual producer price received by Irish producers which would make an utterly unfair discrimination against Irish producers.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, evidently from reading his speech, sees nothing to be anxious about in this, but I want to say to the Taoiseach&mdash;nobody in the Government understands these matters because there is nobody there who is directly involved himself in the business of making a living from agriculture&mdash; that if he holds this optimistic view about the measures that are to be taken by the European Commission on the control of milk production, nobody else does, nobody in the dairy industry.  It is an indication of the total absence of policy in this vital matter that the Taoiseach in this House yesterday should talk the kind of drivel that he <Col N="2270" /> did talk on this matter.  I dislike using that expression but I do not know of any other that would accurately describe the folly that the agricultural section of the Taoiseach's speech contained.</P>
    <P>He did not refer either to the extraordinarily difficult problem of MCAs and their incidence on all Irish agricultural exports.  After the price review in February, with the customary fanfare of media sunburstry, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries announced that he had secured a 2 per cent devaluation of the green £ and went on to say that it would be worth &mdash;I have forgotten the figure&mdash;£50 million or something like that.  Inside a week, because of the slippage of the £ sterling in the monetary market, the effect of this ridiculous revaluation was totally wiped out and the situation now in the beef export market is that there is a tax of between £50 and £60 on our live exports and a tax of between 6p and 8p a lb., depending on the quality of the cut, on our dead meat exports.  What is vital about it is that the United Kingdom market is shrinking very rapidly and will be gone in due course; the UK is rapidly becoming self-sufficient in meat production and it is incumbent on us then to expand our exports particularly to Germany, Belgium and possibly the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>The German trade had been expanding but it cannot expand if the monetary compensatory amounts continue to rise uncontrolled.  I recently heard the Italian MCAs have been frozen; I am not certain of that but if they have, it will serve as an exemplar for the European Commission to freeze ours also, if they are not to result in the total distortion of trade, and they are having precisely that effect now. Neither the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries nor any Member of the Government has said anything in my hearing in recent months about whether an immediate and realistic devaluation of the green £ will now be sought in order to keep the co-efficient constant in the relationship between the green £ and the real purchasing power of the £ sterling.  That is what is not being maintained and that is what counts. If it is not done our exports will be <Col N="2271" /> very seriously inhibited.  From what we can ascertain the Government are either unaware of this or are incapable of dealing with it because they have not indicated their intentions in this regard.</P>
    <P>The dairy industry was recently appalled by the agreement of the Council of Agriculture Ministers to accept from New Zealand, a third country, the guaranteed export into the United Kingdom market of 120,000 tons of butter for the next three years and thereafter and protocol 18 of the British Treaty of Accession runs out. This question will be broached I understand at the council meeting on 7th July and it is likely that the facilities extended by the summit meeting held here in Dublin and presided over by he Taoiseach, for the importation of New Zealand butter and cheese into the UK market to compete with ours will be extended further.  It is worth remembering that the milk required for the production of 120,000 tons of butter exceeds by far the total Irish production of milk.  Irish exports would hardly have been more than about 65 per cent of that, I would imagine, last year and the contribution of the Irish dairy industry to the skim milk powder mountain is a mere 60,000 tons or so, out of 1.3 million tons.</P>
    <P>The real offenders in this area are, of course, primarily the United Kingdom in importing dairy products from their old Commonwealth countries, like Australia and New Zealand and, to some extent, Canada as well.  This seems to have the blessing of the Coalition Government because not once in all the three-and-a-half years they have been in office have we heard any condemnation of the gross interference with the Community preference, one of the basic principles of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>Time does not permit me to discuss the dire necessity for a revision of the farm modernisation scheme and Directive 160 of that scheme and the dire necessity to make land available for young farmers who do not have enough land at the moment to expand.  I am sorry the Taoiseach is in such a frightful hurry to shut this House down and <Col N="2272" /> silence the voices of the elected representatives of the people and I am sorry I have not time to discuss at as much length as I would wish the serious problems that press on agriculture and, indeed, on the economy generally.  But the Taoiseach would have it otherwise. He wants to shut this place and gag those elected by the people to express their complaints and make their requests.  The Taoiseach wants to govern by Press releases for the next three-and-a-half months and all we can do is vote against this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the need for the parliamentary vacation nobody can challenge the need to give the Opposition a rest to facilitate them in reassessing their own position.  We have been promised the now traditional Fianna Fáil response to electoral defeats, another reshuffling of the Opposition front bench because those who are there presently have been found wanting.  It does seem to me that a party in such total disarray should be glad of the opportunity to withdraw from the public gaze because every time they have gone to the public since the last general election they have lost ground.</P>
      <P>The almost inevitable experience of democratic government is to be unpopular in the middle of their cycle of office and this tendency is certainly accentuated in a time of economic difficulty.  At a time when this country, like so many others, is experiencing unprecedented economic difficulties one could have expected the Opposition to make hay while the political sun shone, as far as they were concerned, but instead of making ground they have actually lost ground.  Over the three-and-a-half years after going into Opposition, a period during which they had every opportunity to take advantage of the Government, a Government subjected to global economic battering, they have lost political support.  They are now three seats down and the Government are two seats stronger and somewhere in the wings is the malignant growth on the Fianna Fáil body, which is a cause of very great distress and worry to anybody who is opposed to Fascism and believes the will of the people should prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2273" /> This Dáil adjourns today for the summer recess.  In our democratic situation the Government are faced with an Opposition which has no fight left, which is losing political support, which carries no conviction whatsoever of being capable of providing an alternative Government should there be a wish on the part of the people to bring about a change of Government.  All electoral tests since the last general election have clearly shown that Government support is growing.  This ought to bring home to the Opposition and to critics of the Government the fact that the people are not fools, that they understand what is happening in the outside world, that they appreciate the difficulties which face other countries and us, that they understand Ireland is an open economy and must accept the disadvantages of global recession in the same way as it has enjoyed in the last 15 years the immense growth that occurred because the world economy was expanding.</P>
    <P>The country is aware that the world economy is now recovering, though at a rate far below that experienced in the last decade.  Our growth rate in the future is unlikely to outstrip that of the countries with which we trade. Ireland is on a world economic escalator and, when that escalator is going up, we go up and, when it is going in reverse, we go into reverse too. The only action which can be taken to prevent a complete reversal is for the Government to inject considerable amounts of public money into public capital expenditure to allow the country to curb to some extent the global trend downwards of the economic escalator.  That is what this Government did over the last three years in exceptionally difficult circumstances. Whatever our difficulties today, they would be immeasurably greater had the Government not implemented the financial and economic policies upon which we deliberately embarked over these last three most difficult years.</P>
    <P>The time has now come for an end to the béal bocht.  Unfortunately, we will continue to have the béal bocht from Deputies opposite and from some commentators. The interesting thing is that most of the exhortations coming from <Col N="2274" /> such quarters have not been matched by practice.  One hopes that the behaviour of some people who have exhorted restraint, while they have been unwilling themselves to practice it, will at least expose them as being hypocritical. Perhaps they might now at this stage match their own practice with the exhortations they give to others.</P>
    <P>This Government have matched their exhortations with practice.  I would recall&mdash;I do not make anything of it&mdash; that the members of this Government have themselves personally foregone all income increases to which they were entitled under the National Wage Agreements since June, 1975.  We have deliberately declined to take any increase in our incomes from June, 1975, to January, 1977, and so the Government have a right to ask others to make some sacrifice and to forego a little.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by the Leader of the Opposition and others, including commentators, that the Government are not giving leadership.  Leadership in a democracy means endeavouring to persuade people to follow a line which the Government consider to be the right line.  No Government have taken more time or care or have exercised more patience in this field than the present administration.  Although history is seldom of interest or matter for headlines, I want to record it to remind people that the exhortations of the Government today are in no way different from what the Government were asking people to do in 1974.</P>
    <P>In November, 1974, the Government published a White Paper dealing with the economy and with incomes in particular. In that White Paper&mdash;A National Partnership&mdash;the Government spelled out that the alternative to moderation in income demand would be a loss of competitiveness and greater unemployment. That view has since been endorsed by innumerable institutes and organisations&mdash;the National Economic and Social Council, the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Central Bank, as well as other institutional and individual commentators at home and abroad.  That lesson is as true now as it was in 1974.  The tragedy is that the <Col N="2275" /> Government's plea did not receive the proper response from the people.</P>
    <P>We have had more meetings with the social partners, with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and with organised employers, than any previous Government. I would remind the House that on 10th December last the Government had a summit meeting with representatives of trade unions, farmers, employers and industry.  At that meeting the Taoiseach, in the name of the Government, addressed a special plea to the social partners.  On that evening he went on television and radio and his remarks were carried in the newspapers the following day.  The Taoiseach's message to the nation then&mdash;it is his message now and it is still the Government's message&mdash;was that without an adjustment of the attitudes and expectations of our people, particularly those in employment, there is little hope of improvement through budgetary or any other policy.</P>
    <P>In December last, for the first time in our history, the Government gave the country a forecast of the budgetary position.  This was illustrated on television on 10th December and in all the newspapers of 11th December, 1975, in graphs issued by the Department of Finance.  It showed expenditure as demanded by public Departments and by Government agencies and it showed also the cuts that had been made at that stage in the demands by various Departments. The cuts were more than £300 million.  The graphs also showed unavoidable expenditure which the Government said would have to be met by additional taxation because the possibility of additional borrowing was not on and even if it was it would be economically undesirable.</P>
    <P>Of course the Government could have made further cuts but the consequence of such cuts would have been greater unemployment.  That in itself might have reduced public capital expenditure but it would have added to the social welfare bill.  I wonder what else can a Government do if democracy is to survive other than do precisely what we have been doing?  We have put the facts to the people and we have endeavoured to persuade them to <Col N="2276" /> make decisions in their own interests. I am still satisfied that the overwhelming mass of our people are prepared to forego a little themselves individually in order that all can gain, provided no strong interest group runs ahead of everyone else.  The best way to achieve that in a society is by exercising individual and community sanity. Other countries have done it; why must Ireland always be the last to move in the right direction?</P>
    <P>This difficulty of which I speak is not of recent origin.  It has existed in this country for the last couple of decades.  As a country we will have to cop ourselves on.  I am not saying other countries were not behaving in a similar manner.  They were but at least they are now correcting their own attitudes and behaviour.  They are now accepting the realities of economic life.  We do not now live behind tariff walls.  We could not survive and maintain our standard of living behind such walls and such protection.  We have to be involved in free trade, we have to compete with the outside world, we have to sell our goods on an Irish market that is exposed to competition from abroad.  We cannot face that competition if we price ourselves out of the Irish market by giving ourselves green confetti by way of income increases.  We cannot compete on foreign markets if we give ourselves green confetti for our wages at home and, by so doing, increase the price of our commodities abroad.</P>
    <P>No unacceptable sacrifice is being asked of anybody.  All that is being asked is a little patience.  We have to correct the difficult situation which arose in the last few years.  If we are to remain solvent and credit-worthy our first commitment must be the repayment of loans that we deliberately made.  I would point out that we borrowed with the full support of the business community, some of whom are now very vocal in attacking us for doing so.  We borrowed with the full support of the labour movement some of whom are not hesitant in criticising the tax necessary to meet Government expenditure <Col N="2277" /> including repayment of debt.  We borrowed with the full support of people who argue that the Government should make up for the shortfall in private expenditure.  We borrowed with the full support of every international institution of which we are members, from the European Economic Community to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the IMF and the World Bank.  Without having made those borrowings, without having maintained Government expenditure at the level at which we deliberately maintained it&mdash;we are unapologetic for maintaining it at that level&mdash;our unemployment figure would have risen to 200,000 or more.  That was not acceptable to us.  It would have been calamitous from an economic point of view as well as from a social point of view.</P>
    <P>We explained this in every budget we introduced.  We also indicated that when the world economy began to pick up, when prospects improved to sell our goods abroad and at home, it would be necessary to change the direction of overall public expenditure so that enough money would be left for the private sector to reinvest and so that Government expenditure could be reduced.  That was the direction of our budget last January.</P>
    <P>When we met the social partners last December we explained frankly the need to increase Government revenue.  In December nobody said we were wrong to spend the money&mdash;not one, from the left, the right or the middle.  They accepted the need to maintain Government expenditure at the level at which we maintained it this year.  They accepted also the reality that Government borrowing had reached a level it would be unwise to exceed.  They accepted that to increase borrowing would be to commit further resources in years to come for the repayment of short-term debt instead of applying such resources to productive investment.</P>
    <P>When the Government imposed the tax that everyone knew was necessary, instead of doing what we exhorted should be done in November, 1974, that those in jobs should not seek compensation for necessary additions in taxation, those in jobs <Col N="2278" /> insisted on getting total compensation for increases in expenditure taxation on some of the less essential items.  For as long as we continue on the present course a very large slice of public expenditure will have to go on paying increases in public sector remuneration. The higher those increases the higher will be the revenue the State will have to collect and the higher the taxation the State will have to impose. It does not matter who is Minister for Finance.  It does not matter what is the title of the administration.  It does not matter if there is a national Government, an one-party Government or a ten-party Government, those are the realities of financial and economic life in the country and no critic can deny the accuracy of what I assert.  In Heaven's name is it not time, therefore, that we put aside sectional interests, party interests, and accepted those realities of life as they have been accepted in every other country in the world?</P>
    <P>We cannot afford in this country an upstairs and downstairs mentality, upstairs the well-to-do, the secure and well provided for, using their muscle power to extract even more out of the community.  The consequence of that for those downstairs would be insecurity and unhappiness and an inability to keep up with the progress of those on top.</P>
    <P>This is a Government who believe in social equity.  All our policies, economic, social and fiscal, are pointed in this direction and have shown our conviction and our determination in the face of the most bitter, vicious and vehement opposition ever mounted in Dáil Éireann against social reform.  We are determined to proceed on the path of social reform.  The country, knowing it has a Government committed to the fair distribution of wealth, should accept the <i>bona fides</i> of that Government and the validity of the arguments the Government are advancing, particularly, when by accepting the policies which the Government are enunciating, nobody will be the poorer but everybody in the long run will be better off.  The sooner these realities are faced the quicker will be the pace of recovery, the surer will be the recovery and the more certain will be <Col N="2279" /> the continuation of the country's progress.</P>
    <P>Our problems would be great even if we had not got an increasing population. Our problems are the greater by reason of our increase in population, so also are our opportunities.  The opportunities for growth in the Irish market are greater because our population is rising.  It is a population which is an active, young, dedicated and generous population.  It is an extraordinary thing that notwithstanding all the difficulties of the last few years our population has been increasing, not merely, by virtue of a rise in the birth rate but also because net immigration continued.  We have more people coming into the country than going out.  Gone are the bad old days when we had annually 20,000, 30,000 and even 50,000 people emigrating and had 90,000 or 100,000 people unemployed.  If the bad old days of emigration were here then the Government could produce a much happier looking unemployment index and the unemployment figure could be down to 60,000.  That would be the Fianna Fáil recipe, to let the people drift away.</P>
    <P>This Government have not allowed that.  They have maintained living standards as best they could in a very difficult situation.  They have given people hope in their own land.  They have given people prospects of living here.  They have invested money in industry infrastructure and education. They are giving our people opportunities for the future.  As we are educating our young, and otherwise providing for them, as we are building homes for them, we must also provide jobs for them.  Is it too much to ask that those in jobs, who tend to be the parents of today, should put a little aside in order to allow their own children jobs in their own land?  That is what incomes moderation is all about.  I do not know any father and mother in Ireland who would not make a sacrifice for their own children.  That is what we all, collectively, have to do.  If we think that by demanding more now and consuming more now we can provide employment for our children in the future we are doing our children a disservice, not <Col N="2280" /> to talk about the disservice we are doing to ourselves as well.</P>
    <P>We will have to be more moderate in our income demands in the next 10 years.  The green plan will spell this out even though there may be those who will argue that the Government should not dare to spell out what the rate of income should be in the years ahead.  It is not possible to plan unless everybody accepts the need to maintain incomes at a level which will enable the plan to work.  Several of our plans in the past have been frustrated because income levels far outran what it was possible for our economy to provide without generating unemployment, unacceptably high public expenditures and economic distress.  The realities will have to be faced.</P>
    <P>There is natural frustration in the country that negotiations for the 1976 national wage agreement took so long and that the procedures to vote on the negotiated settlement are also very long.  I have been arguing for several years, not merely from the Government benches but from the Opposition benches too, that there would be no economic sanity in the country until the Government became involved in income determination, not merely as an employer but also as guardian of the common good.  Look at other countries where income levels for a year or more are detemined with far greater speed and with better results.  In all those countries the government's voice is heeded.  In countries with moderate income levels the government are not only not excluded from but they are welcomed into consultations, so that all can be made aware of economic realities, so that an objective assessment can be made as to what an economy can afford.</P>
    <P>It was, and is part of our process of policy formulation and of improving public attitudes to involve the Government. That is why last November/ December and prior to that we had many meetings with the social partners. We spoke to the social partners and spoke to the nation as a whole, spelling out the economic budgetary realities. These are not the difficulties merely of whoever happens to be caretaking the economic and financial affairs of the country at any particular time.  The <Col N="2281" /> national budget is the community budget, and nobody in the community can run away from the parameters of it.</P>
    <P>We were told last December and January by the social partners that account would be taken of the economic realties facing this country.  Can anybody say that all our experience in the last six months indicates that the economic realities are being faced by different sections of the community?  There are many cases&mdash;I do not have to list them, I do not have to name them, for fear I am accused of an untimely intervention.  I do not have to mention them at all but they are known to everybody who listens to or reads the media.  The truth is that there are far too many people anxious to enforce economic realities on others but unwilling to have them applied to them.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with a report which hit the headlines this morning. It is the latest report of the Economic and Social Research Institute, their quarterly economic commentary for June, 1976.  It contains a number of forecasts which are at variance with the forecasts from several other bodies. Of course, one of the drawbacks in relation to economic forecasting is that the latest forecast is always regarded as being valid and people forget what was yesterday's forecast and they seldom bother to check whether the people making the latest forecast have been proved right in the past.</P>
    <P>I thought the country might find it interesting if I were to give a statement of the degree to which the Economic and Social Research Institute have been right or wrong in their forecasting since 1969, and it will be seen from this that they have seldom been right in the past; that is not to say they are not right today.  The lesson from that is that one should not put too much reliance upon any individual forecast.</P>
    <P>In 1969 the Economic and Social Research Institute in forecasting growth was wrong to the extent of 2.4 per cent.  They forecast 2.4 per cent smaller growth than actually occurred. In 1970 they forecast .6 per cent smaller growth than occurred.  In 1971 they forecast .7 per cent less <Col N="2282" /> growth than occurred.  In 1972 they forecast 2.35 per cent less growth than occurred.  In 1973 apparently overcome by the bad reputation they were getting for pessimism, they forecast growth 3 per cent in excess of what actually occurred.  Not, indeed, that I would entirely blame them because that was the year of the commencement of the oil and energy crisis which sent everything into a tail-spin, but in 1974, when economies were very obviously in distress they again erred on the optimistic side and forecast a growth of 1.35 per cent above the growth of that year.  In 1975 they reverted to their pessimistic role and they were 1.75 per cent less in their growth anticipation than what actually occurred.</P>
    <P>So it may be seen that over a period of seven years they have been roughly between 1.75 and 2 per cent wrong in their forecast, and mainly on the pessimistic side.  If that average figure is set off against their forecast published this morning it will be seen that there is room for believing they are being unduly pessimistic.  Their latest figure of growth is that of only ½ per cent this year in contrast to the economic division of my Department who expect a growth rate of between 2 per cent and 2½ per cent.  The Central Bank, I understand, will concur with this figure and the EEC expect that Ireland will have a growth of 3 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>The figure of growth which we have given in recent times and earlier this year is influenced by the fact that the Government very deliberately in their budget last January increased the public capital programme by 27½ per cent.  The Economic and Social Research Institute anticipate a fall-off in investment of 4 per cent this year. None of the other forecasting institutions and bodies which I mentioned expects to have a fall-off of that volume, and indeed it is very difficult to reconcile the calculations of the authors of the Economic and Social Research Institute report having regard to the massive increase in the public capital programme.  We expect that the actual volume increase in investment this year will rise by about 4 per cent, not that it will be 4 per cent less as the Economic and Social <Col N="2283" /> Research Institute forecast.  The indications are that we are justified in our forecast and that the Economic and Social Research Institute authors are wrong.  For instance cement sales, one of the most sensitive indicators as to whether an economy is expanding or otherwise, for the first five months of 1976 rose in volume by 5.7 per cent compared with the same period last year.  As regards investment in plant and machinery, to which the Economic and Social Research Institute does not refer, the value of imports of producers' capital goods&mdash;these are goods for investment purposes&mdash;rose in the same period of the first five months of this year compared with last year by 24.6 per cent.  In Heaven's name, how can anybody suggest that investment is falling off when the indications are that investment is rising dramatically?</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said about the longer term effects of the proposed national agreement on incomes, which regrettably does not involve as long a pay pause as the Government consider desirable, if it is adopted and implemented it will have the effect of increasing consumer demand in 1976. It was argued against the pay pause that a pay pause would have meant a fall-off in consumer demand and therefore an increase in deflationary pressures.  That was a valid argument in the short term but the consequences of a pay pause and of greater income moderation this year would have been far greater competitiveness and a massive increase in exports and, therefore, greater employment levels.  More people would have been employed, and, therefore, private consumption would have been not only maintained but after a few months considerably expanded.  In the event, things have not happened that way, but the effect of implementing the national wage agreement with its comparatively high income increases would be to generate extra demand this year, yet for some reason which is not yet fully explained the Economic and Social Research Institute report is suggesting there will be a fall-off in demand this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2284" /> There are, to say the least, a number of contradictions between the stated forecast of the Economic and Social Research Institute and the consequences of other economic forces which are at work in our midst, and there are clear contradictions between the economic indicators that are developing here which are showing growth and the pessimistic forecast of the Economic and Social Research Institute.  As I said, their record tends to be one of pessimism, and even others who are not given to optimism find they have reason to disagree with the figures as produced by the Economic and Social Research Institute.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other issues in the report on which I need not dwell too long in the House.  It is, for instance, suggested that the figures for unemployment are unreal.  Perhaps they are, but not for the single reason stated in the report of the Economic and Social Research Institute which suggests that the unemployment figure in Ireland does not truly reflect overall unemployment particularly among women.  The unemployment statistics in Ireland include a number of groups which can hardly be regarded as being unemployed in the full and true understanding of that word.  To be fully unemployed a person ought to be available for full-time, unrestricted work, but there are a number of groups now in unemployment statistics in Ireland who are not complying within that category.  They include, for instance, farmers, persons aged over 65, relatives of farmers assisting farmers, persons who through mental or physical incapacity could not perform a full day's work or in many cases even part-time work.  There is at present an interdepartmental committee examining the live register of unemployed people to see whether or not a better index could be produced.  When that has been completed it will be time to challenge all the figures.  Even among the categories of women which the Institute were at pains yesterday to identify, there is a number on the register who probably accepted unemployment voluntarily as soon as they qualify on stamps.  This is a practice which is not unusual, particularly in families where more than <Col N="2285" /> one member of the household happens to be working.</P>
    <P>I have been critical of the report of the institute but not of the value of the Economic and Social Research Institute.  I believe in the valuable contribution that economic thought and debate can make to public understanding of the facts of economic life, but I would be failing in my duty if I did not draw attention to the number of unsure grounds on which the Institute advanced their prognosis for the Irish economy.  Having criticised some of their calculations, I underline the general trend of their message, as I do of all messages issued, from whichever source which point to the need for restraint in income and also for the necessity for people in employment to accept their obligation to make their contribution to the possibility of increasing employment.</P>
    <P>There is a notion abroad that the Government alone have responsibility for increasing employment, that a Government programme of extra expenditure could generate more employment here.  The only way in which the Government could do that would be by expending more money from the public purse, and that could come only from taxation which would have to be paid by the private sector.  It is far better to leave the money with the private sector to develop, to expand, to generate their own capacity and fund investment. We can help to keep our costs low by not having any taxation higher than is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>All these elements run counter to the argument that the Government should spend more money to generate more employment.  We have spent more public money than ever before in the maintenance of employment, in endeavours to generate employment during the recession.  Now that the recession is gradually moving away is the time not to put as much reliance on public expenditure but to encourage the private sector to move forward on a path which will give the growth that this and other countries so anxiously require.</P>
    <P>Some commentators not noted for being well disposed to me or the Government have spoken about &ldquo;the untimely intervention of the Minister for <Col N="2286" /> Finance&rdquo; in relation to the bank dispute. I will put a few facts on the record hoping they will be reported elsewhere. The Government have asked for a response from all sections of the community on the incomes front.  In May of this year the banks made an offer to their officials which was rejected.  On 2nd June a further offer was made which was in line with the national pay agreement.  That was rejected.  On Monday, 14th June, a third offer was made which was well in excess of the national pay agreement and strike notice was served that day after that offer had been rejected, the strike to take effect from 28th June.  The only way in which that strike notice could have been prevented from going into effect was for a still greater offer to be made well in excess of what has been negotiated in the national pay agreement talks.</P>
    <P>Four days after service of strike notice I said that what was developing in the area of bank pay was contrary to what had been said by banks themselves in their annual reports and in the recommendations which they had made regarding the running of our economy, no more and no less.  It is straining words to the point of foolishness to suggest that to remind people of their own recipe for economic salvation is &ldquo;an untimely intervention&rdquo;.  I might remind the House and the country of a remark which was contained in the report of the inquiry into the 1970 banks dispute.  I quote from paragraph 215:</P>
    <P>Secondly, it is unlikely in these days that bank officials or any other substantial and visible group will be allowed to break clear away from the standards of pay generally accepted in the country, without other groups taking action to restore an acceptable balance... Bank officials are citizens of Ireland and not men from Mars entitled to expatriation allowances.</P>
    <P>They are not my words.  They were written seven years ago.  Is it untimely to remind the country and the people involved in this dispute of those words, or do they challenge them?</P>
    <P>Is it suggested that some people have a citizenship rights and a loyalty superior to that which <Col N="2287" /> they owe to Ireland?  To judge by the behaviour of some of them, and I am not thinking merely of the banks, there are others who believe in entitlement to expatriation allowances at the expense of the remainder of the community.  I do not believe it and the Government do not. We Irish have to exercise more discipline and unselfishness than has been our wont.  If we do that the economy can recover.  The Government's green paper will be saying this in clear, unambiguous, unemotional language, and we will be looking forward to getting a more positive response and we may move along the path that many other democratic countries have moved along, a path of prudence and of acceptance of the economic facts of life and of the need to understand that none of us can be an exception to the need to forego a little so that all can gain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be justified in expressing shock at the content of the Minister's speech were is not for the fact that we have become so accustomed to that type of speech that we are no longer capable of being shocked by it.  At a time when the economy is in a disastrous situation, when inflation is increasing rapidly, when the unemployment figures for this time of the year are at an all-time high, one would have expected from the Minister for Finance some information on a policy with which he would hope to combat this disastrous situation.  All we got from him were attacks on the Fianna Fáil Party and excuses for the failure of Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of this frightening report from the ESRI, which can by no means be regarded as an appendage of the Fianna Fáil Party, one would have thought that the Minister, knowing these facts before this report was published, would have come in here with some suggestions as to how the Government propose to cope with the problems facing us.  However, having listened to the Taoiseach yesterday, it would be too much to expect that we would have any variation on the theme from the Minister for Finance. <Col N="2288" /> I was particularly interested, and I am sure the country will be, that the Minister's instance of the practical way in which the Government have given a lead to the public was that they have foregone increases in their salaries.  Might I remind him that we did likewise, but that in the short period in which they have been in office Ministerial salaries have doubled?</P>
    <P>The Minister has a personal responsibility for the manner in which the economy has deteriorated because of the way in which his statements escalate from gloom and doom to exhilirating confidence, and back again. At the same time I would stress that I am not making the Minister personally responsible, because it is a Government responsibility.  I have no doubt that the Coalition Government as such would be only too pleased if we directed our attention solely to the Minister for Finance, so that coming up to the next election they could move him to another Department and put in a new Minister to give the appearance of a totally changed situation.</P>
    <P>It is pointed out in the report of the ESRI that Government policies have failed and, unless they are changed, there is no future for the country or for the unemployed and there is no hope of reducing inflationary trends. It was pointed out that the impact of the budget is responsible for the fact that there will be practically a nil rate of economic growth this year.  The Minister has already pointed out that ESRI had originally stated that there would be a 2 per cent growth, but the Minister's budget has come in the meantime and that had to be taken into consideration in the latest report. There is an extraordinary difference between what this report, prepared by people who are not involved with any political party, has to say about growth in the economy&mdash;which will be nil&mdash;and the statements of the Minister for Finance&mdash;who says the increase in economic growth will be 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>I was also interested to note the Minister's references to ERSI forecasts in previous years.  He pointed out that as the forecast was too low in <Col N="2289" /> certain years and too high in others, we could not rely on them. The interesting point is this: their forecast in relation to economic growth in 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972 was low.  In those years Fianna Fáil were in office and that made the difference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1973 when the ESRI thought we had a group of geniuses in office they believed that this group would be able to increase the economic growth to a height never dreamed of.  In fact, the forecast increase was in excess of the actual economic growth in 1973 and 1974. That was a lesson for the public.</P>
      <P>At this point, I would like to add my voice to the protest made by the Leader of this party and other speakers in relation to the adjournment of the Dáil today.  It might be said that this is a gimmick because we all like to have holidays.  We are no different from anybody else in the sense that we would like our holidays, but we believe that it is totally irresponsible on the part of this Government to adjourn the Dáil when there is a bank strike and when the decision on the national wage agreement has not been reached, but will be reached by the end of this week.  A responsible Government would ensure that the Dáil were sitting when the economy is in very grave danger.  It is obvious that the whole purpose of this exercise is to ensure that Fianna Fáil will not have the opportunity to criticise the steps the Government may take to deal with these matters.  The Government are doing a very serious disservice to this country by adjourning the Dáil.  I want to make it very clear that we are putting forward in a responsible manner our proposal that the Dáil should continue until we know the shape of things to come.  We can then give advice to the Government on the steps they should take in future to deal with these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me the fatal flaw in this Coalition, as in previous Coalitions, is the fact that there is a complete lack of leadership.  This applies to the Taoiseach <Col N="2290" /> and to the Government as a whole.  The hallmark of this Coalition is indecision.  It is no use comparing this Coalition with coalitions in other countries.  We have heard on many occasions in this House from the Government benches that there are coalition governments in many EEC countries.  In those countries the coalitions are formed from parties which have more or less the same outlook. Here we have a highly conservative Fine Gael Party allied to a Labour Party, which would like to regard itself as being well to the left.  At Government meetings it must be a fact that each decision which comes before the Government is decided not simply in the national interest, but rather on how it will affect the fortunes of individual parties.</P>
    <P>We have had many debates on the highly inflationary situation in which we are living and the fact that our inflation rate is very much higher than in any other EEC country, and it is growing.  We have had discussions on the unemployment situation.  At this stage, had the Government heeded the advice of the Opposition we should be in the position to reassure our people that we had inflation under control, or were well on the way to doing it.  In fact, the situation is the opposite and the inflation rate is increasing.</P>
    <P>On many occasions the Opposition put forward proposals as to how inflation could be controlled.  They criticised Government policy and pointed out what the effects of that policy would be on our economy.  In January, 1975, Deputy Colley, our spokesman on Finance, pointed out what he believed would be the effect of the handling of the economy and the budgetary situation by the Minister for Finance and the Government.  That forecast, which is on record, proved to have been extraordinarily accurate.  It is now clear that had the Government taken notice of the advice given by this side of the House we would be in a better situation today.</P>
    <P>One would have hoped that by this stage, after three-and-a-half years of Coalition Government, we would be in a situation where we could say that measures had been taken to restore our <Col N="2291" /> competitiveness in the world market and on the home market, where we had to compete with foreign goods. Here again the same inactivity is to be seen.  Many of our industries have closed down and many more are in serious trouble.  Within the next few weeks in my own constituency approximately 200 people will be made redundant.  This Government did nothing to allay the fears of the industrialists and business people on whom we rely to provide jobs which are so necessary in this extremely high unemployment period and in the light of the fact that very many of our young people are coming out from the schools.</P>
    <P>During the course of his speech the Minister asked why the advice given by the Government was not heeded. The reason why the Government's advice is not heeded is because nobody, even within the Government, knows whether what they say today will not be changed tomorrow.  This is the indecision of which I have already spoken and which has created fear and panic among the business community. It is indecision in the sense that we have seen over the past few years, since the Coalition came into Government. Certain proposals emanated from the Minister for Finance and from the Government which could in our view help considerably towards controlling the inflationary trends and reducing unemployment, but invariably as soon as any opposition appeared from some of the groups mentioned by Deputy Gibbons the Government immediately retreated.  Not only that, but they endeavoured to make a virtue out of necessity.  For instance, we had the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance appearing on television and speaking on radio, pointing out how serious the situation was in relation to the economy, pointing out that unless we had a nine months' pay pause the economy would be in tatters, and assuring people that this was the factual situation and unless the advice given by the Minister and by the Taoiseach was heeded unemployment would rise rapidly, and inflationary rates would go out of control.  A very short time <Col N="2292" /> afterwards we found them not only retreating from this particular position but actually stating that they were reasonably satisfied with the situation which had evolved.</P>
    <P>Having asked the people to tighten their belts, which I have no doubt the people were prepared to do, they introduced a budget in January of this year which put all hope of reaching a reasonable solution to one side, and the workers in the various industries felt that it was necessary for them to demand increases in their incomes to cope with the problems which were made for them by the Government and the Minister for Finance.  In those circumstances how can the people believe any proclamation or statement by this Government?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach yesterday referred to the national wage agreement and pointed out the dangers that were inherent in it.  The fact is that it was because of the manner in which the Government refused to accept any responsibility in the early stages of the negotiations that this position came about. The negotiations moved along at a very slow pace and the result was that workers in individual industries made claims against their employers, and when that stage was reached it was going to be extremely difficult to reach a reasonable level in relation to a national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, the basic flaw of this Government is lack of leadership. The country is getting no lead and it is not only apparent to those people who are in a position to invest and to provide employment but it is evident to the ordinary man in the street who as a result tends to give up hope.  There is complete lack of confidence in this Government and in this leadership and this will ensure that the crisis in which we are at present will continue.  Confidence is basic in relation to getting this country back on its feet and confidence is lacking.  As I pointed out I am not surprised that confidence has gone because if the Government do not know what they are about it is difficult for people to know what to do.  Deputy Barry Desmond stated last night that a plan was not necessary, that it was not essential that a plan <Col N="2293" /> should be produced, but that people should work hard at what they were doing and that in that way we would end the economic crisis.  What he is in effect saying is that the Government have failed, that they do not know what to do and they hope that the workers and employers might possibly be able to continue without any diretion. The Minister stated that the Government were looked upon to do everything.  That is not a fact; the Government are simply asked to provide leadership, to make the decisions and stand by them, and in that way ensure that people throughout the country, whatever their walk of life, will know exactly where they are going, what the purpose is, what the target is and they will endeavour to reach that target.</P>
    <P>We have had complaints from the media about the low turn-out at the Dublin by-election and they stated that this indicated a loss of faith in democracy.  The Minister spoke about the number of elections they won but he and certainly the Labour Party will regard the election of the best possible candidate that they could get in the Dublin constituency as a pyrrhic victory if the Labour vote continues to fall or even falls to the extent that it fell in that by-election. In the future the Labour Party will not thank the Minister for Local Government for changing the constituencies.</P>
    <P>I will look briefly into the background of the media situation.  Before the general election of 1973 the media in the main, for one reason or another, seemed to dislike Fianna Fáil.  Some felt it was time for a change; some believed that they had a group of extremely clever people who would do a better job in Government than Fianna Fáil, and they supported the Coalition.  The Coalition came into office and for some time afterwards praise was lavished on them for the wonderful work they were said to be doing.  As time went on and the Coalition began to fade and the Ministers in the Coalition were showing themselves unable and incapable of delivering, the media began to have second thoughts but being human they <Col N="2294" /> nonetheless in the main continued their support for the Coalition.</P>
    <P>Finally, when the economic situation became so bad that they could not possibly overlook it they became critical of the Coalition but invariably they were more critical of Fianna Fáil. So, if the public recognised, as they did, that this Government was an absolute failure and if they believed what the media was telling them about Fianna Fáil I see no reason why they would vote.</P>
    <P>Of course that is not the position at all.  I wonder how an objective observer judges.  Does he judge us on our policies?  We have already produced and announced a number of policies.  We have more in preparation and will announce them when we believe the time is opportune.  Are we judged on these?  I have seen on many occasions statements in the media about the lack of policy in Fianna Fáil.  We have policies and they are quite obvious, but I should like to look at the other side of the coin. if the media believe that we are not up to standard and have not the necessary policies, how do they judge the Coalition which met a few days before the 1973 general election and got into a huddle in a room in Leinster House and quickly drafted a 14-point plan which is now the joke of the century.  What policy was there and how do the media regard it as policy?  If they criticise the documents we have issued and criticise us for not issuing more documents how do they look on this 14-point plan, when some of the points in it helped to elect the Coalition and the people now have a Coalition Government instead of a Fianna Fáil one?  Was it well thought out and planned policy which got the Coalition into office or was it a document drafted by a few politicians who wrote down a list of the things which they thought would be the most pleasant type of policy they could put forward?</P>
    <P>I am not asking for any favours: I have never been critical of the Press or the media generally.  I have been praised by the media, condemned by the media.  I was sometimes condemned when I thought it was unfair and at <Col N="2295" /> other times when I believed it was justified.  All we ask is a fair deal and when the media refer to our policy or the lack of it they would also comment on the 14-point plan and ask themselves if it was on that plan that the Coalition were elected and how long they had been preparing it and what depth of study went into it.</P>
    <P>We have policies, but apart from that we are offering the country something that is at least equally important &mdash;leadership, a leadership which was very clearly present during our term of office despite the fact that we had quite a number of problems.  This Fianna Fáil Party which is so often criticised is the same Fianna Fáil Party which pulled this country up by its bootlaces after two disastrous periods of Coalition.  It is the same Fianna Fáil Party which left office in 1973 and left the country in such a sound economic condition that our leader could repeat the words of Seán Lemass when he asked the Coalition to return the country in the state in which they got it.  It is the same Fianna Fáil Party that provided stable Government over 16 years and which was elected time and again and which got more votes in 1973 than in the 1969 election.  It is the same Fianna Fáil Party which created hundreds of thousands of jobs over that period.  I believe the basic quality of Fianna Fáil is the strength of its leadership and its dogged determination to carry out the policies in which it believes and which are in the interests of the nation rather than simply wondering how they will affect the party's fortunes.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason why I was motivated to speak in these terms was because of an article I read very recently by the education correspondent of the <i>Irish Press</i> when he referred to a statement by Most Rev. Dr. Ryan, Archbishop of Dublin, in relation to the role of the religious in education.  He pointed out that the religious who were already working in community schools had found in these schools a worth-while apostolate and, he added that the community schools <Col N="2296" /> were now doing exceptionally well.  I ask those who are interested to look back over the files of the newspapers and consider the criticism and violent attacks made on me and the Government at that time in regard to community schools.  I ask them to look back on the Official Reports of the Dáil of that period and see how the Opposition of that time tried, by dragging in all sorts of irrelevancies, to destroy the concept of the community school and I ask them to remember, if they can, the television programmes on which I appeared to defend the concept against the criticism of the present Minister for Foreign Affairs and Deputy Thornley, who were then spokesmen for their parties, and the criticism of many other educationalists.  I ask them to look at the track record of this Coalition.  Could any objective observer state with confidence that had the community school concept come to the fore in the Coalition's term of office, taking into account the same type of opposition, this very worth-while concept would have come to fruition and would be regarded as it is today?</P>
    <P>Without doubt it would long ago have gone into the limbo of forgotten things and the country would be without this very worth-while new type of school which is now praised by everybody so that many towns in Ireland are demanding the establishment of community schools.  I mention this to show that during that time, because the Government believed in the concept, even when it would appear that it would have detrimental political effects on our party, they brought these schools into being and today everybody praises it.  It is almost impossible to believe that this was only four or five years ago.  I give that as only one instance.  This was the general attitude of the Government.  It was the attitude of my colleagues in their respective Departments.  It was the attitude of the Government as a whole.  They thought out a situation and came to a conclusion as to the proper way in which to deal with the problem in hand and, having done that, they then followed it through.  This is where the Coalition <Col N="2297" /> Government fail.  They may be capable enough of producing certain policies but they are absolutely incapable, because of the nature of Coalitions, of following their decisions through and seeing them brought to fruition.</P>
    <P>I notice in the statement of the Taoiseach with regard to the building and construction industry that he now, at this very late stage, accepts what we have been saying for the last two years. We have been pointing to the fact that the building and construction industry is facing a critical situation.  We pointed out that unless the Government took measures to ensure that this critical situation was resolved, the industry would deteriorate.  We can now see very clearly that the industry is indeed in a very serious situation.  There are at present 25,000 building industry workers unemployed.  That figure is approximately half the number of those normally employed in the building industry.  That is a shocking situation. It is shocking because, as I have said on many occasions, this is the one industry capable of providing more employment at a time of high unemployment and capable of creating jobs which will not affect our balance of payments because most of the materials used are home produced.  On the many occasions on which I raised this matter here the only answer of the Minister for Local Government was that we were, on the one hand, asking for more money to be spent on public projects and, on the other hand, asking that the total amount for capital development and other purposes be reduced.</P>
    <P>I want to make my position in relation to this matter as clear as possible. We are in a time of very high unemployment, a peak unemployment situation in this month of July.  All the policies of the Government should be directed towards providing employment, and the only way in which we can ensure that jobs are made available is by providing more money for the Department of Local Government. I have had experience as a member of a Government and I maintain that it is the duty of the Taoiseach to have every member of his Cabinet examine once again the various Estimates in an effort to see where Estimates can be <Col N="2298" /> pruned.  I know the difficulty of prevailing on Ministers to do this.  The money for projects which may be desirable but are not absolutely essential should be transferred to the Department of Local Government to enable that Department to provide the extra money necessary to create jobs in the building and construction industry.</P>
    <P>Before continuing on this matter, Deputy Halligan's entrance has reminded me of something to which I must refer.  It is a circular issued by the Department of Local Government, H 15/76, of 23rd June, 1976.  It instructs local authorities to increase rents.  Last night the Minister for Local Government attempted to argue his way out of the situation in which he now finds himself in relation to the rent increases.  He admitted, however, 48,000 people would now have their rents increased.  During the Dublin by-election Fianna Fáil published a document stating that Corporation rents were being increased this month.  They asked: &ldquo;Do you know your Corporation rent is being put up this month?  Ask your Labour and Fine Gael candidates for details&rdquo;.  Almost immediately the Labour Party issued a document published by Deputy Doctor John O'Connell asking the people to vote for Brendan Halligan and that document is headed: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil claim that your Corporation rent is being put up this month. This is a lie&rdquo;.  On the day of the election, 10th June, the <i>Irish Independent</i> published an article headed: &ldquo;Tully nails Fianna Fáil rents `lie'.&rdquo; The <i>Independent</i> went on: &ldquo;Last night the Minister for Local Government denounced as `a downright lie' a Fianna Fáil statement that the Corporation rent is being put up this month&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>After all this, on 23rd June a circular was issued from the Department of Local Government directing local authorities to increase their rents. In a report in the <i>Evening Herald</i> on 30th June we were informed that &ldquo;Deputy Dr. John O'Connell, who was accused in the Dáil the night before of distorting facts by denying during the recent by-election that local <Col N="2299" /> authority rents were rising, said today he was surprised to hear the increases were now going through&rdquo;.  Deputy Dr. John O'Connell was responsible for issuing the &ldquo;This is a lie&rdquo; pamphlet and I must assume that, before he did so, he approached the Minister for Local Government to find out if, in fact, the rents were going to be increased and I would like to know what answer he got.  On the other hand, suppose we take it that he did not approach the Minister, surely it was most irresponsible of him to issue a pamphlet stating that rents would not be increased if he did not know whether they would be increased or not.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts of the case.  We have had too many cases where outside influences are anxious to throw doubt on the integrity of politicians.  We should remember that when circumstances like this arise they do not redound to the credit of politicians generally.  I would have preferred to have raised this matter yesterday on the Estimate for Local Government when the Minister was present but unfortunately we did not reach the Estimate. I was beginning to speak on the matter on the discussion on the Estimate when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle told me that the time for discussion had expired.</P>
    <P>I should like to give one example of the way rents will be increased.  In respect of an unemployed man maintaining a wife and four children whose gross basic incomes is £29.40 unemployment benefit, up to today his rent was 67p per week.  It will now be £3.48 per week, an increase of £2.81.  This was done by the party who pat themselves on the back as the party of social reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of speaking on this Adjournment debate which is taking place at a time of fairly difficult circumstances for the country.  In his speech yesterday the Taoiseach referred to those difficulties.  I wish to make a few remarks about some of the criticisms that have been expressed about the last budget and the attitude adopted <Col N="2300" /> by the Minister for Finance in that budget, especially in the light of the budget later produced by the British Government.</P>
      <P>It has been fashionable in some circles to suggest that our Government should have adopted a different strategy, that they should have attempted to go the way Mr. Healey went in Britain.  There has been the impression that if this had happened there might be an attitude of wage restraint in this country.  This fashionable thought is flying in the face of certain realities that need to be spelled out.</P>
      <P>In his budget strategy the Minister for Finance had to have regard to the financial position as it related to this country and there were certain factors that had to be considered.  We are aware of the economic background of this and other countries since the shattering effects of the oil crisis and the world recession.  We are aware of the substantial volume of foreign borrowing by our Government since then to keep the country afloat.  We should be aware that prior to the budget last January this country had borrowed externally to a higher proportion than any other EEC country, and this has been stated by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.  The proportion was getting dangerously near a ceiling level beyond which there would have been resistance in EEC and in international banking circles to further extensions of external borrowing by Ireland.  Apart from the question of whether the money was available, there was also the undesirability of extending that borrowing unduly for obvious reasons.  Foreign borrowing is extremely expensive, especially in this era of devaluation.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Finance were to attempt the same type of action as was applied by Mr. Healey in Britain, there were two options open to him.  He would have to arrange that more substantial foreign borrowing was done by this country in order to contain the price of beer, petrol and the other commodities that were affected by the budget or, alternatively, he would have to arrange for increased taxation in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2301" /> The attitude of Fianna Fáil and of some sections of the public are somewhat unrealistic in this area.  In one breath there are sweeping criticisms of Irish budget strategy, of the policy of the Minister for Finance and of the National Coalition Government.  The question is asked why did the Minister not do what was done in Britain?  Why was the price of beer and petrol not contained in order to give the workers a greater incentive?  On the other hand, there are Opposition spokesmen berating the Government for the present extent of foreign borrowing.  There are very many criticisms expressed about taxation.</P>
    <P>The taxation strategy of the Government in the budget was the correct one in difficult circumstances.  Items that were hit were not the necessities of life.  Recently the Opposition put down a motion on tourism and there was some criticism of the increase in petrol prices because of its effect on the tourist industry.  This is a little ludicrous when one works it out.  For instance, if a family of four come to Dublin, drive down to the west, travel in that area and return to Dublin&mdash; perhaps with a total mileage of 600 miles&mdash;in a car giving 30 miles per gallon the additional increase of 10p per gallon works out at about approximately £2.50 per person.  We should be a little more realistic when we are discussing the economy and the supposedly shattering effects of some of the measures adopted by the Government. In a world context, where airlines impose substantial surcharges on people going abroad, it puts the matter into perspective and it shows the lack of logic and sincerity in much of the criticisms.</P>
    <P>We should also mention the cost of living and consumer subsidies.  Three weeks before the by-election the Opposition put down a motion on the matter of cost-of-living increases.  They know that the extent to which a Government can control the cost of living is extremely limited.  It is fashionable to speak about internal inflation as opposed to external factors that influence the cost of living.  One of the problems with regard to internal inflation is that agricultural prices are <Col N="2302" /> contained within what is supposed to be an internal inflation factor over which presumably we have control.  Of course, we have not such control. There is a higher proportion of farming people living in this country than in any other EEC country.  For that reason a deal under the CAP under which substantial increases are available in food prices to Irish farmers is obviously good for the country in a broad sense.  Of course it leads to price increases in respect of certain foods. While this is an internal matter, it is due to the benefits the farmers are achieving because of our EEC membership and because of Government policy.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that there has been an increase in the cost of living, the country needs to be reminded that in the budget last year the Government introduced substantial subsidies on essential foodstuffs.  There was a subsidy on bread to the tune of 5½ per loaf and there were subsidies on flour, butter and milk.  The cost was approximately £40 million to the Exchequer. In a sense this is related to the additional taxation imposed in the budget in the indirect area, which tends to balance that.</P>
    <P>Let us deal with the issue of wealth concerning capital taxation.  The issue of capital taxation is the one about which there is the highest level of misunderstanding and possibly the greatest amount of propaganda since the Government came into office.  Presumably, the purpose of capital taxation is to assess tax on capital in some shape or form.  The reality is sometimes forgotten.  Many people who write about capital taxation tend to talk about capital gains taxation and wealth tax and they tend to forget that estate duty taxation is fundamentally capital taxation.  In so far as yields of capital taxation and the Government are concerned there is less revenue accruing from the newly introduced capital taxation measures in the area of capital gains tax and wealth tax than there was yielding to the State before the abolition of estate duty.</P>
    <P>A great many representations were made to the previous Government as well as this Government about estate <Col N="2303" /> duty tax, which was supposedly penal. There were representations from the farming community, the business community and other elements in the country holding property.  The Government took the view, when in Opposition, that estate duty should be abolished.  They abolished it when they came into office.  There was publicity recently about Westport House, near where I live, and the issue of wealth tax.  The case was over-stated because there was not any decision concerning wealth tax as far as that property was concerned.  There is an interesting side issue in that there is an article in today's <i>Irish Times</i> about that property.  In the course of that article Lord Sligo mentioned that the root of the major problems they had when they decided to open Westport House to the public was that through for successive owners there were four successive piles of estate duty which effectively penalised it completely.</P>
    <P>This is the background where capital taxation is concerned.  It would be better if those commenting on it had some regard to realities.  If the fundamental purpose is the paying of tax then less is accruing at the present time than there was.  The abolition of estate duty has been a very good deed for a certain sector in the community who should realise it and should cease to criticise the Government for the wrong reasons.  Let us have criticism of the Minister for Finance, if it is valid, on specific points, but let us do away with this lack of an objective approach by a section of the community which by their training and disciplines are supposedly trained to use objective criteria in the business world, which they do not tend to use, and in regard to which they have flights of fancy when they tackle political issues in the country.  That cannot be said often enough.</P>
    <P>The wealth tax, about which there has been so much discussion, is relatively mild.  It has a base line of £100,000 in addition to which private houses on land are exempt.  This base line compares, for example, with the base line in a country like Denmark, of £20,000.  There is also within families <Col N="2304" /> provision under which assets can be put on to members of the families so that in a business situation a business complex can be owned by two or three members of the particular family.  This reduces very much liability in so far as it is concerned.  The fundamental assessment of capital taxation is yield, and fewer yields are coming in at the present time, which tends to make a nonsense of much of the criticism of the Opposition and some of the critics of the Government in that particular arena.</P>
    <P>There are external factors in relation to the cost of living.  I mentioned the agricultural factor, but world markets of commodities also have a bearing. From 1972 to 1976 they show staggering increases beyond which the Government do not, obviously, have control. There was an increase in that period in soft woods of 150 per cent, rubber 250 per cent, cotton 150 per cent, wool 175 per cent, zinc 160 per cent, lead 176 per cent, nickel 120 per cent, tin 190 per cent and copper 100 per cent. This Government, in isolation to the rest of the world, and all of the problems created by devaluation, are supposed to waive a magic wand and exert the type of control and influence which no power on earth has.  It is entirely unrealistic to expect them.</P>
    <P>As far as devaluation is concerned it is worth spelling out the reality. There is the terrible picture, in so far as imports into the country are concerned, and the extent to which the £ sterling has devalued against other world currencies.  We are an extension of Britain to an extent in the financial arena in the sterling area and the question of the devaluation of our pound <i>vis-à-vis</i> other countries is a matter which is entirely outside the control of the Government.  Let us spell out some realities of this.  From January, 1973, approximately the time we went into Government, until May, 1976, a threeyear period, the dollar went down from 2.35 to 1.80, a reduction in the value of the Irish pound against the dollar of 23 per cent.  The Canadian dollar showed a reduction in the value of the Irish £ of 25 per cent, the Dutch guilder a reduction in value of the Irish £ of 35 per cent, the Belgian <Col N="2305" /> franc 31 per cent less well off, the Danish kroner 32 per cent, the German mark 38 per cent, the Swiss franc 49 per cent and the French franc 29 per cent during the period we are talking about.</P>
    <P>There are two things which can be said about this which are both good and bad.  In the first instance this has obviously inflated greatly the cost of imported articles into the country and it has increased substantially the imbalance of payments.  The people in the country, independent entirely of the political arena, the Government and the Opposition, have it in their hands to do something about the question of imports.  The traders in the country also have it within their capacity to do something as well.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am unduly patriotic.  I hope I am not wearing my patriotism on my sleeve.  If we buy more goods produced in the country as a people we can effectively reduce this imbalance and get on the right side of the devaluation factor.  I am appalled at times to see the lack of opportunity there is in many stores for Irish people to even buy Irish goods.  There are certain sectors in the Irish trading community who sell, practically exclusively, goods manufactured outside the country.</P>
    <P>Obviously, in a free market one should have a choice.  We have a choice.  We have a reasonable liberal free trade arrangement with Britain and with the European Economic Community so obviously we want the choice.  I am not suggesting that those stores should not import the more fashionable garments, travel goods and luxury goods from France, Switzerland or Germany.  I am at least suggesting that a minor element of patriotism might be an arrangement under which the Irish buying public have the opportunity to buy Irish goods if they choose to do so.</P>
    <P>There is a need for this in this time of difficulty.  We have spoken about what patriotism consisted of in the past. We have spoken of patriotism in the 1920 period, the fifties and sixties, when there seemed a consensus that patriotism was the creation of jobs and the creation of wealth in the country, with which I agree.  Patriotism at this <Col N="2306" /> time is this factor as well, the insistence by the Irish public, if it is possible to get a comparable article, to buy Irish.</P>
    <P>The other point which should be made against the background of gloom is the light there appears to be at the end of the tunnel because this devaluation factor can work very well to the advantage of the country.  We are a trading nation.  We will rise or fall on the extent to which we export specially manufactured goods from the country.  The agricultural position is satisfactory and has reached a higher level of development in the sense that there is not the scope for further expansion that there is, for example, in the industrial arena.  While devaluation provides all the difficulties in the importation of articles, commodities or raw materials into the country it can work very well to our advantage in trading outside the country.  Devaluation would work terrifically to our advantage in trading outside this country and it makes for greater opportunities here.</P>
    <P>In regard to inflation, whilst it is and has been running at a higher level than in some other countries, it is fair to point out and put into perspective that costs have also been rising in other countries of Western Europe. There tends to be too much emphasis on the rising cost here and suggestions that it is not happening elsewhere.  Of course it is happening, and these who travel to the European Continent, North America and Japan can tell horrific stories about the cost of living in the cities and towns of these other countries.  But it has put Ireland into an extremely competitive position on world markets and we can benefit greatly.  The main reason we have not benefited as much as we might have done has been that, due to world recession, there has not been the uptake in world markets that there might have been.</P>
    <P>However, the conditions here are satisfactory at present for this type of expansion which unquestionably can take place.  If there has been devaluation of the £ against European and North American currency and the yen to an average extent of 35 to 40 per cent, it puts the Irish export industry <Col N="2307" /> into an extremely competitive position. Rather than talking about gloom at present, we should get the message across to the Irish public that if we can get the restraint which we seek in the wage sector and if we could possibly get a year in which we could opt out of the problems that are traditional to the country in that arena, we could 12 months hence run into a period of great growth in the Irish economy and an era of confidence. In addition to the possibility of exporting from existing factories, the containing of inflation added to the great advantages of the devaluation factor on export markets where this country is concerned, can lead not only to increased exports from existing factories but to increased investments in this country by new industries coming in from outside.</P>
    <P>In that regard, against all of the gloom which Fianna Fáil are portraying about the weaknesses in the Irish economy, it should be recognised there is still a very healthy interest in investment in manufacturing industries in this country from industries from outside this country.  The Taoiseach was in America recently and he came back with very good news.  There is a lot of buoyancy within the IDA.  They have 22 people at present working across the North American Continent with considerable success.</P>
    <P>Irish exports in the year up to April of this year increased from a figure of £1,200 million to £1,500 million, an increase of £300 million which was in excess of the rate of inflation.  Despite what is being said by elements of the business community in this country and by the Opposition, there is a range of incentives available from Government which has no parallel in Europe in the form of grants, loans, tax concession and complete relief of taxes on export sales.  There is also the range of incentives from the CTT, IIRS, and the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to put certain things into perspective.  There has been great criticism of the policy of the Government in the industrial textile and footwear sector.  Two things are happening which should be remembered.  We entered an era of free trade a few years <Col N="2308" /> ago, negotiated by the previous Government but with which we agreed.  It is inevitable that even in periods of boom certain traditional Irish industries, due to an inherent inefficiency, are going to the wall.</P>
    <P>The second position makes things very difficult for the Government, and this should be explained as well.  There are suggestions that in textiles imports coming in under the counter through Britain from Pakistan should be stopped, that we should do what the Germans and the French do and act unilaterally and to hell with the EEC if they do not allow us to do it.  We should put down the curtain and say we are not letting them in.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the Irish Government requested the EEC to allow them to act in this manner.  The request was not acceded to.  The option the Irish Government has in acting bilaterally is extremely limited because we are a creditor nation within the EEC. Additionally we were fortunate, on entering into the EEC, in negotiating in the industrial sector the retention of the ability and capacity of Government to offer grants to industry and to offer incentives in the form of complete relief from taxation on export sales.  We are the only country in the EEC having these incentives.  There has been pressure from the Commissioner in Industry to get rid of these incentives within the Irish economy for obvious reasons.  The danger is that if we worked unilaterally in the footwear or textiles area we run the risk of losing very much more in circumstances like that.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the question of oil exploration as regards the exploration licences issued by the Government, through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to interested parties in October of last year on what seems to have been a remarkably good deal, having regard to the necessity to encourage private enterprise and to maintain within that the protection of the rights of the Irish people.  We have a criticism from Fianna Fáil about the Government policy in the oil exploration sector.  Some things should be said about that policy and the <Col N="2309" /> policy prior to when we went into Government.</P>
    <P>At present there are two countries in Europe which have an oil resource, Britain and Norway.  Oil is coming ashore to Britain and to Norway.  Oil coming ashore in Norway has made that country singly the wealthiest country in Europe, including West Germany.  It is bringing to the benefit of the Norwegian economy between 20 and 25 per cent of GNP.  Oil is flowing in Norway because of a decision taken by the Norwegian and British Governments ten years ago. This is significant.  From the time of the announcement of Government policies in an area such as this to the time that is necessary for the commercial interests to consider whether or not to take up the options, leading to the time of the necessary exploration, financing arrangements, the laying of pipelines and coming ashore, takes a number of years.</P>
    <P>It seems that the Opposition have a brass neck to start berating the Government in so far as an oil exploration policy exists, because it simply had not existed before we went into Government. The prior Government, apart from the single stake farmed out in Cork for a pittance some time ago, had taken no initiative.  There had been no policy statements, there had been introductions of no policies, their were no incentives offered to private companies, there was no attempt to set up a State company or to get the blend of private and public sectors which this Government has achieved. If we are looking to the future, apart from the basic agricultural and industrial economy, this oil sector, if we find the oil to the extent to which we think it is possible, can benefit this country greatly.  It seems the Opposition are on a very weak wicket in attempting to criticise the policy of the Government in that sector.</P>
    <P>It is equally appropriate to refer to the question of mining legislation.  The Government took action in regard to what they thought was an anomaly and a bad deal.  The basic reason the Government took action in the mining area was that mining was not like <Col N="2310" /> manufacturing industry and the tax incentives which we give to industry. Mining is a wasting resource which has a fairly short-term life.  Even in the Canadian mining magazine, prior to the present Government's action there had been comment from time to time wondering why any Irish Government was offering these types of incentives which seem so completely generous to the mining industry. Therefore the Government acted and brought in amending legislation of which I believe it was proved that within this country there were suggestions that the Government was then going to yield to the industrial sector and that the whole question of competence was at stake in the tax incentives in industry, which of course it was not because it was an entirely different sector.</P>
    <P>While in Canada about a month ago I met some Canadian people working in Government there concerning this kind of issue and I was told that in Canada, with their own people in the mining industry, while they are looking for concessions from their own Government, the country they cite as being the country in the world to which they are going to go if they cannot get a good deal in their own country is this country.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the attitude of the Opposition on the question of policies.  Deputy Faulkner referred to the supposed policies of Fianna Fáil. If this question of the creation of jobs is of importance to the country, and there is a consensus that it is singularly important, it might be no harm to take a look at the policy of Fianna Fáil in this respect in the industrial sector.  The Fianna Fáil spokesman on Industry and Commerce suggested to the House twice in the course of 12 months that the Government should impose on the IDA a situation in which they would insist that Irish companies get at least 50 per cent of the grants paid to manufacturing industry for development.  Obviously we are all keen that the Irish industrial sector should participate as much as possible, but there is a limit to the degree of development due to lack of technological experience and other things.  The result of the Fianna Fáil proposal being <Col N="2311" /> adopted by the Government would be a cutting back to an enormous degree in the level of employment and a cutting back terrifically on foreign investment here, with a massive reduction in the number of jobs that could be created.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I agree with the remarks of the Taoiseach that nobody in the world owes us a living.  One of the sad facts of life, particularly in the west, is that living standards have been reduced and there are many sectors of the public who are not prepared to accept this restraint.  I saw in the newspapers this morning a picture of a little girl carrying a placard reading &ldquo;Save my daddy's job&rdquo;.  Another relevant slogan might be &ldquo;Save my son's job&rdquo; because while there is an existing labour force there are problems in relation to the question of providing jobs for future generations.  These are very dependent on the restraint spelled out by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach.  For these reasons it is vital that we should get this type of restraint in the coming months.</P>
    <P>I should like finally to refer to the Irish social policy, and I would mention the criticism there has been by the Opposition of our policy in this respect.  Deputy de Valera on the Labour Estimate about three weeks ago referred to this at some length and there were inferences that the Government were down on welfare and that they were against development.  There were suggestions that our social policy is somewhat in isolation, that there is something of a left-wing ultra socialist phenomenon here.  I shall read from a recent article in the <i>OECD Observer</i>, relating to unemployment benefits in seven major countries, No. 76 for July and August, 1975:</P>
    <P>Faced with the prospect of sharp rises in unemployment to levels unprecedented since the Great Depression, some countries began taking action, in late 1974 and early 1975, to improve income maintenance. This was primarily achieved by increasing coverage, by easing eligibility provisions, by extending benefits beyond normal benefit periods, by raising benefit rates, <Col N="2312" /> with increased payments for training and job creation programmes in some instances.  Action has also been taken in some countries to raise contributions to unemployment insurance schemes. Given the likelihood of continuing high levels of unemployment, further changes in unemployment transfer schemes in the course of 1975 cannot be ruled out.</P>
    <P>I read this merely to attempt to put the Irish situation into perspective, because from listening to the public debate we have been having one would imagine we had an extreme left-wing socialist Government introducing a welter of measures which are repugnant to the people and completely isolated and unrelated to those other countries&mdash;countries such as Canada, the US, the West German Republic, Italy.  There is a sense of unreality about these criticisms when we have regard to some of the criticism we get from certain aspects of the Irish public on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate affords the House an opportunity to assess the performance of the Government at a very suitable juncture, because they can at this point be fairly judged on their merits.  They have been long enough in office to have had an opportunity of putting their policies into effect, of implementing their own ideas for the different social, economic and political areas.  It is no longer possible for either the Government or their apologists to claim that any particular failing is a result of the situation they inherited or the outcome of policies for which they are not responsible. They have had ample time to manage our affairs as they saw fit and to implement their own strategies.</P>
      <P>A three-year span is long enough to enable any Government to show their mettle, to deliver the goods or to lay the groundwork for future delivery.  The state of this nation today is this Government's responsibility, the result of their stewardship. Let there be no excuses or special pleadings on that issue.  Let the Government be judged on the situation as it is because it is of their making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2313" /> I should like to set out as objectively as possible how we view the present state of affairs and then to let the people judge whether this Government have done well or badly, whether they merit confidence at this stage of their term of office, whether they are justified in closing down for a long summer recess on the basis that all is well.  That all is not well is abundantly clear.</P>
    <P>The Government are immediately and directly responsible for the present state of our affairs.  That is equally clear.  That they are utterly incapable of rescuing the country must now be made clear to the whole nation in this debate.  To safeguard the economic welfare of the people is one of the primary duties of a Government in a modern democratic State&mdash;to provide secure well-paid employment for all those able to work.  Not to meet that basic requirement, not to pass that elementary test, is the great central failure of this Government.</P>
    <P>The economic and financial structures of the country have been devastated and there is no need for anyone on those benches to outline the enormous damage that has been done.  The review of the Irish economy published today puts this beyond controversy.  It is the most comprehensive and damning indictment of the performance of any Government I have come across in modern times.  It sweeps the Taoiseach's pathetic attempts of yesterday to generate a false optimism into the wastepaper basket.  Apart from its devastating analysis of our economic failure and its pesimistic predictions for the future, the publication of this review must surely raise the deepest doubts about the way in which our economic affairs are being assessed and dealt with at the highest level and about the manner in which economic policy is being decided by the Government and their agencies.</P>
    <P>How could the Taoiseach come before this national parliament in a vital adjournment debate and give a reasonably optimistic picture of <Col N="2314" /> our prospects, when the most prestigious economic research institute in the country had already formulated a diametrically opposite conclusion about the state of affairs in our economy?  I suggest that this must surely give rise to serious and farreaching concern among those who care about our country, about its management and in particular about the good faith and credibility of its Government.</P>
    <P>I want to ask if the Government accept now the view of the Economic and Social Research Institute.  Before I came into the Dáil this morning I was asking myself a very specific question&mdash;I wrote it in the notes I was preparing for my speech.  I wanted to ask if we can expect that this review of our economic situation by the ESRI will be met by another hysterical outburst from the Minister for Finance.  I also wanted to ask&mdash;I also made a note of this&mdash;if this prestigious national institution would be attacked by the Minister for Finance as he is wont to attack any individual who does not see eye to eye with him.  I no longer need to ask that question.  True to form, this erratic, unpredictable Minister for Finance has seen fit to come here this morning and attack the ESRI, to accuse them of a wrong analysis and to question their good faith as an institution.</P>
    <P>How can anybody have any faith, belief or reassurance in the way in which our economic affairs are being managed when we have that sort of situation?  I do not think anybody here has doubted the conclusions of the ESRI before, or questioned their <i>bona fides</i>.  They have no axe to grind.  The ESRI is an impartial objective institution.  Even the most outrageous Coalition propagandist would not attempt to accuse them of being in any way amenable to suggestions from Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>They have spelled out their analysis of our economic situation clearly and without equivocation. That analysis and those predictions are at complete variance with what the Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance have been saying over the <Col N="2315" /> last month or so.  I want to make it absolutely clear that I believe the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance gave a certain twist to their economic predictions because the by-elections.</P>
    <P>It is significant that with the advent of the by-elections the world economy, on which so much depends, began to take an upturn and that even in this country the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance could see visible signs of improvement.  I suggest that that was totally unrealistic and misleading.  There were no such signs.  It was simply false propaganda put out by the Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance and other Coalition speakers in an attempt to influence the outcome of the by-elections.  I would like somebody to disprove that contention, if they can.  Following up that line the Taoiseach, because he could not jettison it too quickly after the by-elections without loss of face, in a speech here yesterday gave it as his view that there were distinct encouraging signs emerging in our economy.  One commentator used the phrase &ldquo;Mr. Cosgrave's optimistic assessment of the economic prospects.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  What is the real analysis as disclosed by this impartial objective national body? At this stage, we have only newspaper reports of what the review contains, but I do not think any of us have any doubts as to the accuracy of the reports, because they are consistent in all the newspapers.</P>
    <P>The institute suggests that the rate of inflation this year will exceed 18 per cent.  That surely is a prediction which must cause the deepest and gravest anxiety to the Government and to our economic planners.  All the available evidence points to the facts that throughout Europe rates of inflation are being brought down, and it is almost certain for this year that in most European countries, including Great Britain, the rate of inflation will be brought down to single figures.</P>
    <P>Here we have an authoritative <Col N="2316" /> prediction that our rate of inflation this year will be 18 per cent.  The institute also have indicated their belief that we are not going to achieve a growth rate of 2 per cent, as optimistically predicted by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech, but that the actual rate of growth this year will be a mere ½ per cent.  That, of course, is in complete contradiction to the picture the Taoiseach endeavoured to paint here yesterday.  The institute do not accept any Government suggestions that some inroads will be made in the level of unemployment this year. They are quite specific in suggesting that 135,000 unemployed is a very distinct possibility.</P>
    <P>As I said in relation to the review which the institute has given, its implications are serious enough but what is really frightening is to contemplate a situation in which the Taoiseach speaking authoritatively on behalf of the Government in an important debate can give one picture to our economy and its likely course of development during 1976 when this body gives a completely different picture.  How can anybody have any faith in the manner in which our economic forces are being managed? Does not the illustration in that review prove beyond any shadow of doubt our contention that our economic difficulties do not spring from any international circumstances but rather from our own mismanagement? Does this not also prove that there is no reality in the manner in which our economic prospects are being assessed by the Government and that there is no validity in the policies which they are purporting to put forward to solve our economic problems?  I suggest that that underlying reality is far more serious, far more worrying and far more depressing than the actual picture of economic depression which the institute has painted for us in this review.</P>
    <P>I suggest that one of the central areas in this debate should be the position in regard to the bringing forward by the Government of a national economic plan.  The burning <Col N="2317" /> question at this moment for all those who are interested in our economic future and welfare is whether the Government are, in fact, engaged in the preparation of a plan at all.  There is no evidence that they are.  There are no veiled references in ministerial speeches to indicate what the issues are.  There are no significant hints from wellinformed sources.  Even those political commentators whose job for the last few years seems to have been to reflect as accurately as possibly the views and the wishes of the Government on these matters seem to have been kept completely in the dark on this.  Is it the truth that there is no economic plan?</P>
    <P>Are the Government diametrically divided on the basic principles from which such a plan might be derived, divided to the extent that no such plan is possible?  I believe that is the position and I am reinforced in my belief by this review of the Economic and Social Research Institute.  If the Government were engaged in the preparation of a plan, surely the one body to which the Government and their advisers and planners would be having constant access would be the Economic and Social Research Institute for information and statistics.  If they were in touch with the institute, they must have known the thinking, the views and opinions of the institute as disclosed in this review.  All the evidence points to the fact that there is no economic plan on the stocks at this time.  I believe this is so and I suggest that it is a matter which has the gravest implications for our future as an independent nation.</P>
    <P>If this Government cannot even at this very late stage get to grips with the economic situation and bring forward an economic plan behind which the whole country could rally, then I believe it should resign.  I believe that is their paramount, overriding duty and obligation at the moment.  I have for a considerable time being advocating the adoption of such a national economic development plan and I have stated on several occasions that I believe the process whereby such a plan would be produced would be more important <Col N="2318" /> than the plan itself because I would insist that the wage bargaining process must be built into all our economic planning in future.  Everything that happened and is happening today confirms me in that view.  It is absurd to expect trade unions and workers to accept the disciplines of an economic plan in the preparation of which they have not been completely involved.</P>
    <P>Next Saturday we are facing the outcome of the conference on the national wage agreement.  We have leaders of the trade union movement and the workers themselves being asked in that context to come to certain decisions. Everybody hopes that they will make the right decision.  They are being exhorted from every side to take the right decision but is it reasonable or fair to expect the trade union movement and workers to take a decision on a national pay agreement in total isolation?  Would it not make much more sense if the Government and all those who now want to preach to the workers could say to them: &ldquo;Accept this national wage agreement because your acceptance of it is vital to the success of this economic plan which we are now putting before you&rdquo;?  I would then be reasonably confident of the outcome of any such proposal put to the trade union movement.  This is not the situation.  At this late stage there still is no economic overall context into which this national wage agreement will fit. There are no results which can be demonstrated to the trade union movement as likely to emerge from their acceptance of the national wage agreement and deriving from a national economic plan.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be axiomatic that a national economic plan, based on the realities of our situation, presenting some attainable targets is a <i>sine qua non</i> of our situation. If we are to get on top of our economic difficulties it can only be done in this way.  It is no longer sufficient to exhort workers and the trade union movement to be restrained and to accept pay pauses when they cannot see what the outcome of that restraint will be.  I believe that any Government&mdash;and this Parliament&mdash;could talk very <Col N="2319" /> realistically to the workers and the trade union movement if we were asking them to accept any form of national wage agreement as an element in a national economic development plan.  I hope sooner or later the simple truth of this proposition will permeate and infiltrate the minds of the Government, and if there is any conflict inside the Government on this issue, let the Taoiseach resolve it.</P>
    <P>I do not know if he has a Cabinet reshuffle in mind.  It is a bit thin to expect us to believe that this long summer recess is to enable somebody to paint the ceiling of the Seanad chamber.  I do not consider that an acceptable proposition; perhaps it is.  If the Taoiseach wants to have the Dáil in recess, get away from the hurley-burley of Dáil business in order to have a look at his Government and identify those total failures in that Government, the men who have failed to measure up to the responsibilities he has placed on them and if he has such a reshuffle in mind before he comes back in October, such reshuffle should be very closely related to resolving any difficulties that may exist in the production of a national development plan.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government will not be taken seriously, its statements, exhortations and speeches will not be listened to, unless they can all be linked to that central, driving, dynamic of economic planning.</P>
    <P>I have advocated for a long time now the preparation and inauguration of such a plan and I have also said that pending its inauguration and implementation the Government should, as an immediate step, redirect a considerable amount of its public capital programme moneys from long-term developments into an instant immediate job-creation programme. I would award that top priority.  There is a public capital programme of over £600 million. It would not require any great expertise to divert £100 million of that programme from long-term investment programmes into an <Col N="2320" /> immediate job-creation programme. I have advocated that since last September or October, and I am very interested and encouraged to see that precisely that proposition of mine has been endorsed by the Economic and Social Research Institute.  In one of the daily newspapers the final sentence in their exposition of the ESRI review is as follows:</P>
    <P>Since there is little scope for an increase in Government spending the ESRI suggest that the Government's capital expenditure should be redirected away from long-term development projects and towards immediate employmentgenerating projects such as a public works programme.</P>
    <P>That is precisely what I have been advocating for well over six months.  I cannot understand why the Government will not do it.  Is there some paralysis induced by the economic crisis?  Is there reluctance to take any action in the economic field because the Government have been proved so wrong so often in the past?  Whatever the situation is in that regard, we now have this national economic institution, the best economic advice available to us, recommending this proposal, and I urge the Government to adopt it now without any further delay.</P>
    <P>It is important that we identify for exactly what it is the latest theme of the Coalition propaganda machine.  As they can no longer rely on even their most devoted adherents in the media to refrain from outright condemnation of their obvious failure to manage our affairs with any reasonable level of confidence, this Government propaganda machine concentrates on attacking the Opposition.  It can no longer boast of the achievements, abilities and qualities of the Government, and so the refrain, repeated over and over again, is that even if the Government are making an unholy mess of things Fianna Fáil could not do anything better.  That message is apparently to be repeated until it gains general acceptance.  My personal view is that it has already gained some acceptance. Apart from its irrelevance&mdash;because it is not the performance of the Opposition <Col N="2321" /> that matters to our economy&mdash; apart from its basic fallacy, I would like to know on what is that contention by the Government based?</P>

      <P>It is surely relevant to ask those who now preach that destructive gospel&mdash;because it is destructive&mdash;if 1973, the last year which was a reflection of Fianna Fáil economic policies in action, was not, in terms of economic performance, one of the best years since the war.  Look at the statistics: I ask those who put forward this message: have not Fianna Fáil a sound track record of good Government?  Were there not plenty of jobs, steady economic progress?  Were the Government not able to pay their way when Fianna Fáil were last in office?  The simple answer to this latest propaganda device of a bankrupt Government is to ask them to compare like with like, to compare Fianna Fáil in Government with the Coalition in Government, not the Coalition in Government with Fianna Fáil in Opposition, to compare 1973 with 1975.</P>
      <P>In 1973 our unemployment figures were at the lowest ever and there was no emigration.  There was economic growth; our inflation was at a reasonable level.  There was a reasonable level of taxation and, above everything else, Government finances were in order and under control.  By contrast in 1975, as some spokesman for the European Commission put it, 1975 was the year we broke all the wrong records&mdash;raging inflation, massive unemployment, intolerable levels of taxation, financial chaos and a Government quite incapable of paying its way without recourse to massive, terrifying measures of borrowing.</P>

      <P>There are two amendments, the first in the name of the Minister and an alternative amendment in the names of Deputy Barrett and Deputy O'Malley. The amendments may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2323" /> In page 24, to substitute &ldquo;the Arbitration Act, 1954, and in determining such a dispute exploration expenses other than the geological, geophysical, drilling or other exploration expenses which may properly be attributed to the discovery, delineation or development of the deposit from which the relevant natural gas is to be got shall not be taken into account by the Arbitrator&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Arbitration Act, 1954&rdquo; in line 17.</P>
    <P>This amendment arises from subsection (3) of section 37.  On the Committee Stage Deputy Barrett and Deputy O'Malley sought to ensure that the price negotiated by Bord Gáis Éireann for any finds of gas should relate only to the expenses incurred by the developing company in actually exploiting the particular find.  They put in an amendment to add after the last line &ldquo;of the Arbitration Act, 1976&rdquo;, &ldquo;only expenses incurred in the block in question&rdquo;.  I said at the time that I was sympathetic to their thinking but the use of the word &ldquo;block&rdquo; could be over-restrictive in a find of gas.  Because of the geological structure the investigation of the find could run beyond the block and I promised I would look at it before the Report Stage.  I have consulted with the Department of Industry and Commerce and I have also discussed my amendment with the Attorney General to ensure that it was something that could be legally enforced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett and Deputy O'Malley have also put in an amendment which reads:</P>
    <P>In page 24, line 17, after &ldquo;1954&rdquo; to add &ldquo;The Arbitrator in any such arbitration shall not take into account expenditure on any field other than that in which the natural gas concerned was discovered.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I had this amendment also examined by the Attorney General and by the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department advise me that, besides the actual drilling in the gas field, there could be expenses outside the particular field which could rightly be considered as part of the expenses <Col N="2324" /> incurred in developing the find and they should therefore in fairness be taken into account.  The Attorney General advised me that the term &ldquo;field&rdquo; is legally difficult to define and the form of words used in my amendment would ensure that any expenses rightly incurred could be charged but it prohibits other expenses being charged by the company in arriving at the price to be paid.  I hope the Opposition will accept the amendment. It meets their point of view and it ensures that the arbitrator will take into account only expenses rightly chargeable.  At the same time this ensures that this will not be seen by a licensee as endangering legitimate expenses he may incur or in any way inhibit such licensee from exploring and exploiting the natural gas in our Continental Shelf.  I hope the Opposition will accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has accepted the substance of our amendment. Our purpose was to prevent multi-nationals, or whatever you like to call them, from charging expenses in some place like Nigeria against an oil or gas find off our coast. The Minister's amendment sets out to do this.  The first licences issued by the British did not contain such provision and the British were badly caught out.  The next lot of licences issued by them were corrected.  Would the Minister consider a small deletion?  Would he delete the word &ldquo;exploration&rdquo; and leave it just &ldquo;drilling or other expenses&rdquo;?  This will give greater flexibility to the arbitrator in arriving at a decision with regard to what shall or shall not be allowed.  If the qualification is left in there could still be a danger that one of these companies could charge a large proportion of management or overhead costs against the field and might also accelerate the write-off against equipment and so on.  If the Minister accepts what I suggest there would be no danger of this happening.</P>

      <P>We would like to point out that in opposing the Gas Bill Fianna Fáil were concerned to illustrate in detail, as we did, how since October, 1973, the Government have not recognised the fundamentals of our energy problem.  As a result, they are incapable of devising the means to direct an <Col N="2326" /> energy policy that will permit our economy to adapt itself to the changes that are necessary as a result of the energy crisis.</P>
      <P>For the last three years the blame for the economic mismanagement of the country has been put on the Arab oil producers, on labour costs and on other factors outside our control.  Weekly during the last three years the Government have put the blame on someone but not once have they admitted that their own incompetence was the cause of our problems.  Government expediency, based on the sole criterion of holding on to office, has created more inflation.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage of this Bill the Minister made some observations. He told us that a decision was made by the Government six months after the discovery of the gas find and that meant it was less than 12 months after the Government came to office.  We were told this was the quickest way to get the gas ashore and that it would be in the interests of the economy.  The Minister also informed us that no feasibility study existed with regard to a gas grid. He said that the longer the gas was in the ground the dearer it would get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the time of the oil crisis the price of oil has increased fourfold and this has affected the price of fertilisers and of energy for industrial purposes.  The Minister told us it was essential in the context of our international payments that the ESB should be able to use home-produced raw materials for energy purposes. He gave us his opinion that the cost of a gas grid would range from £10 million to £200 million, depending on which expert was consulted. During the debate he told us he was arranging for studies to be carried out.  He said it would be expensive and difficult and that it would take some time but he agreed that we must take every step to ensure the most beneficial and economic use of any further resources.  Here we have an admission that, without any study being carried out, decisions were made which affect <Col N="2327" /> what the Government say has been one of the major influences in the economic upheaval of the last few years.</P>
    <P>We have been debating a Gas Bill that brings into being a gas board that initially will concern itself with the Kinsale find.  At the end of Committee Stage, after hours of examination, we discovered that the Government decision was made, apparently taken without any reliable assessment, whereby more than 50 per cent of this discovery was being disposed of to the ESB.  The justification was that in the context of our international payments the ESB should be able to use home-produced materials.</P>
    <P>As the utilisation by the ESB involves a massive investment of about £60 million in new generating capacity, we are entitled to ask how the output from this new capacity, producing electricity at ever increasing cost to the consumer, has any benefit with regard to easing inflation or helping our balance of payments?  Is the Minister suggesting that the existing oil-fired generators at Pigeon House and Tarbert will not be used?  The answer is, of course not.  It would not be logical to do that.  Neither is the decision to increase the investment in the ESB.  The ESB report that increased costs arise from reduced consumption. Therefore, we are asking existing ESB consumers to subsidise the present and past investment in generating capacity and we add further reasons for cost increases by encouraging this new investment in Cork of £60 million.</P>
    <P>The greatest detrimental factor in our balance of payments is the effect of inflation on our manufacturers and on their costs.  In the last three years increasing fuel costs have influenced rises in all manufacturing costs.  First, there are increased processing costs; secondly, there are increased delivery and distribution costs; thirdly, increasing wage rises have brought about increases in the cost of living of which lighting, heating and power are very significant influences.</P>
    <P>It follows therefore that when the Minister for Transport and Power <Col N="2328" /> spells out Government energy policy as being directed towards pushing up the cost of all energy supplies to the level of electricity no one can expect the Government to be capable of dealing with our inflationary problem. This has been stated in this House.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will use the first prudent gas find to reduce the cost to the consumer and they will expand the utilisation of low cost energy so that the cost of living can be reduced.  Furthermore, we will use the availability of low cost energy to maximise the creation of downstream conversion of other resources, such as lead and zinc, to provide the necessary job opportunities to absorb our thousands of unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Government policy, on the other hand, wants to make all energy more expensive, whilst it is the concern of the Minister for Transport and Power, who then passes it to the Minister for Finance to further plunder it.  We believe, at the appropriate time, that the electors will support our policies on energy utilisation, as set out in this debate.  We, therefore, give notice that we will not be bound by decisions of the Government which are, as yet, not contracted for, as we learned last week, and which have been opposed, because of their fundamental incorrectness in our judgement.  Having regard to this statement the ESB are on notice from us that any arrangements entered into by them for the supply of natural gas will be reviewed by Fianna Fáil when we re-enter Government.</P>
    <P>We have put forward our reasons, as I have said, for opposing this Gas Bill.  We opposed this right through the debate in the House on the different Stages and we still oppose it.  That is the position of Fianna Fáil and we have not failed to put forward alternative proposals for the utilisation of this gas in order to make it of greater benefit to our economy and to create more employment, which is so badly needed at this time. We have disagreed with the Government proposals and will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister, at this late stage, if it is the intention of the Government to issue a White Paper or a Green Paper on our resources, those we know we have and those we might find as a result of further explorations?  Are the Government trying to effect some international deal with foreign imported oil or gas until we are self-sufficient, which we hope will be some day?  If this is not the case the economy will crash very shortly because of the Government's policy in mishandling our imports and also the fatal decision of the Minister for Finance imposing a tax on imported oils.</P>

      <P>This is all part of the Bill.  We do not believe that the Government are using our resources in the best way possible.  We have a duty to draw the Government's attention to those lapses on their part and also in relation to good planning.  The Minister might try to influence the Government and the Minister for Finance to take the tariff off imported oils which he imposed because otherwise he will drive more people out of employment as those firms cannot carry on.  Perhaps the Government will now spell out what they intend to do with our natural resources, the imported oils, and when they will remove this punitive tax off imported oils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been a useful one not just today, which is very brief, but on the Second Stage and the Committee Stage because a number of matters have clearly come to light as a result of it in relation to the Government's policy on energy in general and on gas in particular.  The most important point, in my view, is the decision of the Government in principle that when gas becomes available in the country it should not be <Col N="2330" /> sold at its economic or true market price but that it should be sold at a price which bears reference to the price of other forms of energy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett dealt with this matter already and I dealt with it at some length the last day.  I can only say once again, at this late stage, to the Minister that I sincerely believe that to be a totally wrong policy.  I believe that if the Government implement that approach to the pricing of gas they will, unfortunately, render far less beneficial to the country the find which we already have off Kinsale Head and the other further finds which, hopefully, we might have in the future.  There is no point in our going to a lot of trouble and expense to bring in a comparatively small amount of gas, equal to 12 per cent of our energy needs, if we are not going to take advantage of it.</P>
      <P>The advantage is that it is coming in and being bought by Marathon at 5p a therm and it apparently will now be used subsequently at some figure or other, which will allow the Minister for Finance, under section 11 of this Bill, to direct the Gas Board to make substantial profits and will enable those profits to be paid into the Exchequer. This is quite at variance with what has happened in Britain.  It is, in fact, what the Coal Board and the Central Electricity Generating Board in Britain have been looking for but which successive Secretaries of State for Energy in Britain have refused to concede.  It has, apparently, been conceded in advance here.  It does not matter so much in relation to the Kinsale Head find because it is committed to two main users.  From what we gather an agreement has been made in principle with them, even though the contracts have not yet been signed.  We also assume that the price has been agreed in principle with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unreal to be expected to debate this Bill, particularly the implications of section 11, without knowing what those prices are.  It was indicated to us by the Minister in the course of the Committee Stage debate that he does not think that one form of energy should be significantly cheaper than <Col N="2331" /> another.  He sought to retreat somewhat from that position later on.  That was my understanding of it and I believe that is the understanding of anyone who read the debate and is the only understanding one could arrive at.  He went on to say that it would be very unfair to let industries in Cork that were using gas have cheaper power than industries somewhere else that did not have gas.  That is quite a foolish argument.  Obviously, everyone cannot have it all at the same time. Some industries are particularly suitable for gas and some are not.</P>
    <P>The one I have spoken about several times, not alone in this Bill, but other Bills and Estimates in the House, is a zinc smelter and/or a lead smelter.  The most crying industrial need we have at the moment is such a smelter.  No arrangements have yet been made.  It should have been a condition of the issue of a mining lease in Navan that those to whom the lease was issued would arrange for the erection of a smelter and that the export of concentrate from that mine would not be allowed except under special permit from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We have here a source of energy which would be ideal and very economic for such a smelter, but it is not being used.</P>
    <P>In fact the Government decision is that 60 per cent of this gas will be used in the most wasteful way in which it can be used.  It is converted into electricity which is already very highly priced in this country.  The wasteful use of gas in this way is not going to do anything to reduce the price.  The amount is not big enough to have any great impact on the ESB's cost structures anyway.  It seems pointless that when we have at the moment a limited quantity of a very valuable source of energy, it should be used in such a wasteful fashion. Gas is not something that simply goes up in the air once a start is made to open a well.  The flow from that well can be regulated and if, as the Minister says, we have not got in the Cork Harbour region at the moment industries <Col N="2332" /> which would take up that gas and use it benefically, that is not to say that we would not have them in two, three or four years' time if we deliberately, as a matter of policy, decide to put them there.  Apart from the fertiliser industry there is a whole variety of petrol-chemical industries which can use natural gas benefically and use it in a way in which the waste of thermal and calorific value is kept to a minimum, unlike electricity which is the very opposite, where thermal loss is huge, amounting to approximately two-thirds the value.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I regret some of the consequences of this Bill.  Already, although the idea of a gas board is one that I and my party support, some of the decisions which have been forced on that board in my view are the wrong ones.  There has been no attempt to take an overall view of the energy needs of this country and of the utilisation of sources of energy that would be to the maximum benefit of the country.  In particular it is very disappointing to find that the usage of this natural gas will give something like only 600 or 700 permanent jobs.  This at a time such as the present is extremely disappointing. The value that could be got from this gas is immensely greater than what will be got.  For these reasons, and also because the gas board are going to be purely a buying and selling operation and have no powers that I can see in this Bill to undertake any kind of exploration themselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>One might as well say that the function of going to the moon can be conferred on the gas board under section 9, because I presume almost anything can be.  As the matter stands it does not seem to envisage that any exploration would <Col N="2333" /> be carried out here by the board.  It is wrong, when we are now in a position to finance exploration of that kind from the profits that will be made by this board, that we still leave it to foreign companies for the most part to do this work and that the Irish interest in these various consortia is very minute, normally not exceeding 5 or 7 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Bill we are now debating is of considerable importance because the board is going to be as important a body in ten or twenty years' time as the ESB is now.  I would like to see such a board get off to a better start with more useful policies than those which it appears to have at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can agree with the last point made by Deputy O'Malley that the Bill we are debating and just concluding concerns a very important body.  I hope he is right that in 20 years' time it will be as important as the ESB.  Of course we do not know that.  This gas board has been set up to deal at the moment with one find of natural gas.  That is all we know about it.  It may be&mdash;I hope I am wrong&mdash;that there will be no others and that we will have no further functions in the future except to deal with this one find of gas.  However, the Bill is designed to allow any further finds to be handled by the gas board, and the policy decisions for any other finds of gas are left open deliberately so that in the future a Minister for Transport and Power can decide how they should be used to the best advantage of the country.</P>
      <P>The reason I resisted on Committee Stage amendments from the Opposition which sought to control at the moment the price at which the gas is being sold is that this would remove that flexibility in approach by any Minister in the future.  I think that is the right way to do it.  It may be there would be two policies in relation to future gas finds from different areas. The acceptance of the attitude or outlook of the Opposition in this regard would have prohibited a Minister or Government in the future from adopting two policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley spoke about feeding gas to industry.  There is a section <Col N="2334" /> in the Bill which allows, outside the gas board at all, gas to be fed directly to an industry in a particular spot at a particular price.  This could not be done if the Opposition had their way. On the Second Stage, the Committee Stage and again today Deputy O'Malley referred to the argument going on in England as to the price at which natural gas should be sold and the resistance to it.  Of course, if the amendment proposed by the Opposition was accepted by me there could be no argument here in the future as to what it would be, and the only reason that argument can go on in England is that, contrary to what Deputy Barrett and Deputy O'Malley know, there is provision in the British Act for the Exchequer to take the money.  Section 16 of the Gas Act, 1972, in England says: &ldquo;If in any financial year of the Corporation there is an excess of revenue of the Corporation over the total sums properly charged by them to revenue account, the Secretary of State may with approval of the Treasury direct the Corporation to pay over to him so much of that excess as appears to him after consultation with the Corporation to be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not have to do it, and the argument can go on as long as they are not compelled either to do it or not to do it, but it is only when one tries to limit that that the argument cannot and does not take place.  If one writes into an Act that the price must be such and such, it can be sold only at whatever the wording of the amendment he had down was.  Then this argument is prevented from going on not just in two years' time or for one future gas find in two or three years, but for all time you prevent any change of policy by a Government, a Minister for Finance or a Minister for Transport and Power in utilisation of gas.  This is not what we want.  We want the freedom to use it and to have every option open to Government in the use of that gas and the prices charged for that gas.  We must not confine in this Bill the price either at a low level or a high level. There must be flexibility in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2335" /> Deputy Barrett said that he gave notice to the ESB that they would not be bound to supply gas or to uphold the contract presently entered into between Bord Gáis Éireann and the ESB. He does not have to give that notice, as I explained.  The gas contract negotiated between the ESB and Bord Gáis Éireann is an interruptable contract. Therefore I can stop supplying gas to the ESB next year if I want to or leave it with them for 20 years as I want to. Again there is that freedom.  We need have no qualms in the unlikely possibility over here that we would be breaking any contract by the Government, because the Minister can interrupt the flow of gas to the ESB and make them use oil or whatever other form of energy&mdash;solar, fusion&mdash;that may be available.</P>

      <P>It seems to have become the occupation of the Opposition to spend most of their time indulging in academic debate as to the best use of gas.  Some of them would have it going to Crosshaven.  They never seem to deal with the realities. We as a Government have to face the realities and make decisions.  We know that by commercial standards this gas find will provide 11 per cent of our needs.  Even if the consumption of gas in Dublin were to be doubled&mdash;even if we told everybody in Dublin that he or she must use twice as much gas and even turn over from electricity to gas&mdash;it would take years to reach that position and the price would be controlled by the rate at which the gas would be taken from the field.  The more gas we can take from the field the cheaper the price will become.  If we take twice the amount at the end of ten years the price will be halved.  Our concern has been to strike the best balance.</P>

The growth rate in the consumption of electricity has been resumed. The ESB would have had to build generating stations anyhow.  The project to build a nuclear station has been shelved and put back.  It is a matter of demand in the country, and if the money were not spent on conversion of natural gas, stations would have to be built anyway.  This is a very important piece of legislation, a first step to provide for the use of a new form of energy in this country. The Bill gives me freedom, as Minister for Transport and Power, and to my successors, to use the gas that comes in, and BGE will do that under the direction of the Minister.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The control of Fishing for Salmon Order, 1974, which governs the issue of salmon net fishing licences provides that the assessment of applications and the allocation of licences are matters for determination by each board of conservators and my Department have no function in the matter.  From inquiry I understand that a licence was issued to the person in question for 1975.  His application for a licence for 1976 was rejected on the ground that he was not qualified.</P>

      <P>I understand the law governing this is the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order which states that, to qualify for a licence, persons should be able to prove in any year that the major proportion of their income derives from salmon fishing.

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that commercial fishermen are concerned about the increase in the number of persons engaging in skin diving; and if he will state the action he proposes to take to prohibit such activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the question refers to the taking of fish by means of skin diving.  Taking or attempting to take shellfish by this method is prohibited under the skindiving for shell fish bye-law No. 533, 1966, made under the Fisheries Acts, and the introduction of further legislation to deal more effectively with this matter is being considered in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware this is becoming rather a serious problem?  Skin diving seems to be fairly well organised at the moment. People go off at weekends in gangs and invade areas where there are lobster and crayfish, and stocks are being seriously damaged as a result of their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is governed by the shell fish bye-law No. 533, 1966, and apparently the main difficulty resides in not being able to detect persons engaged in this kind of activity.  I suppose the solution lies in more close vigilance on the part of the local fishing communities and others interested in the industry, as well as the normal security people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember it well. Would he let me know if his Department have received complaints about excessive taking of shell fish by skin divers in the area stretching from Slyne Head to Innisboffin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is causing the Department some concern.  There is difficulty in proving an offence under the relevant section.  The main vigilance is provided by local gardaí who very much need the co-operation of the local community to prevent such offences occurring.  Before I came in here the Parliamentary Secretary emphasised that this was causing him and the Department concern, and they are keeping the position under very close review indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Where it has been brought to the notice of the Department that skin divers are taking shell fish in the area I mentioned, what action have the Department taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This practice reached the point that there was a Press advertisement on 30th May.  It was a public advertisement and the Fisheries Division sent a copy to the Commissioner of the Garda pointing out this was an offence under the Act.  I give that as an illustration of the Department acting on a central basis.  What is required for full success is full co-operation from the local communities with the local gardaí.  It may be necessary for the Department to review the legislation.  I take the point that Deputy Haughey was involved in drawing up the legislation.  Apparently in practice it has turned out that it is difficult to make this law stick since it calls, as all our law does, for apprehension of the person in the course of the commission of the crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree one line of approach would be to prevent people purchasing illegallytaken lobster?  The regulations provide that a skin diver may take one fish for his own personal use, but in so far as there is any abuse of the regulations, the way to deal with it most satisfactorily would be to make sure that nobody buys these illegallytaken lobsters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister suggest to his colleague that bye-laws might be introduced whereby skin diving would be prohibited during certain periods of the year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a much larger question and, for all I know, may fall outside the ambit of the Fisheries Division.  I think Deputy Haughey's suggestion should be pursued, and I will bring it to the Parliamentary Secretary's attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

That is not within its terms of reference.  The matter of close-downs is one for the <Col N="2345" /> Department of Industry and Commerce and the agencies attached to that Department.</P>

      <P>I do not know the background of State participation in the Fitzwilton Group.  My identification with this matter is based on my meeting with the management after their announcement regarding the close-down of the firm.  The management, in their discussions with me, related their plans of close-down to the state of the international market. I can tell the Deputy that on Friday I will, in company with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, be meeting a deputation from the unions concerned in this matter.</P>

      <P>I have already supplied details of the terms of reference of the monitoring unit in my reply on 4th February to a similar question from the Deputy.  The main functions of the monitoring unit are to gather information and to keep in touch with developments in the area of industrial relations with particular reference to the fixing of pay and other <Col N="2347" /> conditions of employment and negotiation procedures and to provide, in particular, immediate information on the issues involved in major industrial disputes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

The unit does not investigate in that sense.  It keeps in touch with developments and informs me of possible difficulties arising in important sectors of the economy.  I meet the unit weekly, and that is how it operates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements have been made for AnCO and Cert to take into training upwards of 3,200 school leavers in the summer period.  This figure is broken down into the following categories:</P>
      <P>1.  Career training programme&mdash;over 1,500.</P>
      <P>This scheme which will be carried out in facilities provided by the vocational education authorities is aimed exclusively at school leavers.  The period of training will include planned work programmes, introduction to industrial procedures and discipline, training for job seeking etc.</P>
      <P>2. General summer courses in vocational education and regional technical colleges&mdash;500 approximately.</P>
      <P>This programme will cater for about 500 school leavers this year.</P>
      <P>3.  Industrial induction&mdash;120</P>
      <P>Industrial induction type courses are provided for large numbers of young people.  It is planned that around 20 per cent of the intake during the summer months will be school leavers.</P>
      <P>4.  Apprentices&mdash;400/500</P>
      <P>AnCO plans to recruit 400/500 first year off-the-job apprentices in the summer period who will all be school leavers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2352" /> 5. Community Youth Programme.</P>
    <P>AnCO plans to train 700 young persons under its community youth programme in the current year.  The majority of these trainees are school leavers, about 200 of whom will be trained in the summer period.</P>
    <P>6. CERT</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>All of these short term schemes are no substitute at all for the necessity of a general economic recovery, which alone would give sufficient jobs for young people.  Even with a return to growth rates which we had in previous years we would still be left with the very serious problem of school leavers with insufficient jobs because there are more young people looking for jobs now, emigration has virtually ceased, the population is rising, and I would be the very last to claim that any of the measures we have here would be sufficient to meet the overwhelming demand there is on the part of young people for jobs in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that with all the resources available to the Government from the Social Fund and other European funds it has not been used to the best <Col N="2353" /> advantage in order to provide employment for young people?  Would the Minister also accept that Government priorities seem to be entirely wrong in view of the fact that this week the House allocated £5 million to the blookstock industry when it might well be used in looking after jobs for young people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that one can take all kinds of expenditure options but I would not suggest that one should use the money under one heading for another purpose.  The general problem of employment for young people cannot be settled until there is a general upturn in the economy, and any measure devised here will not settle it without that taking place.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy when he says that we have not fully utilised the Social Fund.  We have done extremely well out of the Social Fund, although we have criticised certain inadequacies in it from our point of view, but the very change that permits us to use the Social Fund for the community youth project training programme, was in part, an initiative from the Irish delegations in the European Community.  We and others sought the changes in the regulations in the Social Fund that permit the Social Fund to be used for these projects around the country.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are business people who <Col N="2354" /> would be prepared to take on a young person provided that they got the premium?  I believe a number of young people would be employed if this premium was extended across the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Deputy, but the highest percentages of unemployment are amongst adults.  I do not wish to minimise the hardships being caused to young people who are looking for jobs.  Many of them are put into jobs for which they are unsuitable, and many of them after expensive training programmes are without jobs which they are trained for, but I do not think we can forget in any measures we can devise here those people of a slightly older age group who have been thrown out of jobs when industries have closed down.  These are people that we must also assist and not forget.</P>

      <P>We are all aware of the disastrous results of the Government's economic policies in general, but this question refers specifically to providing summer employment for school leavers, and the Minister seemed to confine his reply to employment opportunities or training courses provided by AnCO.  Are the other Government Departments not taking in the usual complement of students and school pupils this year for summer work which they have done in previous years?  The Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Education in my time always took in a very considerable number of young people for summer employment.  Has that ceased?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware what the other Departments are doing.  The question related to what under my Department we were doing under the various schemes, and here are the actual schemes devised to meet current higher employment amongst the young people.  I do not suggest that the scheme devised here will be adequate to cater for the great numbers of people looking for jobs, but these are the ones I am responsible for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the seriousness of this situation and the <Col N="2355" /> almost universal frustration to which the present situation has given rise, would the Minister inquire from the other Departments if they are taking on these summer complements, and if they are not would the Minister urge them to do so?  There is a great deal of work that comparatively untrained school leavers could undertake during the summer months in these Departments.  Would the Minister urge them to make a special effort to take on some of these people?  Would the Minister give us any information about or is he monitoring the progress of the scheme which is currently in operation in Great Britain to cater for this problem?</P>

Nuair a bhíomar ag déanamh na sochraithe chun an aerstráice a chur síos in Inis Thiar d'iarras ar Ghaeltarra Éireann meastachán a fhail ar an gcostas, Se an meastachán a fuair mé an t-am sin £50,000&mdash;sé an figiúir ceart anois £57,000&mdash;chun aerstráice féir nó bog a chur síos ach go gcosnódh sé an t-am sin £200,000 chun aerstráice crua a chur síos.  Sin £50,000 i gcompáráid le £200,000.  Chomh maith leis sin, rinne mé fiosrú in Albain agus ar an Mórroinn agus táim sásta ón gcomhairle a fuair mé go bhfuil na haerstráicí fearaí sáscúil go leor.</P>

      <P>Íocann mo Roinnse deontais mar chabhair do thréimhseacháin Ghaeilge agus bíonn ábhar léitheoireachta ina bhformhór do dhaoine laistigh agus lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht agus do dhaoine óga.  Ina measc tá&mdash;dhá cheann a fhoilsítear mar nuachtáin, sé sin <i>Inniu</i> agus <i>Amárach</i>, agus&mdash;dhá cheann eile a fhoilsítear go sonrach do dhaoine óga, <i>Tir na nÓg</i> agus <i>An Gael Óg.</i></P>
      <P>Is de réir tuillteanais an cháis, tar éis gach gné den scéal a bhreithniú, a cheadaítear deontas do thréimhseachán agus níl aon scéim ar leith ag mo Roinnse ach amháin an scéim a bhaineann le hirisí áitiúla Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Is i bhfoirm tábla atá an t-eolas i dtaobh na ndeontas agus, le cead an Cheann Comhairle, cuirfear timpeall sa Tuairisc Oifigiúil é.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Colley, has very kindly given me five minutes to conclude my remarks. When the debate was adjourned I was referring to the persistent, intensive propaganda campaign of the Coalition.  I believe that we, in Fianna Fáil, will have a major task in restoring public morale, which has been demoralised through being subjected for over three years now to this cynical propaganda by the Coalition machine.  We shall have to persuade the people that economic situations can be made amenable to political action. We shall have to establish the fact that, while economists can analyse economic problems, they cannot solve them and that something more is needed by way of an economic policy than simply extending pay-related benefits and exhorting workers to selfsacrifice.</P>
      <P>To restore the Irish economy to a reasonable level of economic growth will be a fairly long process but not as long perhaps as some fear.  The important thing is to start working towards the objective.  Once we are on the way, once the machine starts to roll, people will get back their confidence.  I believe the overriding national need at this time is for an Irish Government to demonstrate the political will to conquer the difficulties, to get on top of the situation, to set out a programme of activity designed to achieve that end&mdash;in short, to produce an acceptable, viable, national economic development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one can seriously deny that the fortunes of Ireland today are at their lowest ebb in this century.  In the words of Napper Tandy: &ldquo;She is truly a most distressful country&rdquo;.  Our economy has ground to a halt, our <Col N="2408" /> young people are left without hope, our agriculture and industry have been disrupted, our dreams of unity betrayed.  The Government have failed utterly.  Instead of reform they have given us repression, instead of jobs they have given us dole, instead of decisions they have given us divisive debate, in place of trusted leadership they have given us deception and demagoguery.  Let the Government look honestly and objectively at their record to date and at the state of the nation today.  If they can do that and still claim they are entitled to the confidence of the people and of this House, that they can close down the Dáil now and depart for a long, tranquil holiday, they are capable of self-deception to an extent that amounts, in my view, to a psychiatric condition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The occasion of the adjournment debate can, and indeed, should be availed of to consider the performance of the Government generally.  Of course, any consideration of the performance of the Government automatically focuses attention on the economy because of the disastrous situation in which we find ourselves and the grossly incompetent manner in which the economy has been handled by the Government.  Before coming to that matter there are a few observations I should like to make very briefly on some other aspects of the Government's performance.</P>
      <P>I suppose one should start with the Taoiseach.  What I want to say about the Taoiseach was said earlier today by Deputy Haughey, which is&mdash;it is a serious charge and is fully substantiated&mdash;that the Taoiseach misled the country yesterday in regard to the economic situation of the country.  He did so knowing what the facts were, knowing what would be and was contained in the report of the ESRI, a body whose reports have been frequently quoted with approval by members of the Government.  He did not even attempt to anticipate the situation by trying to disprove the report of the ESRI which, of course, he could not do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an extremely serious position when the Taoiseach sets out to mislead <Col N="2409" /> the people of the country in regard to the economic situation.  It is particularly serious when the economic situation is as disastrous as it is now, when what is required above all is that every man, woman and child should understand how serious the problem is and what has to be done to tackle it.  The Tánaiste, quite apart from his inactivity&mdash;I will not put it any higher than that&mdash;in his Department has distinguished himself by calling on a number of occasions for the production of a plan.  We are still waiting to know on whom he was calling.  As I have said on a previous occasion, some people are beginning to suspect that he was calling on Fianna Fáil because it is quite clear that calling on his colleagues in the Government will mean that his call is falling on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice yesterday tried to tell us that the situation is improving in regard to serious crime when he knows, as indeed does practically everybody else, that in general the situation has greatly disimproved; but in areas like Dublin city the position is becoming critical and armed robberies, muggings and attacks on old people and children are getting out of hand.  I suggest it is no answer for the Minister for Justice to quote comparative figures with cities like Birmingham. Apart from the fact that the figures do not analyse the seriousness of the crimes concerned the comparison must be with the situation in Dublin as it was when the present Minister for Justice took over as Minister. That is the fair comparision.  The fact that the Minister, having told us in the House a month ago that he did not intend to increase recruitment to the Garda until he got a management consultant's report and was vague as to when that would come to hand and then announced that he was increasing recruitment by 500 per cent is itself indicative of the fact that, if he does not know what the position is, some of his colleagues do and persuaded or compelled him to make this announcement.</P>
    <P>Of course the announcement, like many an announcement of this Government, does not mean what it says or appears to say, because it is quite <Col N="2410" /> clear that 500 gardaí will not be recruited and put on the beat in the remainder of this year.  However, at least it is an acknowledgement of the seriousness of the situation that now obtains, a situation which is a direct result of the neglect by this so-called, self-styled law and order Government, neglect of their primary and basic duty to preserve law and order.  I say that, not only because this Government seem to think that law and order and their enforcement apply only to dealing with subversion but also because as indicated in a reply to a parliamentary question approximately a month ago, it emerged that each year since 1972 the number of gardaí recruited has fallen.  It went down in 1973, down further in 1974 and further again in 1975; and this year, subject to the announcement recently made, it was going down even further. That, of course, is a gross neglect of their duty by this Government in the primary area of responsibility of any Government, the maintenance of law and order.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour can best be described as a non-Minister.  Without going into any details of the recent or more distant inactivity of the Minister, it is now clear, even to his own colleagues, that the Minister for Labour, whatever duties he thinks he is discharging, is not discharging the duties of the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>Aire na Gaeltachta has going for him a very effective public relations exercise.  Mark you, in Opposition he had going for him a very effective public relations exercise too, and I say &ldquo;for him&rdquo; because it is primarily directed at the glorification of the individual personally and not at the glorification of his colleagues.  It is I suppose of interest to know that at last even that efficient public relations machine is falling down because it cannot continue to sell a proposition that has no basis because there is no performance by Aire na Gaeltachta and so he is now becoming widely known as Aire na Geallúntaí.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has engaged in some frenetic activity, particularly within the EEC, and one recalls his whirlwind tours of the EEC <Col N="2411" /> capitals in connection with the regional development fund and other matters.  One looks at what is happening and finds that the regional development fund of the EEC, which is of vital importance to this country, is a miserable and unacceptable excuse for a policy by the EEC in this vital area.  In fact the EEC itself as a body is becoming paralysed and there is little if any indication of effective action by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to try to cure this paralysis, an area in which the Minister would have had us believe that he was not alone an expert but an influential expert.  We have little sign of either his influence or expertise when we look at the present situation in the EEC.</P>
    <P>In regard to the situation in Northern Ireland, in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs has a responsibility, the Leader of this party dealt with that situation yesterday.  All I want to do in that respect is point out once more that the basic attitude of this Coalition Government was that which was spelt out by the Taoiseach approximately a year ago, perhaps a little more, in a speech in Blackrock when he said that the matter should be left to the two communities in the North.  I want to make it quite clear that as far as we are concerned we do not accept that proposition.  Of course agreement between the two communities is necessary, but to leave it to the two communities is simply an abdication of responsibility.  It is a flying in the face of history, which shows that one of those communities is not prepared to come to any reasonable arrangement safeguarding its own interests unless it is induced to do so by the surrounding circumstances. A withdrawal by the Government in Dublin and an abdication by the Government in London of their responsibilities is simply a recipe for a repetition of all that has happened in the past in Northern Ireland.  The Fianna Fáil Government sought very hard, and successfully eventually, to establish the right of the Irish Government to be involved and to have a major say in the developments which have <Col N="2412" /> to take place in regard to Northern Ireland.  This Government have no right to throw away that hard-fought right established with difficulty, nor have they any right to allow the British Government to abdicate their share of major responsibility in this matter.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of the lack of performance of this Government on which one could dwell, but there is not time in this debate to do so, unfortunately, and I do not intend to do so.  However, I want to come to the area of greatest failure and greatest concern and that is the appalling situation of our economy today.  The report of the ESRI published today merely confirms what we on this side have been saying consistently, and especially what we have said in regard to the budget produced in January of this year.  It will be seen, if one consults the records, that on that occasion we said that inflation this year was likely to be very close to 20 per cent and that was a calculation based on the consequences of the budget introduced in January.  We also said that there would be practically no growth this year. There has been vague talk about an upturn in our economy.  It is pretty clear that, apart from one or two areas of exception, that alleged upturn is simply a technical adjustment in the form of restocking.  Indeed the situation cannot be otherwise as long as the present excuses for policies are pursued by the Government.</P>
    <P>The worst feature of the Government's performance in regard to the January budget is that it was a repeat of what it did in January, 1975&mdash;the very mistakes made in January, 1975, which were pointed out to the Government and which they acknowledged belatedly in June by adopting the policies we had been urging on them the previous autumn by introducing certain subsidies and reducing VAT rates on certain commodities&mdash;were repeated, but on a bigger scale, last January with even more disastrous consequences.  The direct results of that approach has been deliberately to fuel inflation.  This, of course, leads to claims for increased pay.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Taoiseach and members <Col N="2413" /> of the Government talking about the necessity for a pay pause, as they call it, one would think that failure to agree to that was clear evidence of a lack of patriotism on the part of workers and employers and that the Government had no responsibility in the matter, a Government which for the second year in succession deliberately increased the cost of living by direct action in the budget.  Of course these increased pay claims arise directly from the Government's own decision and mistakes and it means, in turn, more Irish business becoming uncompetitive and more and more people losing their jobs, more and more demands being made on the Exchequer on foot of social welfare and less and less money becoming available to the Exchequer to meet these demands.</P>
    <P>There is nothing very profound or difficult in this.  There is nothing new in it.  We have been pointing it out to the Government time after time, but they go on repeating their mistakes as though there is no other course open to them.  Indeed they try to tell us they are handling the situation extremely well having regard to the difficulties of world recession and increased energy prices.</P>
    <P>This has gone on for too long.  It is cant, propaganda.  There is no truth in it, and people are beginning to see through this bluff of the Coalition.  I made reference previously to some scientific evidence of the truth or falsity of these allegations and I make no apology for referring again to it because it is vitally important that our people should know just how false is the proposition that the Government have handled the situation well.</P>
    <P>I refer to an article in Review No. 1, 1976, published by the CII, by Dr. Brendan Menton, up to recently a senior economic adviser in the Department of Finance.  It is a scientific measurement of Governments faced with the consequences of the oil crisis and the subsequent world recession, Governments whose economies were in most cases more vulnerable than ours to the difficulties that have arisen.  It analyses the performance of the Governments of 20 OECD member countries under various headings.  What emerges is that this Government come <Col N="2414" /> out bottom of the list of 20 under every heading and, in particular, in regard to unemployment and inflation.</P>
    <P>That is a scientific measurement of the performance of this Government in the face of acknowledged difficulties affecting other Governments.  It is available and it would be worth while if people studied it.  Let us get rid of the nonsense that the Government cannot help what has happened.  Nobody in Fianna Fáil has suggested that there were not serious international difficulties affecting the economy.  What we have said is that this Government have been incompetent and inept in their handling of those difficulties and this contention is now borne out and scientifically established in the short article I have referred to.</P>
    <P>One can be forgiven for concluding that during the last few years, when faced with these acknowledged difficulties, the Government, instead of concentrating on solutions to them, have been preoccupied with methods of raising more taxes and new taxes, and that they have totally ignored their responsibilities in the management of the economy.  Of course the primary responsibility in this area rests on the Minister for Finance.  In my view we have never had a Minister for Finance who was so totally unaware of his responsibilities in the field of the management of the economy.  I am saying that out of kindness to him, because I am assuming he was unaware of his responsibilities, not that he was aware of them and ignored them. If he were aware of them his performance would virtually amount to treason.  But assuming he was unaware of them, one cannot give him a fool's pardon, because it is inexcusable that he, and his colleagues who were equally responsible, thought it better that in the area of fiscal administration and control that the concentration should be on the raising of more taxes and on different ways of raising tax.  As the economy contracted that was the preoccupation of this Government, and of course we are reaping the harvest of that incompetent and inept approach today.</P>
    <P>The two areas in which the incompetence of the Government come <Col N="2415" /> through most clearly are in the fields of prices and employment.  We find in regard to prices that in the first quarter of this year for which we have figures there was an increase of 7.3 per cent in the CPI and in the next period it was 6.2 per cent.  Allowing for the cumulative effect, that is approximately 14 per cent in the six months which, again allowing for the cumulative effect, is getting close to a 30 per cent inflation at an annual rate, this at a time when our competitors are getting their inflation down to single figures and when the Taoiseach tells us that unemployment and inflation are the priority areas of Government policy and attention.</P>
    <P>I dread to think what might have happened if they were not the priority areas, considering what is happening at this time when we have had repeated allegations from the Government benches that these are their priority areas.  At the same time, and as a direct consequence, unemployment has soared and will get worse.  Little, if any, effective action has been taken by this Government to solve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>We have never suggested&mdash;nor do I suggest now&mdash;that this is a problem which is easy of solution.  We say it should be tackled as vigorously as possible. There are, and have been, steps open to the Government all the time to tackle the unemployment problem but they have not taken any of these steps. I do not say there is a single magic wand which Fianna Fáil or the Government can wave to solve these problems. I do say that there is an overall package which can be applied and which will improve the position.  I say &ldquo;an overall package&rdquo; because clearly what is involved here is complex. There is an interaction between prices, pay, jobs, borrowing by the Government and how capital is used.  All this involves an economic plan.</P>
    <P>Not that one can guarantee at this time of uncertainty to adhere absolutely to all aspects of it, but in order to ensure that there is an overall view of the use of our resources and that they are used <Col N="2416" /> to the most effective purpose, we on this side of the House, although it is not our duty to do so, have practically completed working out an economic plan for the four years 1977-1980.  The major factors that must be involved in any vigorous approach to tackling our economic problems have to be the reduction of taxes which, whether one is at the top or the bottom of the salary scale, operate to prevent people from working hard.  There is not alone no inducement but there is an active disincentive to work hard. That must be tackled.  We have to direct our investment, in particular our capital investment, to the creation of jobs and to the increasing of productivity, in order to reduce our unit wage costs.  We have to have a crash programme of employment for young people.</P>
    <P>It is alleged that the Government have not the money to do this.  Where will they get the money?  At the moment they are running an enormous deficit on the current budget.  I would remind anybody who takes that line that if this problem is tackled intelligently&mdash;and we have demonstrated this &mdash;it can be done.  In our last budget in 1972 we deliberately budgeted for a deficit, the first time this was ever done. This was not just the sum that was left when we applied all the tax we could as against all the money we had to pay out.  This was calculated.  We imposed no new tax, reduced income tax, increased social welfare, provided incentives for development in the industrial and agricultural fields, and, as a result, we ended up with growth which produced buoyancy in the revenue and, for practical purposes balanced the budget.</P>
    <P>The only place this or any other Government will get money to tackle our problems is from growth in the economy.  The policies pursued by this Government have been consistently directed against growth, whatever may have been said.  At that time, we told them they were going to hinder growth and they have done so.</P>
    <P>A vital part of any overall package designed to deal with our economic growth problems must be the question of pay.  It is quite clear that the Government <Col N="2417" /> must play an active role in the negotiation of national pay agreements, far more active than has been played heretofore.  We must not lose sight of the fact that what really counts in pay negotiations is the workers' actual take home pay and its real value.  It follows from that that it is useless for the Government to come here imposing massive increases in indirect taxes across the board and ignoring the consequences of that on take home pay.</P>
    <P>The action of the British Government in this field should be of some interest to this Government.  Apart from that aspect, I suggest that the most serious consequences in the field of pay arising from this Government's performance has been that it now looks, unfortunately, as though we will have no national pay agreement.  When one thinks of the White Paper issued by the Government in regard to the social partners and the exortations we got from the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and other Ministers, and their virtual saying that the Government were going to apply statutory controls if it was necessary, then coming back from the brink, and then look at the shambles in which we are today, one despairs of any hope for the future of our economy while this Government remain in office.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that Fine Gael and Labour cannot agree on this as on many other areas.  In another context recently I quoted the present Minister for Industry and Commerce saying that he had objection, in principle, to any interference by the Government with free collective bargaining.  I find that neither the Minister for Industry and Commerce nor any of his colleagues seem to have found any great difficulty in accommodating his principles with the enactment of legislation which was controlling, by statute, the pay of bank officials, nor had they difficulties with the recent Bill which not alone was controlling the pay of bank officials by tying it to the national agreement, but which was actually imposing a statutory pay freeze.  That did not present any difficulty, apparently.</P>
    <P>In my view the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his colleagues from either the Labour <Col N="2418" /> Party or the Fine Gael Party have a responsibility as Members of the Government in this area.  If they cannot deliver a voluntary agreement as we did, albeit by the introduction of legislation, on the present course they are following and on the statement of the Minister for Labour, they have left themselves no alternative but a complete abdication of responsibility in this field.</P>
    <P>It is no good for the Minister for Industry and Commerce or anybody else to tell us about his objections in principle if what he is really saying is that the Government are abdicating all responsibility in the field of pay.  If that is the message we are getting, and there is no other message available, it should be clearly understood that every time the Taoiseach and his colleagues tell about the grave damage which is being done and will be done to our economy by uncontrolled income increases, in effect they are saying: &ldquo;We are responsible for this because we are abdicating responsibility for trying to bring about pay levels consonant with the interests of the economy for which we are responsible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government have now produced what can fairly be described as an absolute shambles in the field of industrial relations and in the economy generally.  I have not been inaccurate in my predictions in the past on the economy.  I wish I were inaccurate in what I am about to say.  So far as I can gauge it, if there is a national pay agreement, the next six months will be a time of acute difficulty for the economy, but if there is a free for all, the next six months will be chaotic.  We will have industrial unrest leading to further loss of jobs, and further loss of production, which will cause a negative growth in our economy, very possibly a fall in revenue to the Exchequer, but with greater demands than ever on the Exchequer in the field of social welfare.</P>
    <P>Facing into that situation the unfortunate people are depending on this Coalition, the National Coalition as they like to call themselves. <Col N="2419" /> It is difficult to understand where they get the &ldquo;national&rdquo; into it, but I will not develop that theme. It is pretty clear that some members at least of this Coalition have allowed themselves to be misled by some bye-election results.  The warning signals have gone up for them in Dublin South-West, a very serious warning.  If they have not got the message the people are getting it fast, that this Government individually and collectively are disastrous for the country.  You do not have to depend on the Fianna Fáil assessment to find that out.  You can consult the ESRI or the Economic Review of the Confederation of Irish Industry to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>We are facing into probably the most difficult economic six months the country has ever faced at least since the war.  What do we do?  We are running away; at least the Government are running away.  They think they will be able to avoid some of the worst criticisms if the Dáil is not in session.  What sums up the whole approach of the Government is the reason we are given for the lengthy adjournment now proposed by the Government: the floor of the Seanad antechamber has to be repaired.  That sums up the whole attitude of the Government and their attitude to the people in general.</P>

      <P>Let me dispose first of all of the hoo-ha made about the length of the adjournment.  I have here figures for recent Dáil adjournments under the previous Administration. In 1968 the Dáil adjourned for 103 days.  In 1972 the Dáil adjourned for 102 days.  This year the proposed adjournment is 103 days.  The average length in other cases was approximately the same.  There is a difference.  Since we took office, last year we sat for 979 hours as compared with 691 hours in 1972 under Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>There was one occasion in those years on which the Dáil was recalled.  In 1961 it was recalled by telegram to deal with the ESB stoppage.  Legislation was passed in one day.  So far as the House may be genuinely concerned, if the situation warrants it of course it will be recalled.  It was not recalled during the serious crisis in the North of Ireland in 1969 although that was a grave situation.  I will probably refer at a later stage to some other aspects of that.</P>
      <P>In an adjournment debate the normal discussion proceeds on the basis that the Government are attacked, as they were by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lynch, for what they did or did not do.  On the other hand, certain alternative proposals were referred to by him.  Some of them have seen the light of day.  Others are what we understand to be discussion documents.</P>
      <P>There has been nothing said in the course of this debate which would lead me to believe that any proposals from the opposite side of the House would deal any better with the present economic situation than our proposals have dealt with it. I want to acknowledge the appeal made by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday to the various parties to the recent employer-labour talks to accept proposals that were put before them, and also the appeal expressed by him to those involved in the bank dispute to take a rational view of the current situation.  I am grateful to him for that, but I suppose most of us recognise that if appeals were the solution to the problem it would have been solved long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Opposition have the feeling that they must oppose and part of their duties is to oppose the proposals we have made.  As I <Col N="2421" /> stressed yesterday, we have urged in the course of the last six months particularly, and even before it when we produced a White Paper on <i>A National Partnership,</i> the need for restraint and moderation in wage and salary negotiations. Recently we repeated that.  It was asserted here today by Deputy Haughey that we changed our tune in the middle of the by-elections. That is not so.  We said in the course of the campaign, and I have repeated it since, that this was crucial to the development of our economy.  I said then and I repeat now that things are by no means as bad as speakers from the Opposition would have us believe.</P>
    <P>One of the common criticisms which has been made in recent weeks and which has been pushed around by every means that is available to the propagandists&mdash;and they are not all on the Government side of the House&mdash;is that the Minister for Finance talked out of turn in respect of the bank strike.  What did he say?  He quoted verbatim comments, advice and admonitions from bank directors, from people in industry, from certain speeches or addresses delivered at the annual meetings by some bank directors. He quoted verbatim what they said at their meetings or in discussions or comments on the radio, and he then went on to contrast what they said with what they did.</P>
    <P>Is there anything wrong in that?  Is there anything wrong in being reminded of what people said, particularly having regard to the freedom with which they advised the Government and others to do this, that and the other, although when the opportunity arose they acted differently?  The Minister for Finance has been the but of every type of criticism from every quarter, both Opposition and elsewhere, but the one thing that they do not admit is that he is resolute, competent and resilient, three qualities which taken together make him a formidable operator.  That is his record and that is what he said.  So far as we are concerned, we have made that clear.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2422" /> However, Deputy Haughey talked here today about an erratic and irresponsible Minister for Finance.  I quoted the figures.  Deputy Haughey said we twisted our predictions because of the by-election; they were unrealistic and misleading.  He was in Donegal during the by-election.  He was removed out of it because of the attacks that were being made on him by his former colleague, Deputy Blaney.  He was removed to Ballyfermot where I understand he paid up and shut up.  He is not the person to talk about erratic and misleading behaviour.</P>

      <P>He was very free with them when he was here today; the Deputy was not here.  I am going to give back now what we have been getting for the last six months, and I am going to say what I want to say without interruption.  There is a report from the Public Accounts Committee after there was a Cabinet reshuffle in which Deputy Lynch removed Deputy Haughey and Deputy Blaney from office, and what was the report?  I will quote the facts, and I quote from paragraph 79 of the report of 1st December, 1970:</P>
      <P>It must be added that had Colonel Hefferon taken appropriate action when he learned from Captain Kelly about the proposed arms importation and his drawings from the account, much of the money might not have been misappropriated.  Had the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Neil T. Blaney, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, and the then Minister for Defence, Deputy James Gibbons, passed on to the Taoiseach their suspicion or knowledge of the proposed arms importation the misappropriation of part of the money which is now known to have been spent on arms might have been avoided.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for anyone on this side of the House to say another word on that. That was a Dáil Committee on which <Col N="2423" /> there were the following Fianna Fáil Deputies: Deputies Barrett, Dowling, Dr. Hugh Gibbons, MacSharry, Tunney and Nolan.  Three of them are now members of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench.  I want to quote the concluding remarks of Deputy Haughey's speech:</P>
      <P>Our economy has ground to a halt, our young people are left without hope, our agriculture and industry have been disrupted, our dreams of unity betrayed.  The Government have failed utterly. Instead of reform they have given us repression....</P>
      <P>When I hear some Deputies opposite talking for the need for more gardaí on the beat, it reminds me of Satan rebuking sin.</P>
      <P>We have put forward our proposals. We have made it clear in our dicussions with the trade unions and other organisations that we believe this is the only policy in present circumstances.  We cannot isolate ourselves from the rest of the world, in which there are five million unemployed in the EEC countries.  What I said yesterday was that compared with other countries&mdash;and we do not say any more&mdash;we have done better than some.  Part of the Fianna Fáil plan is that we are to spend more money, but we are to spend more money without taxing more.  We are to spend more money on what?  Here are the figures we are spending on housing, and I will contrast them with the figures for the previous Administration.  In 1972-73, the last year in which Fianna Fáil were in office, the total for housing provided by the State was £45 million. In 1976 the comparable figure will be £119 million.  For the first quarter of this year there was over £20 million received by building societies. Last year the building societies spent over £65 million on top of the money that was provided by the State for building houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch rightly says that he is in favour of a system of owner occupiers.  Maybe he is not aware that we have one of the <Col N="2424" /> highest house home ownership rates in the world.  More than 70 per cent of the houses in this country are owner occupied compared with something over 50 per cent in Britain and a considerably lower percentage in a number of the other EEC countries.  In addition to that, two out of three of the houses that have been built in the last three years are owner occupied.</P>
    <P>This part of the thing was not costed.  Part of the Fianna Fáil propaganda was the suggestion that they would do away with rates.  They did not say how the money would be raised, or how the local services would be financed.  It was an easy cheap promise given on the eve of the election, which was contrary to the white paper which was published by them in December 1972, in which they said, that for many years rates would be an integral part of our economic system.  They did not see in the foreseeable future any alternative system to rates.  They talked about the abolition of rates on the eve of the general election and on the eve of this by-election also, and there was no suggestion as to how the money would be raised.</P>
    <P>I costed some of the proposals made by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, and the total came to £75 million.  I do not know where he proposed to get the money.  Deputy Colley said that we have reached the limit of taxation and borrowing.  During the course of the by-election Deputy Haughey promised 10,000 new jobs. The last time Fianna Fáil had a scheme it was 100,000 jobs and that scheme disappeared.  Deputy Colley was quite right a few minutes ago when he said: &ldquo;Not that you can adhere to all targets of an economic plan&rdquo;.  There is no doubt that some people learn from experience.  The second Fianna Fáil plan collapsed, the third fell flat on its face and we do not know where the fourth one is.  There were 70,000 or more unemployed when Fianna Fáil were in office and at the same time emigration was rampant.  We have ended emigration.</P>

      <P>One of the assignments of Deputy Joe Brennan is to bring forward policies for discussion. That is one of the duties imposed on him and in between he does a bit of groundwork before the Donegal convention. One of his duties is to bring forward policies, and I do not know who brings them back after they have been rejected by the electorate.  One of the former economic advisers to the Fianna Fáil Party published an article which suggested that we should cut social welfare by £30 million.  Maybe that would have provided some of the £75 million required for Deputy Lynch's proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little misrepresentation in that.  Deputy Lynch referred yesterday to the increases which had taken place in social welfare and he said that there was not much in these increases, that they were swallowed up by increased prices.  To set the record straight, between May, 1973, and May last the consumer price index has gone up by 68 per cent, say 70 per cent.  At the same time the provision for social welfare, including payments from the Social Insurance Fund, went up by more than 100 per cent between 1972-73 and 1976.  One of the advantages in this increase was that the rate of retirement pension, under both <Col N="2426" /> the insurance and assistance schemes increased between 95 per cent and 100 per cent between 1972-73 and 1976, and the personal rate of disability and unemployment benefit for an individual increased by more than 96 per cent while under the assistance scheme it increased by about 105 per cent.  That is the record of the Government.  These are the actual increases that people received.</P>
      <P>In the course of his remarks the Leader of the Opposition said that the concept of pay-related benefit is all right if it was operated in the proper way.  He referred to the possible adverse effects on employment if the benefit was too high in relation to employment income and he referred to the fact that some of the schemes had operated in this way.  Recently Bills have been passed in both Houses of the Oireachtas to correct this, and an order was passed here, which was introduced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the Minister for Labour, who was then at the ILO, which gave effect to the Government's decision and provided that benefits should not exceed 85 per cent of the average net weekly earnings which he had received prior to becoming unemployed.  The benefits include pay-related, redundancy payments, unemployment benefit and assistance and a refund of income tax as a result of unemployment.  There was also a measure passed to impose extra penalties on employers who failed to stamp insurance cards. In other words we had a two-pronged approach in legislation to prevent excessive payments so as to wipe out any disincentive to seek work by payments which had resulted from the effects of a combination of three Acts meaning that in some cases persons got more than 100 per cent of what they earned when working. It has now been reduced to 85 per cent.  I do not know whether the Leader of the Opposition thought that this ceiling was too high but at any rate that is the step we took to correct it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some discussion has gone on here about legislation.  It is important to know what is being done.  I referred to the fact that we sat more hours <Col N="2427" /> than any previous Dáil.  In addition since we took office we passed 117 Acts compared with 96 Acts during the comparable previous three years of the Fianna Fáil Government.  It is not that passing Acts by itself is any criteria, but you must allow for the fact that these Acts include a variety of measures of a reforming character, not of a repressive character.  There was one measure which, to use Deputy Haughey's phrase might be of a repressive character, that was the Criminal Jurisdiction Bill.  Is it not a good thing to take every step within our resources as a nation to prevent one group of Irishmen killing another and to bring to justice those responsible for it?</P>

      <P>Is the Opposition against that?  I know that there are divided counsels opposite on that.  I know that there are divided views on that.  I know that the reason for the protracted debate was to try and keep the two sides together.  I know that there was not the same intervention in debate by some of the critics in the past.  They were relatively silent, but they blossomed forth in the course of this debate.  That Bill was found constitutional. There were other Bills also, one on physical planning, to establish an independent planning board.  This was promised by Fianna Fáil but it was never brought in.  One of the Ministers responsible for it resigned because he objected to what his leader did at the time.  A Bill was brought in on building societies, a Bill to prevent the abuse of drugs, a Bill on discrimination in employment, a Bill on industrial relations, and a wildlife Bill.  All of these Bills were promised by Fianna Fáil.  It was like the Department of Lands in Castlebar, there was not a brick upon a brick until we got into office.  There was also a Bill on family law, the first that we had a chance of passing for 50 years, and Fianna Fáil complain about that.  We had a Bill on elections.  Every other redistribution Bill was a Fianna Fáil Bill, and there was nothing wrong with them until the <Col N="2428" /> High Court got hold of one of them. There were innumerable amendments to the social welfare code.  There were Bills on agriculture, culture and the arts, and a variety of other Bills, including the Prosecution of Offences Bill.  All that indicates a reforming Government.  I do not deny that there was one piece of legislation which might offend the patriotic sensibilities of some Deputies opposite.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons talked about agriculture and contested the fact that farmers' incomes had increased by 50 per cent in 1975.  He said that I had ignored the drop in cattle and sheep numbers.  He said that the Government were actively discouraging the agricultural industry and he referred to the action taken in relation to VAT and other things.  He went on to say that the Government were hostile or inimical to farmers' interests.  As far as I know, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is prepared at any time to advance farmers' interests and to meet deputations.  Not only that, but on a number of occasions he brought along with him the Minister for Finance.  I remember a time when a Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture would not receive the farmers.  He left them out in Merrion Street and not in weather like this but in winter weather.  Are the memories of Deputies opposite so short that they forget that?  The Minister for Agriculture is, I think, recognised as one of the most energetic advocates of farmers' interests in this or any other country.  He has vigorously asserted their rights.  In fact, one of the criticisms in the course of the recent Dublin South-West by-election was that the common agricultural policy had put up the cost of living because of the increases in farm prices.  The same case was not made in Donegal; there was no talk about it there.  That is typical of Fianna Fáil&mdash;one voice in one place and another voice in another place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy we have put forward in respect of both agriculture and industry has brought results which we believe are in the interests of the nation.  Of course we are still faced with&mdash;and we recognise this&mdash;the major problem of a growing population of people out of work because of <Col N="2429" /> the effect of modern developments and particularly the effect, as I have said&mdash;I think I should quote from the leading article in today's <i>Irish Press</i>.  It says:</P>
    <P>In many ways the Taoiseach was coldly realistic and we hope the same realism will be practiced by other Ministers.</P>
    <P>That is in contrast with what Fianna Fáil spokesmen have said and this is &ldquo;Truth in the News&rdquo;.  That is their view of what I said.</P>
    <P>Yet no solution was propounded to this central basic weakness in the Irish economy.  Can the State or anyone else provide for a revival of Irish industry to cater for the home market and our own consumers' spending?  In textiles, clothing, footwear, durables such as refrigerators, shall we abandon the struggle and leave all to the importers?  On the face of things this is what is happening and what industry we shall have will be foreign owned, highly technological and export orientated and also heavily subsidised by the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>There is not much wrong in that assessment of the situation.  But how much worse would it have been if we had not established the Industrial Development Authority to attract capital, know-how and skill from abroad?  I remember, although not many Deputies now remember, that the Opposition not merely opposed this but said that when they would get back they would repeal the Act. They did not repeal it and the Industrial Development Authority and the tax concession on exports introduced by the late William Norton and Gerard Sweetman have been the two greatest single factors in expanding and developing industry here.  We have sought and obtained investment here from abroad because there is stability here and because investors believe that the atmosphere generally in a very troubled world is at least as good here as anywhere else and better than most.</P>
    <P>Of course the Opposition could contrast that with the situation existing when we had the last <Col N="2430" /> Cabinet shuffle in the Fianna Fáil Government.  Deputy Haughey is keen on a reshuffle now.  He was not so keen on the last occasion when there was a reshuffle.  The Fianna Fáil policy is to spend more on everything.  We have had debates when we sat here for over 900 hours &mdash;a record.  In that period we gave more time in one year, with the exception of a few hours, than Fianna Fáil gave in three years to Private Members' Business.</P>
    <P>What was the time used for?  Does anybody remember a motion in which it was said: &ldquo;You should not spend more money; save it; you should not spend on this&mdash;cut it out&rdquo;.  Where there not motions on roads, education, housing grants, amenity grants, health grants, more medical cards, more benefits of every kind, week in week out, for an hour-and-a-half on Tuesday and an hour-and-a-half on Wednesday? They trooped into the division lobby week after week on Wednesday evenings advocating more money for everything. But we are told: &ldquo;You cannot borrow, you should not borrow; you have already exceeded your borrowing limit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We think we have gone to the limit with national borrowing.  For one thing the cost of borrowing means that it must be paid for out of revenue, that you have to tax people to pay for it. One of the criticisms is that we should not have taxed the old reliables.  What should we have taxed?  Is it suggested that we should have raised income tax or increased VAT, or reimposed VAT on food which we took off when we came in?  Is that suggested?  The Fianna Fáil proposal is that we should spend more but we should not tax and we cannot borrow.  Nobody accepts that.  The answer is the recent by-election.

      <P>The Deputy reminds me of something.  I see that according to a report one person at the Fianna Fáil convention in Donegal said he was screwed by another.  As far as I can see, Deputy Blaney screwed both of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2431" /> We have made our view as regards Northern Ireland abundantly clear and that as far as we are concerned any proposal that meets with the support of both communities there will have our support.  Deputy Colley said in the course of his remarks here before I stood up that we had rather opted out. But we had a number of meetings&mdash; this year alone there were two meetings in Dublin and others in London&mdash; with the Secretary of State for the North.  I had a meeting with the then Prime Minister, Mr. Wilson, in London in March.  There have been other discussions since.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition referred to the Fianna Fáil policy document on the North of Ireland and expressed the view that it was produced prior to the demise of the Convention. The Convention almost had the seeds of its demise from its conception but Deputy Lynch's timing may be a little at fault.  In fact, their policy document was produced on the eve of the West Mayo by-election.  That was at a time when there was a sort of movement to see if it was possible to reach some sort of rapprochement with Deputy Blaney.  We know what happened to the document in West Mayo and not even a blood transfusion from Deputy Blaney's party could now revive it.</P>
    <P>We have approached this problem with a clear and sustained policy to ensure that both communities in the North respect each others' rights.  If both communities agree on a settlement it is acceptable to us.  We have made this clear in the North, in discussions with the British Government and we have made it clear here.  I see no alternative policy that would produce a better result or that would have any hope of success.  Naturally, we regret that the discussions have not reached a stage which we would hope would result in a measure of agreement between the two communities there.  We have had discussions ourselves both directly and, on some occasions, jointly with different elements represented.  We are still prepared, and will continue, to play our part in endeavouring to get agreement.</P>
    <P>So far as the question of recalling the Dáil is concerned, we have made it <Col N="2432" /> clear that should the necessity arise we will recall the Dáil.  As I mentioned earlier, there were many occasions in the past in which issues arose and the Dáil was not recalled.  We recognise that it is, of course, the privilege of the Opposition to assert that they do not want to go on holidays.  The fact is the decision to adjourn was announced many months ago and the Opposition were told.  It has nothing to do with the present balloting on the employerlabour conference wage recommendations. It was announced before the present impasse arose over the banks. It is not an effort to close down.  Whatever else can be laid at our door we have never tried to stifle discussion in this House.  We have had more discussion, longer debates, more time for Private Members' motions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think the record was on the Marts Bill.  I listened yesterday to the paternal solicitude of Deputy de Valera in regard to pushing through the Estimates.  This is not new. This has been the practice for years. There is the difference in that this year we have given a great deal of extra time for debate and even with that extra time for debate on Estimates, on legislation and on Private Members' motions the Opposition are not satisfied.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Colley a few minutes ago talk about an article alleged to have been written by Dr. Brendan Menton.  In this case he confused the father with the son or the son with the father.  It was the son who wrote the article and he was never in the Department of Finance.  Some may have noticed that in the statement on the by-elections the Fianna Fáil propaganda machine said Fianna Fáil's percentage vote in Dublin had gone up by 1½ whereas the Coalition vote had gone up by only 1.5 per cent.  This is the Opposition that criticises statistics.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to make a statement on the recent tragic events in South Africa.  I deeply deplore what has happened and I am sure that all Deputies will join with me in expressing shock at the largescale loss of innocent lives and in expressing sympathy to the injured and bereaved.  The Government fully associates itself with the terms of UN Security Council Resolution 392 (1976), adopted on Saturday, the 19th, which strongly condemned the South African Government for its resort to massive violence.</P>
      <P>We in Ireland are particularly aware of the destructive potential inherent in policies of discrimination and the South African Government can be under no illusion as to the fundamental attitude of the Irish Government and people on this issue.  The Government have consistently condemned the policy of apartheid, which we consider intrinsically evil in character and I have repeatedly emphasised, as did my predecessors in this office, that the repressive policies of the South African Government in implementing the apartheid system would, if unchanged, inevitably have disastrous consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2372" /> Ireland does not have direct diplomatic links with South Africa but following the recent tragic events there I would again urge the South African Government in the strongest possible terms to initiate a programme of radical change, without which disaster will be inevitable.</P>
    <P>I understand that the South African Government have indicated their intention to investigate the events at Soweto, but the precise details are not known to me.  I would strongly urge the South African Government to ensure that the inquiry is conducted in a manner that will satisfy both those inside and outside South Africa as to the impartiality of the results.  This of course, will not solve the underlying problem but it may at least prevent a repetition of recent tragic events.  The underlying problems cannot however but continue to increase unless the Government of South Africa begins to take steps leading to the complete dismantlement of the unjust and dangerous system of apartheid.</P>

One of these guidelines exhorts multinational enterprises not to render any bribe or improper benefit directly or indirectly to any public servant or holder of public office.</P>
      <P>In the framework of the United Nations, a resolution was unanimously adopted at the last session of the General Assembly which condemns all corrupt practices by transnational and other corporations and calls on Governments to take all necessary measures to prevent such practices. Following on this resolution, the United States has proposed that negotiations of a binding international agreement on corrupt practices should begin at next month's session of the Economic and Social Council.  Although Ireland is not a member of the Economic and Social Council, I indicated our support for the United States initiative at the recent OECD Ministerial meeting.</P>

The number of trials which stood adjourned at 1st June, 1976, because of the barristers' withdrawal from the legal aid scheme was approximately 700.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of the second part of the question the figure of 700 trials may be very roughly apportioned as follows: (i) 440; (ii) 130; and (iii) 130.</P>

      <Col N="2392" /> Recruitment of gardaí to increase the strength of the force by 500 will commence as soon as possible.  It will be necessary for the Civil Service Commissioners to arrange for the holding of a competition and it is likely to be a few months before recruits are available from it.  Recruitment from the last competition is continuing but the number of successful candidates in that competition still to be appointed will be matched by expected retirements from the force.</P>

      <P>In most areas throughout the State the number of applications for maintenance orders or other applications in the area of family law is not such as to pose any special accommodation or administrative problems at present. However, the question appears to be concerned mainly with the position in Dublin and I am aware of the need for better facilities there.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>First of all, may I make it quite clear, that, despite the statement that appears in the <i>Garda Review</i> that it is published, and I quote &ldquo;on behalf of the Garda Síochána&rdquo;, it is not in fact an official publication but is, <i>de facto</i> at all events, the journal of the representative bodies or some of them and quite clearly its policy is to advance the interests of their members, just as the journal of any staff association would do.  Issues such as the incidence of crime when raised in editorials or other articles in the review can be expected naturally enough to be appraised from a rather narrow perspective and should be assessed with that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I think it is inevitable and indeed perhaps essential if it is to fulfil its purpose that a journal setting out to advance the interests of the members of the representative bodies will have a certain degree of partisanship in its approach, the current editorial is not the kind of commentary that I would have expected to see published in the <i>Garda Review,</i> above all at a time when the country is faced at one and the same time with a serious economic crisis and the need to maintain extremely <Col N="2394" /> costly security measures.  To speak with such emphasis about Garda grievances without even a passing reference to the major improvements made in pay, allowances and conditions over the last six or seven years presents an unbalanced picture especially when so many of our people are out of work.  Even more disturbing was the unreal picture of our country as a lawless dangerous place.  I gave some facts to the House yesterday during the debate on the Estimates for my Department, facts which put the record straight and which I hope will reassure any citizen including members of the Garda themselves, who might have been disturbed by the tone of the article in question.</P>
    <P>Apart from those important points, I am assured by the Garda authorities that some of the key statements in the editorial are either exaggerations or entirely wrong.  I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by any detailed analysis of all those statements but I will select one as an example.  The editorial states that &ldquo;in Border areas one comes across one-man check-points&rdquo;.  In fact, if at least two men were not available for check-point duty&mdash;something which I am assured happens but rarely&mdash;the policy is that the check-point would not be manned at all.  It has, however, happened very exceptionally that a man on check-point duty became ill and had to leave so that one man was left behind for a time.  If that is what is meant by the operation of a one-man check-point, it is not in my view a fair description.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the extent of the crime problem and, if I had not otherwise been made aware of it, which in fact I had been, the representations made to me by Members of the House from various parts of the State would have left me in no doubt.  The Government have recently decided to increase the strength of the force by yet a further 500 men&mdash;that is, in addition to such recruitment as will offset retirements and so on&mdash;and, at a time of such difficulty as is now prevailing, I think that is ample evidence of the Government's commitment to do what is reasonably possible in the matter.</P>

To assist in the work, my Department have published a booklet on fire safety in hotels as well as more general fire safety standards.</P>
      <P>It may be some reassurance to the Deputy to know that statistical returns for 1975 indicate that, while brigades were called to deal with 85 fires in hotels, most of these were of a minor nature and the number represented less than 1 per cent of the total number of fires dealt with.</P>

      <P>While the Environment Committee of the OECD has issued a report by a sub-group on &ldquo;Low-Cost <Col N="2403" /> Improvements of the Outdoor Environment of Urban Areas&rdquo;, no specific recommendations have been made arising from the report.</P>
      <P>The report deals with a number of possible approaches to urban improvement, short of comprehensive redevelopment. They include traffic measures; improvement of social and recreational facilities and measures to improve the appearance of buildings and spaces, and to conserve heritage features.</P>
      <P>So far as local Government is concerned these are matters for local authorities to consider in the circumstances of their areas and, ideally, in the context of the review of their development plans.  Many of the suggestions made in the report are matters to which I have repeatedly directed the attention of local authorities. For example, I have encouraged them to include, as part of their housing programmes, the preservation and development of the residential and other amenities of innercity areas.  I have spoken on numerous occasions about the various ways in which local authorities can contribute to the conservation of our built environment, without necessarily becoming involved in grandiose or expensive schemes.  And, of course, I have always stressed the value of more effective public participation in planning a matter which is also referred to in the report.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  This is a nonstatutory body which I set up in February, 1975, to advise me on matters relating to my functions and responsibilities concerning control of water pollution.  Accordingly, it was not envisaged that the council would produce any report for general publication. I expect, however, that before <Col N="2404" /> it is superseded by the statutory body envisaged in the Water Pollution Bill, the present council will wish to report formally to me reviewing its activities since it was established.</P>
