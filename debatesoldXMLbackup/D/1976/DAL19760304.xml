      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday afternoon last I mentioned how the Government have failed the agricultural community.  By virtue of the new taxation of agriculture and of co-ops, the Government are undermining the industry instead of building it up.  The Government have failed the agricultural industry and this year's budget has added insult to injury and left the rural population outraged.  At a time when investment in agriculture should be encouraged, the Government have taken steps in the opposite direction.</P>
      <P>I consider the taxation of our co-ops as the most negative measure in the budget, a serious blow to the whole movement which was built up and encouraged over many years by successive Fianna Fáil Governments. Through the co-ops our farmers became directly involved in the processing and marketing of their produce. In recent years tremendous expansion and modernisation were undertaken by the co-operative movement to meet the challenge of our EEC membership. This involved heavy financial expenditure which now has to be repaid at expensive rates of interest.</P>
      <P>However, the only thanks the co-ops are getting for their enterprise is an increase in the burden of taxation. The development and expansion of our agricultural production is of course vital to our economy and to our balance of payments position and we should not discourage this development through taxation.  The Government must therefore be condemned for putting the whole future of Irish agriculture in jeopardy.  We should bear in mind that the co-ops provide massive employment, directly and indirectly. They ensure a living for the vast majority of farming families. Without them the whole social and economic fabric of many towns and villages as well as rural areas would collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should remember that co-ops were never created for the purpose of making profits and they do not exist for this purpose today.  Any profits <Col N="1285" /> co-ops make are ploughed back into improvement and development.  The Minister for Finance is not dealing here with foreign multi-national companies but with our basic industry. His budget has taken away the incentive to develop our highest employment content industry and a big export earner which has played such a big role in our economic survival. This new taxation is ludicrous when it is compared with the situation where an industrialist, whether Irish or foreign, can set up a new industry or expand it yet his profits will be completely free of tax for 20 years.  The co-op movement should be on the same basis as an industrialist who could make a profit of £20 million in a year and still be tax free.  Our farmers are now subject to income tax and VAT credits on farm purchases have been withdrawn, adding still further to farmers' costs.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed that more provision was not made in the budget for capital expenditure in respect of sanitary services.  It is vital for the country to get as much serviced land as possible into the hands of local housing authorities and the only way this can be done is through substantial increases in the money for sanitary services.  The increase this year is approximately £1.8 to £1.9 million above last year's figure of £18 million. This is approximately a 10 per cent increase over last year.  It is not an increase in real terms, however, and therefore we have to remember that a local authority, a State body or, indeed the Government, cannot do nearly as much work this year as last year with the same amount of money because of inflation.  This small increase in the allocation for sanitary services will go nowhere near meeting the needs of local authorities and housing authorities.  Many county councils, urban councils, county borough corporations and so on are short of money.  So serious is the shortfall that the allocations to each authority will not meet existing commitments and the authorities will be unable to proceed with existing schemes, schemes started last year or the year before.  In some cases there is a shortfall of anything up to 100 per cent of <Col N="1286" /> the allocation.  This is very serious because the question of employment enters into the picture.  Again those with machinery have found it necessary to defer schemes because there is such great uncertainty about the future.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to find that capital expenditure for sanitary services this year was not substantially increased. The same argument applies to health services.  We discussed these at length over the past two evenings and in this morning's papers, particularly on the front page of <i>The Irish Independent,</i> one could see that the position is fast deteriorating in hospitals and institutions throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This budget is a disastrous budget for numerous reasons.  The increase in motor taxation hits the ordinary man very severely, particularly the worker who requires a car to get to work.  It adds anything up to £3 a week to his expenses.  I asked how it was proposed to compensate the worker for this increased expenditure.  Not alone is there an increase in the price of petrol but there is also an increase in motor taxation, to say nothing of the dramatic increase in car insurance before Christmas.  This alone will make it very difficult for the Government to negotiate successfully a pay pause this year.  Because of these increased costs in petrol, taxation and insurance, firms will be forced to increase their prices and the consumer will have to pay more.  This will add more fuel to the fire of inflation.  This budget will have very serious consequences.  I believe the full brunt will not be felt until possibly next June or July.  A budget like this is completely unsuited to an economy like ours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>To give any validity whatever to the arguments advanced on this budget by the Opposition one would, first of all, have to accept that there was no world financial crisis and, secondly, given the fact that there is a world financial crisis, an economic crisis, hitting western Europe in particular, one would have to accept that if Fianna Fáil were in office they would do better than the Government.  Any consideration of the budget must be <Col N="1287" /> based on these two premises because everything that Fianna Fáil have said&mdash; perhaps not everything, but practically everything&mdash;is based on the argument that, if they were over here, they would be able to weather the storm.  They could, in fact, completely ignore the industrial storm, be able to do everything and make everyone in the country happy.  If Fianna Fáil's record over the years showed that that was the type of Government they were when they were in Government then perhaps there might be some reason for wondering if that, in fact, were true but those of us who have lived long enough to have experienced a very long time of Fianna Fáil in office realise that nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
      <P>I have said on numerous occasions here, and I repeat it now, that it is very easy for somebody in Opposition, who has not been in Government, particularly someone who has not taken part in Government as a Minister, to offer instant solutions to practically everything without bothering to cost those solutions and without bothering to say what effect they would have on the economy.  During my quite lengthy period in Opposition I, like everybody else, was prepared to offer what I considered to be solutions and, even though I worked very hard to try to find out whether or not the solutions I was offering were reasonable, I must admit now that, having had an opportunity of looking at it from the other side, quite a number of the things I suggested just would not have worked mainly because of financial reasons. A number of them would have worked and those I have attempted to put into operation since I became Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand people who have had experience as Ministers on this side of the House going to the far side and, having failed to do anything year after year, attempting now to get the House and the public to accept that the solutions they are offering from the far side are reasonable solutions, or indeed, solutions at all.  I could give the benefit of the doubt to backbenchers and to front-benchers who have not had ministerial experience because they, like myself <Col N="1288" /> when I was on that side of the House, are using whatever political intelligence they have to attempt to offer something they think would work and to make fair criticisms.  However, not alone is it unfair but it is entirely dishonest for someone who has been a Minister of State and who knows the facts of life in Government to go across the House and to put forward half-baked solutions which he must know would not work.  We get them by the dozen.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the Opposition have not made a reasonable approach to the budget.  Because of the economic crisis I thought that the Opposition would, as good parliamentarians, under a leadership who would point this out to them, feel that the onus was on them to help in every possible way to bring the country back to prosperity.  Instead of that they are putting every possible impediment in the way of the Government, and attempting both at home and aborad to denigrate the efforts the Government are making.  Happily the Government are able to survive, but it is not with the assistance of the Opposition. When in opposition we were always under instructions from our leaders that, under no circumstances, were we in this House or outside it to make a criticism of the Government, no matter how valid it might be, which would be against the national interest.  That seems to have gone out of fashion, although former leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party pointed out to us the necessity for this, and we accepted it.  It now appears to be the practice to try to denigrate the Government on every possible occasion, to do as much harm as possible, and if it helps to bring the country to its knees, so be it.  I am sorry that a national party like Fianna Fáil should descend to that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>I could understand such a line being taken by backbenchers because they possibly would not appreciate what they were doing but it is unbelievable that people of experience in the front bench, former Government Ministers and even the former Taoiseach, could make such contradictory statements. It seems to be considered by Fianna <Col N="1289" /> Fáil that there should be a drastic cutback in Government expenditure, that there should be a reduction in taxation, that there should be a reduction in borrowing, that hundreds of millions of pounds extra should be found under various headings, particularly housing, health, sanitary services, roads and so on.  Strange things have happened in this country, and maybe they have discovered a pot of gold at the bottom of a Fianna Fáil rainbow somewhere, which we know nothing about and which, if they ever become the Government, they will be able to dig up and start using.  There is no other way in which the suggestions they have made could be implemented.</P>
    <P>I do not like mentioning people who are outside this House, but a former adviser of the Fianna Fáil Party has indicated that, in his opinion there should be a drastic reduction in social welfare and in civil service pay.  At the same time, Fianna Fáil tell us we should be increasing social welfare and that we should be increasing the civil service pay under a number of headings.  I would like to start off with one of those headings, namely, equal pay.</P>
    <P>This Government are determined to have equal pay for work of equal value operated.  I would like all the organisations involved, particularly the women's organisations and some of the trade union organisations who have been very noisy about this&mdash;and I speak as a trade union official of 26 years' standing and I know what I am talking about&mdash;to realise that there was no move towards equal pay by Fianna Fáil during their time in office, and that during the period of less than three years in which this Government have been in office the gap between the pay of men and that of women in public employment has been reduced by 60 per cent.  Do the people who are shouting about equal pay and about the failure of this Government to introduce equal pay, including the lady who indicated that she was going to work might and main for the return of a Fianna Fáil Government, understand how they are paid or the mechanics of these things at all?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> The women employed in the public service have had 60 per cent of the differential reduced as a result of the National Coalition Government being in office.  I do not know how people can say that it was only because there was a row kicked up at the EEC that this matter was brought up at all. There is a report in this morning's paper about some gentlemen who came here from the EEC to investigate this matter.  I do not intend to comment on the competence of those gentlemen; they represent the EEC and that is good enough for me.  However, if the criticism which the newspapers seem to think is directed towards the Government is valid, the people who preceded us in Government are the people they are aiming their barbs at or should be aiming them, because they did nothing whatever to rationalise the difference in pay between men and women, who did nothing at all to have the principle of equal pay for work of equal value put into operation.</P>
    <P>While I am of the view that we must, as soon as practicable, have equal pay for men and women who are doing work of equal value, I still believe the decision that the Government took was the right one and that the Government can hold up their heads and say to the employed women of this country that they did more in three years for them than Fianna Fáil did in all their years of office.</P>
    <P>I would also make this comment, particularly with reference to some of my colleagues in the trade union movement with whom I have worked for many years.  We have recently introduced a Bill to give a fair deal to farm workers.  For most of my 26 years in the trade union movement I was compaigning for equal pay for farm workers.  I did not see any evidence of the wild enthusiasm of some of the people who have been talking about equal pay in recent years when I was attempting to have farm workers brought up from the second class citizenship status to that of any other worker.  There were a few exceptions, but I am afraid that the trade union of which I had the honour to be General Secretary <Col N="1291" /> for so long, the Federation of Rural Workers, fought a lone battle for farm workers over the years.  I make no apology for saying that when the change of Government took place, I played a very substantial part in having the Government adopt the idea that farm workers' wages and conditions should be dealt with in the same way as those of any other employees.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Wages Board were set up by the Government and let me be very quick to add that they did a very good job in the early days, because in 1956 when they fixed a minimum rate of 24 shillings a week they did put a floor under farm workers' wages.  Over the years the farm workers fell further and further behind.  Then for two or three years in succession the Agricultural Wages Board refused to accept the national wage agreement, although it applied to everybody from the lowest to the highest in the land, whether they were organised workers or not.  It did not apply to farm workers, according to the people who have the legal authority to regulate their wages. Their hours of work are still 50 per week in the winter, 44 in the summer, ten hours more than industrial workers.  It was suggested recently that women agricultural workers should be given equal pay because it would increase their hours from 46 to 50 per week and would put them on an equal basis with the men.</P>
    <P>I do not want to stay very long on this subject, but I want to make it clear that this Government made this provision.  It is part of the ongoing policy towards which the present budget is geared to bring the country back on to a steady course. We want to ensure that everybody who has wages and working conditions regulated should be dealt with in the same way.  There is a lot of talk now about the next wage agreement. The Government feel that there should be a stay on wages, that there should not be a big rush for further substantial wage increases at <Col N="1292" /> present, and that there should be an easing off until the country is back on an even keel.  This is not alone in the interests of the country or the Government, but it is in the interests of the very many people who are unemployed.  There seems to be a big objection to this.  I suppose it is the old story of the well-off person feeling that he has no responsibility for others.</P>
    <P>From my very youngest days I have always learned that it was each for all and all for each.  It was a question of the people who were members of a trade union not alone looking after themselves and their fellow workers but looking after other workers.  I appeal to the trade union movement to go easy on this. The people who run the trade union movement have very long experience and are dedicated to ensuring that the people they represent are given a fair deal.  I believe they have been given a fair deal under this Government. An effort should be made to ensure that those who are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs, or the 60,000 or 70,000 who were unemployed at the time this Government took office, should also be given an opportunity of getting employment.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that, with the exception of a relatively small proportion of people who are unable to work and who in my opinion should not be signing on at unemployment exchanges, should be dealt with in a special way.  Ordinary workingclass men and women would prefer to be working than to be unemployed.  It annoys me to hear well-heeled people &mdash;and in the main it comes from people who are employers&mdash;saying that the working man would rather stay at home because he is getting more by staying at home.  I would be only too happy to hear from employers anywhere in the country who say they cannot get employees.  I have heard this talk so often that I now say that any member of the Government would be glad to hear from those people who criticise unemployed workers.  Let us hear where the jobs are and they will be filled pretty quickly.  The unemployed and the sick are entitled to be <Col N="1293" /> able to maintain for a reasonable period, as near as possible, their standard of living.  It does not appear to be accepted by some people, either in this House or outside it, that the man who owns a factory or a farm has a very big capital asset.  However, if he happens to be unfortunate enough to die, his relatives have substantial capital assets to which they are entitled.  The working man has one thing only, and that is his labour, the sweat of his brow.  If he finishes work through illness or death, there is nothing for him or his relatives unless the State steps in.  We still have a peculiar idea that there is no difference between the employer and the employee, that the employer is right to criticise the employee because of the fact that, if he is unemployed, he is getting an allowance on which he can live.  I think he is entitled to it.  I do not know whether Fianna Fáil would take the advice of the people who criticise this budget if they were in Government now, but they certainly took it when they were in Government. It is the old story, as far as social welfare is concerned, of the unemployed and the sick getting very little.  There are many cases where people were literally starved into going back to work when they were not fit to go back to work.  It should be remembered that the employee's and employer's contributions towards the cost of the stamp are considered as part of the cost of the employee. Therefore it is just as reasonable to count it as part of his wages.  When people pay for stamps for many years, it is wrong for those who have never stamped cards, or who are still in full employment, to complain that their less fortunate brethren are getting sufficient to live on.</P>
    <P>This Government can look back with pride on the tremendous improvement which they carried out in the social services over the past three years.  Before the change of Government I remember people telling me of the small allowances they were getting when they were ill or unemployed.  Indeed, old age pensioners and widows and orphans were getting a mere pittance. I quite agree that, if Fianna <Col N="1294" /> Fáil were in office and it was suggested to them that they should decrease social welfare benefits, they would do so.  The economy of the country might be an awful lot better than it is, but the ordinary people who are depending on social welfare would have had to spend another three years in misery. For that reason alone, this Government can look back with pride on their efforts in the social field over the last few years.  In addition to that, we reduced the qualifying age for old age pensions.  They did something which I had been asking for, that is, they allowed the means test for noncontributory benefits to be brought to a stage where people who are badly off can get enough to live on because God knows, the Fianna Fáil system was wrong.  I always think of an old lady of 80 years of age, living in an old thatched house, with only one room in it because the rest of it had fallen down, and the social welfare officer deciding that she had a house and therefore deducting 25p per week from her allowance.  We did away with all that.  Now people can get the old age pension with a reasonable amount of income from other sources.</P>
    <P>The most neglected people were the girls who stayed at home to look after aged parents.  I know hundreds of them.  When the parents were there the daughter lived on their old age pension and when they died she might have had a council cottage or a little old house, and she had no income unless she applied for home assistance. In the country districts there is no work and at the age of 57 and upwards there is no point in looking for work for the first time because it is not available for such people.  This Government introduced a system whereby such persons are paid benefit.</P>
    <P>The unmarried mothers, whether we agree or disagree with what they did or how they carried on, were not entitled to be treated in the disgraceful way in which they were treated under Fianna Fáil.  We have introduced a system which allowed those people to be paid benefits.  Also the prisoner's wife, when through no fault of hers or her family's the husband was put in prison, until this Government <Col N="1295" /> took over, she could go on home assistance if she could get it.  She could beg for a few pounds.  This was not the way to restore her dignity.</P>
    <P>These were the kind of things which had to be remedied, and they were remedied, and these things cost a great deal of money and will continue to cost a lot of money.  Year after year the amount of money spent on them will increase.  Fianna Fáil say: &ldquo;Cut back on social services&rdquo;.  For goodness sake, they should have a look at themselves and at what they are saying.  Perhaps the people who say it are not speaking for the party entirely, and perhaps I am wrong to criticise them for doing that because individuals do say peculiar things, but they keep repeating it.  They have said practically everything that could possibly be said, no matter how contradictory.</P>
    <P>We heard a big hullabaloo about health services at present.  I was a member of a health board when they were set up first, and I think I know as much about the running of health services as most ordinary Members of this House.  It is utter nonsense for people to talk now about a huge cutback in health services.  Of course we cannot do everything we want to do. We cannot find money to introduce new schemes which one hoped would be possible and which, please God, will be possible within the next year or so.  However, because it could not be done this year does not mean that there should be cries from the housetops that the health services are being completely done away with.  There should be a very hard look taken at the expenditure on the health services because I believe that those who are really ill and need attention should get that attention, but those who are not entitled to it and those who are wasting time and money should not be allowed to do so.  It is amazing how over a period things can grow up in a certain way until people are prepared to consider that they must ask for something.  They do not need it but they must ask for it because they have not anything else to do.</P>
    <P>Medical cards have been mentioned <Col N="1296" /> again and again.  The eligibility for medical cards has been expanded very much under this Government.  Payments for medicines to people who are entitled to only limited eligibility have been increased enormously.  The services for the aged, where they can be taken to a centre and looked after, given a meal, even a simple matter like a hair-do or chiropody, those things cost money.  Collecting these people costs money; bringing them in and out costs money, but it is being done now where it was not done on the same scale before.  It is wrong for people off the top of their heads to condemn these things and say this money is being wasted, or, alternatively, the State is not putting up enough money for these services.</P>
    <P>One of the things that amuses me about Fianna Fáil is that they try to compare everything with last year.  I advise them to compare it with three years ago.  Because of the improvements carried out within the first few years of this Government's office things have improved enormously. The amount of improvement required now does not require a tremendous step-up which it would require if Fianna Fáil were still here.</P>
    <P>In my own Department I have questions and questions.  Housing is one of them on which not much more can be said.  When I took over first I found there was provision being made for the erection of under 20,000 houses, perhaps down as far as 14,000 or 15,000.  This was not good enough for me, and I insisted on extra money being provided, and the Government came up with that extra money.  When we were looking for office we said we would build 25,000 houses per year. When I started first I felt that if we could reach the 25,000 by the end of our first term of office we would be doing very well.  Because of the impetus which was started by the Government and the full co-operation we got from local authorities, building societies, various lending agencies, and from the builders, our first year in office produced, as everybody knows, 25,365 houses.  The financial year ended in March.  From the end of that year, from about November or <Col N="1297" /> December, there was a continual cry from Fianna Fáil, including some people who should know better, about the complete failure of the Government to reach the target of 25,000 houses.  When we reached it they argued at once, &ldquo;We had the ground work laid but you will not do it again&rdquo;.  Though it was untrue to say the ground work was laid, it was true to say that sites had been acquired and that in many cases plans for the erection of houses and contracts had been made but had not been proceeded with because there was not the money to do so.  Because of that they might reasonably say: &ldquo;Well, the first year you got 25,000&rdquo;, but they did not say it was a tremendous increase on what they wanted to do.  The second year came along, and right through that year from July to the end of the year again and again and again in this House and outside it, not alone members of the Fianna Fáil Party but people engaged in the building industry, or not exactly engaged in it, but some of the people at the top of the organisations kept repeating that we could not build the houses, there was not enough money.  When we built, not 25,000, but 26,636, they then said &mdash;and it shows how damn stupid people can be&mdash;that we fiddled the figures.  The statistics which we used were the same statistics which had been used year after year in the previous ten years by Fianna Fáil, and they are the only way in which houses can be counted.  That is (1) houses on which a final grant has been paid or houses which have been certified as being completed if they are not eligible for the grants and (2) the local authority certifying that they have completed the houses and handed them over to tenants.  They are there for anyone to count them and anybody who takes the trouble of going around from one local authority to another can without any difficulty check on the number of houses and find that the figures are as I gave them.  It may be all right for politicians to bring housing within the realm of politics but it is very dishonest for those who, though not politicians, speak on this issue for none other than a political reason.  The facts are <Col N="1298" /> that during our second year in office the number of houses built was 26,636 and for the next year, or that just passed, although we were told that the number would fall flat compared with previous years we built 25,992 houses or eight short of 26,000.</P>
    <P>In reply to this a Deputy on the other side of the House said that this figure was a reduction on that for the previous year.  There was a reduction of slightly more than 600 but we exceeded our 25,000 target.  As I have said here before, Fianna Fáil estimated that in the mid-seventies between 14,000 and 15,000 houses would be required and as late as 1969-70 they promised to make the necessary provision for this unless outside affairs resulted in changed circumstances. That was at a time when houses were costing a lot less to build than they are costing now.  All I ask of the Opposition is fair play.  During their terms of office I considered many things they did to be dreadful but in some respects I lauded them for what they did.  However, I have yet to hear anybody over there admitting that we have done anything well.  I consider that a very poor outlook in so far is they are concerned.</P>
    <P>I have been criticised, too in respect of the increase in local authority housing from 4,400 in 1972-73 to 8,700 last year.  Within the past couple of days a representative of the building industry federation was reported in the newspapers as differentiating between local authority and other houses.  So far as I am concerned a local authority dwelling is a house, too.  I might add that local authority houses being built now are a good deal better than some of the houses built down through the years by some of the said builders.  I am aware that at the time of the so-called guaranteed order cheaper type houses were being built by the local authorities on the instructions of the then Ministers for Finance and Local Government and that the standard then was deplorable. I am not blaming either of the then Ministers in regard to the question of central heating because at that time oil was cheap and it was assumed that it would continue to be cheap.  However <Col N="1299" /> it is easy with hindsight to see that they were wrong but I could not guarantee that if I had been in office then I would not have been tempted to do likewise.  However, apart from the heating question, everything else about those houses was wrong and there is no point in laying the blame on the people who worked on the houses, to blame the contractors or the designers because these people worked in accordance with specifications supplied to them and they were told that there was no point in building houses to last 50 or 60 years but to aim at something which would have a life span of from 25 to 30 years.  We know that because of the design decided on many of these houses will not last half that time and that after they had been occupied for 12 months they cost nearly as much to repair as they had cost to build.  That is a scandal that Fianna Fáil must bear for the rest of time.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this whole question has been resolved and in this regard I pay tribute to the members of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour as well as others at local authority level who accepted the standards I suggested in regard to open space, back entrances, fire places, retaining walls and so on.  Without their co-operation it would not have been possible to achieve these improvements.  If there is anybody who wishes to differentiate between local authority and private houses I suggest that he examines the local authority houses being built now so that he may see for himself the improvements that have been achieved.  These houses are ones in which anybody would be proud to live.</P>
    <P>I noted in the <i>Evening Herald</i> recently that a Fianna Fáil member of Dublin Corporation tabled a question which he succeeded in having published and which suggested that he was responsible for the introduction of the senior citizens' homes that are included in the local authority housing schemes.  I would remind the House of the number of old people who were living alone in very bad conditions and whose only escape was to go into the local county homes.  I <Col N="1300" /> might add here that during the term of office of the previous Government and since we came to power the county homes have been revolutionised so that they are now very comfortable, but they are costing a lot to maintain.  It was my opinion that it would be much better to provide a proportion of local authority dwellings for some of those people and I suggested that in each scheme an effort should be made to allocate about 10 per cent of the dwellings for those who are capable of living on their own.  This has been done so that now we have those old people living among the younger generations and not only do the older people receive assistance from the younger ones but they can devote their time to teaching the children a way of life which may have been forgotten by the children's parents.  The arrangement is working very well.  Here again I congratulate the elected representatives of local authorities and the officials who helped in this work.</P>
    <P>Regarding housing generally, it is my hope that our target of 25,000 houses will be reached again in 1976. The money is available and so is the expertise.  Recently I met a representative of the Construction Industry Federation and he told me that the federation are doing well and are confident for the future.  It is worth considering that by the time this Government will have been in office for four years we will have completed more than 100,000 new houses.  Let us compare this with the expressed hope of Fianna Fáil to build between 14,000 and 15,000 houses each year in the seventies and to increase this, perhaps, to 17,000 or 18,000 in the mid-eighties.  These are the people who tell me that I am not building enough houses and that there is something wrong with the industry.  I believe in calling a spade a spade: there are sections of the building industry that are not doing well.  We are not building hotels but everybody knows that the reason for this is that the existing ones are not being filled. Nor are we building as many factories or office blocks and this has an affect on the overall employment in the building industry.  But for an <Col N="1301" /> Opposition Deputy to say I am responsible for the fact that the housing section of the building industry is doing badly when we are building almost twice as many houses per year as the average of the previous three or four years with Fianna Fáil is mischievous or those who make such statements do not know.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with two other matters which concern my Department&mdash;sanitary services and roads. Previous Governments, including previous Coalition Governments, did not seem to understand that sanitary services were so important.  They did not seem to understand that if money was not made available for sanitary services industry and housing could not continue.  They did not seem to understand that there was little use talking about the environment or improving the waters of our country if we did not make provision for dealing with the effluent from the towns, the villages and from agriculture. The result was that although this year I have 130 per cent more money allocated than my predecessor had the last year he was in office it is only a drop in the ocean.  This year I could spend another £30 million but I have not got the money and, under present circumstances, it would be unfair to increase income tax substantially to raise this money.  I do not think I would be justified in asking the Government for that money.  We have to cut our cloth according to our measure.</P>
    <P>I have heard a lot of criticism from Dublin Deputies about sanitary services and for this reason it is only right that I should point out that Dublin received 30 per cent of the money allocated for this purpose. Dublin county and city are entitled to that amount of money but it is unfair of those who know they are entitled to it and who know the circumstances to blame me for the fact that my predecessors over the last ten years were not as active in trying to get money for sanitary services. Had they been as active we would not have run into the difficulty we are in now.  We require a lot more money but we have not got it and we will have <Col N="1302" /> to wait until it will be possible to raise it.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear people talking about local authority housing in Dublin.  I am a country man but, having travelled around the country and seen the standard, I believe it was wrong that we should have a situation where in a country district a newly wed could be allocated a local authority house while 5,000 families in Dublin city had to go on a waiting list.  In some cases families had to live four to a room. Thousands more could not get on the waiting list until the change took place in the points system because Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council felt there was no point putting them on it because there was little hope of rehousing them.  This year I put 40 per cent of all the local authority housing capital into Dublin.  Some people will say it was terrible to do that and will ask me what will happen to the rest of the country but the greatest need is in Dublin and we must tackle it. I have allocated £23 million to Dublin this year for local authority housing.  I wish those who have been criticising me, even since the money was allocated, would accept that an effort is being made, irrespective of who is making it.  It is possible that when they have another look at the situation they will have a change of heart.</P>
    <P>On the question of roads I should like to remind the House that I represented farm workers and local authority employees for many years.  I know practically every road worker by his first name and he knows me by my first name.  I am proud of the fact that I was responsible for introducing the five-day week for road workers&mdash;this was done through a Labour Court case on 4th July, 1961 &mdash;and I was also responsible for the reduction in working hours from 48 hours to 45 hours to 42½ hours to 40 hours.  These things have meant improvements for such workers over the years but, nevertheless, Opposition Members have said that I was deliberately creating a situation which would leave road workers off work. They are codding themselves; they are <Col N="1303" /> not codding me because I have too high a regard for those people who go out in all weathers and do a good job although some people do not appreciate it.</P>
    <P>I have given instructions that where there was an ongoing job on a national primary or national secondary road it should be continued.  I have given instructions that where there were contracts entered into they should be honoured.  I have given instructions that work should continue on anything on which it was necessary to spend money to make roads or bridges safe and that all money required for national primary and secondary roads maintenance should be provided.  Having provided that I divided the remainder between all the local authorities and told them: there is a block grant for you; you are the experts and you know where it can be best spent so spend it there.  The only thing I asked was that as far as possible it should be spent where men are employed.  I want to see men employed throughout the year on this work.  I do not want big machines brought in to do a job in three months that would take a group of men with smaller machines, or without machines, six months, although it would not be done any cheaper.  That is false economy because we can wait for the extra three months.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputies at Question Time one would get the impression that I deliberately set out to leave hundreds of road workers in every county off.  One would get the impression that at least 500 road workers were being laid off in every county although most counties do not have anything like that number employed altogether. Many Members have overlooked the fact that as far as main roads grants are concerned when it comes to a question of priority it is not so important that such works should continue if other important things are left out, particularly if people lose employment as a result.</P>
    <P>A lot of people do not seem to understand that if there is a national primary job to be done and in the region of £500,000 allocated for it <Col N="1304" /> that when that job is finished the local authority does not get that money again but for the next job in line.  Some members of local authorities, and Deputies, seem to imagine that if money is given one year it should be given every year.  If these people want to know if they are getting more money for employment on roads this year as compared with last year they should leave out the question of the new roads and ascertain how much money is being spent in the country then.  If they do so they will find that in all cases they got more money this year than last year and that more people will be kept in employment throughout the year.  It is my job to ensure that this job is carried out.</P>
    <P>On the question of rates I should like to state that over a long period a survey has been carried out to find out what we should do about rates and if we could have another form of local taxation to raise money. When we took office the National Coalition included in their programme a commitment to review the rating system.  We promised to take health and housing off the rates. We said we would attempt to find a way to meet local taxation.  We took health and housing off the rates.  Let me repeat, there is at least an average of £4 in the pound less being paid by ratepayers in towns, cities and country&mdash;that includes farmers&mdash; than would be paid if Fianna Fáil were in power.</P>
    <P>Before the election Fianna Fáil said if they got in they intended to do away with rates on dwellinghouses. They did not cost it because they could not have done so in that short period.  From the costing I have done, I discovered that it would cost a great deal more than we are suggesting. Let us check and find out what Fianna Fáil really meant and how it affects the budget.  In a White Paper published in December, 1972, by Fianna Fáil, after years of deliberation, they decided there would be no relief for ratepayers.  They gave vague promises of studies to be carried out but there was no reference to derating of domestic premises <Col N="1305" /> and no relief from health or housing charges.  In February, 1973, two months later, they promised to derate domestic premises but gave no indication of how the money could be found to do this.  In 1975 relief of domestic premises cost about £45 million.  In the Fianna Fáil election manifesto no reference was made to derating domestic premises. If they intended to do it, that was the place for it.</P>
    <P>One Deputy&mdash;I do not want to name him&mdash;got about 200,000 leaflets printed pointing out how stupid the Coalition were to suggest that that could be done.  I am told he nearly fainted when he saw in the newspapers that Fianna Fáil had decided to do away with rates on houses. He had a big bonfire.  Those are the facts and it is ridiculous that Fianna Fáil should castigate us about rates and say we should have done something about them in the budget.</P>
    <P>In my view the present Government did very well in this budget because, apart from taking health and housing off the rates, they also made provision for malicious injury claims.  This meant that in North Tipperary, for example, there would have been an extra £2 in the pound on the rates because of malicious injury claims but for the fact that the Government stepped in to meet damages caused by explosions and so on as a result of troubles in the North. Yet Deputies stand up in the Opposition benches and say &ldquo;We would do more&rdquo;.  If they could do more, was it not extraordinary that in 16 years of unbroken rule all the wonderful things they now say they can do were not even thought of or referred to?</P>
    <P>Recently they criticised us over the farmers' dole.  They said it was a scandal in certain areas.  It was and we made certain provisions to ensure that it would stop.  What is happening now? A few days ago I heard some Deputies saying that we were a very unfair Government because of what we were doing to farmers on the dole.  Wanting to have your cake and eat it is childish.</P>
    <P>In view of the serious economic situation, this was a very good budget. I represent more of the people who drive in and out of this city to work <Col N="1306" /> than anybody else.  For years I have been asking for something to be done for them.  Previously the employers could get away with this through income tax but the workers could not. We stopped the employers getting this benefit.  From talking to a number of workers I learned that they are now getting travelling allowances, because of trade union negotiations.  People who feel they still have a grievance are not quite correct.  While we would all like to see an easier budget and see things better than they are, at the same time the Government did a good job in very bad circumstances and Fianna Fáil should be the last people in the world to condemn us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I resist the invitation to comment on the Minister for Local Government's contribution.  I do not intend to pursue the matter beyond saying that if he is the fair-minded man he professes he will have to accept one thing which is very basic to this budget. When the Fianna Fáil Government, which he dismisses so lightly, left office, or were about to leave office, the condition of the economy was such that the Coalition were able to promise the people that there would be no increase in prices.  They are, supposedly, very talented men.  They can boast of economists who, on paper at least and academically, are far above the type you would find in an ordinary party like Fianna Fáil.  The two elements are there&mdash;they are very honest men, in their own rating, and talented economists.</P>
      <P>In their statement to the nation, having looked at the situation and surveyed the economic condition of the country, it was possible for them to promise the people that if they were returned to Government there would be no increases in prices.  In other words, prices would be stabilished.  That promise was made in 1973.  Their excuse for the distortions and disruptions which occurred was the oil crisis. But what happened later.  We accept that that would have upset their calculations, but how do they relate that to the conditions obtaining immediately prior to their taking office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his budget speech it is obvious that the Minister for Finance reflects <Col N="1307" /> the economic quagmire and shambles into which this country has tumbled &mdash;in part, admittedly because of world conditions, but not <i>in toto.</i> My belief is it was caused to a greater extent by the tandem Government who were returned to office in 1973.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech is a series of contradictions reflecting nothing but the great progress that has occurred. The Minister in his own inimitable and sanctimonious style likened himself to the cleric preaching against sin to an audience not interested.  The Minister was quite presumptious in saying that; he certainly was not speaking for my reaction to a cleric speaking against sin, I am always interested. I admit that my interest is conditioned by the respect in which I hold the same cleric, by the example which he may be giving.  If the position were such that the cleric was practising the sin about which he was preaching and which he was exorting me to avoid then my interest would be diluted.  I would become uneasy and anxious for the termination of his sermon.  That is how I listened to the Minister for Finance.  He was preaching about the sins of which he himself had been guilty from the first day he took office; preaching about sins of public expenditure while at the same time there is no greater example of excesses in that regard than the Minister; preaching about the horrors of rising prices and at the same time introducing legislation which by its very nature could not but accelerate the increases already obtaining.</P>
    <P>I would take slight issue with the Minister for Local Government here. My interest is not in Fianna Fáil primarily; I am here because I have an interest in the country and by using whatever ability I have to assess where I can make a contribution, I find myself in the Fianna Fáil Party because I see them as a party who by record and objective cater more for my aspirations, personal and otherwise, than any other political party.  I see them as the party who from their inception have done more in Government for the people than any other Government.  If I thought they were <Col N="1308" /> not that type of party I would not be in the party.  I do not accept, or react kindly to suggestions that members of this party are here for the purpose that the Taoiseach would claim attaches, or the interpretation which he attaches, or has attached in the past to being in Government&mdash;getting hands on the loot.  I am not interested in having hands on any loot nor do I accept that as a fair assessment of what government is about.  When the Minister for Finance presumes to liken himself, as he did, to a cleric I think he or his script-writer should have researched more deeply as to how appropriate the analogy is and also as to what the reaction to it might be.</P>
    <P>We have a Minister practising all the economic vices and at the same time endeavouring to preach economic virtue.  In his budget speech, as reported in the Official Report he spoke about economic growth being thwarted by excessive income increases. He said:</P>
    <P>Economic policy for 1976, if it is to be soundly based, must meet three vital requirements.  First. it must reduce our excessive rate of price inflation.  Second, it must, within taxation and borrowing resources available and the limited opportunities for growth, give a high priority to safeguarding employment.  It must finally, limit the growth of public expenditure, the expansion of which has been such a feature of recent years.</P>
    <P>The Minister claims that is a sound basis for economic policy.  He speaks later about how important it is to keep down incomes at home so that we can manufacture goods which can be sold competitively on world markets. I accept the economic basis of what he said and if I were preaching the need for such restraint I would not simultaneously introduce in a budget measures which by their nature, and having regard to tradition in this country, mean that you cannot get agreement on stabilising incomes.  If the Minister does not know that, his Labour colleagues will tell him that over the years&mdash;this happened under Fianna Fáil Government and they were able to cope with it&mdash;the basis <Col N="1309" /> for the submission of applications for increases in income was related to the cost of living.  If the Minister does not see the price of petrol, of the pint, of the &ldquo;half&rdquo;, of school transport, of clothing, of shoes, the price of every commodity that people must buy if they attempt to maintain their standard of living, as elements in a case presented for an increase in wages or salaries he should not be where he is. He should resign or his Taoiseach should ask him to resign and he should be replaced by somebody who will recognise what is necessary and take the appropriate measures.  How can one appeal to people to do one thing while at the same time one is making it impossible for them to do that?  If the Minister has a solution he is unique.  He is doing something unheard of here or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased during the week, while looking at a television programme, to hear the former governor of the Central Bank re-echo what the Tánaiste said the previous week: that if the Government wanted anything they wanted a plan and they wanted action.  Mr. Ken Whitaker said that is what we want.  The Tánaiste said that is what we want.  The Minister for Finance has said that it is being chartered.  Deputy Bruton, who is Parliamentary Secretary to two Ministers, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, a very important Minister, and the Minister for Education, spoke last Thursday.  I thought it rather strange that he said twice he spoke as an ordinary Deputy.  It is extraordinary that he should come in here on a budget speech and contravene the wishes of the Chair in relation to repetition and say that he was speaking only as a Deputy.  This is an indication to me that the Government are not a Government in its true sense. There is no collective responsibility. They have not prepared themselves to deal with what comes, whether it is good or ill.</P>
    <P>I realise that what Deputy Bruton was doing, what other Deputies on the other side have been doing and indeed what the Minister for Local Government endeavoured to do&mdash;he <Col N="1310" /> did not mention the world budget until almost the end of his speech&mdash;was to disassociate themselves from the quagmire in which they find themselves. That is not very good <i>esprit de corps</i> and is not how a Government should behave.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government I was a backbencher for a long time.  There were times when certain measures were contained in budgets which did not appeal to me and which would not be beneficial to me in my constituency, but having had the opportunity of making my case at parliamentary meetings during the year and making my contribution when the budget came in I stood by it and so did every other backbencher.  We did not run away and hide.</P>
    <P>There is a big difference this year to the reaction to the first budget introduced by the Coalition Government, which was possible because of the thrift and the good administration of their predecessors.  In that budget money was dished out in all areas. Backbenchers were queueing up to associate themselves with the distribution of the loot.  The benches over there have been very lonely looking since the Minister for Finance introduced this year's budget.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier on to the need for a plan.  In relation to the Irish language I was very happy that a man of Mr. Whitaker's standing, while discussing economic matters, should refer to the importance of the Irish language in cementing the people of Ireland together to realise there were hard times ahead and if they were to be tackled they must be tackled by everybody together, each person realising that it would be necessary for him or her to forego certain things so that somebody else might benefit.  The Coalition Government seem to be concerned about nobody but themselves. Each member of the Government is preaching his own gospel and catering for the ephemeral advantage, eat, drink and be merry, and having no regard for the long term.  The tradition of their Government is that you get it for three years, you get what you can out of it, get out and Fianna Fáil will take up the slack.  They have <Col N="1311" /> done it on two occasions before and we can rely on them to do it again. What else other than that attitude explains the position in which we find ourselves when everybody on the benches on the other side realises the condition the country is in and the Minister for Finance, followed by other Ministers, tells us that everything is marvellous?</P>
    <P>When I look for proof of good government I look to my constituency and I look to see how the people are managing. That is not the way with this Government.  There can never be progress until they realise that they are in this together.  Major economies are forever mindful of the need for a plan and the need for updating data. Such countries can then conserve limited resources.  We are in a worse position than most other countries. The Government decided, instead of assembling data which would help us to get out of the stormy waters in which we find ourselves, to dispense with taking a census.  The current expenditure this year is £1,500 million and the semi-capital expenditure is £800 million.  Out of that total the Government could not afford £100 million for our census.  It has been said that this was political strategy on their part, that it was aimed at consolidating the restructuring of constituencies carried out by the Minister for Local Government.  There seems to be no other reason.  The Tánaiste is looking for a plan and is calling on somebody&mdash;I do not know if it is Fianna Fáil&mdash;to produce an economic plan for our future, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Education thinks one is necessary and one is being worked on and the Minister for Finance says one is being chartered.  How can one charter a course without up-to-date data?  How can I accept that the Minister is preaching virtue to me in the matter of economics, when all around me I have ample evidence that what he is preaching is sin.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about income increases and said that if we did not contain inflation and cut back on this, that and the other: &ldquo;These forces, if <Col N="1312" /> not arrested, could lead very rapidly to the public finances running completely out of control.&rdquo; They have done so.  They will not be brought back under any type of control by the attitude, the hesitation, the bungling, the shot-in-the-dark tactics of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I want to move now to a matter which is dear to me.  I have referred to it at every possible opportunity, with the indulgence of the Chair, since I came into this House in 1969. I am concerned about the employment of our resources.  I am concerned about a situation where current expenditure amounts to £1,500 million.  I want to indicate where I think this Government are failing a large section of the people in my constituency, and in every other Dublin constituency.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years it has become quite common to hear talk about human rights and human freedoms, and the rights and dignity of the individual.  Invariably that talk arises out of the incarceration of a person, or alleged brutality to a prisoner and matters of that kind.  I agree there must be a public outcry when that occurs.  Invariably when it occurs or when it is alleged to have occurred, the person in question has the right to engage legal expertise, or legal advice is provided for him so that he may prove he has been so abused.</P>
    <P>The citizen for whom I want to express concern has no such aid.  The only aid he or she has is given by Deputies of this House.  I refer to the little boys and girls who are attending our primary schools.  In his budget speech, as reported in the Official Report, the Minister talked about areas of necessity and tried to give the impression that he was providing for this area.  He said:</P>
    <P>Another area of necessity arises because numbers of teachers have increased by over 5 per cent to match the increase in the numbers of pupils.  The Government would like further to reduce pupil-teacher ratios but it is not yet possible to do so.</P>
    <P>There is an implication there that this has already been done.  I can <Col N="1313" /> speak with some experience and some authority about areas familiar to me. I can say categorically that since the Minister took office the ratio has disimproved. It has gone the other way. This year the Minister made an attempt to mend his ways in respect of education.  This year it appears he broke away from the influence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the other Ministers who are endeavouring, in their own words, to screw the Minister for Education. He is giving a little more now than he gave other years.</P>
    <P>In 1972, we were promised a school in Finglas South.  Because of lack of money it was not completed until last year.  There are 2,000 houses in a new area.  People could not qualify for one of those houses unless they had a family.  However paradoxical it may sound, the school was filled before it was opened.  The student-teacher ratio is 46:1 or 47:1. The Minister said they want to reduce that ratio.  The human rights which are fundamental to me are enshrined in our Constitution which says every child must be given primary education.  We will not have a good social or economic state until we guarantee equality in the matter of education, especially at the primary level.</P>
    <P>What equality is there for a young child who has been transplanted out to that area?  Quite a few of the parents are unemployed. They have not got the time or the ability to complement the education in the primary school.  Nevertheless, those children are expected to compete with all others.  We know, the Minister knows, the Department of Education know that, in some cases, the student-teacher ratio is 47:1 and there is no school at all for another 700 or 800 children.  They are sheperded out in double-decker buses to any other place into which they can be shoved so that it can be recorded that they are attending primary school.  They are attending them all right but it is absolutely impossible for them to have the <Col N="1314" /> benefits and advantages visualised in the primary school curriculum.  It is promised that the other school will be there when moneys are available.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government and his party told us that the seventies would be socialistic.  If that is the form of equality this Government and the Labour party want, if it represents the efforts they have made towards helping the workingclass child and if it is the extent of their interest in human rights, to say the least it is not my idea of what should be done.  I am not convinced by the Minister that moneys are not available for education because he is squandering £1,500 million but if he could assure me that this was the best he could do he would have my backing in reducing moneys at second and third level.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the children are depending on what they will get out of primary education.  Unfortunately, education is following on the prescribed course which does not necessarily reflect the student's ability or record the student's value in regard to the circumstances he must face.  It follows the old traditional course, where the child in the urban area must compete with those in more settled areas or with those of the better class, as it is called in common jargon.  In such circumstances how can such a child compete when he has to contend with all those disadvantages?</P>
    <P>Where are the 600 remedial teachers employed?  For me, education is the No. 1 priority.  Primary school education is provided for in our Constitution and all of us give vain professions of faith with regard to equality of opportunity.  I challenge the Minister for Finance to tell us how he can claim as he did at column 636 of the Official Report of 28th January, 1976, when speaking on education when he said:</P>
    <P>This generous disposition towards our youth will have to be reflected in a willingness to pay the cost or else our children will be the sufferers.</P>
    <P>Who is the Minister trying to convince? I am annoyed with him because <Col N="1315" /> I am concerned about the injustice being done to the children.  If the Minister can sit back and accept that position we cannot hope for any improvement in the appalling conditions obtaining in primary education, where we are perpetuating the disadvantages that exist.  Those disadvantages are obvious when one considers second- and third-level education and those who succeed in obtaining this education.  Less than 2 per cent come from the areas I have been talking about.  The parents are paying all the increases imposed in the budget by the Minister.  There is an obligation on me to remind him of the injustice being done to the children.</P>
    <P>With regard to how moneys might be saved, I have made a suggestion before and I repeat it now because since my original suggestion in 1969 it has been mentioned by one or two other people.  In the matter of third-level education we should consider a system of loans rather than grants. Today, education is not the traditional concept of a healthy mind in a healthy body.  To me it is something that has replaced the old capitalist system, that gurantees a person a certain income at a much higher level than that obtained by someone who is without what we call education.</P>
    <P>I do not see the justice of asking taxpayers who themselves have not been given a fair opportunity to aspire to such a goal to subsidise third-level education in this way.  Some years ago I discussed this with the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and I said I hoped he as a socialist would agree with me, an alleged conservative, that it was not fair we should ask the rest of the community to pay for third-level education.  I had said I did not see why the rest of the community should subsidise, without return, a teacher, a lawyer, a dentist, a doctor or a vet.  Some of us reached these positions perhaps because of an accident, perhaps because of certain circumstances deriving from the thrift of our parents, but most of us rather than showing gratitude to the rest of the community show ingratitude by making the services, that as graduates we <Col N="1316" /> are qualified to give, all the more expensive.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why one section of the community should be called on to subsidise the other in the field of education.  If third level education were not subsidised more money would be available for primary education. What I am suggesting is the introduction of a scheme of loans through which the children of the working class would be able to pay for the third level education and later repay the money advanced by the community.  Those who avail of primary education pay the cost.  The same applies to secondary education but that is not so in regard to third level education; they pay a fee but they do not pay the full cost.</P>
    <P>There are several other matters I should like to refer to but time does not permit it.  Today the Minister for Local Government seemed to be yearning for attention or praise and he expects magnanimity from this side.  That is a rare commodity in this House and no Minister should look for any special compliment for discharging his duties.  Indeed the same applies to any Deputy.  We are paid to do a job and as at any other level it is expected that we will do the job we are paid for.  Perhaps we would all do it a little better if periodically we were to receive a clap on the back.  Therefore, I do not think the Minister should be too discouraged because of the absence of continuing recognition for him from these benches.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the Minister for saying that when in Opposition the Leader of his party warned Deputies never to say or to do anything here or outside that would in any way harm the Government.  I do not have to travel too far back to get an example of members of the Labour Party, including the Minister, saying to our Minister for Finance that it was not their responsibility to do the Government's work.  They were steadfast in refusing to accept that there was anything commendable in any of our budgets.  If the Minister for Local Government now advocates a change in that, perhaps there should be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> Reference is made to housing and perhaps I should talk about his vocal Parliamentary Secretary.  The vocal Parliamentary Secretary who, I am afraid, is not at times a respecter of the truth, referred to houses built in a certain part of Dublin with only one door and he credited the Fianna Fáil Government with those houses. Now I happen to know a little about these houses because they are actually in my constituency.  There are 24 of them.  The contract was placed on 13th January, 1974.  That was when work commenced on these houses with only one door.  The Coalition Government were already one year in office at that stage.  I am not saying this is a major issue, but in referring to these houses and to the building of houses worthy of their occupants we have to accept that the only one door houses in the country that I know of were started on 13th January, 1974, and so the credit for these houses must go to the tandem Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government referred to social welfare and labour.  In the time at my disposal it will be difficult for me to say all I would like to say in regard to these two important areas.  First of all, as far as I am concerned, I would not give any social welfare benefits as of right.  Indeed, at some stage the Government might analyse for us this right to social welfare benefits.  There must be some limitation because, if there is not, and since we cannot get in respect of primary education the rights enshrined in our Constitution, I cannot see how it is possible to establish everybody has a right to social welfare.  If there is a right for one there is a right for all.  I certainly would not give money to any able-bodied man or woman without seeking in return some productive exercise. The Minister for Local Government wants us to indicate areas where such people could get employment.  There is no difficulty in suggesting such areas.  Let some of them be put building the school required out in my constituency and the schools required in other constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that, notwithstanding the very serious concern of the Minister and of the Government in regard to the phenomenal growth in public expenditure, there are still a great many areas in which we, the politicians on both sides of this House, have been notoriously remiss from the point of view of examination and taking decisions which might well be very unpopular but would be very much in the national interest.  In a small country like ours, with limited resources and limited taxable capacity, the urgency of an examination of every area of public expenditure cannot be over-emphasised.  Indeed such an examination should have taken place years ago and there is no reason now why we should not indulge in such an exercise in the national interest. I am convinced that in the areas of health, agriculture, social welfare and education, to take but a few, there is scope for rigorous examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not entirely convinced that in many areas of education we get what one might describe as the best cost-benefit to the nation as a whole as a result of public expenditure.  I have never been enamoured of the so-called free post-primary system of grants.  I believe that there could be a better system, a system which would <Col N="1320" /> be in the best interests of the schools and of the educational authorities, to say nothing of being in the best interests of the families concerned.  It may well be that families who could not find the money to meet their responsibilities in the matter of educating their children require help, but I believe the system could be recast with advantage.  The so-called free post-primary system was introduced by the late Donough O'Malley, a man of great idealism and egalitarian sensitivity.  It was brought in in a hurry and I do not think it was very well thought out.  One could have reservations about its real source of benefit, particularly to those families who need educational help.  Nobody ever envisaged that school transport would be costing the millions of pounds it now costs.  While school transport has been a godsend to education and a necessary social service, there should have been very careful examination of the expenditure involved with a view to recasting the system.</P>
    <P>It is fashionable to decry expenditure on social welfare.  I do not, but there are certain areas to which the expenditure could be more usefully devoted.  I do not, nor would any politician, begrudge giving a widow £11 per week to live on.  Even if that widow has a rates waiver, a medical card, the benefit of a subsidised fuel scheme, free electricity, subsidised television, it is little that we provide. Nevertheless there are areas where, in the national interest, we should examine the expenditure.</P>
    <P>To give an example, I earn £5,400 a year as a Dáil Deputy.  That is my sole income.  Should I also receive, as I do receive, children's allowances for my children?  If one wants to be egalitarian or if one wants to be selectively egalitarian&mdash;and there must be areas of selectivity in relation to it&mdash; one could ask why should a very wealthy or a moderately wealthy man or a very large farmer, businessman or a man with substantial professional income be given children's allowances which cost millions of pounds per annum when given across the board to everybody irrespective of means?  The Minister instituted a clawback system <Col N="1321" /> related to income in respect of children's allowances.  There were howls of indignation and the clawback was dropped.  I do not think this can be operated through the income tax system, because there are many people in agriculture, say, under £100 valuation, or other self-employed people who could have a substantial income but who would also get children's allowances and who would not be covered by the PAYE system.</P>
    <P>I have spoken very strongly on occasions in this House about the waste of money involved in the assistance scheme to small farmers, the rural dole.  That is an area in which there could be substantial savings and I am glad to say that in this budget there is provision for coming to grips with that problem.  In relation to virtually everything I have suggested, there is not a vote in it.  There is a lot of political flak to be faced in highlighting these problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I am not specifically relating this to farmers.  I am referring to various areas of expenditure.  I am not anti-farmer but I seriously suggest that there are areas in agriculture where millions of pounds were poured down the drain, for instance, on the bovine tuberculosis scheme.  It is currently a national scandal.  It would be interesting if the Committee of Public Accounts examined this and had in attendance not just accounting officers but some of the professional people who operated that scheme.  In regard to the intervention beef scheme I am convinced that there is a strong case for a public inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As a great deal of money was spent on establishing clearance areas and subsequently these areas once again became active, there should be an examination into the operation of the scheme.  I am not <Col N="1322" /> just talking of 1976, 1975 or any other year; I am talking about the past ten years.  Furthermore, I am not talking about £50,000 of £100,000 but millions of pounds of public expenditure. I am glad the Minister for Health has made a close examination of public expenditure on health.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This year we are spending the best part of £250 million on the health services.  There should be a very rigorous examination of this expenditure.  I do not believe that there could not be better expenditure having regard to the benefit to patients, doctors, nurses and others involved.  I am conscious of the need for a great deal of money for the administration of these services. Nevertheless, how many hospitals have trained managerial staff on the administrative side?  Admittedly, of the £250 million annual expenditure, £150 million or £160 million is for pay. There is not much one can do about that, but I have no doubt that under the general medical service the health boards could produce data to facilitate a review which would lead to substantial savings, perhaps millions of pounds, for instance, on the administration and dispensing of drugs.  To adopt that attitude is not to renege on one's social principles, and I claim to be a socialist, but insist that where you spend tax-payer's money it will be spent to the greater benefit of all concerned in every area of public administration. This is the fundamental principle: that there shall not be waste of scarce resources.  There should be an examination.  Our hospital system is a bit crazy, quite frankly.  I think it is very wasteful.  The degree of excessive admissions to hospitals in Ireland is extremely wasteful.  There are other <Col N="1323" /> areas of health expenditure crying out for money&mdash;for example, special day centres and residential centres for disturbed and abandoned children and so on.  Quite a number of them exist in the constituency which I represent and they could urgently do with money.  I have just mentioned a few in relation to social welfare.  One can mention a number in relation to health&mdash;Deputy Fitzgerald has gone&mdash; and there was in my view excessive expenditure on taxis in the health service.  Close examination of that has proved it to be so, and that is being resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must admit that there are quite a number of other areas which should have been subject to far greater public service grouping, far greater than a straightforward cost-benefit analysis of the real cost and of the real benefit to the nation.  As such, public expenditure would have been kept within what one would call rational and objective lines.  In relation to the recent budget I might add another one&mdash;and there are no votes in this.  For example, we put a few ferocious increases on petrol, road tax, drink and so on, but what about gambling?  I had a question down to the Minister for Finance last week asking him what the Exchequer yield would be on a 20 per cent increase in gambling tax, and he said it would be approximately an extra £1 million. I occasionally gamble, but I have not the slightest doubt that if anybody in this country has the view that the country has gone to the economic dogs, they can go along to the dogs and along to our race tracks and they would be ashamed almost at times to put down a £1.  There seems to be no shortage of money for gambling.  If one were to increase the taxation rates on-course and off-course, perhaps it would be said that there would be more evasion, that people would not pay the tax anyway.  My view is that in a situation where a Minister for Finance is constrained to seek extra revenue, that is one area this year where I do not think anybody would have been under great stress, and I think the extraction would not <Col N="1324" /> have been too painful if the tax had been increased on gambling.  That is a yield area, I was a bit surprised the Minister did not get round to.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the partial change of heart on the part of the Minister for Finance and other members of the Government in relation to economic planning.  Three years ago I made a speech in this House asking for remedial short-term planning.  I do not believe that economic planning, purely by putting out a Green Paper or final plan or anything like that is a panacea towards the effective management of the economy.  I do believe, as of now, that there is an urgent need to state clearly the medium, short and long term objectives of general budgetary and economic planning and strategy.  There is an urgent need for various inputs so that we can once again get off the plateau of inflation we are currently on and go ahead with economic and social progress.  I am quite convinced that that should be done rapidly this year, and it would not do any harm at all if there should be a great deal of urgency attached to this.</P>
    <P>As regards agriculture, I think that, as one who advocated the introduction of farm taxation in this country and fought very strenuously in this House for it, and who makes no bones or apology to anybody for holding the view that those with a substantial income in agriculture should contribute to the national Exchequer, I can put my views now in that context.  I am not so sure that the system which we have introduced is necessarily the best.  There is a case to be made for a review of it.</P>
    <P>I know there are only about 9,000 farmers out of 160,000 liable for income tax, and I suppose, the payment made by these farmers in 1975-76 is peanuts in terms of tax yield although the few hundred farmers who have to pay will scream holy hell about it. There is a need for refinement in the system with greater selectivity.  As a Labour Party backbencher, it was never my cry nor my intention to see any progressive farmer taxed excessively. Even those who are not progressive are not necessarily taxed excessively <Col N="1325" /> at the moment.  But I think that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Finance should perhaps meet the farmers' organisations again and thrash out a system.  I have the greatest regard for the president of the ICMSA.  Mr. O'Keeffe has always been very rational and calm in his approach.  Sitting down with men like that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a convention, Deputy, that, if it can be avoided the names of persons outside the House ought not be mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make the point that we should sit down with the spokesmen for the farmers' organisations. It would be an opportune time now, having seen the system in operation, to review it quite rapidly and to allay the fears of all in a situation where there are progressive young farmers, anxious to make an able contribution, and who are in a situation where at the moment agricultural prices are quite good.  I have little sympathy for those farmers who two years ago virtually threw away calves they could have held on to with a little bit of effort because they were getting £1 for them and it cost £2 for a vet to look at them, and now they will be charged £70.  They are now screaming holy hell, not having planned stock levels ahead and managed their business effectively. It is amazing how covetous people can be in the short-term.  There is a serious need for a review of farmer taxation. I do not believe that the taxation which has been introduced will be regretted. It is not going to be disastrous for the co-operatives concerned.  There are an awful lot of organisations, local, provincial and county-wise, masquerading under the guise of co-operatives, and the co-operative ideal in them was never very strong.  Some of them are not co-operatives in the true sense. They are trading concerns.  There is no reason why they should have the special advantage they have enjoyed over past decades.  I do not want to attack individuals, but I wonder what some of these co-operatives are doing. They do not keep proper records; they do not have their financial structures <Col N="1326" /> properly maintained.  That is not an attack on them.  This is a tradition that has grown up in terms of the finances of the co-operative system.  They will not find that the bringing of their organisations into the net would be unduly regretted, and I have no doubt that the system will work out all right.</P>
      <P>Getting back to the farm taxation, the Minister should meet the organisations, because in some respects we have fallen between a number of stools.  The yield has not been very much.  A great deal of unnecessary fear has been engendered.  The system has been very loose.  For example, the £100 evaluation the Minister referred to in his speech has been excessively loose.  The situation should be reviewed. These are my comments on the overall approach.</P>
      <P>I have three other points.  I stress to both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce the urgent need to introduce effective consumer protection legislation. It has a substantial bearing on inflation.  One would not relate it specifically to areas of legislation in relation to the financial statement by the Minister, but I am concerned about the continued absence of effective consumer protection legislation. The Minister for Industry and Commerce should this year put such legislation on the statute book, and it would be of great benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, the Minister for Finance should take a very rigorous look at one or two of the very questionable companies operating as consumer pyramid companies.  I am appalled at some of the reports I have received of people handing over money to such companies, the operation of which is most questionable.  I would stress to the public that before they invest their money in any company they should check its credentials with the utmost care.  There are no golden incomes to be received from such companies.  The public can be milked on the basis of short returns by one of what I would call those pyramid operators.  There are a couple of them in this country and they have taken people to the cleaners financially. There is need for the Minister for <Col N="1327" /> Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take a very close look at them.</P>
    <P>My final point is in relation to public service pay.  There is a good deal of what one would call downright reactionary nonsense talked about this.  One would imagine, listening to some public representatives both at Oireachtas level and local authority level, that because a public servant has a job which is secure and reasonably well superannuated, protection from the politicians in terms of security of his employment, a decent office to work in, or gets a car allowance so that he can drive to perform his public duties, and because he has protection for his widow, one would imagine that there was something obscene about this.  I would have thought, a Cheann Comhairle, that it is the ideal, and the aim and policy of this nation and every political party in it to ensure that everybody has these normal conditions of employment.  It sticks in my craw when I hear people saying &ldquo;Well, you know, haven't they got security of employment?  What the hell else do they want?&rdquo; People have security of employment, not as a concession or a peculiar, unique right, they have it because they are in that employment.</P>
    <P>It is the aim and objective of every political party that everybody in this country should enjoy precisely the same conditions of employment.  That is why in the private sector we insist that the ordinary manufacturing worker gets redundancy pay when he loses his job.  That is why we insist on income maintenance and social welfare, so that people do not come to a sudden catastrophic drop in their income. I find people petty, snivelling and narky in many cases in attacking what one would call the public servants on the basis that they have conditions of employment which it is almost inferred they should be damn grateful to have.  I do not see the logic of that approach.  For those outside the public service it is our job as politicians and the job of the trade union movement to ensure that there <Col N="1328" /> is parity of such employment right across the board.  If in private employment people have not total security it is the function of the trade union movement and the State to legislate in support to ensure that there is security of employment.  In the private sector many companies do not have decent occupational pension schemes, which are a great need.  I am pleased that my colleague Deputy Cluskey, the Parliamentary Secretary, is making strenuous efforts to introduce a national comprehensive system of private occupational schemes which would be comparable to that enjoyed in the public sector. It is our function to ensure that persons in the private sector have parity.</P>
    <P>It is arguable that if it were not for the public servants the decisions taken by the politicians on all sides would be worse.  It used be argued that while Fianna Fáil pretended to be running the country, they knew the civil servants were the ones who were discharging this task, but that the Coalition tried to run the country while the public servants thought they were the Government.  There was a certain irony in that because when one recalls at least the last ten years of Fianna Fáil rule one realises that, apart from occasional inputs by the Government of the day, the civil servants were running the country.</P>
    <P>Making that point and putting it in its proper context does not necessarily mean that any Minister of State must pander to any area of the public service.  In any Government Department or in any area of governmental activity&mdash;for instance, in the area of security&mdash;where there is a good Minister, one who is prepared to consider most carefully the advice given to him by civil servants in his Department and where that Minister is a man of independent judgement, knowing where he is going, both administratively and politically, there can be engendered enormous output and productivity so that much benefit from the Department concerned can accrue to the State as a whole.  If, on the other hand, a Minister were to disregard the normal courtesies and <Col N="1329" /> to attempt in any way to browbeat public servants the result might be a diminution of co-operation on the part of individuals.  For example, a person who might otherwise work extra hours to deal with a file might leave the file aside for an extra day or so and might eventually give a reply which, although perfect for the record, would not be of any benefit from the point of view of innovation.</P>
    <P>However, it may be argued, too, that we as politicians have not brought sufficient pressure to bear on the public service, on the many excellent individuals within the public service&mdash;not necessarily at senior level because seniority of itself is no guide to innovation or to imaginative ideas.  But I am convinced that a great sense of dynamism can be generated within the public sector if the politicians undertake their task in the right way.  Perhaps the public service has been excessively cautious but I am convinced that within many Departments there are some very interesting, valuable and necessary ideas and I would urge the individuals concerned not to hesitate to bring forward their views to the Ministers and the Parliamentary Secretaries concerned. I am convinced that any such ideas would be considered.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for the work he has done during the past three years.  He has had a particularly difficult time but he has weathered the storm well and I am convinced that in the near future when the economic upturn comes we will see the Minister show his true mettle.  It would be hard to surpass him in terms of the diligence and hard work that he has applied in respect of his contribution to the country.  Indeed, as a whole, the National Coalition have made good strides.</P>

      <P>This debate has followed a rather long drawn-out pattern. Instead of the subject being dealt with consecutively it has been dragged out on Thursdays for a number of weeks, not the most satisfactory method of integrating a debate of this nature or of making it effective.  But this is yet another indication, another step in the reduction of the effectiveness of this <Col N="1330" /> Parliament.  It is with a certain feeling of futility that one stands up to speak here now about general matters.  It used be different but one gets the impression now that the business is ordered so as to avoid giving Parliament the power of doing anything effective and that if discussion cannot be avoided completely it is proceeded with in a way that deprives it of continuity and force.</P>
      <P>The effects of this budget are being experienced severely already by the people.  It is a reflection on our procedure here that debate on it is confined to the tailend of the week and is dragged out interminably but this can be said of many debates here.  They are becoming almost futilities.</P>
      <P>Most of the facts and the majority of the arguments have already been advanced.  There does not seem to be much point in indulging in a long repetition of these.  I will take a somewhat different approach and I want to do it objectively because the matter is so serious.  I am anxious to see if there is a summary or perspective in this, particularly in regard to where the Government and the country are going.  While attempting to do this I am aware that some of us have been in this House long enough to have had experience of being in Government and in Opposition on more than one occasion.  That experience gives one an understanding of a Government's difficulties and a realisation that there are economic factors outside the control of this House or any Government in power which influence the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Little is to be gained by distortion or by being unreasonable in that matter.  I should like to preface my remarks by stating that I am aware that there has been an adverse economic climate which any Government since the end of 1973 would have had to face.  I am stressing this because I fear that the realisation of this fact only emphasises the validity of the indictment that can be made of the Government and their performance since 1973.  Everybody realises that an economic blizzard hit the world with the oil crisis at the end of 1973 and that there was a subsequent <Col N="1331" /> worldwide depression.  However, that fact, far from being a justification for what the Government have done or an extenuating circumstance to explain and exculpate them for what has happened, is the basis of the indictment.</P>
    <P>The Government came into office on the basis of an <i>ad hoc</i> or quickly organised election programme as preceded previous coalition Governments. They came in with preconceived and, in certain areas, doctrinaire approaches; but when they were faced with the winds of reality they were unable to trim their rigging or their sails to that wind.  The reason we are now in a worse position than other countries who had to face the same storm, and the reason for the present situation, viewed soberly, is because the Government did not react in a positive way to the crisis.  To say the least of it, that is disturbing.</P>
    <P>The reaction of the Government in their first year in office was to buy popularity at all costs and explain away the problems in the hope that they would blow away.  The popularity was bought, but the problems did not blow away.  The Government secured a certain amount of popularity during the past few years by that process, but in all sobriety I invite Government Deputies to wander among the ordinary people of our cities, towns and rural areas, and assess the trend of their popularity.  They will find that the incidence of taxation in the towns, the imposts on transport and the anxiety of the agricultural community will give them some measure by which to judge whether I am being extravagant or unreasonable in my statement.</P>
    <P>A tour of the shops yesterday would have proved interesting.  It would have been interesting to hear what customers had to say about the prices we had to pay this week and to hear their comments on the increase in prices directly due to the action of the Minister for Finance.  I am not too concerned about that but I am concerned that this trend is continuing without any counter alleviation. This is the result not so much of <Col N="1332" /> Government policy; it is the result of Government extravagant policy in regard to the procedures they have adopted to get money to be used as a palliative and a relief measure.  This is necessary because they have failed utterly to have a constructive policy to deal with the situation.  There are many differences in detail and procedure between us but the essence of the difference between the views of this side of the House and the Government is this, that we realise that in our present situation positive action is needed to stimulate economic activity, to provide employment and to take the measures necessary and that requires a programme or plan.</P>
    <P>I am led to make a comparison between the difference in the Government's approach to the problem and what we had in the past.  The former Coalition ran into certain difficulties. I will deal with this, the major point of my debate, later but I will anticipate it by saying this.  In 1956 there was a serious economic crisis.  In the long term it did not threaten or seem to be as intractable as the present situation.  It was left to Fianna Fáil when they returned to office in 1957, to correct that situation.  I am not unaware of the fact that one Coalition Minister, the late Deputy Sweetman, then Minister for Finance, in spite of the attitude of other members of his Government, made an effort to correct the situation and because of him the situation was not as bad as it might have been.</P>
    <P>Here we have a Coalition Minister who, instead of reacting responsibly and sensibly as that predecessor did, seems to be going further in the wrong direction.  The point I want to make is this.  The recovery in 1957 and the progress made in the sixties was not an accident.  It was due to positive Government policy.  When favourable opportunities offered we were in a position to exploit and avail of them.  That is the lesson to be learned here.  We would not have been in a position to recover or exploit our subsequent opportunities if we had not had plans.  The Fianna Fáil Government knew what they <Col N="1333" /> were doing.  They had definite thought-out, practical plans for economic expansion.</P>
    <P>One may say that the winds were favourable.  Yes, but the sails were hoisted and trimmed to get the maximum benefits of the winds.  The net result&mdash;everybody in history will judge&mdash;was one of increasing prosperity and progress for the country to an extent that could not have been envisaged years before.</P>
    <P>This Government are to be faulted because they have embarked on a campaign based on the shallow considerations of political popularity. They are not now in a position to do anything effective to cope with the situation because they do not have a coherent programme or policy which is necessary if we are to have a proper level of economic activity that will generate national wealth and enable us to prosper.  This is becoming an urgent problem not only in its own right but because other European States and countries all over the world are correcting their situations.  Even the British who have a very great influence on our economy are moving strongly to correct their economic situation.  We are not keeping station. This is very disturbing.</P>
    <P>The fundamental difference between Fianna Fáil and the Government is that the Government do not have a positive plan or programme to cope with the situation we have been facing for the past two years. Recent experience has shown that a programme is necessary and when we have such a programme it will be effective.  In my view that is not an unreasonable statement.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Ministers, quite rightly, point out the dangers and the difficulties we are facing.  The Minister for Finance is telling us that inflation must be controlled and wages must be controlled or modified.  He is making appeals all round.  Where can that get us when the Government do not have a plan and are doing nothing in that regard?  They are pleading for moderation in incomes while, at the same time, are showing extraordinary extravagance in the expenditure of the <Col N="1334" /> people's money.  Can you blame the man in the street for being a little cynical when he hears the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance&mdash;I know they are right&mdash;prophesying dire consequences and pointing out the dangers of inflation and the need for keeping the expansion of incomes under control?</P>
    <P>One can think of the man who is listening to that on the radio, or who is seeing the Taoiseach on television, or reading it and who then finds that when his wife goes out she discovers that the price of practically everything she has to buy has gone up because of what the Government are doing.  How can one expect him to listen with anything but cynicism when on going to the nearest garage he gets another little touch of what the Government are doing and have done?  We have to cope with basic psychology here.  One does not wish unreasonably to blame the Government for the difficulties; one can understand and sympathise with the efforts being made to ease the burden on people who are so hardly hit, such as the unemployed&mdash;incidentally it was Fianna Fáil who began that policy of thinking of such problems when they first got into office.  One knows that the Government cannot work miracles and that in the modern world, whether it is in government, at the top of the trade union movement or in management or anywhere else, there is such disorganisation and so little discipline that it is extremely difficult for leaders to be effective, but at the same time there is no excuse for not doing something constructive and at least having a plan.</P>
    <P>I spoke about the programme for economic expansion which was implemented by Fianna Fáil.  One of the executives most responsible for the staff work on that plan was interviewed this week on television.  I wish members of the Government heard this interview and took some of what was said to heart.  Nobody could accuse either the interviewer or the interviewee of the slightest trace of political bias or motivation.  If the Government had taken the same kind of attitude and adopted the same <Col N="1335" /> understanding approach we might have a different story today.  I emphasise again that the essential difference between us is that.</P>
    <P>Let us see how it worked out in fact and where we are going.  Despite all the brave promises made when Labour and Fine Gael for the third time in our history came into coalition in Government&mdash;they had a new name this time; in 1948 &ldquo;coalition&rdquo; was a dirty word to them; now they call themselves the National Coalition Government; it does not matter what they are called, they are the same mix&mdash; they have been in office for the past three years and what is the position? Government spending even having regard to inflation has been, in a certain sense, irresponsibly extravagant. The national debt in 1973 was a little over £1,300 million; at the end of last year it was nearly £2,400 million and it is fairly safe to say that the estimated debt at the moment is about £3,200 million.  The Minister for Finance has run the country into debt by the creation of a national debt out of all proportion to what his predecessors had incurred.</P>
    <P>It is easy, and Government Deputies are good at this, to say to the man in the street : &ldquo;That is high finance; it will not affect you.  That is how the thing works&rdquo;.  Certain factors can operate to justify some increase in the national debt under inflationery circumstances such as we have had.  But the rate at which the Government have been doing it is&mdash;to use a word I have often used before but I wish to keep within the limits of responsibility and so I use it again&mdash; disturbing.  In the last analysis it is the people who pay and already this week the people are getting a little indication of how much they must pay for our National Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>That is the debt situation.  Another interesting indication is found on the face of the Estimates for the Public Service.  Estimates are published every year setting out what the Minister will require in money in the coming year for the public services.  I take the total on the face of the book as a general indicator of trends.  In 1973 <Col N="1336" /> the total in the Book of Estimates was £585,142,000.  In 1974 that had gone up to £704,964,000.  Then there was the change over to the nine-months' period, which is not comparable, so we can come along to 1975. For 1975 the Book of Estimates shows a total of £1,093,259,000.  I have in my hand the Book of Estimates for the year ending 31st December, 1976, and this shows a total of £1,521,932,000.  If one puts that along with the trend of the national debt one will see the burden that is being put on the backs of the people, progressively year by year, by the Government.  I have given two small indicators.</P>
    <P>Inflation has kept pace with those figures.  It was 11 per cent in 1973, 17 per cent in 1974 and 21 per cent in 1975.  These are all indicators of Government spending.  They are spending, spending, spending.  It is not good enough for the Minister for Finance to come back and say : &ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo; He was very anxious to get there to do something. He is there and it is up to him to do something. We did our share when we were there.  The Fianna Fáil Government had a record.  They could not be indicted on that basis. The Minister need not give us a short answer: &ldquo;What will you cut? We have to give it for this, that and the other&rdquo;.  They have but why have they to spend money unproductively? Why have they to turn themselves into a charitable institution without having enough funds to maintain it? My answer is that it is through their own failure to do their job as a Government.</P>
    <P>We also have the further indicator that the budget deficit rose from £5½ million in 1972-73 to £10 million in 1973-74, to £92 million in 1974, for the nine-months' period, and to £259 million in 1975, so the deficits are going up.  The borrowing has also gone up.  Borrowing went up from £199 million in 1972, to £223 million in 1973, to £385 million in 1974, which was a nine-months' period, and to £733 million last year.  One has only to look at the current figures to see what is projected. <Col N="1337" /> Indicators of how the Government are handling the taxpayers' and the country's money are the Estimates, the index of inflation, the budget deficits and the borrowing. They all tell the one story and raise the one question: &ldquo;What are the people getting for it?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When one goes into the shops one sees what people are getting.  They are getting higher prices, a higher cost of living and a tendency to a reduction in the standard of living.  It does not stop at that.  There might be something to be said for spending if there were something on the other side.  If we had more people in employment, more economic activity, then there might be a different complexion on the story. One looks in vain for justification for Government spending in any of these areas.</P>
    <P>We have the extraordinary situation that under the Coalition Government unemployment has soared to 117,000, according to the last figures I saw, which is a very high, and, I would say in the long term, an unsupportable figure.  Not only have we this unemployment figure but we have the very disturbing social picture of young people coming out of school who should now be taking their places in society in useful activities, who are unable to find employment and be properly fitted into the social scheme. If this continues, apart from the hardship to them and their families, there is a very serious social problem being built up for the future.  A boy or girl who comes out into the world between 16 and 20 years of age, who has no opportunity open to him or her will, if that situation is not corrected, very largely through no fault of his or her own, be driven into the unemployable possibly but certainly ill-adjusted to fit into a social pattern.  By their spending, their borrowing, their seeking after popularity the Government have put people out of work and the rest of the community have to pay for their lack of policy.  This is the pattern of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>On top of that, we had the usual doctrinaire Left stuff which is not really constructive socialism at all.  We had this doctrinaire approach in talking <Col N="1338" /> about private enterprise and getting after the mythical rich and all that claptrap.  The result is that economic activity is stagnant.  There is money in the banks waiting to be borrowed, and which would be borrowed if people had confidence in the Government and in our economic future.  It would be borrowed and invested productively to get the wheels turning again and to get the work done.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary reflection on the Government to say that, with their spending and borrowing record, with their unemployment record, and so on, money is still available for development but, thanks to the Government's utter destruction of confidence, that money is not being availed of.  I am afraid these are the hard economic facts and they are causing a great deal of disturbance. The cynical popularity seeking policy of the Government succeeded quite well up to recently.  Unfortunately, the people who will have to bear the brunt of this policy and who will be saddled with the Government's failure at a later date will have no redress.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, it is with a certain amount of despondency one gets up to speak about these matters. Some of us who have been in the House for a long time, and who have been on both sides of the House, believe it or not, are inclined to sympathise with the Government on their problems and on the misrepresentations that can be made of them. We can sympthise greatly with any Government, any heads of trade union organisations, any managers, or anybody with administrative responsibility in these very difficult years in this very difficult age, when it is practically impossible to get co-ordinated action.  While realising all that, the Government cannot go on spending and borrowing to buy popularity, salving their conscience by preaching to the people, and failing to have some constructive approach to the problems.</P>
    <P>They should tackle the problems instead of trying to mitigate the results of the problems.  They got full support from this side of the House so far as <Col N="1339" /> mitigation goes.  If you rely merely on mitigation, in the long run you only aggravate the problems.  It is like giving a pain-killing drug to a person suffering from a painful disease, without dealing with the disease.  In the end, the pain-killing drug does more harm to the patient than good, even though it saves him a lot of discomfort in the meantime.  As well as giving the medicine necessary to keep the patient as comfortable as possible &mdash;nobody will quarrel with that approach&mdash;you must get at the root cause of the problem and deal with it.  The Government are failing to do that with the problem of what is called inflation.  Their borrowing and spending record, their employment record, their record in industrial activity is bad.</P>
    <P>One gets the feeling that the Government are literally biding their time in the hope of striking oil.  To pin one's faith on something like that is foolish. I will use the few minutes I have left to make a certain comparison.  Anybody who has seen the political progress of this country over the past 50 years must be disturbed at the trend of this Coalition.  I remember vividly the history of the first Coalition Government. They seemed to flourish for the first two years.  Things went well. Then problems blew up.  I remember how the cost of living and rising prices changed the tide of popularity against them.  In late 1949, in 1950 and in early 1951 the pressures grew.  Being a Coalition the Government burst up from inside.</P>
    <P>We will never defeat the Government here in the Lobbies.  We know that.  They will have more than the number we can muster.  That was also the position then.  When the pressures became too strong the Coalition could not take it and they burst up from inside.  The situation developed in the same way during the second Coalition. They got off to a flying start.  The legacy they left us in 1951 necessitated the 1952 budget, which was not popular. This can be said for it.  The action taken by the Fianna Fáil Government corrected the situation.  Then for the second time a Coalition Government took over with the country in good <Col N="1340" /> shape.  Their past mistakes had been corrected.  By 1956 the country was in difficulties again and the Coalition with it.  Their popularity waned again. Deputy Sweetman was one of the Minister's predecessors.  He was not very popular with many people on his own side of the House, particularly his Labour Party supporters.  When the crisis came in the autumn of 1956 he took positive action to try to cope with the situation.  We did not put them out but by the end of 1956, the pressures grew and the Coalition blew up.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were strong enough to handle the situation and they had the necessary experience.  Thanks to the late Deputy Lemass there was a clear economic policy and the know-how was already there in the civil service. We were very fortunate in having the personnel and one man in particular in the permanent service.  On that occasion he was more than just the right man in the right place The point I am making is that the opportunities were availed of by Fianna Fáil.  The Coalition broke up because of internal stresses.</P>
    <P>I am perturbed at what I see&mdash;not at the prospect of the Coalition breaking up again&mdash;but for what may happen to the country.  There is a grave situation with regard to unemployment and prices have escalated.  One need only go around to the shops and see the impact of VAT on the sale of cars, petrol and other items.</P>
    <P>The popularity of the Government is waning.  The pressures are there and already one can hear the murmurings.  There are other matters I have not mentioned, for instance, the performance of the Government with regard to equal pay and other problems.  It is a very disturbing thought that the damage already done could easily be compounded by a precipitate break-up and I fear this may come when one remembers the rumblings among some of the Minister's supporters in the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the Minister's approach with regard to the public service has been the fairest.  It is very easy to stimulate hostility to the public service and it can be popular for some purposes.  That is all wrong. <Col N="1341" /> The way the public service pay problem has been faced has lacked a certain sensitivity and consideration, to say the very least.  I have not the time now to expand on that matter.</P>
    <P>We have talked about the private sector when discussing other Bills.  I want to ask the Minister if it is his set policy to try to eliminate the professional man, the self-employed person. If it is, I should like the Minister to remember that that is going along a road which most people would not approve.  The impositions on the private sector and on the self-employed are disturbing; I would ask the Minister to examine whether he has not been unduly harsh and to reconsider proposals in regard to this matter.  I suppose this will not be the last occasion this year when we shall be discussing finance.  I should like the Minister to tell us that there will be no more budgets before next January&mdash;&mdash;</P>

At this time leadership that knows its own mind is an absolute and urgent necessity.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Deputy de Valera referred to the dispair and despondency permeating our economy.  We should cast our minds back to three years ago and see where the Government first failed to take the proper steps.  When they came into <Col N="1342" /> office the economy was moving along on an even keel but when the oil crisis arose it was obvious that the Cabinet did not fully realise what was happening in the western world and they failed to take any steps to rectify the situation.  At that time the economy was strong.  We had a steady increase of 3 per cent or 4 per cent in the GNP, we were balancing our budgets and moneys borrowed were always used for productive purposes to be channelled into the capital budgets.  That was the kind of economy the Government took over in 1973.</P>
      <P>There were certain pressures arising and obviously the Government should have seen them.  More especially, they should have been aware of the consequences to our economy of the oil crisis.  When that crisis erupted there was a certain movement of wealth from west to east but the Government did not realise it.  If we look at the public spending, especially on the current accounts, it is obvious the Government did not realise there was this shift of wealth.  Instead, they thought the economy would expand under such heavy pressures.</P>
      <P>The oil crisis was bound to have a downward effect on our economy and it is in this area that the Government made their first mistake.  They did not consider the effects on the economy with regard to unit costs and inflation generally.  They made no move to curb inflation although Fianna Fáil pointed out to the Minister on several occasions that if he did not take steps to curb the raging inflation our economy would suffer disastrously.</P>
      <P>When we left office we left a deficit budget of £5 million but after a short period of three years, the Minister has budgeted for a deficit of £327 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Deputy will recall that at the time of the withdrawal of the Irish contingent serving with the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East in May, 1974, the Government informed the United Nations Secretary-General that they would be happy, when present needs had passed, to send again an Irish contingent to the Middle East.  It was also made clear at the time that we regarded our commitment to the United Nations Emergency Force as a continuing one, even if for the present <Col N="1346" /> it was not possible to supply troops.  In view of this the Deputy may be assured that the possibility of our again supplying troops to the UN Emergency Force in the Middle East remains under active review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if his attention has been drawn to reports from the Irish Centre, Camden Town, London, that many Irish youths are arriving in that city without any means of support; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the latest report of The Irish Centre, Camden Town, London, which has appeared very recently, there was an increase of about one-sixth in the number of young people aged 25 and less coming to the centre's attention in 1975.  The number of young people under 18 years who sought the centre's assistance in 1975 was, I understand, 114 as compared with 98 in 1974.</P>
      <P>I would take this opportunity to advise such people very strongly, and indeed parents who have a major responsibility in the matter, that where young people leave home for Britain careful arrangements should always be made before departure from Ireland in regard to ensuring that employment and accommodation are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have dealt factually with this but his information is insufficient.  Is the Minister <Col N="1347" /> aware that youngsters of 14 years of age and under are going to London? Is he aware that the numbers are rising rapidly of people who are going over there without work?  I should like the Minister to quote from the end of the report of the Irish Centre. The Government must attack this problem properly instead of giving unctuous advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have taken important action in regard to this.  There is a repatriation scheme funded by the Department, there are Government grants to emigrant bureaux in Ireland which advise persons proposing to emigrate to Britain &mdash;about £5,000 per annum is given for this purpose.  The staff of the Embassy in London are available to give general assistance and advice. The Manpower Service of the Department of Labour assist in such matters as advertising among Irish emigrants in Britain job openings in Ireland. The Emigrant Resettlement Scheme provides very effective benefits for those returning permanently to Ireland from Britain.  We are examining the question of whether any additional assistance is required by way of the Department of Social Welfare to assist our service in London.  All these matters are being attended to but basically the issue is one which, given that we are a free country with free movement into and out of the country, must primarily be a matter for the parents of very young adolescents.</P>
      <P>I have no figures in respect of persons of the age of 14 and under&mdash;the figures I have relate to under 18 years &mdash;but it is of course possible that the Deputy may be right and that some Irish parents may be permitting children of that age to emigrate on their own.  If so, it is a blatant neglect of parental duties.  There is difficulty for the Government in interfering in the area of family relationships or with the free movement of people.  It is important, and Deputy Moore is quite right to raise this matter, that there should be general awareness of the dangers involved.  The Irish Centre, in its comments on the problems of young persons under 18 years said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> This group of young people are always a cause for concern and are a priority for accommodation in our hostels, because of their immaturity, lack of sophistication and personality difficulties which make them particularly vulnerable to exploitation by the unscrupulous....</P>
    <P>Many of these young people are emotionally pushed from home because of parental conflict, alcoholism, violence, failure to measure up academically, etc.  Others are lured by the glitter of life in London, by the promise of easy freedom uninhibited by parental control or social mores, by the idea that big money and work come easily, by the show of affluence of those who return home on holiday, and not infrequently return penniless to the Irish Centre looking for lodging, etc.</P>
    <P>This is a problem and it is one the Government cannot resolve unaided without the force of public opinion and without parents doing their duty in this matter which, I am afraid, not all parents do.  I think Deputy Moore rightly raised this matter and I am glad of the opportunity in reply to him to make some of these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Parents may or may not be remiss but the fact is we had 50,000 school leavers last year and there were no opportunities of employment for most of them.  I think the Government must step in first of all and provide these youngsters, if not with jobs, certainly with extended training.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore is right in saying this should be a priority and the fact is many more young people are continuing their education at present, partly for the bad reason of lack of employment opportunity and partly for good reasons.  It is important they should have the maximum education in preparation for employment here, or elsewhere in the case of the small number who emigrate.  During the last three years the statistical evidence <Col N="1349" /> is that there is no nett emigration to Britain.  Certainly some are going but as many are coming back. It is only in the last three years of this Government that nett emigration to Britain has come to an end.  This does not resolve the problem.  There is still a problem of young people.</P>

      <P>The equipment which was ordered over 12 months ago for the network of transmitters and micro wave links for the second television service is being delivered and installation work is proceeding.  RTE advised my Department recently that they are planning on the basis of starting experimental transmissions in the spring of 1977, and inaugurating the service proper in the following autumn. <Col N="1350" /> A little over £1 million has been paid out to date but the full capital cost of the network amounting to an estimated £4.1 million has been virtually committed.</P>
      <P>£1.930 million has been provided for in the 1976 capital estimates for the second network.</P>
      <P>In their statement of June, 1975, on television development in Ireland and the question of national choice RTE estimated that the extra licence fees necessary to finance RTE 2 would be £4.50 in 1977, £5.70 in 1978 and £7.10 from 1979 onwards.</P>
      <P>I understand that these estimated figures allowed for the annual costs arising from capital expenditure of £6.937 million at spring 1975 prices on extra production facilities for the second service.  RTE have now submitted revised estimates of costs of extra production facilities together with suggestions about how they might be financed.  These are being examined by my Department at present in consultation with RTE.  It will not be possible to give an up-to-date estimate of the operating costs of the new service until decisions are taken following completion of this examination.</P>

The great majority of these were in the Greater Dublin 01 area. Reliable figures of the number of lines affected and the duration of the interruption of service are not readily available for a number of reasons, the <Col N="1353" /> principal being that the same faults are frequently reported a number of times and numerous fault reports relate to transient or intermittent difficulties. The backlog of faults is still very considerable and the engineer-in-chief estimates it will be some weeks before the position is back to normal.</P>

Is he further aware that the company have indicated that they do not intend spending more money on developing their factory or modernising their plant, and that if they continue in Loughrea they do not intend to carry on in the spinning business?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I must refer the Deputy to the question he asked me. He asked me the steps I intend to take to prevent redundancy.  In this country we have the most extensive battery of aids to industry of any country in Europe, ranging from grants of every sort to management consultancy, export advice, and the availability of money from Fóir and other State agencies.  As well as being the most extensive battery of aids in Europe it is at the limit that is permitted in Europe.  In the light of the availability of that range, there is no useful intervention I can make in that instance.  I understand there have been contacts, and if there are specific proposals put to me about useful measures I can take, then I will certainly consider them.  In a market economy such as we live in it is neither the duty nor within the power of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to intervene in the internal affairs of given firms beyond the normal range of aids and the general support that is already made available and made freely available by agencies of my Department.</P>

The Deputy knows that in regard to the nurturing of new industry in Ireland we have made much greater progress in investment and money made available this year than we have ever done in the history of the State.  Of course it is a Minister's duty, but it is also the duty of the other social partners, including employers and trade unions, to look to the economic health of any given neighbourhood or firm.</P>

      <P>To answer Deputy Callanan first, Loughrea has a real case for special aid at this time for the reason that due to world economic circumstances two new projects which were secured two years ago for the area and which were an indication of its needs, were lost by reason of the decision of the principals of those firms not to go ahead.  Therefore, I consider it right that Loughrea which was deprived of that needed help is entitled to some special consideration and I will raise the matter again.  The IDA are well aware of the situation in Loughrea and are giving the question continuous attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I must refer the Deputy to the text of the question in which he asked the number of research vessels being used by my Department.  I do not know whether it would be desirable that the Department of Industry and Commerce should ever assume general responsibility for the whole area of science. The universities and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are much more natural users of vessels.  The Deputy is aware that in the Fisheries division there is the <i>Cú Feasa</i> and I understand there is approval for two further vessels.  Also, in UCG there are three research vessels so when I say there are none available to my Department I do not mean there is none in the country.  I cannot give a firm answer at the moment on the question of the vessels that were recommended by the NSC-OECD studies but I am seeking to implement the first part of that recommendation as an addition to the four vessels already in use.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>First, nothing in my answer suggested that and, secondly, it is directly contrary to the facts.  I have here a list which runs into four foolscap pages of the different institutions engaged in marine research and development in Ireland.  These are numerous and are attached to the universities and the different agencies of State.  To suggest that there is no interest or no expansion in this field is a travesty of the facts.</P>

      <P>I have regard for the Deputy's concern in this area but his supplementary is an indication of his irresponsibility in relation to finding out the facts and of his misleading attitude, whether consciously or otherwise, when he asks if the research is not merely in relation to fisheries.  Since he makes that inference it is only correct that I should record the different sections of marine research and development in Ireland.  They are oceanography, meteorology, environmental studies, botanic studies, zoological studies, fishery science as separate from botany and zoology, mariculture, geology, geophysics, petroleum studies and data processing.  To suggest that the effort is sufficient is untrue but I have been able to take some initiatives and we are moving consistently on the OECD recommendations. I am not suggesting that there is nearly enough effort but we must not distort the suggestion by saying that no effort is being made or that we are unaware of our responsibilities or that there are major areas in which there is no work being carried out.  The work is not sufficiently funded or staffed but it is good and serious research and I do not want it diminished in value in this House.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the information given to the Dáil over the past weeks that so many necessary articles are not manufactured in the State or are not available at a quality or price suitable to the purchaser, he has drawn these facts to the attention of the IDA with the hope of having the position rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>At the beginning of 1975 the Industrial Development Authority introduced a project identification scheme designed to identify investment opportunities for Irish industry in manufacturing products which are being imported into the country.</P>
      <P>In so far as Government purchases and purchases by State sponsored bodies are concerned arrangements have been made for supplying appropriate information to the IDA through my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While every effort is being made to stimulate the production of goods now being imported which can be made here competitively, it has to be recognised that in a small country there will necessarily be many products <Col N="1365" /> which cannot be made economically because the home market is too small to support efficient production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Having conducted this investigation and identification how is the information conveyed to the public or would-be investors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is done through the mechanism of the IDA and through the contacts the IDA have.  It is worth recording that since the unit commenced operations at the beginning of 1975 there are already eight new industrial projects agreed by the IDA. There are 30 other firm projects which are at various stages of negotiation with the potential manufacturers and there are 50 separate product investigations being carried out.  I am pleased with the level of response in a period of about 14 months.  It was a genuine lack and the figures I have given the House indicate that it is being responded to.  This lack was identified in the middle of 1974 before the current difficulties.  The mechanism is through the entire network of physical branch offices and of contacts, who have a knowledge of Irish industry, which the IDA possess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Strictly speaking, complaints of inability to obtain motor insurance cover at all or of inability to obtain it due to a prohibitive premium quotation are handled by the Department of Local Government.  Arising from his responsibility for road traffic legislation, under which motor insurance is compulsory, the Minister for Local Government has an arrangement with the motor insurance companies whereby a committee of insurers investigate individual complaints of inability to obtain motor insurance.  I understand that the number of complaints received in the Department of Local Government in 1975 was 189 compared with 282 in the previous year while the number was of the order of 600 in the year 1973.</P>
      <P>There has been a big improvement in the availability of motor insurance cover at reasonable prices since the two increases in basic rates authorised between August, 1974, and the beginning of this year.  The position is not yet satisfactory, and as I stated in a public announcement issued on my behalf in December last I intend making a new approach to the companies in the matter shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the situation is not entirely satisfactory although it has significantly improved. <Col N="1367" /> There are certain practices which hinder the existence of full competition in motor insurance.  These practices include the insistence of some companies on other non-life insurance from the motor client; the refusal of companies to take business from each other and the refusal of some companies to take certain categories of risk.  There is probably a need to have a look at the general operation of the undesirable risks agreement to see if it can be improved.  This is the general area in which I am hoping to take an initiative in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in the change-over and it could be said that most of the economy is now metric, in some sectors exclusively and in others on the basis that it is a freely available alternative to the imperial system.  We should have no difficulty in complying with the EEC Directive on Units of Measure which imposes the metric system from the end of 1977 with some extensions to end in 1979 and the possibility of some limited extensions after that.  A survey of industry in 1974 showed that 52 per cent of firms were then mainly metric, and a similar survey now in progress is showing a considerable advance on this.  The results will be published within the next two months or so. Apart from industry such areas as education, State purchasing, and the work of State and local authorities generally are mainly metric.  Distributors and consumers have had the benefit of a special committee for some years, and a great deal of promotional material made available which has had a considerable effect. Methods of helping the consumer in this are constantly under review.</P>

The Commissioners of Public Works have been asked to report whether this defect has arisen through lack of proper maintenance, in which instance its repair would be a charge on the ordinary maintenance grants paid to the board of management of the school, or if it is attributable to the use of faulty materials in the building of the school, in which instance a special grant might be made towards the cost of the remedial works required.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has no decision-making function in relation to the granting of assistance to firms in financial difficulties.  By virtue of section 4 of the Fóir Teoranta Act, 1972, this power is vested in the board of Fóir Teoranta.  Subsequent to my receiving a deputation last week about the firm referred to, I requested Fóir Teoranta, in the light of the representations made to me by the deputation, to reconsider the question of providing further financial assistance.  Having reviewed the case in the light of the statutory criteria governing assistance to firms in financial difficulties, Fóir Teoranta inform me that further assistance to the firm in question would not be warranted.  I understand, however, that negotiations are under way for the takeover of the firm as a going concern and that this represents the best means of ensuring its long-term viability and the job prospects of the workers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy has deliberately and wrongly said in his supplementary question that the Minister for Finance has a decision-making <Col N="1378" /> function in this matter.  He knows well the Minister has not, because his own Government brought in the Fóir Teoranta Act in 1972, which took away from the Minister any decision-making power in these matters.  It lies with the board of Fóir Teoranta and not with the Minister.</P>
      <P>The realities of the situation are, Sir, that Fóir Teoranta, in discharge of their functions, have decided that the firm in question do not qualify for support.  The reason why they have so decided is that they are not satisfied that the firm in question are capable of operating as a viable unit because of their existing liabilities.  To advance money in those circumstances would mean a total loss of public money and the non-preservation of jobs.  Negotiations are proceeding with an international organisation of good standing which manufactures and markets garments similar to those which have been manufactured in the factory in question and which the factory in question are quite capable of manufacturing. It is no fault of the workforce of the factory in question that they are in difficulties at present.  This is recognised by those who are now negotiating for a take-over.  The best way in which the future employment of the people in question can be guaranteed is by the factory being put into good hands and that matter, I am glad to say, is now proceeding in the right direction, and I think it would be unhelpful to the best interests of the workers if the matter was to be argued in the kind of way in which Deputy Molloy is trying to introduce in this House at this very delicate stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>My statement arises out of certain statements made yesterday in this House by Deputy Flor Crowley.  I should say that Deputy Crowley being in the precincts of the House this morning, I notified him in accordance with what I understand is the normal courtesy of the House that I intended to raise this question at this time here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flor Crowley in the course of a contribution in the debate on the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill yesterday referred to me as &ldquo;a former member of the Communist Party&rdquo;.  I immediately and categorically denied this allegation which you requested Deputy Crowley to withdraw.  I have in fact never been a member of the Communist Party or of any party other than the <Col N="1380" /> Irish Labour Party.  Under pressure from you to withdraw his remark Deputy Crowley said: &ldquo;If the Minister says that he disowns membership of the Irish Communist Party I accept that he has disowned it.&rdquo; You inquired whether this was a withdrawal, Sir, and when Deputy Crowley was silent you appeared to take this as implying a withdrawal.</P>
    <P>I am not of course in any way disputing your ruling that Deputy Crowley's remarks at this point were within the rules of order.  I have to be concerned, however, with the implications of the wording used by Deputy Crowley, in relation to his original statement and as affecting my reputation.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the words used by Deputy Crowley do not imply acceptance of the truth of my denial, but rather suggest the opposite, through the use of the word &ldquo;disown&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsequently Deputy Crowley took up the charge again in various forms, suggesting for example that I had attended a Communist Congress in Poland.  When I denied the allegation about a Communist Congress in Poland he repeated it, and referred to the heat of my denial as &ldquo;proof&rdquo;, as he said, of the allegation he made.</P>
    <P>It is my view, after listening to Deputy Crowley, and having read over the record of his remarks, that the Deputy continued to imply the truth of his original allegation, that I had been a Communist, implying also that my explicit denial was not a factual statement but simply a political &ldquo;disowner&rdquo; of a real past association, made to mislead the House and the public.</P>
    <P>This, I submit, is obviously defamatory.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy's remarks were privileged, I have no recourse except to the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and I therefore request you, Sir, to have Deputy Crowley's statement considered by that Committee.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Before lunch I was discussing the present situation of the economy. I said that a lot of the crisis arose when the present Government came into office.  They failed to realise at that time the serious economic situation the world was moving into.  They came to office making commitments on a 14-point plan without properly researching how they were to be financed.  We know the dangers of over-commitment, whether in business or our private lives. The present Government made these commitments on a 14-point plan, some of them extravagant commitments, especially in the economy in which we find ourselves.  They failed to look at the whole economic structure of the world and of this country at that time. They failed dismally to consider what the full consequences of the oil crisis would be.  Instead they looked at their commitments and said &ldquo;We are going to keep our commitments&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is something that might be justifiable in a strong economic unit, but it has been proved now that the decisions which they took, first as regards deficit budgeting and, secondly, certain types of policy which they adopted were wrong.  Our economic base was steadily expanding, and had been during the 1960s and into 1970. We were expanding our economic base, and that is what matters if we are to create employment.  What was urgently needed at that time, and indeed when Fianna Fáil was in office, was a continuation <Col N="1382" /> of foreign investment into industry, an encouragement of finance, irrespective of whether it was generated within our own economy or had to be borrowed from abroad.  I have never during my time in the Dáil criticised the borrowing that went into commercial or capital development.  Capital development is essential.  This country as regards its development, whether it be our roads, telephones, ports, is in urgent need of an injection of capital. The climate was set at that time, and it took a considerable length of time to get that climate established.  It started under Seán Lemass and Ken Whitaker, the man who left the Central Bank yesterday.  That proper climate was established in the 1960s and continued into the 1970s until we left office.</P>
    <P>The present Government failed first to look at the underlying problems, or some of the problems that were prevalent in Europe at that time. Secondly, trying to pursue a socialistic policy in an open economy such as ours was fatal.  They introduced Bills of a capital taxation nature, their second bad mistake.  These Bills, especially the Wealth Tax Bill, which we opposed, were not conducive to encouraging capital into this country. In the future if our economy is properly built up and our economic base properly strengthened with necessary finance, I would say there would be some justification for these capital taxations.  However, shortly after coming into office they set their minds as to how they could introduce this capital taxation package.  The amount of revenue accruing to the Exchequer from this entire package is infinitesimal in comparison with the total budget.</P>
    <P>But it is not the small amount of money coming into the Exchequer that is the big loss.  It is that it has undermined confidence, first in the private sector and has undermined confidence abroad as regards the inflow of capital.  In effect, that capital taxation brought very little revenue into the Exchequer this coming year. I have not got figures from the Minister for Finance, but I am sure the wealth tax will not account for £3 million to £4 million of the total <Col N="1383" /> current budget.  It inhibited the inflow of capital which was urgently needed to expand our economic base.  It encouraged the outflow of capital.  This has been denied by the Minister, but I am convinced that it encouraged the outflow of capital which could be utilised today.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it created a climate amongst business people that was alien and repugnant to their advancement. We see today that all confidence has been undermined in the private sector, and it is that sector that has suffered over the past three years.  We must concentrate our attention in the future on the private sector, for it is in this sector that we are going to get economic expansion. The public sector plays an important part as regards employment and very necessary it is, but if we want to get this country out of its present economic situation we will have to pay far more attention to the private sector. Over the past three years the private sector has been a target for undue taxation and we are reaping the results now.  How could we possibly hope to continue especially with our huge current deficit.  In 1972-73 there was a deficit on the current budget of £5 million. In the present year, to the end of 1976 on the Minister's figures our current deficit will be in the region of £327 million.  We know that will not be a real figure by 31st December next. Even if there is a pay pause&mdash;and I hope there will be&mdash;we know the underlying expenses which will arise on fuel, telephones and various other factors such as expenses underlying the last wage agreements which I believe have not been taken fully into consideration. All these underlying costs must show up before the end of this year and therefore the Minister's figure of £327 million is not realistic. It could easily be £450 million when all the expenses that will have to be met are taken into account.  This kind of current deficit is one of our chief problems.</P>
    <P>The Government should never have allowed the finances of the country to <Col N="1384" /> reach this appalling state.  We have a huge national debt; our tax base is diminishing while our expenditure is increasing.  Obviously, this trend cannot continue.  It could not continue in any business and much less where the Government are concerned and the day of reckoning must arrive.  To a great extent the day of reckoning has arrived when we see restrictions being placed by EEC countries on borrowing, spelling out what they will expect in the future.  Obviously, guidelines and restrictions will be laid down in regard to foreign borrowing in future and we will find that money spent in the past four years to the tune of about £650 million to finance current deficits&mdash;a large part of which should have gone into productive assets to generate wealth and create employment&mdash;has been misspent because of bad budgetary methods.</P>
    <P>When the upturn which has already taken place in some European countries and in America and Japan comes we will find ourselves in the position where opportunities will exist but we shall have no finances to avail of them. We have expanded our credit.  If we had built up a proper credit base abroad, when the economic upswing comes we could go to the European Bank or the World Bank and ask for £400 million or £500 million to invest in industry or to develop our ports or our mineral wealth.  Unfortunately, if the occasion should arise this year or next year we will be unable to get that kind of capital; we have increased our borrowing too much; that is the whole trouble.</P>
    <P>In 1973 our national debt was £1,298 million; by 31st December, 1976 the estimated national debt will have reached £3,200 million.  These are startling figures.  I would not mind if on the other side of the sheet we had investment to show for this money&mdash; that is what matters.  I do not say that all this expenditure has gone on current budgeting but a large part of it has and there is very little in the way of tangible assets for the astronomic rise from £1,298 million to £3,200 million. Where are the tangible assets within the economy?  There is a downturn in our industrial output which happened <Col N="1385" /> last year and there is every indication that it will continue this year for various reasons.  We have a continuing unemployment problem.  That is the situation we have reached after indulging in huge excessive borrowing.</P>
    <P>This is a situation about which we should all be concerned.  I am not concerned about the Government but about every human being in the country and about his or her standard of living in the next two or three years.  The Government failed to take unpopular decisions; they took wrong decisions. They made commitments which, to put it bluntly, the country could not afford. For years past we have been comparing standards with those of advanced European countries.  We are looking at the golden triangle where they have had wealth for the past 200 years, looking at the advanced economies of Germany and other countries and telling ourselves that we must have the same standards here.  But we must cut our cloth according to the measure.  We are living in Ireland and we can only get the standard of living that the wealth of this country can give.</P>
    <P>The Government failed to realise that sound budgetary policies would automatically dictate this.  They have failed to run the country exactly as a business should be run.  I could make some concession for a slight deficit in the current budget over the last six years but I could make no excuse for the Government having spent £678 million in the current budget over the past three years.  This is money which was not generated within the economy.  This is bound to have a detrimental effect on the private sector and on economic expansion.</P>
    <P>We had a capital taxation packet, which took almost 12 months to process through this House.  This was completely unnecessary at this time. No matter how socially undesirable it was the Government should have looked at the realities of the situation to see what the consequences would be of a capital taxation packet such as that introduced by the Minister for Finance.  It did nothing for the economy.  I would say it was justified if it had helped the Exchequer by £50 <Col N="1386" /> million to £60 million.  It will help the Exchequer very little.  It has completely demoralised confidence in the private sector.  Therefore, we will see the futility of the crazy taxation package of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Cabinet failed to grasp what the significance of the oil crisis would be.  It was quite obvious that there was a certain movement of wealth from the west to the east.  We know the eastern countries are expanding their economies, building their whole infrastructure and naturally doing it at the expense of the west.  Where else would the money come from? The Minister for Finance, as well as many people in the country, failed to grasp the significance of that.  I doubt if the west will ever be as wealthy again.  The Government did not seem to take that factor into consideration.</P>
    <P>The Government did not try to find out where they could cut down expenditure. They went in the opposite direction and increased expenditure, most of which came from the private sector.  There has been a downward trend, as we have seen, over the past three years.  Until we regain the competitiveness which we enjoyed we have no hope of expanding our economic base.  If our unit costs do not get into line we have lost the attractiveness for our manufactured goods which we enjoyed over the past ten years.</P>
    <P>During the past few years inflation has been running at between 20 to 25 per cent.  It was quite obvious during that time that we were losing our attractiveness in relation to our exports. The Government will have to consider doing something about that. I believe England are ahead of us. During the past 12 months England, to a certain degree, has controlled its expenditure by voluntary means. When the British people accepted a semi pay pause of around £6 that was the first step Britain took towards getting out of the economic chaos the country was in.  Britain has now enjoyed almost 12 months of this package, the £6 wages increase across the board.  That was a remarkable reduction <Col N="1387" /> from what the country experienced in the previous three years. This low wage increase is bound to show up to their advantage during the next two years.  It is bound to put their manufactured goods on a competitive basis again in relation to their exports to Europe and the world.</P>
    <P>We have not reached that stage yet. Our unit costs are still rising.  Unless we take some positive steps towards bringing this into a realistic line I believe there will be no attractiveness here for our products.  The majority of manufacturers are operating on a very low margin.  Any man with £500,000 would be very foolish if he invested it in a manufacturing industry. I am not saying this in order to frighten away capital from manufacturers but to impress on the Minister that unless something is done about increasing the profitability of the manufacturer and that it is recognised that profits are necessary if we want to expand our industrial base we cannot succeed.</P>
    <P>Unit costs have gone completely out of hand over the last three years.  The price of electricity has gone out of all proportion in ratio to the cost.  All these factors have had a detrimental effect on manufactured goods.  The Minister said he gave a concession to manufacturers in relation to the retention of stocks.  I believe it amounted to £7 million but I dispute that the Minister gave anything to manufacturers and business people generally as regards a help to taxation.  On paper it looks like it but the Minister is deceptive.</P>
    <P>I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare on several occasions about the pay-related benefit scheme.  I believe the Minister is getting £10 million too much a year from this scheme.  This fund has carried a surplus over the past two years.  The employers' contribution is 2 per cent which is a very substantial amount if a manufacturer is employing 200 or 300 people.  If the Minister was concerned this year to try to help manufacturers he should have looked at the pay-related benefit scheme and if it was in excess of the <Col N="1388" /> requirements he should have reviewed it immediately.  I believe if he did there would be a downward trend in contributions.</P>
    <P>The Minister could also have taken a look at the contributions.  We should all be concerned with the industrial arm, whether that be products from agriculture, our own mineral resources or raw materials which are imported. Our whole future lies in the manufacturing base to try to generate more employment. There was nothing in the budget to help this sector of the economy.  In fact there was nothing in the budget to rectify the economic situation at all.  It was an exercise in bookkeeping, as to how you could balance income against outgoings.  It contained nothing else apart from that.  Reading through the budget speech there is nothing tangible to show there will be an upturn in the economy.</P>
    <P>I wonder is the Minister aware of the circumstances of those people.  He knows the experience they had last year.  He is aware of the huge number of redundancies in this sector.  These redundancies took place for a reason. The units in which they were working were no longer viable and could not operate.  We will have to direct our attention towards this.  Last week I was in Edenderry and I saw advance factories lying idle.  Some time previously I saw advance factories lying idle in Ballinrobe.  I am not sure how many advance factories are closed throughout the country.  Money was either borrowed and given to the IDA, or generated at home.  This is capital which must be serviced.  Unless we succeed in getting people to occupy these advance factories, there is no hope of reducing the present unemployment level.</P>
    <P>Why are there no takers for these factories?  Last year the Industrial Credit Corporation had £4 million which they could not lend.  That is most unusual and very significant.  There is no shortage of money in the Associated Banks today.  If proper proposals are put forward, the Associated Banks are quite willing to help the industrial sector.  Why is no one looking for this money?  There must be a reason.  I know there is a world recession, but there must be other reasons.</P>

I would prefer to see the money the Associated Banks have being channelled into industry rather than capital being borrowed at a high rate from the European Community or other banks abroad.  These are factors we have not taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last December we had 110,000 or 112,000 people unemployed.  Our industrial output was gradually declining. I looked forward to something in the budget to rectify that situation, something which would charter the course ahead for the next two or three years.  I wondered what the Minister had in mind with regard to policy planning, and what our objectives were.  I thought he would set down guidelines as to how we would attain those objectives.  If we did not attain them, at least we would have objectives to work for.  In any business you must charter the course ahead for the year.  You must see what your wage bill will be, how much you can spend on overheads and decoration, and how much you can take out of it yourself. That is planning in a very miniature way.  I expected something from the Minister to show us exactly where we are going.  No guidelines are set down as to how the capital budget will be <Col N="1390" /> spent.  Are we to struggle on in a haphazard type of way with the industrial sector being weakened further?  Are we to have another huge current budget? That is where we will find ourselves at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>In the budget the Minister expects to get £67 million from beer, spirits and tobacco.  Next January the Minister has no hope of getting revenue from that sector.  Revised projections have been made by brewers and distillers. All good business organisations make their projections around the end of December for the coming year.  Projections have to be made because certain types of materials have to be ordered.  All these projections have been revised downwards by from 15 per cent to 25 per cent.  The motoring industry revised their projections for 1976.  They have to show their projections to companies manufacturing ancillary parts.  In the motoring industry there was a drop of from 17 per cent to 18 per cent over the past two years.  Their estimate is down by 15 per cent in 1976 as against 1975. These are the realities.</P>
    <P>We have to look at the distribution of money into the economy.  Last year in the public sector the flow from increased wages and salaries was something in the region of 40 per cent.  In the private sector it was about 25 per cent.  Despite those two factors, there was a slight drop in retail sales. There will not be the same flow of money in the coming year.  If the Minister is to get his desired pay pause is it not plain that there must be a drop in retail sales?  I cannot see how that can be avoided.  We must look at the reality of where the Minister went for taxation this year and how he hopes to achieve it.  He has reached the point of diminishing returns.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have foreseen this situation two or three years ago when he was running a deficit in the budget in those years of £92 million, £259 million and £327 million.  That is where the problem lies.  If he had stimulated the economy at that time he would have a wider tax base today but he failed to do that.  Now the tax base has been diminished and it will <Col N="1391" /> show up where those taxations are concerned.  So far as brewers, distillers and the motor trade are concerned, they have revised their projections and in some cases the reduction has been 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone through the income tax code in an effort to scrape the bottom of the barrel.  There must have been a considerable amount of money around when we left office. The economy was in a solvent state when the Government took over, but, unfortunately, all that money has now been exhausted.  The public service is being brought into line; Schedule D has been brought forward and every conceivable avenue of taxation has been explored.  Yet, in spite of all this we have a current budget of practically £350 million.</P>
    <P>Against this background we must view the economy and the serious state it is in.  It is obvious that tourism has suffered severely in the last five or six years; I am not saying that the fall-off in that industry has been the fault of the Government because I realise the Northern situation has contributed substantially in this area. However, the kind of tax now imposed on luxuries will not help the industry. I believe that the attraction of Spain or Portugal as holiday areas is lessening and we should try to capitalise on this.  In this connection it is essential that we keep our prices competitive and attractive to visitors but in spite of this the Minister has imposed a 10 per cent VAT on car hire and this will not encourage tourists.  The rental of cars is expensive and the petrol increase in the recent budget will do nothing to help.  It is obvious that it will be very expensive for visitors to have a touring holiday in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We should direct out attention towards stimulating the economy.  It is obvious that we cannot keep going without a proper economic plan but there is no plan.  The future could be very bright but it is essential that we have a plan.  We have one of the finest ore mines in western Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> We have been drifting aimlessly for the last three or four years but this cannot continue.  At a time of crisis it is necessary to keep a tight rein on matters but a plan is essential.  In Tara we have one of the finest mines in western Europe. The Government have now made a decision about a smelter and that is a step in the right direction.  However, that decision should have been taken three years ago.  All of us know how long it will be before the smelter is in operation.  We know the problems that will arise with regard to the siting of the project; there have been problems throughout the country with regard to the siting of industries and we are all familiar with the long process that is involved.  The Government could have made a decision with regard to the smelter two or three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us hope that oil and gas will be flowing in a few years time. We should decide now how to obtain the maximum amount of employment in these projects.  Norway is a small country but it is very advanced with regard to the building of equipment for exploration of gas and oil. They are self-supporting with regard to the building of rigs and now they are in the export market but it is likely that any equipment required to bring our mineral wealth onshore will have to be imported.  We may well ask if the Government have carried out any research in the last two or three years to see if it would be possible to build the equipment here.  This in an important question because in future years we will have to look to some of our mineral resources.  For too long we have been depending on the importation of raw materials; we have manufactured and re-exported and this is a costly <Col N="1393" /> business.  We will have to examine the infrastructure with regard to roads and the telephone service.  We have the worst telephone system in western Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

France is supposed to have the worst telephone system on the Continent but they have twice that number and the advanced countries in Europe have 30 or 40 telephones for every 100 persons.  We must also give consideration to the fishing industry and its potential. Two-thirds of the world is under water and it has been proved that there is a considerable amount of mineral wealth in the sea.  Some guidelines will have to be laid down with regard to fishing around our coasts and our future plans in this area.  I am not saying we should have a complete policy overnight on fishing but some research should be carried out.</P>
      <P>These are matters the Government should have been considering in the last few years but it is obvious they have neglected to do this.  It is not enough to issue a Green Paper, a discussion document, after three years. That is not good enough.  At this stage all these matters should have been researched and examined.

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I am talking about economics and budget financing and the effects of all these papers that we have had in the last three years.  We had the Minister for Foreign Affairs writing a weekly article in <i>The Irish Times.</i> Some of the articles were enlightening but others were of the kind that is demonstrated in this budget.  Deficit budgeting can be a serious thing if you get too deeply into it.  I would prefer to advance slowly and steadily, but what we have had is a stop-go policy, giving one day and taking away the next.  That is soul destroying. What should have happened in regard to social welfare was a steady advance in line with our economic resources. We should never have embarked on the type of budgeting demonstrated this year, relying on future hopes of an upturn in the economy and probably some wealth from mineral resources.  That is a very dangerous method.  The capital will not be available for capital development which will be so necessary in the next five or six years, and the unfortunate result will be that our mineral resources will fall into the hands of foreign capitalists because we will not have the capital with which to take our share.  This was demonstrated last week when the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Keating, spoke on Radio Éireann about the building of a smelter which would cost £50 million but how difficult it would be for us to find that capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In private business I have seen people go broke because they did not <Col N="1395" /> watch their borrowing, and people who study the financial pages will note the effect of heavy borrowing on this country.  Heavy borrowing by a Government will eventually bring down the standards of the people, particularly the weaker section.  One intangible but vital thing that is missing at the moment is confidence.  When there is lack of confidence the whole morale and spirit of the people deteriorate and I doubt if the Government can restore people's confidence because they began on the wrong track three years ago.  They committed themselves to a 14-point plan and embarked on the ludicrous policy of deficit budgeting.  Now confidence has been completely eroded.  It is well known that the biggest growth comes from the private sector and unless the Minister and the Government make up their minds to take a close look at this sector and increase the amount of profitability there in order to help it develop and expand, there can be no confidence.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Government can do this.  When Fianna Fáil get back to power it will be left to us to restore that confidence which has been absent in the past three years. We will put down guidelines and though it may mean sacrifices I am convinced the people will respond generously.</P>

      <P>I will begin by dealing with the last point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick. He suggested that Fianna Fáil would have a national economic and social plan which, he said, would put this country back on its feet again.  This was one of the few references we had to a national social and economic plan by the Fianna Fáil Party for many years.  Frankly, I think they are ashamed to talk about the national social and economic plans they produced.  I think they made three attempts at such plans.  Nothing came from them despite all the high-sounding projections for employment, increasing social welfare, capital for agriculture and industry and so on. Only last night it came to my notice through a student in one of the universities <Col N="1396" /> here that these plans are not even being sold as antiques now.  I am informed that the three national social and economic plans of the Fianna Fáil Party are being offered in one of these colleges at ninepence and, for ninepence, they are not even being taken up.  That is about the value they had.  It demonstrates the success of the planning done by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>There is always the next time for Fianna Fáil.  What I should like to put on record now are some comments with regard to the Department of Health.  I had a limited time last night and could not, therefore, make the comments I wanted to or refute the allegations that had been made.  There are certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party who were outspoken and honest. I refer in particular to Deputy Seán Flanagan who wanted an assessment of the expenditure where health is concerned and of the value given as a result of that expenditure.  However, there is a concerted and deliberate effort by certain members of Fianna Fáil to make statements not alone to scare but in many cases to cause actual panic.  There have been wild and malicious allegations of a political nature designed to do nothing else but to undermine the Government and the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I described in detail last night the progress made as far as the money devoted to health is concerned, as far as real improvements are concerned and the increase in health expenditure related to gross national product.  Despite all that this campaign is still going on.  I noticed in <i>The Irish Independent</i> this morning certain allegations, allegations which have, of course, no foundation whatsoever. Whether these allegations are designed to influence thinking in the health boards, particularly the Eastern Health Board, I do not know but they are certainly being deliberately tailored for the purpose of scaring people and creating panic.  I understand the Eastern Health Board intend <Col N="1397" /> to refute these allegations, but I would like to put something on the record in regard to them.</P>
    <P>It was alleged that St. Loman's Hospital was to close down.  This is certainly extravagant and I do not think anybody in his sane senses would see any merit in closing down St. Loman's or in having its functions diminished.  There is no such plan but alleged spokesmen in the professions and alleged spokesmen who are members of health boards continue to spread that sort of rumour. Mark you, rumour is very hard to retract.  There are also petty suggestions made that the tobacco and cigarette allowance, for example, are going to be cut.  This is not true. Another mean one&mdash;one that would please certain members of the public who would be antagonistic towards me or towards this Government&mdash;is the suggestion that visits to cinemas will be affected.  There is no truth in that allegation.  These rumour-mongers talk about cutting down on food, reverting to the inferior diet of Victorian times.  That will not happen but it is intended, without any deterioration in the meals offered to the patients, to make economies where it is seen economies should and could be made.</P>
    <P>As far as the banning of overtime is concerned and the non-filling of vacant posts, what the board will attempt to do is what any board with the public interest at heart would do.  They will ensure that only essential overtime is allowed and that only those posts which must be filled in the interests of the patients will be filled.  This is normal practice where economy is concerned. There were allegations last night and the night before that taxis used for the transportation of patients would be done away with altogether.  This is not true.  I do not think anybody could believe I or the members of the health board were so callous as to deny transportation for people in need of care and treatment.  It is recognised that in the Cork region there was abuse of this service.  This abuse will be cut out but there is no intention on my part or on the part of members of the health boards to engage in the alleged penny-pinching <Col N="1398" /> exercise we heard about last night.</P>
    <P>We had an emotional description last night from Deputy Haughey and Deputy John O'Leary of old people being thrown out of some of the county homes and geriatric institutions.  There is no truth in that allegation and I would like members of the Opposition who make these wild allegations to substantiate them.  I have identified one particular case and it was not a question of throwing anybody out.  Health boards do not do that kind of thing. Ministers do not do it.  All discharges are made by the doctors and the discharge in this particular case could not be regarded as an economy because any vacancies are immediately filled by what are regarded as more deserving cases.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Connolly some time ago talking about the lavish advertising by health boards.  Last night he made no mention of that.  He made no mention of the kind of economies he advocated when the Health Contributions Bill was being discussed here.  We had wild allegations from Deputy Haughey.  I do not know whether or not his heart is in the position he occupies.  He may aspire to higher things, but one is surprised to hear an ex-Minister for Finance make the wild allegations he did.  He made these in his concluding speech despite the fact that I had refuted the allegations specifically when I spoke just before him.  Whether or not he was listening I do not know, but he did suggest the Eastern Health Board were to reduce the milk allowance for children or that the age limit was going to be reduced and I said that would not be so.  It was not my intention or the intention of the Eastern Health Board to engage in such &ldquo;economies&rdquo;.  Again it was suggested by people who represent themselves as spokesmen, unidentified of course, that the school medical examination would cease.  There is no truth whatsoever in it.  It was also suggested by Deputy Haughey and repeated again, despite the fact that I refuted the allegation, that beds would be discontinued in three of the city hospitals.  This was checked, needless to remark, by me and it was discovered, of course, that there <Col N="1399" /> was no intention in these hospitals to cut down bed numbers.</P>
    <P>Without going into the details of the undoubted progress that has been made over the last three years, I want to tell the House that what I am trying to achieve is not cutbacks as far as patient care is concerned.  I do not want to see cutbacks; neither, I assume, do the chief executive officers. What I am looking for is economies that can be made without interfering with the service, so that we can get down to base and resume the undoubted progress we made in 1973, 1974 and 1975.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that as far as the various health boards and health board personnel are concerned, they look for what would be the simplest economies.  It would be easy for us if we wanted to cut down our own standards to decide that we would not have lunch every second day or that we would not have an evening meal at all.  The economies that have been suggested are far too simple. There are economies that can be made, such as those that have been mentioned by Deputy Seán Flanagan and by Deputy Dr. John O'Connell with regard to the usage of drugs.</P>
    <P>We in the Department of Health have been in consultation with the chief executive officers and programme officers of the various health boards, and they are confident that the economies that are proposed can be implemented.  Anybody who represents these economies as economies that will have an effect on patient care are very much wrong.  I know it will be a difficult task but I am confident that, with good will, these can be achieved.  There are people who do not want to effect or even to think about effecting such economies as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>People ought to appreciate, whether they agree with the policy of the Government or not, that 1976 will be a very difficult year as, indeed, was 1975.  Everybody, whether he is Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, will agree that we must tighten our belts, that we must have regard to the fact that it is going to be a tough <Col N="1400" /> year.  When we call for restraint everybody agrees that there should be restraint but when it comes down to specific personnel they say, &ldquo;Not us&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I said before and as I said last night, health services have been much more progressive in the past few years than they were during the 16 years of the Fianna Fáil Government. Deputy Haughey had a nerve last night when he talked about a cutback in the health services to the degree he said there would be, when he who was Minister for Finance was so niggardly towards the Department of Health and when there was no real increase in moneys during his four-year period as Minister for Finance.  It was 3.2 per cent in the first year; 3.2 per cent in the second year; 3.2 per cent in the third year; and 3.4 in his last year of office as Minister for Finance.  I do not remember if that was the year he fell off the horse and when the Taoiseach had to deliver his budget statement for him.  Whether there was any significance in the fact that Deputy Lynch was more generous than Deputy Haughey in the previous three years, I do not know, but that was the extent of the increases given by Deputy Haughey when he was Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I am sure there will be many more rumours and scares and much more malicious propaganda by members of the Fianna Fáil Party, but this does no good for the country or for the health services, because people get scared, particularly old people.  We have, as I have said, improved these services and we are merely asking for a standstill, but the services provided in 1975 will continue to be provided in 1976.  We can, I hope, in 1977 and the years after that continue with the improvements we made in 1973, 1974 and 1975.</P>
    <P>Objections have been made to the amounts spent and there are queries whether or not we are getting value for this.  As I promised last night, the health boards will be advised that they should establish finance committees so that they will be in full possession of the facts.  This will be done fairly soon to enable them make a real assessment and examination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" /> It should be remembered also that nearly 100 per cent of health expenditure falls on the Exchequer, and, of course, as Deputy Haughey knows, when a Minister for Finance gets estimates from the various Departments he does not necessarily give them the full amount just like that. He has to scrutinise them and invariably there are some reductions.  Again we find the Opposition complaining about expenditure, overborrowing big deficits and taxation.  These are the people who, even now and over the past three years, have been demanding more services, demanding the creation of more posts, demanding even greater improvements than we have given over the last three years.</P>

If he is prepared to stand by the allegation he makes he should also have the manliness and the courage to give his name so that the allegation he makes can be closely examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of the economy and on the budget, from the speeches of Fianna Fáil you would imagine this country could do things in isolation, with no regard whatever to the undoubted effects on this economy of what is happening particularly in the EEC countries and in many other countries in the world.  They seem to believe we are back in the era when their Leader, now dead, Lord have mercy on him, believed that we could have a hairshirt policy, that we could drink light beer instead of tea, and so on.  We are not in that era any more because we are now in the EEC.  We are in the EEC because Fianna Fáil wanted us to be in the EEC, because Fine Gael wanted us to be in the EEC, and we, as a Labour <Col N="1402" /> Party, are in it because we accept the majority decision of the people who voted about 80 per cent to 84 per cent in favour of entry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for allowing this motion to be brought up as it is urgent.  I feel that when a question was asked we should have been able to get a full reply to it, because if the tickets were taken away from those children it meant that there must have been some reason for it, some decision on it, and for that reason I was disappointed when I was told there was further investigation needed.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, these children were going to school by bus, some of them travelling free and some fare-paying.  Just over two weeks ago, one evening, the inspector boarded the bus and took the tickets from the children.  I have never heard of this happening before.  I understood that when you had a ticket, even if you had gone over the distance, you were given the opportunity of staying on the bus until the end of the journey.  As much as anything else, it would give the parents a chance during the school holidays to make alternative arrangements for the children to get to school.  The weather has not been too bad since, and it has not been such a hardship on the children to travel to school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This family, who were living on one side of the road, bought another farm across the road and moved in.  They are now maintaining that they are <Col N="1403" /> nearer to Daingean school and that there can be only 200 yards at the most between the two gateways.  This new house has an avenue leading to it. If the distance was measured up to the house you would find that it would be the same in both cases.  For that reason, I feel there may have been some mistake when the measurements were being taken.  On a number of occasions children have been found to be nearer another school, but because all the family had been attending the schools in Trim, or in their particular area, they were allowed to continue on, as naturally it would be a disruption of their education, particularly national education, if the children had to move to another school.  For that reason there should have been more notice taken when it was decided to withdraw the tickets from those children.  It was a hardship on them to be told at a moment's notice that the tickets were being withdrawn.  It was in conflict with the normal procedure regarding the transporting of children to national schools.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider this case and to return the tickets to the children. We should have got a full reply on this case and a decision should have been given when the parliamentary question was put down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complicated case.  First of all, there is an incorrect statement in the Deputy's question in which he says the family moved across the road.  Within the normal understanding of that term, that was not the case.  According to the information provided by CIE, they moved 0.6 of a mile, which is a significant change of residence, and could affect the eligibility of the children.  This matter, as we have advised generally, could have been taken up with CIE at local level when the matter arose and could have been dealt with more quickly.  The withdrawal of service following this change of residence was made by the local CIE office. The Department of Education were not aware of it, but this is perfectly <Col N="1404" /> normal because CIE have an ongoing responsibility to review the situation to see if there are children who cease to be eligible because of such a thing as a change of residence of 0.6 of a mile.</P>
      <P>There is an additional complication in this case in Trim.  The younger children of this family are attending the convent school.  According to CIE's information, the elder members of the family are attending the Christian Brothers' school.  With regard to national schools, the distance is measured from the gate of the school to the house.  The anomalous situation arose as a result of this move of 0.6 of a mile.  The younger children remained eligible because the convent is that bit further away, whereas the older children, by virtue of the move, and combined with the fact that the Brothers' school is in a different location, ceased to be eligible.  In view of the fact that we prefer to keep a family together when we got the Deputy's question rather than saying this is the situation, we said that we wanted time to investigate the matter.  When an assurance is given in the House that a matter will be investigated in response to a parliamentary question, I can assure the House that it is dealt with with the utmost speed.  As a result of inquiries a decision has been reached in the Department in the last day or so to restore the facility which had been lost, and I can tell the House that that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is the judge of his own business in these matters, but I should like to assure him and the House that if a problem of this urgency does arise&mdash;and I do not deny for one moment that it is an important case for the Deputy and the family concerned&mdash;the best approach is to see me about it and we will try to solve the problem in that manner, rather than bringing it up on the Adjournment, which is an exceptional parliamentary measure. The Deputy is entitled to adopt whatever procedure he wishes, but I want to place on record that, as far as I am concerned, it is not necessary for him to raise the matter on the <Col N="1405" /> Adjournment to get me to deal with the matter as speedily as I can.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> The Dáil adjourned at 5.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 9th March, 1976.</P>
