      <P>On the Order of Business, yesterday when it was sought on this side of the House to raise the bus disputes affecting a number of cities you, Sir, ruled the question out of order.  Since tabling the question we learned that the Minister for Labour had taken up the problem with the unions and the company.  As we will now be denied any opportunity of raising the matter or debating it here before the recess, would the Minister today or tomorrow give the House some indication of the progress of his talks with the unions and CIE?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy Oliver John Flanagan for appointment by the President to be a member of the Government.</P>
      <P>I might add, for the information of the Dáil, that subject to the Motion being approved, by the House, I propose to assign the Department of Defence to Deputy Flanagan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter arises out of a series of events which were debated to some extent here recently and, perhaps, it arises more particularly out of changes the Taoiseach announced in his Cabinet two weeks ago.  On that occasion the Taoiseach assigned to himself the Department of Defence and he now disengages from his responsibilities for the affairs of that Department by the assignment to it of Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan.  When the Taoiseach made his announcement two weeks ago he simply announced changes in the assignation of Ministries.  By doing so he thereby precluded the Dáil debating these changes at that time and the events that led up to them. Here now, on the second last day of the session before the Christmas recess, in a week when a regular plethora of Dáil business will be sought to be got through because of statutory problems connected with the termination of the fiscal year, we have the appointment of a Minister to the Department of Defence.  The timing of this motion is rather difficult to understand having regard to the announcement two weeks ago and to the events prior to that announcement to which I shall refer in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the significance of the timing is related to the fact that we are so late in the Dáil term with so much business to be got through in the relatively few hours that remain before the end of the statutory year Perhaps the other significant feature is the fact that this is removed by a <Col N="699" /> least two weeks from the events which led to the making of this appointment and, therefore, two weeks removed from the public memory of these events.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go into the suitability of Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan as Minister for Defence.  He has been a long time waiting for a ministerial appointment.  His past will be an indication of his suitability for this appointment and time will judge whether or not his appointment is justified.  The only thing I can say about the timing in this respect is that Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan will not have much time to spend in it, fortunately for him and, perhaps, fortunately for the country because both he and his colleagues will be removed from office after the next election.</P>
    <P>I think it well to recall the Taoiseach's role in this whole affair. A former Minister for Defence, Deputy Donegan, made his attack on the former President on Monday, 18th October.  I am not going to go into the merits of that attack.  I am not going to go into the denigration of the office of President on that occasion. I do not think it is necessary to do so but on Wednesday, 20th October, when the Dáil resumed after the summer recess&mdash;that is, having regard to the emergency reassembly of the Dáil at the beginning of September&mdash; I put it to the Taoiseach that he should ask for the resignation of the Minister for Defence because of the remarks he had made and because of the location in which they were made and, in the event of the Minister's refusal to tender his resignation, I asked that the Taoiseach should dismiss the Minister.</P>
    <P>At that time, as we now know, the Taoiseach had already been offered by the Minister the Minister's resignation, which he rejected, but in his reply to my question on 20th October, apart from referring to what the Minister for Defence had said as a remark which slighted the President, for which he did apologise, he made no further comment on the Minister having tendered his resignation. In fact, he failed to disclose to <Col N="700" /> the Dáil on 20th October that the Minister had tendered his resignation.  He deliberately failed to disclose that fact to the Dáil, and the deliberate failure to disclose is, in my interpretation a concealing from the Dáil of that fact, a fact which, I suggest, the Dáil was entitled to know, and especially from the head of a Government which he and his colleagues describe as an open Government.  That behaviour does not seem to me to be consistent with that of a Government that presumes to regard itself as an open Government.</P>
    <P>On the following day, Thursday, 1st October, I tabled a specific motion for the dismissal of the Minister for Defence.  The Taoiseach spoke for the motion, and again he neglected to disclose to the Dáil, concealed from the Dáil, the offer by the then Minister for Defence of his resignation. Again, he spoke of the full apology made by the Minister to the President which he regarded as being adequate for the purpose, and then&mdash;and this aspect of the matter makes it difficult to reconcile his action here today and his action of two weeks ago&mdash;he eulogised the Minister for Defence for his dedication and expertise generally in the running of the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>If the remarks made by the Minister at that time did not warrant the acceptance by the Taoiseach of the Minister's resignation or warrant the Taoiseach dismissing the Minister, if the Taoiseach's assessment of the performance of the Minister for Defence in his office was the correct one, why then do we find ourselves faced today with the appointment of a replacement Minister for Defence?  Why was the Minister for Defence, as has been generally accepted in the meantime, demoted if the events leading to these actions were, in the opinion of the Taoiseach and the Government so insignificant as not to warrant any action?  I wonder whether the smiles on the faces of two of the Ministers, one of them involved in the shuffle, the now Minister for Transport and Power, and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, is a device to cover up their embarrassment for the part they took&mdash;and the part they took was similar to that taken by their colleagues&mdash;in <Col N="701" /> endorsing the former Minister for Defence in his action and endorsing the Taoiseach in his failure to take action in relation to the statement of the former Minister for Defence?  However, they are entitled to smile cynically or with amusement. It is a matter for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We have all heard of people whistling past graveyards, and I suppose it is a device in Dáil Éireann, if you are fearful or embarrassed about something, to feign a smile.</P>
      <P>The only other speaker to the motion to which I have referred was the Taoiseach's Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy John Kelly, whose comments on the affair then and since do credit neither to himself nor the Government.  The next day, Friday 27th October, the President resigned. Following the resignation I tabled a motion of no confidence in the Government. The Taoiseach countered this motion by an affirmative motion of his own seeking the confidence of the Dáil in the Government.  That entitled him to open the debate.  I would like to ask the members of the Dáil to throw their minds back to that very day.  Well over a week had elapsed since the Minister for Defence had tendered his resignation.  We had heard nothing about it, but an alert political journalist disclosed that fact and also the fact that he had tendered his resignation not only once but twice.  Therefore, when the Taoiseach spoke that morning we were told for the first time, having already read it in the daily newspapers, that the Minister for Defence had, in fact, tendered his resignation on the Tuesday mornings and again on the Friday evening of the President's resignation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we come to two weeks later when the Taoiseach had returned from the Summit Conference of the EEC in The Hague and, as is customary, gave notice that he intended to give an account of what happened in The Hague to the Dáil.  However, by way of an aside&mdash;and as far as I know an aside of which no notice whatever had been given&mdash;the Taoiseach then announced the Cabinet <Col N="702" /> changes before he went into the account of the proceedings in The Hague on the previous Monday and Tuesday.  As we know, he assigned the Department of Defence to himself and made the other changes.</P>
    <P>It was difficult to understand, first, why, in the light of what had been done, with his refusal to remove the Minister for Defence, his praise of the Minister in carrying out his duties, it was necessary at all to push the Minister for Defence from the job which, apparently, in the opinion of the Taoiseach, he had been doing so excellently and efficiently.  It was obviously regarded by the country as a rebuke to the Minister for what he had said and done, but in the meantime the Taoiseach had succeeded in getting his own Deputies, and, indeed the Labour Deputies, into the division lobbies behind him in support of his actions.  The Labour Deputies, I feel, trooped into the lobbies with some misgivings in all this affair, but I think the misgivings were, perhaps, more strident following the sudden announcement by the Taoiseach of his demotion of the Minister whom the previous week he had asked the Labour Deputies to support in the division lobbies. If Deputy Coughlan wishes to pursue that one, perhaps we can discuss it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>By all means.  The same applies to the recent debate on the Government's handling of the economy, which rather turned on a debate of the Opposition's policy in relation to the economy.  There was no policy to discuss except that of the Opposition on that occasion.  I want to tell Deputy Coughlan that we all know of the misgivings that overtook the Labour Party if not on the day they trooped into the division lobby behind the Taoiseach in support of his Minister for Defence then, subsequently when the Taoiseach took action in relation to the same Minister for Defence and demoted him to what is regarded as a less important ministry.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention to discuss Deputy Oliver Flanagan's performance, or his likely performance, or his suitability for the post.  He will not get much opportunity of establishing himself, in my opinion, but what I have been saying is typical of the Government's handling of the country's affairs, particularly in the last 12 to 18 months.  They bungled one aspect of administration after another. We have had bungling of budgetary matters, bungling of the national wage negotiations, bungling in the equal pay for women legislation and bungling in the promises made in the last budget to increase social welfare payments all round by 1st October.  We have had the contradictory statements about children's allowances by the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste, the second most important member of the Government.  After two years of piling on oppressive taxes on petrol and other commodities we now have the Minister for Education, supported to some extent by the Minister for Finance, telling us that the country is overtaxed.  It is they who have done this over the last three years in ways that were not regarded as being ordinary decent practice of tax imposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the House of the manner in which the colossal increase in petrol tax was imposed <Col N="704" /> more than two years ago under the guise of the Imposition of Duties Act.</P>

      <P>I submit I am entitled to discuss any aspect of Government policy under this motion because of precedent and, even to disregard precedent, because of the concept of collective responsibility and because the member of the Government who previously held the office now being filled by Deputy Oliver Flanagan was the Taoiseach.  For those reasons I believe I am entitled to speak as widely as I wish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am about to say is, in general, in relation to the Government's performance.  Almost since the Government took office we have seen many examples of misleading propaganda, diverse and contradictory statements by members of the Governments in their attempts to cover up the disastrous performance of the Government in relation to all aspects of administration during that period.  I have dealt with the <Col N="705" /> Taoiseach's attempt at misrepresentation in not disclosing to the House certain facts in relation to the stance of the Minister for Defence following his insult to the President.  He tried to misrepresent the Fianna Fáil statement on the economy when, during the course of that recent debate on the Government's performance generally he tried to claim that the Fianna Fáil economic proposals would cost £650 million.  He tried to justify that by saying that the immediate precise proposals would cost £3 million, which they would not, and then said it would be necessary to increase the cost of government by £350 million in the coming year, something which would have to be done anyway.  Even if the statement in relation to £650 million was true, more than half of that figure is because of the Government's mishandling of the economy.  The implication there was that the £350 million would have to be found by either borrowing or taxation.  There was no question of money coming in anyway from buoyancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know what happened to the marvellous economic recovery which the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce promised were under way.  What happened to the higher economic growth rate the Minister for Finance so confidently expected?  Was all this another example of thinking out loud?  The second example of this kind of misrepresentation of Fianna Fáil's position came from the leader of the Labour Party, the Tánaiste, Deputy Corish, when he said at his party's conference last month that our proposals for more spending by borrowing were a belated conversion from our earlier opposition to such action.  That is not true.  We did not object to temporary borrowing provided it was used to maintain jobs and keep down prices in the aftermath of the oil crisis.  What we objected to, and still do, was the incompetent way the National Coalition borrowed huge sums and ran up enormous debts, driving up inflation and increasing unemployment. Moreover, the Government have run up these huge debts from foreign borrowings at a time when the value of sterling was going down making the cost of these borrowings <Col N="706" /> to the Irish taxpayer all the greater burden.  In spring 1974, we were attacking the National Coalition budget for this reason and now we have seen the folly of their policies. We have been consistent since then in our attack on these policies.  The fact that we were correct can be seen in two ways.  Firstly, the disastrous failure of the National Coalition's approach to our position generally, an approach which has led to record levels of unemployment and inflation. This is plain even to their most ardent support.  Secondly, the National Coalition are adopting policies adumbrated and suggested by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Earlier when we stressed the importance of investment and the need to hold down costs in order to preserve jobs we were scorned at for being reactionary allies of big business but today, when the jobs are gone and the dole queues are stretched to unprecedented lengths, we have not only Fine Gael Deputies but Labour Deputies preaching the same message of the need for investment; the need for incentives; the need for reasonable profits in industry in order to create new employment, the need for pay restraint in order to get people back to work. Why must they always inflict damage before they finally learn the stupidity of the extravagant claims to create an economic paradise, instantly and effortlessly, which they seem to have been making over the last three years?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy a good deal of latitude but I am bound to say again that in my opinion this motion does not encompass a discussion on Government policy and that in any case we had a debate on Government and economic policy quite recently in November last.  There should not be a reopening of that debate.</P>

      <P>I will talk about appointment of Members to the Government in a previous debate in such a context and I refer the Chair to the Official Report of Dáil Debates on 6th May, 1970, column 640.  The title of the debate was &ldquo;Nomination of Member of Government&rdquo;.  When I made a suggestion that the debate ought to be restricted to that very motion the then Leader of the Opposition said:</P>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that there can be no restriction on the extent of discussion.  Any matters that are involved in this ... are open to discussion without restriction.</P>
      <P>Later on in the same column, Deputy Cosgrave said:</P>
      <P>Let us start with this but it must be clearly understood that there is no restriction on the terms of this discussion.</P>
      <P>The discussion proceeded on that basis.  We are now to conform to a different set of rules on this motion which bears the exact same title?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>I shall try again and if I go outside the rules of Order as the Chair sees them, the Chair can stop me.  I shall avoid conflict with the Chair because I respect the Chair's decisions and appreciate its difficulties but we have not succeeded in getting the kind of latitude that would seem to have been accorded to Oppositions in previous Administrations.  Perhaps it is a question of different interpretation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is responsible for all these aspects of Government policy and administration and, as I argued earlier, the Taoiseach is just now relinquishing one post and assigning it to another.  Generally, to deal with other aspects of the Administration, I leave myself in the Chair's hands as to whether in his opinion I am transgressing the rules of Order, unduly widening the scope of the debate in respect of which the only precedent of which I am aware is the one I have just quoted where it was asserted that there would be no limitation to the extent of the debate and that, in fact, was what happened.  I shall not go into the matter in any greater detail except to complete what I was saying, that the Government have now adopted Fianna Fáil policies which they criticised some weeks ago. They propose tax cuts in lieu of wage increases.  I accept that the level of tax cuts proposed, £50 million will only be barely sufficient&mdash;if sufficient &mdash;to catch up with the inflationary trend now standing at about 18.5 per cent for which they have been largely &mdash;I shall not say solely&mdash;responsible.</P>
      <P>I was not present at the time but for the third time in this House&mdash;or perhaps the fourth&mdash;that I have spoken on this matter I have suffered the mispresentation repeated so often by the Minister for Local Government about housing.  Housing is an area, as the figures will show ultimately of which the Government or the Minister for Local Government himself can hardly feel proud.  Notwithstanding that the Chair permitted me several months ago to call on the Minister to withdraw his imputation against me about reducing or trying to reduce the number of local authority built houses, the Minister has been persistently making that charge.  However, I shall ignore it.  But I repeat what I said, that this Government have made it virtually impossible for people who wish to buy their own homes to do so because of the Government's refusal to increase the amount of grants and the level of income at which people will qualify for loans and grants.</P>

      <P>The list could be extended but I do not want to come in conflict with the Chair who has restricted my scope considerably. There are very many other examples of bungling by this Government, of failure to be frank with people, of trying to confuse people's minds with contradictory statements&mdash;the Minister for Finance talking of reducing or abolishing children's allowances and then being told by the Minister for Social Welfare that he was talking out of turn.  But the people and the House know the whole story down to the last sordid details.  What is important now is to ensure that the people will get an early opportunity of giving judgment on the malperformance of this Government.  Merited and justified though the Taoiseach may think the changes he has made in the Government are, I do not think he went far enough; he should have begun a bit higher up and changed the Minister for Finance because of the terrible financial and economic mess in which the country is at present.  Perhaps it would be still better if he gave the people the opportunity to change the Government as a whole.  That is what the people are waiting for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment of a Minister for Defence is probably one of the most important decisions that this House has to consider.  It is important because it relates to the security forces and the Minister appointed must have credibility and enjoy confidence.  In a period of national emergency it is even more important that we should have a Minister with credibility who would engender confidence, one who is not irresponsible or reckless in his approach to problems.  We would like to hear from the Taoiseach or other Members why Deputy O.J. Flanagan is being appointed to the post of Minister for Defence.  The Taoiseach gave no explanation as regards his suitability, no reasons why he was being appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Common sense will demand an answer to these questions.  Why was he appointed?  It was not on merit. <Col N="710" /> He does not have the loyalty one would expect a Minister to have because during the debates on the Offences Against the State Act he was plotting to overthrow his Leader. Even after the bombs had fallen he disregarded the advice of his Leader and marched into the division lobby to vote against that Act.  In view of his recklessness on that occasion and his attitude to his Leader and to offences against the State, one wonders why Deputy O.J. Flanagan is now being promoted to this important post during a period of national emergency.  Was it because of influence or power behind the scenes? Where does the power lie which has put this Deputy into the Department of Defence?  These questions will have to be answered.  I will deal in greater detail with this sorry situation as the debate proceeds.  Why and how are the two important questions at the moment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps some members from the Government benches will clear up the doubt in many people's minds about this situation.  What power did Deputy O.J. Flanagan exercise over the Taoiseach?  It was a self-appointment and a self-announcement; it was not an announcement from the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Department of Defence over the years could be described by most responsible people as a sorry mess and a joke.  The Taoiseach has set himself up as a little Hitler.  His Ministers for Defence are mere puppets.  Within the past three weeks we had three different Ministers for Defence.  The Taoiseach lasted fewer than three weeks and now we will have a new Minister.  Deputy Donegan when Minister for Defence was a puppet and carried the can for many irresponsible actions which can be laid at the Taoiseach's door.  I will deal with this point in more detail later.</P>
    <P>We had hoped that a man with a mind of his own, who would be uncontaminated by the prompts of the Taoiseach, would have been promoted to this post.  Patronage by the Taoiseach to friends and cronies has become very evident in recent times. He made a horrible mess of Defence. <Col N="711" /> While Deputy Donegan had many shortcomings, no one can deny that he was concerned about security.  One of his faults was that he yielded to the Taoiseach's whims, did his bidding and did not think for himself. We know the sorry mess the then Minister made of illegal promotions which, in many cases, were the friends and cronies of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in recent weeks again decided to show his contempt for the young officers in the Army by making promotions available to people of the Equitation School.  While some of these men may have been nearing promotion stage, nevertheless the promotions have disturbed the confidence of the men who have made a career of the Army.  Promotions must be based on merit and military ability.  Hard hats and horses are no substitute for military efficiency.  For the future we want Ministers for Defence or Taoisigh who will not interfere with or upset the morale of the Defence Forces during a period of national emergency.  The Papa Doc approach of the Taoiseach is all too evident in his complete disregard of junior officers and officers entitled to promotion.  While these recent promotions were within the law, they were on the basis of the men's ability to sell horses.  In one of our newspapers these promotions were referred to as &ldquo;promotions personal to themselves&rdquo;. Nevertheless they were an injustice to the many because they were not based on military efficiency.</P>
    <P>Down the years members of our Defence Forces, officers, NCOs and men, gave creditable service on battlefields abroad and carried the flag with distinction in the interests of justice and peace.  These people were not promoted.  It is a sad day for the Defence Forces when the sale of horses takes precedence over military efficiency.  I thought the Taoiseach would have come to his senses after the appalling situation that developed after the illegal promotions by Deputy Donegan of the Taoiseach's cronies and friends.</P>

      <P>In view of the enormous amount of corruption that is taking place, it will be very difficult not to go outside the rigid lines set by the Ceann Comhairle.  Nevertheless, to operate within those rigid lines, we can still expose the situation.  I want to point out that the illegal promotions took place at the behest of the Taoiseach and that the then Minister had to carry the can but got no support from the man who prompted him.  His desertion of Deputy Donegan on two occasions was all too evident.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently he came into this House and misled us about his confidence in the then Minister. At a later stage he ratted and threw the man to the wolves.  While this man had shortcomings, I would hate to see a colleague of mine betrayed and thrown to the wolves as this man was by the Taoiseach.  Maybe in the not-too-distant future Deputy O.J. Flanagan will be thrown to the wolves too.</P>
      <P>Again, I ask why was this irresponsible man, this character assassin, appointed to this post?  We all know his track record over the years and that must be a factor in his promotion here today.  Whatever instructions the Taoiseach gives to the new Minister, promotions must be on the basis of military merit and not on hard hats and horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The morale of the Defence Forces is at a much lower level than ever before and this is a very serious matter. Recent promotions have aggravated responsible officers who felt they were in line for promotion.  It would appear to me that during the next few <Col N="713" /> years we will have more officers appointed from outside the establishment than within the establishment because of the extension of service and the basis on which officers were promoted recently.</P>
    <P>I want to say in relation to the Papa Doc approach of the Taoiseach that his contempt for the institutions of State is all too evident.  The law and order song which he and his Ministers have been singing for far too long is used only when he feels it is to the advantage of himself and his party.  His contempt for the highest office of the land was shown all too clearly by his action during the recent debate on the Donegan affair.  His reference during the 1973 ard-fheis to Árus an Uachtaráin being turned into a funeral parlour is another indication of his irresponsibility and his attitude towards the institutions of this State. I would hope that in a short time we will have a new Taoiseach who will respect the institutions of State and who will be concerned about law and order not for the sake of party considerations. This self-styled law and order group are exposed now because of their complete and utter irresponsibility.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a Minister for Defence during a period of national emergency, without any explanation as to his credibility or his standing, without taking into consideration the man's track record and background, is appalling.  The misleading of the Dáil, as pointed out by Deputy Lynch recently, is a factor that brings discredit on the Taoiseach as the Leader of this House.  He is not the only Minister who has tended to discredit the institutions of State.</P>
    <P>To arouse the minds of the people at home and abroad we have another Minister endeavouring to project himself as being another armchair general. That is one thing which the Coalition parties are not short of, armchair generals.  In the person of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs we have a man who is fomenting civil war, who speaks about Lebanese situations developing in this country, who is ultraconservative, who is not concerned with the unity of the nation or the <Col N="714" /> fight for freedom which took place in the past.  The men of 1916 have been trampled on by references to them by the Minister and by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach. The fascist-type tactics of many of the Ministers is very evident in statements both inside and outside the House.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Lands and other Ministers have adopted the same type of tactics.</P>
    <P>There must be a realistic approach, in the area of defence, to the security problems which confront the nation, but security is being threatened by putting into office an irresponsible Minister.  I have outlined here the type of man that Deputy Flanagan is. Before I deal with his suitability, I want to say that he was plotting to overthrow his present Leader when we were discussing the legislation in relation to offences against the State. He disregarded the advice given by his Leader and marched into the division lobbies to vote against the Act. What forces have been brought to bear on the Taoiseach?  What non-elected influence and power has been brought to bear to have this man promoted?  Remember that the Taoiseach did not make the announcement. It was made in defiance of the Taoiseach by Deputy Oliver John Flanagan himself.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the patronage has stopped and that the situation will be terminated whereby the morale and efficiency of the Defence Forces is being disturbed by irresponsible actions of the Taoiseach and his puppets. Puppets they are and Deputy Flanagan has got this promotion on the basis that he will do exactly as he is told by the Taoiseach just as the previous Minister.  The same fate will befall Deputy Flanagan when he makes mistakes which he is bound to make because of his irresponsible and reckless approach to problems.  His appointment now is a sorry joke.  Forget the horse trading in relation to Army efficiency.  Get down to the basis of military efficiency and ensure that the Army is fit and able to deal with an emergency situation in an effective way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> There are other matters regarding the Defence Forces which are disturbing the minds of the people and one of them is the selection of cadets. The method of selection is suspect and must be examined at the earliest possible opportunity.  The diversion of key officers into dead-end positions is horrifying.  When influence is used in the selection of personnel there is a continuity of corruption that can only lead to a terrible situation in the future.  Some realism must be brought to bear and there must be a fair method of selection and promotion. As the Taoiseach is the defence dictator, I would appeal to him to show some responsibility at this late stage and ensure that those people who have served the nation wisely over the years will be duly appreciated and will get promotion on the basis of merit and then on seniority, all other things being equal.</P>
    <P>One small section of the Army which has no military value should not be singled out as the only avenue for promotion to senior rank and as the most important area in the Defence Forces to which a person could direct his energies if he wanted to be promoted.  If this particular racket continues then many people will have second thoughts about the equitation school and its continuity and will judge it in a very different light.  The selling of horses is no substitute for military efficiency and promotions should be based on efficiency and merit.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to the difficulty one experiences in trying to obtain information about the Defence Forces and their activities abroad. Even by writing to the Secretary General of the United Nations one cannot break through the barrier, the purpose of which seems to be to ensure that information will not be given to the Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the reports which I saw time and time again from the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to the Congo operation.  What is printed in them has turned out to be a tissue of lies and when I endeavoured to get further information <Col N="716" /> to counteract those lies in the United Nations' official report I was told by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that some of the information that the United Nations had could not be revealed until the people who gave it were dead.  A book published by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has substantiated what I say now, that many of the reports of the United Nations dealing with the activities on which I sought information concerning members of the Defence Forces in action abroad were a tissue of lies that must have percolated from the United Nations Organisation in the Congo at the time.  This was the responsibility of Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien, now Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Until matters like this are corrected and factual and full information is given to this House to enable us to assess fully the credibility of the work done by Irish soldiers abroad, a serious doubt must remain in my mind about the coverup by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. It was his office and he was responsible, and when the reports were published if he did not have them corrected he was again responsible for the erroneous reports now in the library of this House.</P>
    <P>For a considerable period, three years, there have been no promotions in the FCA to senior rank.  Nevertheless, the Taoiseach can promote officers in the equitation school and make personal appointments there while men in the field training personnel to combat subversive organisations and to maintain security within the State are completely disregarded. It is illogical that there should be personal promotion at this stage within the Defence Forces when members who have been entitled to promotion for the last three years are overlooked, cast aside and not allowed to do their duty as they should be, and are not getting promotion to which they are entitled.  Members who should have been promoted and who want to soldier on and serve this nation loyally and faithfully are now reaching the age limit.  They now find themselves phased out into civilian life because of lack of opportunity. <Col N="717" /> It is illogical that personal promotions would take place while promotions are due in the field and are not being given to the people entitled to them.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be some sanity in relation to defence affairs and to promotion for not alone the permanent Defence Forces but also the FCA.  It is a disgrace that the matter has been handled in this shabby way.  If a man has got a horse and a tall hat he does not register for promotion in the eyes of the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>We had the dictation of the Taoiseach in relation to other matters that have disturbed the Defence Forces.  I am not going into detail on all the matters that have disturbed the minds of many persons serving in the Defence Forces.  They are all too well known to the Taoiseach because in many cases he was responsible.  He is the dictator.  He is the Papadopolous directing the activities. He is the man who prompts the Ministers to make silly pronouncements. I would not be surprised if the statement made recently in a military barracks at Mullingar had, beforehand, got some prompting from the Taoiseach and other members of the Cabinet as to what he might say, and he probably said it in the wrong way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a situation in the Curragh where a prison was built in the middle of a military barracks.  I understand that the Taoiseach was responsible for this decision, that he was partly or to a large extent responsible for the selection of this site, a site that has caused concern to military personnel, officers, NCOs and men, in the Curragh Camp.  I hope that serious matters such as the location of a prison in the middle of a military establishment such as the Curragh will not be repeated in the future.  It is a serious situation that has caused great concern and made the post vulnerable.  Maybe that is the reason why it is left lying aside.  The House has been misled in relation to this <Col N="718" /> prison by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on one occasion when he answered questions in relation to defence on the Estimates that were before this House.</P>

The collective responsibility of the Government lay in that each and every member knew the reason why the prison was being built and the circumstances under which it was built, but this House was misled by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on the occasion of an Estimate here. When I questioned him in relation to it he told me that no prison was being built in the Curragh.  When I asked the reason why it was built there and mentioned how it had disturbed the minds of personnel serving there and how it made the post more vulnerable than it was, the Minister misled this House.</P>

      <P>Such promotions disturb the minds of responsible people and those who are members of the Defence Forces.  I want to get back to the question of the appointment of Deputy Oliver Flanagan.  As I stated earlier, the appointment of a Minister for Defence in a period of national emergency is most important and the confidence and the credibility of the individual are all-important.  When we look across the page of history what do we find in relation to the man now being appointed as Minister for Defence?  We find that he has been adjudged absolutely irresponsible. These are not my words, they are the words of other people.  One wonders why he was promoted and how he was promoted.  It is very disturbing when the man can announce his own promotion. What hidden or open influence is there behind this promotion?  It is disturbing in this particular appointment to have influences outside of the House operating.  We would like the Taoiseach to come out into the open and tell us the pressures which were applied to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Oliver Flanagan has been a long time in the House.  He has been described in many ways in different <Col N="720" /> countries.  He has been described as O.J. Flanagan, MP, in one country because that is the way he signed the register.  I want to deal, first of all, with the suitability of this man for the post of Minister for Defence.  On 13th November, 1972 we had a very important debate on the Offences Against the State Bill.  I want to quote some of the statements made by Deputy Flanagan before I deal further with his appointment and his other actions in the past to show how completely unsuitable he is for this post.  During the Second Stage debate of the Offences Against the State Bill, 1972 in Volume 264, column 563 of the Official Report he stated:</P>
    <P>I left this House with a clear conscience.  Although I had no guarantee I would return here I considered I had performed a noble and just act and so long as I was at peace with myself I knew I had justified my membership of this House.  There is nothing more difficult to live with as an uneasy conscience.  Therefore, a Bill of this kind must be examined by every Deputy and each one of us must realise that he will have to live with his conscience.</P>
    <P>He went on to say in column 564 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>...to cow the people and to threaten them with tanks, bayonets and with stripes on uniforms.  We have seen an example of this recently in this country.</P>
    <P>This shows the type of man Deputy Flanagan is and his respect for law and order on that occasion with his references in the House in relation to the Offences Against the State Bill, in relation to the role of the Army and the role they would play in relation to offences against the State.  He was the only member of the Fine Gael Party to vote against the closing Stages of that Bill.  This is the man we now have with those bayonets, stripes and authority over those people.  This is the man who is now being put in charge of the Defence Forces.  He had contempt for law and order, as indicated in his speech in the House on the Second Stage of the <Col N="721" /> Offences Against the State Bill.  We are now in a period of national emergency and this man is being put in charge of our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I want to go further to show the type of man Deputy Flanagan is and how irresponsible he is.  This is not alone on our assessment but on that of the Judiciary in relation to aspects they examined of the reckless and irresponsible action of Deputy Flanagan in this House in relation to another matter.  I will point out a few items to show how hypocritical this man is and the type of man the Taoiseach is now appointing to the very sensitive area of defence where he will have under his command thousands of men whom he despised in the House.  This man had contempt in 1972 for the officers, NCOs and men of the Defence Forces and for the security of the State.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach only gave three or four lines of a statement to the House this morning.  He gave no explanation of Deputy Flanagan's suitability.  He could not do so because he knows the man is completely unsuitable.  I want to quote from the Locke's Distillery Report of Tribunal, 1947.  The report states:</P>
    <P>In like manner, we found it necessary to exercise extreme caution in dealing with the evidence of Deputy Flanagan.  We found him very uncandid and much disposed to answer questions unthinkingly as if he were directing his replies elsewhere than to the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>He showed complete disrespect for the tribunal on that occasion.  The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>On several occasions he contradicted himself and was disposed to shift his ground, when he found that answers already given would lead him where he did not wish to go.  He was, on other occasions, in conflict with testimony which we believed to be true.  In respect of two matters we are satisfied that he told us what he knew to be untrue. One of these was of little importance save as a test of his credibility. The other was of some importance. He denied that he took <Col N="722" /> any notes of his first interview with Mr. Cooney, Junior.  Mr. Cooney said he did and was not cross-examined upon this.  Recalled specially upon this point towards the close of our sittings, Mr. Cooney repeated this evidence and again was not cross-examined.</P>
    <P>Those learned gentlemen who sat on that tribunal went on to say:</P>
    <P>We are satisfied, and so find, that Deputy Flanagan did take notes at this interview and we can attribute his denial only to the supposition that the notes, if produced, would not substantiate his evidence as to what Mr. Cooney told him.  In the circumstances, in so far as the matter is material, we feel more disposed to accept Mr. Cooney's evidence relating to that interview than that of Deputy Flanagan.</P>
    <P>Those are the words not of a politician but of the learned gentlemen from the bench who sat on this particular occasion.  On page 17 of this report they go on to state:</P>
    <P>We found it quite impossible to follow or appreciate Deputy Flanagan's ever shifting evidence as to the meaning to be attached to the allegation that a Minister of State had a keen personal interest in the sale of the Distillery.  There is not a scintilla of evidence that any Minister had a particle of such interest.  The charge is an extremely grave one.  We are satisfied that it is wholly untrue, that it is entirely without foundation and that it was made with a degree of recklessness amounting to complete irresponsibility.</P>
    <P>They are not my words or the words of a politician.  They are the words of a responsible member of the Judiciary, who found him completely, absolutely reckless and irresponsible. That is the man that the Taoiseach has promoted or has been forced to promote to the position of Minister for Defence.  Deputy Flanagan announced his own promotion and at a later stage after some hassle the Taoiseach decided to fall in line.  No reasons were given in this House as to why this man has been proposed <Col N="723" /> for the position.  This man who has been adjudged by the Judiciary as reckless and irresponsible will now be in charge of a vital force at a time of national emergency.  How low can we sink?  What pressures were applied by non-elected representatives behind the scenes to ensure that this man was promoted?  Before this debate is over we may have an indication of the pressures that were applied.  The tribunal also said:</P>
    <P>We accept, without reserve, the evidence of Senator Quirke and Miss Quirke with reference to the gold watch and also the evidence of Dr. de Valera and the Taoiseach. In our opinion there is no foundation to this allegation and we consider that the charge contained was made with extravagant references and complete absence of a sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to support that man.  In Schedule 21 of this tribunal 49 persons who gave evidence on oath are named.  I am not merely throwing charges across this House.  This is evidence given by people on oath and it is the assessment of the members of the Judiciary who examined the situation. How many times in the future will we have to deal with Deputy Flanagan's irresponsibility in the House?  On all too many occasions in the past we heard Deputy Flanagan's irresponsible charges in this House. This report shows the type of man Deputy Flanagan is and that is the type of man that the Taoiseach chooses to put into this sensitive post during a period of national emergency. One would think that the Taoiseach, who gave military service to this nation, who served this nation in arms, wisely and well, would have some respect for the people who are now serving, and for the security of the nation in the future, and that he would not put this position into the hands of an irresponsible political pauper who will make statements of one type or another to project himself. As a result of this tribunal, Deputy Flanagan was shown up for the man he is, by responsible people in a responsible manner.  Having been <Col N="724" /> given the benefit of the doubt, he has been assessed as being irresponsible and reckless.  If Deputy Flanagan made these charges before, he will make them again.  Despite these charges of the past, the Taoiseach has chosen to put this man in charge of the Defence Forces.  This man has been regarded as being irresponsible and as a liar before a tribunal.</P>

      <P>I base my argument on what the learned gentlemen of this tribunal heard in evidence.  I did not hear all the evidence but these men are beyond reproach and that was their assessment of the situation. Many times in this booklet Deputy Flanagan's absolute disregard for the truth, his irresponsibility in dealing with the affairs of State is shown. This is the most sensitive ministry in the Cabinet and it calls for dedication and responsibility of the highest order. Over the years we have been accustomed to Deputy Flanagan's reckless approach to every matter that has come before the House.  This is the man above all other men that the Taoiseach chooses to put into this sensitive position.  The Taoiseach should be charged with absolute and complete irresponsibility if in the knowledge of the contents of this report he proposes Deputy Flanagan as Minister for Defence.  The members of the Judiciary called it reckless irresponsibility. They are being kind. They regard it as extravagant recklessness and a complete absence of a sense of responsibility.  The Taoiseach now asks this House to accept this man as Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces are vital in a period of national emergency and this man has been proposed to fill the position of Minister for Defence and this House has been asked to accept this man and to vote confidence in this man who has been adjudged as reckless and irresponsible by responsible <Col N="725" /> members of the Judiciary.  It is too sad that members of the Defence Forces will now be saddled with such a man.  The appointment of this man amounts to recklessness and complete irresponsibility.  The Taoiseach knows the facts and he knows the man so it is complete and absolute irresponsibility to promote him to this position.  What pressures were applied by this man, this self-appointed Minister, on the Taoiseach?  This man must have a great hold over the Taoiseach that he can dictate what post he will take and how he will operate.  Having regard to the evidence presented by responsible members of the Judiciary, it is beyond comprehension that any Taoiseach would promote a man who was as reckless and irresponsible.  These men were kind in their assessment of the Deputy.  Some 49 persons gave evidence on oath before the tribunal and they indicated he was absolutely irresponsible, that he was guilty of recklessness and complete irresponsibility.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to approve the appointment of a man guilty of all these things to a sensitive post.  Is that the respect the Taoiseach has for the dedicated members of the Defence Forces, that he would put a man of this calibre to deal with this important Department?  He is appointing a man whose evidence the tribunal found was wholly untrue and entirely without foundation and which was made with a degree of recklessness amounting to complete irresponsibility.  That is the person being appointed to the vital area of defence.  Whatever faults Deputy Donegan may have, he may have been acting on the advice of the Taoiseach or other members of the Cabinet.  He may have been prompted before he went to Mullingar barracks and he may have been encouraged to say what he would not have uttered normally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is necessary because it does not seem to be getting through.  If anything seems to be offensive in this House it usually means it is getting to the target.  There is plenty of other material I can use. The Deputy can speak next if he is allowed.  I will not be muzzled.  If the Deputy wishes to make a contribution, he can do so.  With regard to the proposed appointment of Deputy Flanagan to the office of Minister for Defence, we have shown clearly that he is completely unsuited for this sensitive post.  The hypocrisy attached to this debate is appalling.  We know that pressures must have been applied and in years to come this appointment will be a joke.  I have no doubt that the lobby trotters of Fine Gael and Labour will ensure that this man who has been judged irresponsible by the learned gentlemen who dealt with the tribunal will be appointed to this important post.  We are being asked to appoint such a man to a sensitive position in a period of national emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope some sanity will prevail before this debate is completed.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will reconsider the situation and take the right action.  Perhaps he will be courageous enough to remedy the situation.  He has all the facts.  He knows the situation and the man and knows the kind of evidence he gave to the tribunal.  What would happen in a period of national emergency if such a man were in the vital area of defence, a man who disregarded truth and common sense and whose tissue of lies were disregarded by the Judiciary?  How can we expect such a man to operate in the sensitive <Col N="728" /> area of defence where the lives of thousands of men and the security of the nation may be at stake?  When the lobby trotters vote through the appointment today, they will be doing a great disservice to the nation and to the House.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Taoiseach even at this late hour to reconsider the appointment on the basis of the man's track record, on the basis of his irresponsible approach, and on the basis of the assessment of the man by the Judiciary.  He should be assessed on that basis, not on the bricks he can fire from the Government benches, and not on the manner in which he will try to bolster up the fallen arches of the Coalition Government.  What is the pay-off for?  It is important to ask: why the pay-off at this stage?  Why is he being paid off?  He is one of the most junior of the Parliamentary Secretaries. What hold has he got over the Taoiseach?  What did he say to the Taoiseach?  He is a self-appointed Minister.</P>
    <P>For the first time the Taoiseach indicated this morning that he was appointing Deputy Flanagan as Minister for Defence, but Deputy Flanagan indicated himself that he was to be promoted.  What hold has he over the Taoiseach?  Why was he able to make an announcement of his own promotion? These are questions which will be asked and which must be answered. Over the years Deputy Flanagan has proved himself in many ways.  This document proves that.  He is the most professional character assassin in the business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have to withdraw the words &ldquo;character assassin&rdquo;, I will say the man is a stranger to the truth.  He is the most professional stranger to the truth in this House. The members of the tribunal were not politicians.  It is a sorry state of affairs that, in a national emergency, the Taoiseach should decide to appoint such a man.  Deputy Flanagan is a <Col N="729" /> nice man to meet outside the division lobbies.  He is a pleasant person to speak with, and he is a good friend of mine.  Nevertheless, his appointment to this high office is another matter. His appointment at this time in this sensitive area is another matter.</P>
      <P>It has been proven, not by Members of this House but by members of the Judiciary, that he was absolutely irresponsible and reckless.  The evidence he gave was disregarded as being untrue. This is the man the Taoiseach now asks this House to accept as Minister for Defence.  This is a man in whom the House is being asked to vote confidence.  We will see what the lobby trotters will do today.  How irresponsible can the Taoiseach be in presenting a man like that to this House as Minister for Defence, knowing his track record, knowing the mind of the man, and knowing how reckless he was?  At that time he was not a member of the Fine Gael Party. He is now and he is acceptable with all his faults and with all his warts. The Taoiseach should tell us why he is promoting him and what pressures were applied for that promotion.  He has not told us why a character assassin is being promoted.</P>

At that tribunal those gentlemen sifted through all the evidence.  On Saturday 7th February, 1948, immediately after the general election, Deputy Flanagan who headed the poll in Laois-Offaly sent a telegram to Mr. de Valera: &ldquo;Laois-Offaly's answer to the Locke Tribunal leaves no doubt as to the belief in the existence of corruption.  Eagerly awaiting the assembly of Dáil Éireann to reopen this and other similar public scandals&rdquo;.  In all the years since, he has not reopened that or the other public scandals.  He has an opportunity <Col N="731" /> to come into the House today and reopen it and wipe the slate clean if he can.  Let him come in here and project himself as an honourable and honest man who is suited to this important post of Minister for Defence. I believe there will be no answer to this challenge to Deputy Flanagan. He will hide behind the curtains until the lobby trotters are forced into the division lobbies, but that does not alter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is important to note that no other Member of the Fine Gael Party trotted in with the Labour Party on that occasion but Deputy O.J. Flanagan, the only Member disowned and disregarded by every other Member of Fine Gael on that vital question.

      <Col N="735" /> At the time of that important debate on the Offences Against the State Act Deputy O.J. Flanagan was plotting to overthrow his own Leader.  One wonders what pressure was exerted on the Leader after Deputy Flanagan made his announcement about this appointment.  After the bombs had fallen Deputy Flanagan still indicated his contempt for his Leader and the party by trotting into the division lobbies, disregarding the views expressed in relation to a very sensitive and delicate period during which this legislation was debated.  Even after the bombs had fallen Deputy O.J. Flanagan trooped into the division lobbies, having criticised the Defence Forces with, as he said, their tanks, bayonets and stripes.  This is the man who is now being deemed fit to assume responsibility for the Department of Defence.  At column 568 of the Official Report for 30th November, 1972, Deputy Flanagan said:</P>
    <P>That is why I say section 5 of this Bill is a section which one would expect to be drafted by Fidel Castro or by a legislator such as Bulganin. This is undemocratic in all its forms. How can Fianna Fáil think they can say that this country cannot exist unless we have a law passed that every person who has a map, a photograph or a plan in his possession which, in the opinion of a garda, is not on him for a good reason can be thrown into jail?</P>
    <P>I wonder what would the Deputy have to say about a man who was found to have in his possession a map of a military barracks.  If we are to have regard to what the Deputy said in 1972, he would not regard such a matter as being serious.  According to him anybody who wished should be free to have in his possession maps of military installations or plans designed to effect the sabotage of such installation.  All of this is an indication of the total irresponsibility of the Deputy.  As a lawyer, the Taoiseach must realise the extent of the Deputy's irresponsibility. During the sensitive area of which I have been speaking, the Deputy was plotting to overthrow his Leader.  In announcing his intention to appoint <Col N="736" /> this man as Minister for Defence, the Taoiseach did not endeavour to illustrate in what way Deputy Flanagan is suited to this post although we know that while attending a royal wedding on one occasion the Deputy referred to himself as an MP.  He has appointed himself to the Department of Defence. On a number of occasions he has made it clear that he was the man for the job.</P>
    <P>Leaks from the Department of Defence can be serious to the extent that this is the Department dealing with the security of the nation but we are now to have a man of leaks in charge of that Department.  He is like a colander.  However, we can only hope that common sense will prevail before this debate is concluded and that the Taoiseach will have second thoughts about this appointment.  But should the appointment be proceeded with, even the simplest piece of information concerning the Department will be leaked to the Press if it is considered to have any political value in the Deputy's constituency. There will be no such concept as confidential information in relation to the Department of Defence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening for a long time to Deputy Flanagan making serious allegations here but nobody appears to pay any heed to him.  Perhaps he is ignored because he is irresponsible.  However, I shall not pursue the point.  I have no wish to <Col N="737" /> embarrass the Taoiseach or the lobby trotters of the Government who will be asked to move into the division lobbies to support a man who has been described in a variety of ways by some learned judges.</P>
      <P>I think I have dealt adequately with the question of the Deputy's suitability for the responsibility being entrusted to him but before I conclude there are a couple of matters I should like to mention.  During a debate of this kind it is important that we keep an open mind and that we view the entire scene on a broad basis.  It appears that the promotion of Deputy Flanagan arises from either of two reasons.  It may stem either from his having something on the Taoiseach or from his agreeing to be a puppet in the minstrel show operated by the Taoiseach. The office of Minister for Defence is one for a man of merit, a man with a mind of his own.  Deputy Flanagan's appointment is a self-appointment. He had let us know about it long before we had the informal announcement from the Taoiseach who, in a mere few words, told us of the intention to promote the Deputy.  It is an appointment which is out of fashion since the Deputy has neither a horse nor a bowler hat. Therefore, some other pressures must have been applied in order that Deputy Flanagan would get this appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the whole question of the sorry state of affairs that has led up to this embarrassing situation and I say it is embarrassing because of the manner in which the Taoiseach dealt with it, his bringing of Members of this House into the division lobby in defence of Deputy Donegan and then deciding to apply the axe so that the former Minister for Defence was an outcast from his party, an outcast from the Government when he got the axe from the Taoiseach.  The savage and vicious way in which it was done prompted sympathy from even this side of the House.  I felt sympathy for Deputy Donegan notwithstanding his irresponsibility and his shortcomings because of the way the Taoiseach's axe fell on him, the Taoiseach one day expressing confidence in him and <Col N="738" /> a few days later giving him the boot. This shows pressures were applied to the Taoiseach from some source and he yielded to those pressures.  As I said, Deputy Donegan's period in defence was not a very happy one.  We know about the illegal promotions and how the regulations had to be changed.</P>
    <P>One wonders why the Taoiseach left the decision to remove Deputy Donegan so long having put the House to the trouble of discussing the matter and bringing his supporters into the division lobbies.  We would hope promotions henceforth in defence would be on an orderly basis, on the basis of merit and seniority, everything else being equal.  We would hope a man's ability to ride a horse would not supersede military efficiency or technical ability or service.  The morale of the Defence Forces has been completely shattered because of the way in which promotions were handled.  The career prospects of men who dedicated their lives to the service of the nation have been shattered. I hope the appointment of Deputy Flanagan will not bring another rash of irresponsible promotions.  The last thing I would like is a Defence Minister as a puppet of the Taoiseach. Apparently the Taoiseach will retain the say so.  If he wants to be Minister for Defence, let him step down from this present position and be Minister for Defence.  He has acted as Minister for Defence for the last few days. Let him not appoint a puppet and, when he does appoint a Minister, let him give the appointee the necessary power.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has appointed the wrong man.  I know senior and junior officers and men who were embarrassed in Mullingar because of the disgraceful manner in which the highest office in the land, that of President, was attacked.  We did not find any officer on that occasion being expelled or those who clapped the then Minister being expelled.  Responsible officers there bowed their heads in shame.  We hope there will not be ever again a repetition of this bar room brawl.  We hope we will never have another Minister for Defence making <Col N="739" /> such reckless and irresponsible references to the highest office in the land.</P>
    <P>We know the shortcomings of Deputy Oliver Flanagan.  We know how prone he is to seeking publicity. He is now going into a very sensitive area and it is important that in a period of national emergency like this the Taoiseach would act with the responsibility befitting such an appointment. As the debate progresses, we hope the Taoiseach will have second thoughts and bring some realism into the situation.  We hope common sense will prevail and that we will have a Minister for Defence capable of acting on his own without dictation from the Taoiseach.  I hope that the Taoiseach will learn from the debate and take note of the problems that can develop when irresponsible people, people regarded as reckless by the Judiciary, are put into high office, such as that of Minister for Defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is about corruption, jobs for the boys and hypocrisy.  In the past three-and-a-half years this country has been presided over by a Government the members of which have corrupted public life by ruthlessly undermining the institutions of the State.  We have a Government who, on the one hand, preach law and order and, on the other hand, make the most blatant and in some instances malodorous political appointments.  They preach the defence of democratic institutions and, at the same time, by their behaviour they undermine the very institutions they pretend to defend.  The whole fabric of life throughout the civil service, the Army, the legal profession and possibly even this House has not remained untouched by the Government's capacity to corrupt the concept of decency in public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that about the legal profession and the Parliamentary Secretary need not put words into my mouth that I did not say.  The Parliamentary Secretary has <Col N="740" /> a great capacity for that sort of thing. I am suggesting that the jobs-for-the-boys syndrome runs as a corrupt thread and has a corrupting influence on the public mind and that has been evident throughout the whole period in office of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government have ruthlessly taken the opportunity to appoint one officer in the Army over another because he follows the political dictates of the Coalition.  On the other hand, there have been appointed to the Bench well-known supporters of the Government, and there is an example of this corruption, as I say, in the intellectual sense.  I am not in any way charging the people appointed.  In their own way they are decent, honourable men and men of integrity, but that does not get away from the reality of what the Government have done in the past three-and-a-half years.</P>
      <P>The civil service itself has been corrupted by the appointment of place seekers.  Supporters of the Government have been lodged in the civil service, even though on a temporary basis.  It is well-known that members of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party reside behind civil service desks during the tenure of office of this Coalition Government. That is the type of corruption they have introduced into Irish public life. I am not alleging anything against individuals. That is not my style, and I do not think it should be the style in Irish politics.  What I am pointing out is the corrupting influence, the undermining of the entitlement of the citizen to seek a job in fair competition against his or her fellow citizens, through formal competition or otherwise. A competition throws up the best person, not always but most times, and the &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; would be applying for positions through newspaper advertisements.</P>

      <P>I am speaking on the motion that this Dáil has confidence in the person designated by the Taoiseach to be the Minister for Defence, and we are talking about collective Cabinet responsibility.  This Government came into power on what can be described as a clean ticket.  They were going to do the world and all with the civil service, the Army, the Bench and those other areas of important endeavour throughout our society.  What have they done with them?  I think I have outlined in brief what they have done with them. They have attempted to heighten in the minds of the people the principle that if you support the Coalition you will get your reward for so doing.  It is the jobs-for-the-boys syndrome brought to a fine art, and no greater practitioner in that art than the political leader of our nation.  The Taoiseach is entitled to the respect due to his office, and we give him that respect undeservedly and without equivocation, but the respect we refuse to give him is in relation to his role as a greater practitioner of the art of jobs for the boys than any other member of the Government.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that the motion is on the nomination of a member of the Government by the Taoiseach.  Social or economic policy <Col N="742" /> or such matters may not be discussed under this motion.  They have recently been discussed in the House.  The Deputy may, if he wishes, make reference to the resultant reallocation of Departments that have been made recently, but discussion of recent events in regard to the resignation of the President are not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate and understand the guidelines you have set for me, Sir.  The Taoiseach, who, in a temporary capacity, took upon himself the mantle of the Minister for Defence, is falling into the same trap as brought about the recent presidential crisis, which uplifted from the presidency one of the finest people ever to grace Irish life as a judge either in this country or in Europe, who stepped down on a question of principle from the highest office this land can offer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but what I am saying is that what brought about that crisis was not entirely the utterance of the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Donegan.  As Deputy Dowling said, basically Deputy Donegan is a very decent man.  It is not my intention to engage in making him a public whipping post.  The unfortunate man was probably under strain at the time.  Let us be fair to him. Having had the decency to offer his resignation to the Taoiseach on a number of occasions, he effectively was exonerated and the responsibility for his continuation in office fell on the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come back to my point about the use of the Army as a political vehicle.  On the occasion the Ministers for Defence and Justice were in Mullingar the then Minister for Defence uttered his unfortunate remarks. He had as an audience Army personnel but the Minister for Defence made a political speech.  It is a dangerous principle to be using the Army for political purposes, either for making <Col N="743" /> political appointments as has been done or for the making of political speeches.  The Army has never been found wanting in the service of this nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>On the question of using the Army as a political vehicle and the dangers of doing so, it is clear that the occasion which gave rise to the crisis I am not allowed to mention is understandably unmentionable in Coalition terms.  On Monday the Taoiseach fell back into this practice of using a visitation to the Army as a political occasion and trotted out a law and order message once more.  It is probable that down the road from where the Taoiseach was speaking a post office was being robbed or an old woman was being hit over the head. That is the reality of the situation.  It should not be allowed happen.  My advice to the Coalition is &ldquo;Hands off the Army and the Garda Síochána&rdquo;. They should be seen to be independent within the context of the framework of the State.</P>

      <P>I am making my point.  I am not going to enter into a character assassination of the person who will become Minister for Defence. It appears that the only way one can contribute on the motion is to engage in that insidious practice. It is not my intention to do that.  I thought this debate allowed us discuss the collective responsibility of the Government and the whole area of Government and their performance or lack of performance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume I can discuss matters which were not discussed recently.  The capacity of the Government to go off on frolics of their own was very much in evidence recently. The Minister for Finance made a statement recently about the proposed abandonment of children's allowances and that information was communicated to the Tánaiste through the newspaper; one Minister communicating with another through the headlines of a newspaper.  That is the sort of irresponsibility we are dealing with. The Tánaiste, having been made aware of the views of the Minister for Finance on this matter, condemned the idea that children's allowances and school buses would be abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Another matter which must be seen in the light of the proposed appointment is the question of the Labour Party's condition for participating in Government made known at their recent conference for entering into a new coalition.  We have had the infamous Green Paper from the Government on the economy but there were no conclusions in that; they were all options.  Our people were asked to judge the paper and come up with the answers.  As I said recently, the Government are not prepared to govern; they run to the people every time they have a decision to make. They cannot and will not make a decision.  I hope the Deputy who is to be made Minister for Defence will never be guilty of this.  The Government have a track record second to none in the context of not doing things they promised.  The Leader of Fianna Fáil last week sought information from the Government about a proposed local security force which the Government said they would set up a couple of years ago and of course it is as dead as the dodo.  In the area with which I am charged for the time being, Opposition spokesman on Social <Col N="747" /> Welfare, we had another perfect example&mdash;and I am talking not of the past couple of years but of this year, June of this year&mdash;when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare came here, full of fire&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is again proceeding to talk on social and economic policy.  Perhaps he would listen to the Chair for a moment.  Discussion of the administration and policy of the Government as a whole or of individual members is not permissible in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may conclude that point, the Parliamentary Secretary came into the House to introduce the Social Welfare (Supplementary Allowances) Bill and we still await implementation of that legislation which was promised when the Bill was passing through this House and the Upper House.  Nothing has since been heard of it and it appears that nothing will happen for quite a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Member proposed to be Minister for Defence, I do not know what credentials he has.  I do not intend to go into his character but I assume we can discuss his personal capacity effectively to become the clown prince of Coalition, for that is what he will become, Deputy Oliver Flanagan.  It is very difficult to visualise this new role for the hot gospelling parliamentarian who could go to Princess Margaret's wedding in London and sign his name in the visitors' book as a Member of Parliament rather than as Teachta Dála. This type of behaviour worries me and his general approach to public life worries me and many other people. Discussing him in a political and not personal capacity, not in any sense of his character but rather his political performance which is what we are discussing here, when he did get the opportunity in Opposition he attempted to denigrate the reputation of decent people His attempt was unsuccessful because the reputation of those people he sought to destroy was unassailable.  They were men who since the foundation of this State have made, <Col N="748" /> and are making their contribution to Irish public life.  They are men who, if they remained in private life could be far better off in terms of cash income than they were or are having dedicated themselves to public life either in an administrative capacity or otherwise, State managers and so on. It was the reputation of these people that the next Minister for Defence attempted unsuccessfully to undermine.</P>
    <P>One can only wonder at his political capacity to take over the very important functions of Minister for Defence. He will undoubtedly become the clown prince of the Coalition, but having regard to his past behaviour one can only question the sincerity of some of it.  These are all questions, which no doubt history will answer. We are probably too near the problem to be judged and in any case to sit in judgment on another person is, in my view, a very dangerous exercise.</P>

It is not my intention to sit in judgment or be guilty, as it were, of engaging in judgment of this particular individual, far from it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair's ruling in this respect limits one to a very narrow field.  Having queried the political capacity of this individual to take up this post, may I express the hope that he can measure up&mdash;and I have the most serious and gravest doubts that he can do so&mdash;to this very important position.</P>
      <P>If blame is to be shared in relation to this appointment, in my opinion the Taoiseach must accept the burden. The Taoiseach appoints the Cabinet, the Government and individuals to very important posts.  The capacities and abilities of the individual appointed to the Department of Defence must be of a high order.  His capacity to discharge his functions as Minister must be of a high order. There are other ministries where the same efficiency and high qualities might not necessarily be required, but here is one ministry that deserves a man of the highest ability.  One can only query the ability of the person who, at the end of the day, will be Minister for Defence.  When he is Minister for Defence, I hope he will discharge his functions in a reasonable fashion and will not engage in political clowning and recognise that he is in one of the most important security positions of the State.  I consider the offices of Taoiseach, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence to be critical offices at this juncture of our history.  For this reason we express the hope that the next incumbent of the office of Minister for Defence will discharge his functions and duties with honour and dignity and that he will not be found wanting in courage.  That is an extremely important quality for the office of the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the deepest respect for the present incumbent of the Chair.  For that reason it would not be my intention to go outside his ruling, but it constrains one to a narrowness of debate. It is unfortunate that the debate cannot be widened to consider the 111,500 officially unemployed and the <Col N="752" /> 40,000 unofficially unemployed.  It is a great tragedy that we cannot have a discussion on the generation who are left stranded by the Coalition, the younger generation who are looking for work and cannot get it.  It is unfortunate that we cannot discuss the plight of the young and the not so young unemployed and the great hardship unemployment imposes on these people and the dangers to our society, particularly in the context of leaving our young people unemployed for a considerable time because when bitterness and hopelessness creep in, these young people can turn their attention to other more insidious objectives.</P>

      <P>Our proposals were put forward in the context of a general review of Directive 159 on which discussions have already commenced and in which all member states and the Commission are participating.  As I have indicated on previous occasions, our main concern is to bring more farmers into the development category. At present the identification of development farmers depends on the level of the comparable income and we have accordingly made proposals for alternative approaches to the fixing of the income figure as well as on other matters related to it.  Other proposals are designed to make the directive more adaptable and therefore <Col N="756" /> more effective.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Catches in the Celtic Sea herring fishery south of Dunmore East have been declining in recent years mainly because of poor spawning and heavy exploitation of the fishery in the past.  Since 1974, an international catch quota regime has been operated in the fishery by the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission. The quota system has not proved effective in correcting the downward level of catches mainly because the Commission in fixing the annual quotas did not fully implement the scientific recommendations made to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department proposed more severe conservation measures for the current season but these were not <Col N="759" /> acceptable to the other members of the Commission.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been worried regarding the conditions of the Celtic Sea fisheries for the past number of years since I took over this office.  I have had consultations with fishermen who fish in that sea and also I have the recommendations of the NEAFC and our scientific advisers, not only our own but those attached to other countries.  It is true to say that the scientific advice made available to us and to other countries was not acted upon.  We adopted a more liberal attitude, rightly or wrongly.  We did so because we were disinclined to reduce the catch quota too sharply.  We now find ourselves in the position that the catches are declining and possibly for the ensuing year more drastic measures must be taken. In the last year we proposed that the <Col N="760" /> catch quota would be not more than 10,000 tonnes.  Added to that proposal we asserted that we should have the final say as to how this 10,000 catch should be apportioned.  Our EEC partners did not agree with that.  Then a total catch of 10,850 tons was set down, of which we were to get 6,500 tons.  This is causing us worry.  We have frequent conversations, as I already mentioned, with all parties concerned. The Deputy can be assured that this will be kept under constant review by the Department.</P>

      <P>I share the Parliamentary Secretary's concern about the stocks at Dunmore East.  Would he take into account in any future reduction of catch the serious position of the Irish fleet there in particular and try to have their quota of the catch increased? Have they reached the quota that has been allocated to them this year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.  They have reached about two-thirds of the quota up to the present time.  We are fortunate that, with the demand exceeding supply, prices have been proportionately high.  This matter will pass over to the EEC next year and I cannot say what measures will be taken in the new circumstances so far as fisheries and their protection are concerned.</P>

Among the matters being considered by the study group is the question of more frequent and more comprehensive analysis of the live register.  The most useful information, I suppose, I could give the Deputy would be to tell him that the survey carried out by the national manpower service in 1976 for the 1975 school leavers is as follows: found employment, 49 per cent, unemployed 7 per cent, returning to school 8 per cent, got jobs on family farms, 5 per cent, emigrated 2 per cent, went into full-time higher education, 19 per cent, destination not known, 10 per cent.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> As indicated by my predecessor in reply to a question on this subject on 18th May, 1976, it is Government policy to encourage conservation in the use of energy; district heating represents a potential means of achieving energy efficiency and economy.</P>
      <P>The report entitled &ldquo;Energy Conservation in Ireland 1975-85&rdquo; which was recently published, recommended that outline plans for feasible schemes of district heating and waste incineration with or without electricity generation should be prepared without delay and should show some costbenefit parameters for each proposed scheme.  Some constraints were mentioned in the report such as the high capital cost, possible environmental damage, disruption of roads in reaching houses built some time ago and social resistance.</P>
      <P>Prior to the receipt of this report, a working party on district heating had been established in my Department.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> The answer to both questions is yes.  A new 20,000-line subscriber exchange was opened on Monday, 6th December, in Crown Alley in Central Dublin together with three new tandem exchanges and a new trunk exchange; in addition a greatly expanded system of underground junction cables was provided to interlink the new exchanges with one another and with other exchanges in the Dublin network.  The whole project will substantially improve the service in the centre of Dublin served by Crown Alley exchange and in the Dublin area generally.</P>
    <P>The new trunk exchange is a major one which will enable thousands of extra trunk circuits to be added to the main arterial system between Dublin, the main provincial exchanges and cross-channel exchanges.  Some hundreds of extra trunk circuits which could not be connected pending the opening of the new exchange have been brought into service and some thousands more will be added in the course of the next year.  These will progressively improve the STD service.</P>
    <P>Other new exchanges are being installed in Dublin &ldquo;01&rdquo; area at Blanchardstown, Balbriggan and Shankill; buildings are in course of construction for new exchanges at Belcamp, Malahide and Maynooth, others are in advance planning stages; existing exchanges are being extended in a number of centres and equipment is on order for many others, including a further major trunk switching centre for many others, including a further major trunk switching centre to cater for the rapid growth of trunk traffic in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Outside the &ldquo;01&rdquo; area similar progress is being made.  This week new automatic exchanges were opened at Thurles and Cashel.  These will be followed shortly afterwards by Templemore. Conversions of manual exchanges next year will, among others, include those at Castlebar, Ballina, Listowel, Skibbereen and Lismore.</P>
    <P>Major new automatic exchanges are planned for Galway, Cork, Limerick, and hundreds of existing automatic and trunk exchanges are to be extended including those at Cobh, Glanmire, <Col N="773" /> Mallow, Drogheda, Athlone, Tuam, Sligo, Killarney, Tullow, Droichead Nua, Kildare, Naas, Arklow, Cahir, Gorey, Wexford.  Equipment to convert about 120 manual exchanges to automatic working has been ordered.  Buildings for new key trunk switching exchanges are being built or in advanced planning stages for a number of centres including Cork, Tralee, Limerick, Galway, Sligo, Athlone, Mullingar and Waterford.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned how the new trunk exchange in Dublin will help to improve the trunk service throughout the country by enabling thousands of extra circuits to be connected.  These circuits will come from numerous major trunking schemes which have been in progress for some time such as the upgrading of the southern co-axial cable, from 600 to 2,700 circuits. Plans are in hand to improve the service on every route where extra circuiting is needed.  The co-axial cable to the north-west will, for example, be supplemented by a high capacity microwave route.</P>
    <P>Plans for a new direct cross-Channel microwave route with capacity for thousands of circuits are well advanced and the scheme is expected to be completed in about two years.  Improvements in direct dialling services which have been arranged include extension of the range of these services to Britain and abroad.  Next week STD service will be opened between the &ldquo;01&rdquo; area and Birmingham, Glasgow, Manchester and Liverpool.  These facilities will be extended to the larger automatic exchanges outside Dublin next year.  Early in the New Year the international subscriber dialling facilities at present available from central Dublin city to most countries in western Europe will be provided to a number of countries beyond Europe including the USA, Canada, Australia and Japan.  They will be extended later in the year to all non-coinbox telephones in the &ldquo;01&rdquo; area.</P>
    <P>Telephone development schemes of the kind I have mentioned make heavy demand on capital.  The investment in most cases does not begin to produce benefits in service improvements or revenue for several years.  To enable <Col N="774" /> new improvement schemes to be undertaken in good time it is essential that the necessary capital be made available and that there should be an assurance of its future availability to meet the heavy costs to be incurred over a number of years.  The £175 million provided for in the Telephone Capital Act, 1973, enabled hundreds of new schemes to put in hand.  Since March, 1973, about £135 million has been invested in the system compared with about £45 million in the corresponding period previously.  That is in ordinary terms without making allowance for inflation.  If one makes allowance for inflation, it is £105 million in this period since this Government came into office, compared with £56 million in the previous corresponding period at 1973-74 prices.  Much of this investment has gone into schemes which are still in progress.</P>
    <P>The £175 million authorised to be spent under the 1973 Act will be exhausted in the course of the coming year and a new Telephone Capital Bill will be required.  This Bill which will obviously have to provide for some hundreds of millions of pounds will give the House an opportunity for a full discussion of plans for improvement of the telephone service.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister has given a long list of figures and projections but I should like to know how soon he expects to have all these exchanges functioning.  It is no good telling us plans are in hand.  Has the Minister seen the report of the Confederation of Irish Industry which blamed the telephone service for many problems which industry is facing?  Will the Minister tell the House when he expects those projects to be completed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a great deal of material in my reply. The Deputy's question seemed to call for it because he asked for an extended statement regarding plans for the development of the telephone service and I gave him a fairly detailed, considered statement.  I appreciate there was quite a lot to take in all at once but if he studies it he can see that in a number of cases I gave <Col N="775" /> precise dates as, for instance, next week.  Wherever it was possible to give reasonably precise dates I did so.  I listed a number of projects for next year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may take it in relation to the other projects beyond next year that the Department will endeavour to bring these home as quickly as possible but, of course, it is not possible to pinpoint those more distant so easily.  I think any fairminded person who looks at the record will see there is a speeded up pace of development in the telephone service and we hope to maintain that.  I must point out, as the Deputy insists on this point and is concerned about what he regards as the slowness of development, the development of the service depends on the rate of investment.  In 1971-72 investment was running at £11.4 million and in 1975 it was running at £44.6 million so, whatever fault Deputies opposite may find with this Government, I think they cannot put all the blame on them for failure to develop the telephone service in which we have invested at a far greater rate than they did.  We found a very bad telephone service indeed and I believe we will leave it in much better shape than we found it.</P>

      <P>Certainly not and I have never made that absurd claim.  It would be an absurd claim. Of course, the CII were absolutely right to put an emphasis on the drawbacks and shortcomings of the telephone service.  I think they recognise, and I talked to some of them at the opening of Crown Alley, that a serious effort is now being put in to catch up in this area.  They made a number of general complaints.  They called for an extension of automatic telephone exchange facilities throughout the country. Quite clearly that is a project which is going ahead and going ahead much faster than previously.  There have been a number of improvements <Col N="776" /> in trunk dialling facilities in and out of Dublin.  In my statement I have detailed the things that are being done there and the things that have been done recently have in fact happened since the publication of the CII report which, I think, would not have been couched in exactly the same terms if it had come after instead of before the opening of the major new installations, particularly at Crown Alley and Cork.</P>

      <P>There is a little bit of slippage.  New exchange buildings have been provided at Carnew and Shillelagh.  The automatic exchange equipment has been ordered for both places.  Their conversion to automatic working is dependent on the power extension of the automatic trunk exchange at Gorey for which equipment has also been orderd.  The forecast now given for conversion at Carnew and Shillelagh is about mid-1978 and that is related to the time required by the contractor to manufacture and install the equipment at the exchanges in question and at Gorey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I see this appointment as an attempt by the Government to try to bolster up the constituency of Laois-Offaly, because it is a constituency, along with many more, that has been completely let down by the Coalition.  I understand <Col N="791" /> that Deputy Flanagan is today in Mountmellick turning a sod for a proposed advance factory.  Three years ago the National Coalition turned three sods, in Edenderry, Tullamore and Birr.  The factories were erected by the IDA but are now unoccupied. There is a great deal of talk about all kinds of industry coming to the area, but that is all we hear; nobody is moving in, and all this has cost the taxpayer over £500,000.</P>
      <P>In Offaly last year the net loss of jobs was approximately 600, and no new industry has been attracted there since the Coalition came into office.  I have no hesitation in saying that that is the reason why they are now giving a ministerial appointment to Laois-Offaly. However, they will not hoodwink the people of Laois-Offaly.  It is a constituency in which you must deliver the goods and there is no use in just talking about this, that or the other.  The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Flanagan has in the past been a great man for kite-flying but as he will be in the Cabinet after we have gone through the lobbies here, I presume he will have to adhere to collective decisions taken by the Government. I do not know whether he will or not; knowing Deputy Flanagan, I realise he could go anyway or everyway. In any event, Laois-Offaly will be expecting from him some radical changes in the policy of the Government, and also in regard to hospitalisation in Offaly, they will be expecting a change of heart by the Government on this important issue. The County hospital in Offaly is being downgraded and turned into a community hospital, better known as a home for the aged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>When the proposed Minister comes to the constituency everything will be relevant and people will make it known to him what is relevant.  The Taoiseach and all members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties must know that we have them on the run, and this <Col N="792" /> appointment is the last effort to bolster up the Coalition before they head for the country in the New Year.  Before the last election the Coalition candidates said what they were going to do and what we did not do.  The record will show that in Laois-Offaly we achieved more in industrial development in our last three-and-a-half years of office than has been achieved under this regime.  The Parliamentary Secretary may laugh if he likes. He might not like to hear the facts, but that is the situation.  The Government have been trying to deceive the people in a number of speeches over the last few months in regard to taxation, saying what they will do when it comes to the budget.  Running into an election year they will give a sop here and a sop there.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to deal with the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Flanagan, from a personal point of view, but I would like to know what he will do for the constituency of Laois-Offaly when he is appointed Minister for Defence.  This area is going through a very bad time from the point of view of employment. Thousands of school leavers are unable to get employment anywhere. They are coming to the labour exchange daily and the Government now find themselves unable to finance the Bord na Móna third programme.  This constituency, and especially Offaly, has a vast amount of bog and it is due to the amount of bog that the roads there are in such bad condition.  The Government were supposed to be committed to this expansion programme for Bord na Móna, but they cannot find the capital for this purpose now.  The people of Laois-Offaly will be looking to the new Minister for Defence to do something about that.  There is no point in digging sods here and sods there; when you erect the factories, you must be in a position to employ people in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have failed to do that.  The incentives offered have been unattractive.  The grant available in Laois-Offaly at the moment is around 25 per cent.  That is no good.  The Parliamentary Secretary is not here now.  He is down in Laois being congratulated <Col N="793" /> by everybody.  Nevertheless, this will be on the record.  He must take note of what I am saying and bring back my views to his colleagues in the Cabinet so that they will be made aware of the position in the constituency of Laois-Offaly.  I am sure they are aware of the situation in that constituency because the Taoiseach would have not made this appointment if he was not so aware. I see it as a bolstering-up job to try to hold on to the third seat.  I do not think they will be able to do that because the people of the constituency will realise that it is the last post in an effort to pretend that the constituency is getting something.  After almost four years in Government it is late in the day to be doing that.  The people of Offaly will be looking for a change of heart in regard to hospitalisation in the county.  They view that situation with great concern and I have no doubt they will be looking to the new Minister to bring about a change in that regard.  There is little use in him saying that the hospital will continue as it is for a number of years because it is being downgraded daily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have known Deputy Flanagan for many years and I get on well with him in the constituency, as I do with all the other people there but we differ in our political views.  When he was a Government backbencher he was able to go anyway and everyway but I wonder will he continue to go anyway and everyway now.  It will be interesting to see how he will go.  I hope he does not set up the Department of Defence for a propaganda exercise.  Before he got this appointment he was the mother and father at propaganda and he does not need the Department of Defence, although that Department may be able to help him out in anything he does not know in the propaganda line.  We have heard nothing but propaganda for the last two weeks about his appointment; he was being appointed and he was not being appointed.  The people in the constituency did not treat that with too <Col N="794" /> much concern but they are now wondering what he will deliver.  He will be judged by his performance as a member of the Government.  As a backbencher, he could get up outside the chapel gates and say he was not responsible for things; that if he was there it would not have happened but he cannot do that now.  He will have to tell the people the truth and the truth is that he will have to accept collective responsibility for decisions of the Government.</P>
      <P>I am not aware whether the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government knows what collective responsibility is, only time will tell, but he will not be able to go this way, that way and the other way. He will have to stay with the Cabinet as a team.  It will be interesting to see how he will try to snooker himself out of a corner when a decision is being taken, even if it affects the constituency of Laois-Offaly.  When the hospital in Tullamore was being downgraded he said that if he was there it would never have happened.  It is not too late yet; he might be able to change the thinking of the Government on this issue.  I would not be surprised, coming up to election time, if he threw out some kind of red herring. It might not be too good but he would be hoping that the people would say: &ldquo;Oliver is after giving us something&rdquo;. If that happens, the people of the constituency, a very intelligent electorate will look at the proposal closely.</P>
      <P>I wish Deputy Flanagan well and I hope he will uphold the dignity of the office.  I always got on well with my political opponents and when it came to dealing with the affairs of the constituency we always did the best we could for our people.  It will not be long until those people get an opportunity of passing judgment on him.  He should remember that he will have to deliver the goods; nothing else will do in Laois-Offaly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Connolly in congratulating Deputy Flanagan, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, on his appointment as Minister for Defence.  The appointment of a Deputy of any constituency <Col N="795" /> as a Minister confers an honour on that constituency.  We take it that the constituency is put in a privileged position and from that point of view, on behalf of my constituents, I welcome the change of mind by the Taoiseach.  The appointment of Deputy Flanagan indicates that the Taoiseach has now recognised the importance of that constituency.  For a considerable time the constituency enjoyed recognition in that capacity and quite an amount of progress was made as a result.  While I was not surprised at the appointment, many of my constituents, not of my political thinking, were surprised in 1973 that the Taoiseach frowned on the constituency, the only one to return three Fine Gael Deputies.  They were surprised that the Taoiseach did not honour the constituency by the appointment of one of its Deputies as a Parliamentary Secretary in spite of the fact that Deputy Flanagan had been a Parliamentary Secretary in a previous inter-Party Government.  Subsequently, the Taoiseach appointed Deputy Flanagan as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and there was rumour at that time that over a period Deputy Flanagan appeared to be a disgruntled member of the Coalition back benchers support.  We were extremely conscious of the fact that over the first couple of years of the Coalition, while by-elections were being fought reasonably successfully from the Coalition point of view, all the campaigns suffered from the absence of Deputy Flanagan.  He was conducting himself outside the House like a dog with a sore tail.  His contribution at party level to the Coalition Government's efforts at that time was not very pronounced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In saying this, I am expressing views that were expressed within the constituency in regard to the treatment the Taoiseach then meted out to Deputy Flanagan.  We did have the change some 12 months ago when Deputy Flanagan was belatedly appoined Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government.  Rumour had it then that the appointment arose because of a demand or threat <Col N="796" /> from Deputy Flanagan to the Taoiseach. I mentioned this matter in the House previously and the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Flanagan, was present.  He told me that I was repeating something that had been mis-stated in the newspapers and that the matter was <i>sub judice</i> and that a case was being brought for defamation of character. I have never heard of that case since, but I did repeat in the House what I gathered and what had been said in the papers, and I was called upon by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government to withdraw it because of the fact that it was incorrect.  I believe it cannot have been correct because I cannot imagine the Taoiseach being so jellylivered as to proceed to make the appointment as Minister for Defence having been forced to make the previous appointment.</P>
    <P>Speaking as a representative of the constituency of Laois-Offaly I feel this should be a worthwhile appointment from our point of view, but I am worried about it from the national viewpoint. Deputy Connolly has spoken of the fact that the Government are, and have always been expected to have collective responsibility.  I have been rather surprised during the day by interventions by the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in regard to the confining of the debate strictly to dealing with the qualifications or suitability of the nomination for the post of Minister for Defence.  I do not challenge the Chair's rulings but the motion before us seeks approval of the nomination by the Taoiseach of a member of the Government. The Member is not named and the portfolio being offered is not stated in the Order of Business.  Despite what the Press has been telling us for the past month and what Deputy Flanagan himself has been telling us for the past fortnight, it was only this morning that we became officially aware of the identity of the nominee for the post of Minister for Defence. The Taoiseach suitably chose to overlook informing us as to whether the Parliamentary Secretaryship vacancy is to be filled.  I presume he cannot do that until the House has approved the appointment of the new Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="797" /> According to the Order of Business what we are really talking about is the nomination by the Taoiseach of a member of the Government.  I accept the rulings of the Chair but, you see, the problem is&mdash;I am sorry to use the words &ldquo;you see&rdquo;; I do not intend it as any reflection on the next Minister for Defence who introduced the usage into the House&mdash;that every Minister in the present Cabinet appears to have a wide field in which he can make pronouncements.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, except in this House, says very little about his own Department, but outside he is the greatest expert we have on foreign affairs, economics and Northern Ireland difficulties.  I am in no doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Flanagan, is unlikely to confine himself to dissertations only on the Department of Defence when he becomes Minister.  We saw that he circulated a speech last Wednesday in regard to a function he was asked to attend, the opening of a school. The following day, by way of explanation, he found it necessary to arrange for the Government Information Service to issue a statement on his behalf.  Again I have to say, and it is worth repeating: this is the only successful section of the present Government. It is crowned with success in its achievements, and both its directors have been wonders.  More than anything else, it has kept the Government's head above water even if the country's economic situation cannot be kept above water, but I am not allowed to refer to that.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that in debating this appointment the Chair should be continually reminding us to confine our remarks to the suitability of the appointment, because if the debate were allowed to embrace the overall mismanagement of the Government, Deputies on this side of the House, who are the only Deputies contributing, would not have to concentrate so much on criticism of the nominee for the post.  We are forced into this. When one tries to do some research on the background of the new Minister for Defence it is very difficult to be as restrictive in one's remarks concerning him, as I wish to be.  The <Col N="798" /> Minister-designate has been honoured to be a Deputy for the constituency for the past 33 years.  I am in the position of one representing the same constituency&mdash;second senior man, if you like&mdash;for the past 15 or 16 years &mdash;half his time and it would be most improper if, in reflecting the views of the majority of people in my constituency up to now, I were to say that he was not fit to be a Minister.  I do not say that.</P>
    <P>The great expectations the people had in 1972 are being shattered.  They have now discovered that the galaxy of stars was only a mirage and we are now back to the fundamentals. The Taoiseach on the eve of an election looked around for a man to fill a vacancy forced on him by circumstances.  He was looking for a down to earth individual, a man who had succeeded in getting his message across to his constituents over a long period, and he chose the new Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>I re-echo Deputy Connolly's remarks that we expect&mdash;and it is an expectation that can be justified by the people of Laois/Offaly in the light of 33 years of glorious promises&mdash;the new Minister will deliver.  I want to say categorically that I wish he had been chosen by the Taoiseach to fill an alternative position.  One can ask what has Laois/Offaly to do with Defence? What benefits will accrue to his constituents because of his new position?  I do not look at this problem from that angle because once he is in the Cabinet he will be able to fight our cause.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot from him at local level.  He has fought to have the disadvantaged areas scheme extended to our constituency.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries extended that scheme last week.  If that decision had been deferred until next week, the new Minister might have been able to further influence him at the next Cabinet meeting.</P>
    <P>I found it remarkable that the Taoiseach remained mum.  Of course, I should not have found it remarkable because that is his usual trance situation.  For the last fortnight the Press were speculating and Government <Col N="799" /> spokesmen were saying that the appointment was being made the following Wednesday.  When it became apparent some months ago that the Taoiseach had decided to send a Minister as a Commissioner to Europe, it was obvious that there would have to be a replacement.  Without reflecting on the Parliamentary Secretary at present in the House or on any of his colleagues, the House and the Press logically expected the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach to be the Taoiseach's nominee for this post.  I am pleased this position was given to Deputy Flanagan because I am selfish so far as my constituents are concerned.  It is like the county councillor in the old days who was canvassed for the rate collecting job by the potential rate collector and the county councillor, in a consoling way said &ldquo;If I cannot do you any good, I won't do you any harm&rdquo;.  From that point of view I am pleased Deputy Flanagan has been appointed, because I am sure he will not do any harm to the constituency although it is hard to visualise how as Minister for Defence he will be in a position to do a great deal of good.</P>
    <P>I am sorry he is not in this House to listen to my contribution and that of Deputy Connolly.  Maybe I have my priorities wrong and he has his priorities right.  This motion was introduced this morning at 10.30 a.m. by the Taoiseach.  He asked the House to approve the nomination of Deputy Oliver John Flanagan.  Last Thursday I received a letter from the IDA inviting me to a sod cutting ceremony in Mountmellick today for the building of a new advance factory.  The following morning as Opposition Whip I rang the Government Whip.  The Parliamentary Secretary was not available but I spoke to his private secretary. I drew his attention to the fact that this motion was being taken today.  I assumed that Deputy Flanagan would be nominated and we would debate this matter today.  I thought such a discussion today would be inappropriate for two reasons.  I have indicated consistently that a Minister should not look for an official pair unless he is on official <Col N="800" /> business.  This sod-cutting ceremony was arranged between the Minister and the IDA.  It could have been arranged for last Monday or even next Friday.  There was no necessity to have it today.</P>
    <P>I feel that my responsibility as a Deputy is to be present in this Dáil, unless I am sick.  I am pleased we will have a new advance factory in Mountmellick.  I am hoping, with the co-operation of the new Minister, that even before this factory is completed he will do something about getting industries into the empty advance factories in Portlaoise, Tullamore and Birr, although I gather from the IDA that some progress is being made there.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow morning the people will get the impression that this new Minister is doing a double job.  Although we are electing him here, he is not present because he knows there are enough feet to get him elected.  This is the day he has waited for for 33 long years and one would expect him to be sitting behind the Taoiseach.  I have a pride in my position.  If the Leader of my party was back as Taoiseach and appointed me as a Minister I would take pleasure in being here to hear the announcement.</P>
    <P>Of course Deputy Flanagan did not bother to come up here to hear the Taoiseach, and I begin to wonder if the Taoiseach is in touch any longer. Deputy Flanagan is privileged to be in Mountmellick today cutting a sod, but he would have been more privileged if he had arranged with the Minister for Industry and Commerce to have the ceremony postponed until Friday when we would have been all free and if he had come up here to hear the Taoiseach's announcement. If I had been nasty enough&mdash;Opposition Whips have certain powers&mdash;to let the debate collapse at midday when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach frantically came to my room to say there was nobody beside Deputy Dowling in the House, we would have had a position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I came to the Dáil in 1961 I have not had occasion <Col N="801" /> to be a great admirer of the incoming Minister for Defence and I do not expect him to give me any reason in the future to be a great admirer of him.  I welcome the appointment because it may be of benefit to the constituency and because Deputy Flanagan has waited 33 years and deserves this from his party, but I regret he is not here because I do not like issuing warnings to fellow Deputies unless I do so face to face with them.  We all remember that after the debate on the Offences Against the State Act he opposed his party's line.  It will be recalled also that the Minister for Local Government made an order, effective from 31st December last, introducing a means test of sorts for eligibility for new house grants. Up to then anyone who built a new house could qualify for the grant which was, generally speaking, £325. However, that Minister made an order decreeing that anybody who applied for a new house grant after 1st January, 1976 would not be eligible unless his means were below a certain figure.</P>
      <P>I want to say to the incoming Minister for Defence that I know he personally accepted representations from constituents of mine, and I have no doubt from others as well, subsequent to 1st January and that he backdated them, rubber stamped them, as having been in before 31st December.  I can stand over that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be most careful in the manner in which I watch the operations of the new Minister for Defence.  I am conscious of the fact that while we were in office many nasty things were said about our Ministers&mdash;&ldquo;Fix up your friends&rdquo; is a phrase the Taoiseach has used.  I was privileged to be a Minister and, whether I made a success or failure of it, I tried to be honest.  Deputy Flanagan is on record as having stated that he believed one should fix up one's friends if one were in power.  He stated that on television, in an interview in the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; or one of those programmes, three or four years ago.  I apologise for the phraseology but the effect of what he said is that if he had the power he would do all he could for his friends.  He went a little further. Perhaps from the point of view of that <Col N="802" /> promise of his, our expectations may be a little far-fetched.</P>
    <P>I make one promise to the incoming Minister for Defence.  It is that I will not do to him what he did to me. If a constituent comes to me seeking something that I genuinely feel he is not entitled to, whether it be a grant or something else, I will not tell him: &ldquo;I am sorry, I am in Opposition now. If I were in Government it would be different.  Go to Deputy Flanagan&rdquo;&mdash; in the full knowledge that he could not do anything.</P>
    <P>I am very sorry that the Ministerelect is not here.  If he were I could say to him across the House the number of times he has said this to me by way of joke, by way of the embarrassment he has created for me.  Last night Deputy Flanagan approached me to ask me to pair with him to go to Mountmellick today; not to go with him but we were both to have gone to the sod-cutting and the function afterwards.  I explained to him that I had been a Parliamentary Secretary and Minister from 1965 to 1973 and that over that period I never once asked him to pair with me.  If I needed pairings as Minister in my official capacity the application was always made through the Whip of my party and I never at any stage made an individual approach to any Deputy of the Opposition at the time to pair with me.  I feel that there is a form for pairing.</P>
    <P>I am embarrassed because it will be said of me that Lalor suffered from sour grapes and would not turn up in Oliver Flanagan's, the Minister's home town today for the cutting of a sod.  I would have been privileged to have done it.  I have some great friends in Mountmellick who I hope will be able to get jobs in this factory but as Whip of the Opposition and with such a debate going on in this House the thought did not cross my mind.  As long ago as Friday when I got the letter from the Regional Director of the IDA I replied saying, &ldquo;Many thanks for your kind invitation to the sod-cutting ceremony at the IDA's advance factory in Mountmellick on Wednesday next, 15th. Regrettably as the Dáil is in progress <Col N="803" /> at that time I shall be unable to attend&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It would have been a privilege.  I was Minister for Industry and Commerce. I know all these IDA people and I know the great satisfaction those people, business people or heads of any group in the town will have in seeing this sod being cut.  It is a momentous day from the new Minister's point of view in so far as on the day he was appointed a Minister, appropriately enough a new sod was being cut.</P>
    <P>It is embarrassing from my point of view that I should have to be making those remarks.  First of all, I honestly and, I might say, enthusiastically congratulate the man on his appointment but I am worried about the fact that it is to a Department where solidarity, stability and straightness are so vital.  The editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i> is not noted for his admiration of the Opposition; he has, not alone in the papers but even on interviews on radio, fallen very much into line with Government thinking. On Friday I was struck because he expressed my sentiments on that morning in the sub-leader under the heading of &ldquo;Indiscretion&rdquo; when he said:</P>
    <P>It will not be known until next week whether or not Mr. Oliver J. Flanagan will be our next Minister for Defence.  In the meantime the Taoiseach will have to measure the extent of the Parliamentary Secretary's indiscretion in Mountmellick.</P>
    <P>The last Minister for Defence has found himself demoted because he spoke out of turn, and while Mr. Flanagan's indiscretion was not of the same magnitude it may nevertheless raise the question of his suitability for a very important post.</P>
    <P>Mr. Flanagan may seek to make the press the scapegoat in this affair &mdash;but it can hardly be denied that the press was merely reporting what happened at Mountmellick.</P>
    <P>There are many matter of serious import known to all Government Ministers arising out of their ministerial or Cabinet meetings.  For instance, in January next the Minister for Finance <Col N="804" /> will come into this House and announce his budget and every Minister and former Minister in this House will, once the Minister stands up to read out the budget, be given a copy of the script.  All the Ministers who have been attending Cabinet meetings and who have been collectively deciding to back the Minister for Finance or to take the decisions on where taxation is being imposed and where taxation is being lifted know the details pretty well for a week beforehand or maybe longer, but the Minister for Finance is basically doing his sums up to the last minute.  There was a situation in Britain a few years ago when a photographer took a photograph and there was some question that something might be seen beforehand.  Imagine the danger of having among the members of that Cabinet somebody who does not know when to stay quiet, when to keep his mouth shut.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday in this House I sat at a table with three or four of my colleagues and we were discussing what the <i>Irish Independent</i> calls &ldquo;indiscretion&rdquo;. One colleague senior to me who was a Minister for quite a considerable time before I was, in old God's time when the late Éamon de Valera was Taoiseach, said &ldquo;I would hate to be Oliver facing back up to Dev in the old days having blown like that after being told that he was due for appointment next week&rdquo;.  Another ex-Minister said that it would have been exactly the same with the late Seán Lemass and with Jack Lynch.  The nominee would be called into the Taoiseach's room and told &ldquo;I have changed my mind&rdquo;. I had a fear on behalf of my constituency that the present Taoiseach might eventually be found to have had the guts of the late Éamon de Valera, of the late Seán Lemass or of Jack Lynch, but it transpired he had not.  Maybe that is one of the reasons why things are so bad in general that we cannot talk about them.</P>
    <P>There are two final points I would like to make.  One is that this debate since 10.30 this morning has been remarkable in that all the contributions to it have come from this side <Col N="805" /> of the House.  Maybe the Government will say &ldquo;It was a foregone conclusion. The debate was conducted in the papers for the last fortnight.  Why are you holding things up?  Let us get on with the job&rdquo;.  The other conclusion that I can come to is that there is a muzzle in some shape or form on Government speakers.  The general public, popular opinion, the overall study of the capacity of the back-bench group on the Government's side, and the political pundits who study this situation was that Deputy John Kelly, Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, would be appointed to be in charge of Education. The Taoiseach was playing his cards close to his chest and there would be no reshuffle.  The Minister for Education would go to Europe out of politics and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach would be promoted to that post.  As the Leader of my party said this morning we were given to understand, replying to the debate that we cannot discuss, that the Taoiseach said he had full confidence in the Minister for Defence and had no notion of changing him.</P>
    <P>The day before the Presidential inauguration we got this change followed by the leak that it would not be the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach who would be promoted. Maybe I might be embarrassing the Parliamentary Secretary because it transpired afterwards that he was going to an official function representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  When I came into the House this morning I was surprised to see that there was no Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government but that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs was all dressed up.  I thought he was going to Aras an Uachtaráin and the Taoiseach had played his cards close to his chest again and had left everybody, including my colleague, whistling and he had the other man linedup.</P>
    <P>I have not as close contact with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach as I have with my colleague in the constituency over a period.  I felt that the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="806" /> to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs had earned promotion. I presume the Taoiseach feels he does a wonderful job as Government Whip. He certainly does.  He has done his job so well that the man who played truant at the beginning of this Dáil is now getting this honour conferred on him.</P>
    <P>I suppose the practical reason for promoting Deputy Flanagan is the one my colleague, Deputy Connolly, spoke about.  The message has come through that that constituency which honoured the present Taoiseach by sending him six feet which up to now he has used for voting purposes to increase taxation on farmers and generally to increase the cost of living on everybody would be replaced by four feet after the next election.  Somebody got the message across to the Taoiseach that he might consolidate the position in Laois-Offaly and he might put up a barrier against the danger of Fianna Fáil recapturing that seat by appointing Deputy Flanagan as Minister for Defence.  If the Taoiseach feels that the nomination of Deputy Flanagan as a member of the Government will wipe out the disappointment, the frustration, the increased unemployment, the unopened factories in Tullamore, Birr and Portlaoise and the closure of the factories in Clara and Rathdowney good luck to him.  If Deputy Flanagan, or somebody on his behalf has succeeded in getting the message across to the Taoiseach that this will stymie Deputies Connolly and Lalor and prevent them getting the extra seat we so narrowly missed holding on to on the last occasion, good luck to him but he has another think coming.</P>
    <P>When I spoke about Deputy Kelly I said I was speaking about him without casting any reflections on any of the other Parliamentary Secretaries who were senior to the Parliamentary Secretary who has been selected.  We have had a number of debates when the Government decided they would leave it to the Opposition and they would not go in.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach found it impossible to stay out arising out of something that was said.  He was dragged into the debate.  My contribution <Col N="807" /> is not for the purpose of getting the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach come in here to tell us that he is not disappointed, that he did not expect promotion and that Deputy Flanagan is a far greater individual than he is and more fitted to the job. I would be surprised if he came in and said that.  He said this morning, arising out of an interruption of mine, that it was beneath me, that is was unworthy of me.  He may think, for some reason or other, reasonably highly of Deputy Lalor.  I think so highly of him that I would not expect him to come in and tell that sort of a lie.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is probably listening to me on the monitor.  I challenge him to bring in any quotation from the Official Report showing that we had at any time a straightforward proposal like we had this morning from the Taoiseach saying he was nominating Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan as a member of the Government and he was appointing him Minister for Defence.  The Taoiseach did not find any words to justify that appointment.  He did not say he was appointing him because he would be a far better man than the man who was replaced some weeks ago, that he was more qualified to talk on defence than anybody in the country.  I have already publicly stated there must be some rumpus within the Cabinet or perhaps with Deputy Burke gone from the Cabinet and with Senator Robinson moving her Bill tomorrow he wanted at least one man on the Cabinet who would say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to what he has to say in connection with it.  I also have to say that if the new Minister for Defence proposes at Cabinet level that the Government should not accept the Bill it would be a thundering disgrace if there was not somebody else to second it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment of a Minister in any democracy should be a joyful occasion.  It shows the system working whereby the head of a Government can change his team in the interests of better government. Opposition Members normally rejoice <Col N="808" /> and say that it is good to see this change taking place because we will have better government.  We can understand why the Taoiseach must make changes at certain times.</P>
      <P>The occasion today is a very sad one for me not because Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan has been promoted but because of the very circumstances of the appointment and because for the last six weeks the country has been subjected to a minor crisis because of the indiscretions of a former Minister for Defence, the resignation of a President and the resultant upset.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept the Chair's ruling.  The appointment had to be made because a vacancy occurred. The Dublin bus strike may sound very irrelevant in the present circumstances but in my opinion it is very relevant.  The Taoiseach in his wisdom decided, or was forced to decide, that he would have to change the Minister for Transport and Power into another ministerial office.  The Minister for Transport and Power would have given some thought to the chaotic position in relation to the Dublin city bus services.  Thousands of people are being deprived of proper bus services and have to wait for hours before getting home in the evenings. I do not attribute the blame to any side because I do not know enough about it.  There will be cynicism in the hearts of our people this evening when they realise we are discussing this matter while they are standing in the cold waiting for a bus that will come an hour or two hours late.  If Nero fiddled while Rome burned, we are doing something similar.</P>

The cynicism that is being bred in the hearts of the people as a result of the goings on of the Government over the past six weeks can already be seen.  I had always respected the Taoiseach and had thought of him as a man of law and order, yet when the highest personage in the State was attacked and the highest office in the State was attacked, no action was taken to safeguard our democratic structure.</P>

Reference may be made to the calibre of the person who is being appointed to the post, or to the reallocation of the Departments between members of the Government, but recent debates which dealt with Government policy or the question of the resignation of the President are not in order on this debate; neither is economic nor Government policy in order.</P>

      <P>I am trying to make some sort of an intelligent contribution. I am surprised at the interpretation of the Standing Order.  The appointment is a matter of Government, and Governmental offices are the collective responsibility of any Cabinet. When a Minister criticises the first citizen and after a period that person is replaced, surely it is open to any of us to discuss relevant matters regarding the appointments.  We have to ensure that our actions and our words will do everything possible to ensure that democracy will survive despite the present Government.  Can democracy survive if we are to have performances such as we have had over the last few weeks from Ministers and from the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We first heard the announcement of the ministerial appointment through the newspapers.  That should have been heard first in this House.  That appointment is subject to the authority of this House and the new Minister has yet to be endorsed by this House. This House is the only assembly in the country which can make a new Minister. The authority of this House is being flaunted by people making statements outside the House about ministerial appointments, as they have been reported to have done, without contradiction.  I am disappointed with the attitude of the head of the Government. I saw the Taoiseach making some queer decisions in this House in his voting pattern.  At the time I could see a certain wisdom in what he did and even a certain amount of principle.  What am I to think now about the performance of the Government in the way they have handled matters in the last few weeks?  What am I to think of an assembly which <Col N="811" /> discusses the appointment of a Minister while we have so many pressing problems which we are not dealing with?  If one looks at some of the questions on today's Order Paper, one realises the problems we are facing.</P>
    <P>We are discussing this matter because the House has the duty of endorsing a ministerial appointment. I am not going to criticise the character or the ability of Deputy Flanagan.  He has served the House for many years, he is a keen politician and I will leave it at that.  We can only judge his performance as Minister for Defence over a period.  It may be that he will not be in his new office for very long because we know that this is the prelude to a general election.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Deputy Flanagan will do his best in his new post.  He is a man of great energy and he will not be lazy in his new job.  However, it is equally true that the vast majority of Members have the energy and will to tackle the many problems that face the country. I should like to develop the matter of the bus strike although I cannot get the permission of the Chair to do so.  It might also be pointed out that we have industrial, commercial and fishing problems with which to contend.</P>
    <P>This country is faced with a colossal unemployment problem and in this city there are about 8,000 families or individuals on the housing waiting list.  These are matters which the Government should be tackling.  I agree that as men of goodwill the Government probably want to solve these problems but they are bedevilling their own efforts by their mismanagement of the primary problem, namely, the smooth running of the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a new Minister should be a matter of joy for all Members of the House, even though the Opposition might not agree with the selection.  That is not the point. In a democratic system such as ours, the House should be told in the first place of the appointment of a Minister. All of us believe in democracy and a Minister of State can be regarded <Col N="812" /> as a pillar of democracy.  One must be saddened by the series of events that led to the proposed appointment of Deputy Flanagan. Certainly the circumstances were not auspicious.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much rejoicing or disappointment among the people regarding this new appointment. What we are doing in the House is breeding cynicism.  Once people become cynical democracy is on its way out because to work properly democracy must have the whole-hearted co-operation of the people.  They must join with the Government and Parliament in framing the laws that will be fair to all and in striving to solve the social problems which beset the nation. Never in the history of the State have we had to face so many social problems but little attention is given to them by the Government.  I should much prefer to speak this afternoon on the appointment of a Minister for Housing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to help the Government.  Now that the Taoiseach has nominated a new Minister he may decide to make other changes.  I am not offering any carping criticism of the Government.  I am making some suggestions which might make for better Government.  If the House were appointing a Minister for Housing, at least the Government would deserve credit for recognising the need for such a Minister, and the same applies with regard to a Minister for Fisheries.  It must be obvious by now that there is need for a separate Department to deal with fisheries. All of these changes should stem from the desire of the Taoiseach to strengthen the Cabinet and to make it more efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed appointment we are discussing has been forced on the Taoiseach.  In my opinion he reacted wrongly to the first challenge.  Of course he had more information on the matter than other Members, but the point is that in appointing a Minister <Col N="813" /> regard should be had to the prime needs of the country.  I suggest that the prime needs of the country are social rather than political.  We have problems which may call for the appointment of new Ministers within the limits laid down in the Constitution. I am sorry the Taoiseach did not seize the opportunity of reviewing the entire Cabinet rather than making just one or two new appointments. He should have taken stock of the entire Cabinet and listened to the people outside.  He might even have stood in a bus queue where people waited for hours for a bus and listened to what they said about this appointment. It might be discovered that people were critical not only of the Government but of Parliament in general.  This will not redound to the credit of democracy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may tell us that because of the majority which the Government have in the House the motion will be carried.  I agree there is need for a new Minister for Defence but it does not matter in the slightest to the people outside if we have a new Minister because the problems are just too much and they are neither excited nor disappointed by the Taoiseach's move here today. The youth who have neither jobs nor prospects regard this appointment as a cynical exercise.  Youth today are just as idealistic and patriotic as were youth of previous generations and we are not here setting an example they would like to follow.  Because of the ruling of the Chair, I cannot discuss the problems confronting the people but I do not think it is too late yet for the Taoiseach to rearrange his Cabinet in the hope that that new Cabinet will do better than the present one.  He must demonstrate that he will not tolerate promotions or demotions and, if he wants us to retain any respect for him, he must adhere to the rules of procedure in this House and we must be told the Taoiseach wishes the House to endorse what he is doing.</P>
    <P>One does not get over-excited about rumours of promotions and demotions. I am inhibited in what I say by the <Col N="814" /> fact that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and no doubt you, Sir, would do likewise, ruled that we cannot discuss what we should like to discuss.  We have the right to discuss the appointment of a new Minister but, in discussing that appointment, we are anxious to show the people that we are mindful of their problems.  The appointment of a new Minister is an integral part of our democratic system but we now find our job is to act as a kind of rubber stamp to a proposal by the Taoiseach and we will have to wait for some other opportunity to discuss social problems.  That opportunity will not arise this side of Christmas. I do not know when we will be coming back here but, if we do come back, I hope we will have an opportunity of discussing these important matters.  Will the Dublin bus dispute have been solved in the interval? Will the register of unemployed show an increase or a decrease?  Will some of the social problems mentioned at Question Time have been resolved?  I asked the responsible Minister if he had seen a report of alleged suicidal tendencies by a section of citizens in Dublin or a tendency towards delinquency in another age group.  This is what democracy should be all about and these are the things which should be discussed.</P>
    <P>I do not want to violate any Standing Order but I feel it incumbent to mention these problems so that people will know we are not ignoring their presence.  Had the appointment of a new Minister to the Department of Defence given us an opportunity of highlighting these problems and suggesting solutions to them, then the appointment of that new Minister would have done some good in providing us with an opportunity of discussing these matters.</P>
    <P>It was notable that the Taoiseach in moving the appointment of this new Minister did not eulogise the new Minister.  There was absolute economy of language.  The motion was simply put.  I hope the Taoiseach will reply to this debate.  I think he did himself an injustice this morning and over the last few days in his handling of this matter.  It may be that, being the <Col N="815" /> experienced politician he is, he deliberately set out on the path of doing it his way.  He has the right to do it his way but at the same time he has a duty to explain why it is done in that way.  Why was the announcement not made in the first place in this House?</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Oliver Flanagan proves to be a very successful Minister for Defence and I hope his every action will be for the benefit of those over whom he has authority and for the benefit of the people in general. It would be wrong for me to wish him anything else but I am disappointed at the circumstances of his appointment. I believe he is aware of the attitude of the people.  I know he will try to serve to the best of his ability but not for some considerable time will that wipe out the bad taste the whole sorry matter has caused inside and outside this House.  In many countries democracy is disappearing. It will disappear here unless we interpret the warning signs correctly and act as the guardians of democracy.  As a famous Englishman, Sir Winston Churchill once said, it was the worst possible system apart from all the others that had been tried.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while the Taoiseach has to run his Government as he sees fit, he must also ensure that no action of his endangers democracy or lessens respect for parliament.  Once respect for parliament is lessened the way is open to all kinds of different regimes striving to take over.  I hope the newly-appointed Minister will be very successful in his office.  At the same time, I wish the circumstances of his appointment were somewhat different to what they are now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel I can be as charitable as my colleague in relation to this appointment.  I pledge on my oath, however, that what I am about to say is not a personal attack but is based on my criticism of the ability of this man to fill the post to which he has been appointed.  This is a man who has a long record throughout his political career of showing very little respect for the truth either in this House or outside it, for the truth, <Col N="816" /> for the Presidency of our country, for the great Éamon de Valera who held that position with great dignity and honour.  This is a man who only a few short years ago on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; said he considered patronage one of the spoils of office.  This is a man who, no doubt, will carry this further in the way in which promotions will be made.  The whole dignity of the Army has suffered a blow by this appointment.</P>
      <P>When I think of him as Minister for Defence I am reminded of the story of the vet who was sent for to artificially inseminate a cow.  When he arrived at the farm he asked the farmer was she quiet and the farmer said she was.  He proceeded about his business and the cow gave him such a kick that he landed up in the rafters. He said &ldquo;I thought you said the cow was gentle&rdquo;, and the farmer replied, &ldquo;I suppose it is the first time she has ever seen a bull with a bowler hat&rdquo;. I feel that would be somewhat like the reaction of the Army to their Minister for Defence.  As I say, I believe this man has not the ability to fill this post.  We have heard him speaking in this House with his &ldquo;d'y see&rdquo; and &ldquo;d'y know&rdquo;.  It has been said that that book, &ldquo;The Letters of a TD&rdquo;, by J.B. Keane was written with that man in mind.  I would certainly say he fills the role in the conduct of his office.</P>
      <P>Excerpts from the Locke's Distillery Tribunal report were read in the House this morning.  I believe the actual wording at the sitting of the tribunal was much more severe. It would be interesting to refer back to some of the papers at that time to find out what he actually said.  People may say that that was many years ago and that the man has matured since then.  I do not believe he has.  This Government have shown nothing but contempt for the people whom they are there primarily to serve through the appointment of this man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lack of respect being shown to our institutions of State by the Leader of the Government despite their so-called care about security. The Taoiseach, in answer to a supplementary question by Deputy <Col N="817" /> O'Malley as to how many times he had been to visit the former President, Cearbhail Ó Dálaigh, and whether he had discussed policy with him, said he had discussed policy.  He tried to make it a side issue and could not say what he had discussed, that he was not asked that question.  I know he never did, and this is the man who has stood up before the people of this country and given the impression that his party is a party of law and order, a party that respects the institutions of the State.  They are showing very little respect for these institutions of State by some of their appointments and by this appointment in particular.</P>
    <P>I understand that according to Standing Orders we are not allowed to discuss anything outside the limits of this appointment.  I wonder, therefore, whether in a month's time, if the Taoiseach decided to reappoint a new Minister for Defence, we would be forbidden to discuss this because this discussion on the Minister for Defence will have taken place within the six months' period.  I think the abuse of Standing Orders to try to restrict Members of the Opposition, to curtail them in their freedom of speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to argue with you.  All I can say is that there is no precedent for the Opposition being curtailed in their freedom to widen the scope of a debate on the appointment of a Minister to include other Ministers.  Recently in the United States another Minister of the Government, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien, stated what he thought would happen if Britain announced any intention to withdraw from this country, that this country would have a civil war parallel only to that in the <Col N="818" /> Lebanon.  That did a great deal of harm to this country; I am sure the IDA were very concerned; all the money they spent during this year must have gone up the spout because of the damage done as far as potential investors are concerned.  This was something on which the Taoiseach should have acted immediately and very strongly, but he did not do this. The Taoiseach, in some of his appointments, I am sorry to say, has literally sabotaged many of the institutions of the State, and the economy in particular.  The day will come when as regards those two men, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the newely-appointed Minister for Defence, who are poles apart in their thinking and actions, the story will be told that the Government were not united.  I can understand the feeling of some members of Fine Gael and Labour who must be still wretching inside from the news of this appointment. In my opinion this is the worst appointment the Government ever made.  I do not think the people will have any vestige of respect left for the Taoiseach following the appointment of this man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Moore, commented that our people were so burdened by the economic situation that they were apathetic to any appointments by the Government but I do not accept that.  The Government have mistaken silence for approval and they will find out with greater certainty at the next election how the people feel.  Our people have respect for the institutions of the State; they have respect for the forces of law and order and they do not like to see them abused.  This appointment is an abuse of our last line of defence, our Army. The Army are entitled to have as their Minister a man of known integrity. Most of the speeches have dealt with the lack of confidence which Fianna Fáil have in this appointment.  Fianna Fáil represent the majority of our people and they are satisfied that the appointment is a bad one.  They have no confidence in the Taoiseach or the Government.  Our confidence in the future of the country under the present Government has been struck another blow.  Deputy Moore referred <Col N="819" /> to the slim line between democracy and dictatorship.</P>
    <P>If this country does not get the leadership it requires within the next few years, we will witness the end of democracy as we have known it because the people are impatient and angry.  They are very sad to see the way the Government they claimed had been denied a chance, as they put it, for so long have behaved after been given the authority to govern by the people.  The Government have misused that authority and the appointment today is another abuse. In my view it is the biggest abuse yet. We can expect anything from the Government.  We have had all sorts of speculation as to when a general election will take place but I believe the Government will hold on to the last minute.  I would not be surprised if they attempted to force a Bill through this House to increase the life of the Dáil to seven years.  The Government want to hold on to power while they have it.  The 16 years of Government by Fianna Fáil never saw as many appointments as were made in the last few years.  I hope the Army will be patient because I believe with certainty, and not because of any recent poll, that Fianna Fáil will be back after the next general election to form a government.  We will be able to restore again the dignity of the Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion we are discussing, the appointment of Deputy Oliver Flanagan as a member of the Government, in particular as Minister for Defence, is a sad one for us all. The Taoiseach had open to him the possibility of appointing any one of 55 or more people to the vacant office of Minister for Defence.  I doubt if he could have picked a more unsuitable person than the man he has seen fit to choose.  It is a sad reflection on our country that a person like Deputy Flanagan is being put in charge of the Department of Defence.  While I am confined, apparently, to talking about the Deputy's personal fitness for office I do not want to pass any reflections on him personally in any sort of private capacity or in respect of any views <Col N="820" /> he may have in a private capacity. I will refer only to his public reported statements and actions.</P>
      <P>It seems that there can be little explanation for the appointment of this man other than patronage of some form, of paying off some kind of debt that I cannot envisage and of trying to manoeuvre some sort of short-term political advantage by his appointment. It is clear that the proposal to appoint him has nothing to do either with ability or merit.  There are people on the other side of the House who have greater ability and are more meritorious of appointment to the serious office of a member of the Government. In appointing the Minister for Defence for reasons other than merit or ability the Taoiseach and the Government are not breaking any new ground as far as defence matters and the Army are concerned because the number of promotions within the Army within recent years on grounds that have nothing to do with merit or ability are legion.  We have had that repeated again in recent weeks by the Taoiseach, while acting as Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>Two men were promoted to senior ranks within the Army even though their military experience is limited. Their chief attribute is their equestrian ability.  We have had people promoted to the senior rank of colonel in the Army who, as recently as two years ago, were junior captains.  Although there is a strict rule in the Army that nobody is promoted beyond the rank of captain without undergoing a command and staff course at the Curragh for nine months various of these noted horsemen who have now achieved high rank in the Army have never undergone any such course.  I wonder in the exhilaration of office if the Taoiseach and the Government consider the damage they are doing to the Army.  If they could hear officers talking privately about how they feel and about their careers in the light of what has happened in the past few years, would they come to some realisation of the damage they have been doing and are doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is today's proposal to appoint a particularly unsuitable man as Minister <Col N="821" /> for Defence going to do anything to increase confidence on the part of the Army?  If they see a very unsuitable man as Minister for Defence they cannot be surprised if the various ranks of the Army are filled with men who are less suitable than those passed over.  Trying to put the matter as fairly as I can, I think it is correct to say that there is not a great deal of change between the former Minister removed from office as Minister for Defence&mdash;I am leaving out the <i>interregnum</i> while the Taoiseach was there for a couple of weeks&mdash;Deputy Donegan, now Minister for Lands, and the proposed Minister, Deputy Oliver Flanagan.  It seems to me that a proposal to appoint him is a proposal to replace an intemperate buffoon by a temperate buffoon.  It is rather tragic for the country that this should be so but it is so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan has been in public life for upwards of 30 years and a Member of this House for over 30 years and one would have thought in a life-time of membership of the House and other public bodies that even if it was not there at the beginning, sense would be there by now but I cannot see any evidence that common sense, maturity, stability and judgment exist in the man this House is now asked to ratify as a member of the Government and Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>While he has been a Member of the House, Deputy Oliver Flanagan has probably made more pronouncements than any other Deputy and the proportion of pronouncements that he made that were odd&mdash;to say the least &mdash;is very high.  This goes back over a long number of years.  One might appropriately and relevantly bring to the notice of the House dozens of quotations from him before the House decides to appoint him as a member of the Government.  I have selected only one or two as I do not want to delay the House indefinitely and stay the hours one might profitably stay reading the assembled thoughts and declarations of Deputy Flanagan over the past 30 years.  In particular, I want to refer to a report of a speech Deputy Flanagan made at the General Council <Col N="822" /> of Committees of Agriculture general meeting in Dublin on 6th August, 1969 reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> on the following day.  It is a short report of a few paragraphs and the heading is: &ldquo; `No room for Nazis'&mdash;Flanagan&rdquo;. It reads:</P>
    <P>A call to the Land Commission to take the necessary steps to repossess the land bought by Germans was made in Dublin yesterday by Mr. Oliver J. Flanagan, TD.  He suggested that it be given to Irishmen who were capable and prepared to work it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have no room in this country for Nazis and we are not going to entertain them here.  This country is falling too much into the hands of Germans,&rdquo; said Mr. Flanagan who was addressing a meeting of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not at all as opposed to the Englishman having a holding here as to a German and the sooner we take steps to end this the better,&rdquo; he added.</P>
    <P>He wanted a sub-committee appointed to go to the Minister for Lands to deal with the situation, but the council decided not to discuss the matter at yesterday's meeting.</P>
    <P>He claimed that the situation was now getting out of hand and called for Government action.  He objected to Germans because they were Nazis and because they were alien. When asked about his use of the word Nazi, Mr. Flanagan said he considered all Germans to be Nazis. He said he would raise the matter in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>That is the man we are asked to make a member of the Government today. Even though I have to speak to empty benches because none of them will come in to defend or support him today, I would say to them if they can hear me in some other part of the House, and in particular I say to members of the Labour Party and to people in that party like the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Dr. Cruise-O'Brien and Deputy Barry Desmond: will they come in here tonight and <Col N="823" /> vote approval for the appointment to the Government of a man who said that he objected to Germans because they were Nazis and because they were alien and went on to say that he considered all Germans to be Nazis?</P>
    <P>Is this the sort of man that it is appropriate should be a member of the Government&mdash;even of this Government? Is this the sort of man that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs wants to sit down with around the table once, twice or three times a week and have the most confidential and fundamental discussions of any group of men in the country?  Is this the sort of man with whom other Ministers want to share collective responsibility for every decision made by the Government?  Is this the sort of man that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs along with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the rest of them are prepared to stand behind when he comes out&mdash;as inevitably he will&mdash;to make some pronouncement equally as obnoxious as the one I have just quoted?  Do they want to commit themselves to standing behind him in the views that he holds and that they will not change, views that apparently he has held for upwards of 30 years in public life?  Is that the kind of Government they want?  More pertinently, I might ask is this the kind of Government the country wants or needs?</P>
    <P>I want to refer also to the report of the tribunal appointed to inquire into various allegations made by Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan in relation to Locke's Distillery, which tribunal consisting of a Supreme Court judge and two High Court judges reported on 18th December, 1947 to the then Taoiseach, the late Éamon de Valera.  In paragraph 49 on page 15 of that report the three judges unanimously stated:</P>
    <P>In like manner, we found it necessary to exercise extreme caution in dealing with the evidence of Deputy Flanagan.  We found him very uncandid and much disposed to answer questions unthinkingly as if he were directing his replies elsewhere <Col N="824" /> than to the Tribunal.  On several occasions he contradicted himself and was disposed to shift his ground, when he found that answers already given would lead him where he did not wish to go.  He was, on other occasions, in conflict with testimony which we believed to be true.  In respect of two matters we are satisfied that he told us what he knew to be untrue.</P>
    <P>I draw particular attention to the last sentence: &ldquo;In respect of two matters we are satisfied that he told us what he knew to be untrue&rdquo;. Remember what he told those three judges at the tribunal was told on oath.  It was not a question that he gave evidence that was wrong but believed might be right; he told them what he knew was untrue and he did that on oath.</P>
    <P>We are asked now on behalf and as representatives of the people of Ireland to ratify and approve the Taoiseach's appointment of such a man to be a member of the Government. I find it very difficult to do that. All Deputies on this side find it difficult to do it for the sake of this country.  There must be many Deputies on the other side who find it equally difficult and obnoxious to do it.  Will they go through the hypocritical performance that tragically we have become used to in recent years, of trooping in to do something they know is wrong?  I suppose they will.  I say this to some of the people to whom I have already referred, such as Deputy B. Desmond, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to think deeply before they cast their vote in favour of the appointment of this man who said he objected to Germans because they were Nazis and alien and said he considered all Germans were Nazis.</P>
    <P>The normal procedure followed when a Minister is being appointed to the Government is that the Taoiseach of the day announces it to the House. That is generally the first time anyone, except the prospective Minister, knows about it.  For the past ten days we have been reading that Deputy Flanagan is to be appointed Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> We even read reports in one newspaper about a week ago that he thanked the people in his constituency for their congratulations which had been offered publicly to him as a result of his telling the people in charge of that function that he was to be appointed Minister.</P>
    <P>The fact that he should go round telling all and sundry that he was to be appointed Minister for Defence is in itself a ground for serious doubt as to his suitability.  I do not know what the attitude of the Taoiseach to such free and easy leaking of what one would imagine should be extremely confidential information is, but nonetheless that has been the case over the past ten years.  The country had been told by Deputy Flanagan that he was to be appointed Minister for Defence, but it would not be officially announced for a little time yet.  Then, the Taoiseach comes here this morning and announced it.  Up to the moment the announcement was made, I thought he would not do it. I thought that if the various other things that had happened down through the years were not sufficient ground for regarding Deputy Flanagan as unsuitable, the fact that he had been announcing it for the past ten days would have been sufficient ground to render him unsuitable, but, unhappily, that was not so.</P>
    <P>The Army have been going through a very difficult period.  All that was brought to a head by the attack of the former Minister on the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, the first citizen of this country.  It was an attack which was not withdrawn and the Minister's offer of resignation was refused by the Taoiseach and this in turn caused the resignation of the President.  Is there any evidence that can be adduced to show that Deputy O.J. Flanagan is any less likely than Deputy Donegan was to make some kind of outrageous statement that would be grossly offensive, perhaps, to the President but more likely to some lesser authority during whatever time he will occupy the position of Minister for Defence?  I do not think there is any evidence that would suggest that the likelihood of some outrageous statement or action being <Col N="826" /> made or taken by Deputy O.J. Flanagan is any less than some of the outrageous things that were don by his predecessor.</P>
    <P>We are being asked now to  the appointment of someone everyone in this House must know is not suitable. I remember when the Taoiseach proposed in March, 1973, the appointment of a number of Ministers.  There was a very short debate; it may have lasted 30 minutes or one hour.  There was a very general discussion about the nature of the appointments.  The suitability of individual members of the proposed Government was not gone into.  At that time it would have been appropriate&mdash;and looking back on it, it was a pity it did not happen&mdash; to question the suitability of Deputy Donegan to hold the post of Minister for Defence.  If it had been gone into, it might have caused some rethinking.</P>
    <P>It was a public fact that Deputy Donegan had done some extraordinary things in relation to a group of itinerants who were camped in the vicinity of his house.  It seemed to me that a man who did what he did on that occasion was quite unsuited to the post into which it was proposed to put him.  Tragically, that proved to be the case.  It was not only when he insulted the President that he was grossly unsuitable.  That was only the straw that broke the camel's back.  Within a week of entering his office, he did and said things that were quite inappropriate for a Minister for Defence.  He continued to act in an undisciplined way, to make extraordinary statements and do extraordinary things from time to time. He exercised a degree of patronage within the Department of Defence, in the Army in particular and in various appointments connected with the Department of Defence, in a way that was positively shameless.  I have given the House details of some of these before and I do not want to go into them again because it is not necessary as many of them are well known.  Others are not well known, but the best thing now that that Minister is gone is to leave them alone.</P>
    <P>Can we have any confidence that the same sort of thing will not happen <Col N="827" /> under the man it is now proposed to appoint as Minister?  We can have no such confidence.  There are, I suggest, a dozen or more people on the Fine Gael and Labour benches who are clearly more worthy and more suited to appointment to this post than the man now being put forward.  There is a heavy onus on the Taoiseach to say why this man is suitable.  Nobody either in this House or outside has been able to say why he is suitable. I look forward to hearing of his suitability from the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I want to put this final challenge to the members of the Labour Party in particular and to some members of the Fine Gael Party and ask them to realise what they are doing when they go through the lobbies to ratify the appointment of Deputy O.J. Flanagan as a member of a Government of this country.  Unless they have become entirely bereft of all conscience, they cannot in conscience do what they have been asked by the Taoiseach to do, something which they know well to be wrong and bad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, no speaker from the opposite side has contributed to this motion, except the Taoiseach when he formally moved it. There is a great deal of significance in that and in the fact that none of the Deputies on the benches opposite is prepared to come in to put on record his support for the nomination of Deputy Oliver Flanagan to the position of Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>It is true, of course, that the Deputies opposite will have to come in and put on the record of the House their support for the motion in the sense of voting for it, but most of the leading members of Fine Gael and Labour are not renowned for their reticence and unwillingness to give to us and to the country generally the benefit of their views on topics diverse, but there is a noted lack of willingness and enthusiasm to put their views on record, other than the votes which they are compelled to give or otherwise to bring about the downfall of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that in dealing with this <Col N="828" /> motion it would appear to be almost mandatory, particularly because of the narrow ruling of the Chair in relation to it, to engage in a personal attack on another Member of the House. I regret that and wish as far as I can to confine what I have to say in regard to Deputy Oliver Flanagan to a political attack but it is, I frankly admit, sometimes difficult to draw the line between the two.  To the extent that what I have to say amounts to a personal attack, I regret it, but I think it is necessary that it should be said.</P>
    <P>Before saying anything of that kind, however, I want to underline a fundamental issue involved in this, and it is that the real responsibility for what is proposed to be done in this motion lies not with Deputy Oliver Flanagan or with the other Deputies on the opposite benches in general, but with the Taoiseach personally because it is the Taoiseach personally who, under the Constitution, is responsible for the nomination of members of the Government.  Nobody else is entitled to exercise that function.  Of course, he has to get the support of the majority of Deputies for his proposition, but that proposition would not be before us if the Taoiseach, personally and individually, had not decided to bring the proposition here.</P>
    <P>The first thing that becomes obvious on even a cursory examination of this motion is the personal unsuitability of Deputy Oliver Flanagan to be Minister for Defence or, indeed, to be a member of the Government.  Only in the last few days we have had highlighted one example of that unsuitability.  I refer, of course, to the indiscretion committed by Deputy Flanagan when he stated at a public meeting that his appointment was about to be announced. It is true that he issued a statement designed to deny that, but that statement was too clever by half, and it carefully referred only to his scripted speech: it did not deny the accuracy of the newspaper reports that he had used the words attributed to him.</P>
    <P>This kind of thing, I freely confess, is not a major issue but it is <Col N="829" /> an indication of the kind of indiscretion which every Member of this House expects from Deputy Oliver Flanagan but which one would hope as far as possible to avoid in a member of the Government.  I am not suggesting that every member of every Government has been so discreet as to meet the highest standards one might aim for but I am suggesting that this indiscretion was to be expected and I predict that if the Government last long enough there will be further indiscretions by Deputy Flanagan as Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Oliver Flanagan for many years has been well known, one might even say notorious, for some of the most outrageous statements of abuse in this House and outside it, but particularly in this House, and for some amazing statements of prejudice and bias, and these statements have stretched over his whole public career. I do not propose to go back over that record now&mdash;I think enough reference has been made and sufficient evidence has been furnished by this side of the House to make my statement in that respect incontrovertible.</P>
    <P>However, there is another matter, which also has been referred to and which I feel obliged to refer to again because of the very serious nature of what is involved, and that is the finding of the tribunal of inquiry in the Locke Distillery case in which High Court judges found that statements made on oath by Deputy Oliver Flanagan were untrue and that he knew they were untrue.  I suggest that since that is a matter of public record there is a very heavy onus on the Taoiseach, when replying to the debate, to explain why, given that that is so and a matter of public record, he feels justified in putting forward the name of Deputy Oliver Flanagan, in respect of whom that finding was made by High Court judges, as a suitable person to be a member of the Government and in particular Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Taoiseach that there is no answer and no justification for it, that the Taoiseach was tempted to engage in discussions on other matters relating to other <Col N="830" /> Governments and other persons whenever instances might have occurred which the Taoiseach might think would assist him.  One could go back to 1922 to find instances that the Taoiseach might feel would assist him in justifying this nomination, but I say now, in case the Taoiseach should be tempted to adopt that line, that whatever view one may take of any other incidents, that is not what we are dealing with now.  What we are dealing with is the proposal of the present Taoiseach to nominate Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan now to be a member of the Government and to be Minister for Defence.  That is the issue before the House and that is the issue in respect of which the onus lies on the Taoiseach to justify that nomination having regard to what is on the public record of this country in regard to Deputy Flanagan and his statements on oath which three High Court judges found to be untrue and known to him to be untrue when he made those statements on oath.</P>

      <P>I point out to the Deputy that it is not within the rules at the moment on this debate to refer to the judicial tribunal without at least quoting the exact words of the presiding judge and that to this extent the Deputy is confined, and very confined, in the remarks he may make in regard to this matter.  I just want to inform the Deputy of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Acting Chairman for pointing that out to me. I have, in fact, finished with that topic and I did not purport to quote the findings of the tribunal because the previous speaker quoted extensively and I did not wish to repeat the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that there is not a great deal of cohesion in this present Government and I do not think I can be accused of over-statement when I say that.  But I would suggest that the appointment of Deputy Oliver Flanagan to the Government will certainly not add to their cohesion.  We are all aware of the fact&mdash;indeed, it is on the record&mdash;that Deputy Oliver Flanagan has been an outspoken critic <Col N="831" /> of some major aspects of the policy of this Government which the Taoiseach now proposes he should join. If my recollection serves me adequately, there were long stretches after the present Government came to office during which Deputy Flanagan did not attend this House at all.  It was generally assumed&mdash;and I stress this is only an assumption which cannot be proved &mdash;that this happened as a mark of his dissatisfaction with his Government. Whether the Government have changed their approach so that Deputy Flanagan is now satisfied with their policies or whether Deputy Flanagan adheres to the views he then held but is constrained to keep them to himself for the moment because he wishes to be a Minister of State, is a matter for conjecture.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear that I certainly do not fault Deputy Flanagan in any way for wishing to be a Minister of State.  It is, indeed, a great honour for anybody in this country and any Member of this House to be a Minister of State.  It is a position of great responsibility. There are very onerous duties attached to it and I would not fault Deputy Flanagan in any way for wishing to be a Minister of State.  However, I am, I suggest, entitled to question whether, in accepting the invitation of the Taoiseach to become a member of the Government, Deputy Flanagan has changed his views.  We have no indication as to what Deputy Flanagan's views are now.  In particular, we have no indication in this debate because we have had no contributions from the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>I suggest that, having regard to the personal unsuitability of Deputy Flanagan to which I have referred and having regard to the political disagreements between Deputy Flanagan and the Government, we can get a fair indication of the real values placed by the Government and in particular by the Taoiseach on the protestations of their concern and regard for the Defence Forces.  The Defence Forces are a vitally important part of the institutions of this State.  Seldom have they been more important to the preservation <Col N="832" /> of the State than in recent years.  The appointment of a Minister for Defence is never a matter to be taken lightly but at present it is a matter of particular concern to all our citizens.  There must be few people who, if asked to pick out the Deputy in this House who would be least suitable for the position of Minister for Defence, would come up with somebody other than Deputy Oliver Flanagan.</P>
    <P>The reasons which prompted the Taoiseach to put forward this nomination are, of course, known only to the Taoiseach himself.  We can speculate on them but can do no more than that.  The most obvious reason is the improvement of the electoral chances of the Fine Gael Party in the constituency of Laois-Offaly.  There may, indeed, be other reasons.  It is my hope, indeed, my belief, that that calculation will backfire and that, contrary to the belief expressed that such an appointment will improve the electoral chances of the Fine Gael Party in Laois-Offaly, the direct consequence will be the loss of a seat by Fine Gael in Laois-Offaly in the next election.  I think it would have happened anyway, if that is any consolation to the Taoiseach but I think also that this will improve the chances of that occurring.  I suppose it is legitimate for others outside to speculate on that but, basically, it is an internal Fine Gael matter.</P>
    <P>But the appointment of Deputy Oliver Flanagan to be a member of the Government and to be Minister for Defence is not an internal Fine Gael matter and should not be decided for Fine Gael party reasons.  This vacancy has arisen because of the nomination of Deputy Richard Burke, former Minister for Education, to be a member of the Commission of the European Economic Community and the resultant reshuffle arising from that vacancy so created.  It is legitimate to point out that the nomination which produced the vacancy which the Taoiseach is now seeking to fill was marked by disgraceful manoeuvring among members of the Government. That manoeuvring took place largely in the press but it also took place <Col N="833" /> behind the scenes.  It revealed the depth of disloyalty and dissension which is almost unbelievable.  It revealed a Government riven by rivalries, apparent competition and by incompatible political philosophies.</P>
    <P>The fact that the nomination was made does not end either the rivalries or the incompatibility.  It underlines the extent to which this misfortunate country is saddled with a Government of the kind revealed in those manoeuvres and goes some way to explain their inability to grapple with most of the major issues coming before them.  This inability is seen in a manoeuvre backwards almost every time they come up against a difficult decision while the situation of the country, particularly the economy, drifts on and on towards unmanageable chaos.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of the appointment of Deputy Richard Burke to the EEC Commission was the reshuffle which took place, which included the transfer of the former Minister for Defence to the Department of Lands.  I do not want to dwell on that matter and I do not know the extent to which I would be allowed to do so. The translation of Deputy Donegan at the very least indicates how right we were on this side of the House when we proposed a motion of no confidence in him.  It is a belated acknowledgment by the Taoiseach of how right we were and carries with it the question many people have asked.  Why did the Taoiseach not recognise that in the first instance?  Why did he not act in the first instance and thereby save the country and many people, not least the present Minister for Lands, a great deal of anxiety and, perhaps, worse than that?</P>
    <P>I do not know how many people today remember when Deputy Oliver Flanagan was first elected to the House that he stood as a candidate for the party of monetary reform.  We might well ask, in the light of that and also since he has been nominated to be a member of the Government, who have a constitutional obligation of collective responsibility, what are the views of Deputy Oliver Flanagan or what is his attitude to our current <Col N="834" /> economic problems?  What will his approach be to the curbing or expanding of public expenditure?  Does he believe that some steps of monetary reform are open to us and, if so, what are those steps?  What will he be urging?  Will he favour in the forthcoming budget a reduction in capital expenditure as we had this year and a consequent decrease in the limited possibilities there were in job creation?  Will he feel that is a justifiable approach in order, hopefully, to bring down inflation although no particular result of that kind appears to have attended the Government's efforts this year despite the substantial reduction in the real level of capital spending as against what was proposed?</P>
    <P>I presume Deputy Flanagan, as a member of the Government, will make his contribution to the discussions on the forthcoming budget. It would be of considerable assistance if one knew what his general stand on those matters was.  We do not know. We do not know if he favours the policies followed by the Government in recent years which have produced the enormous amount of public debt with which we are now saddled.  Will he try to reverse it or urge it on further? We do not know if he favours tax cuts.  What are his views on what wage levels should be in the coming year?  We do not know any of those things.  Perhaps some people will say it does not matter.  That may be a realistic view but it is cynical.  I prefer to take the view that the views any member of the Government expresses in the preparation of a budget are important.</P>
    <P>I suspect, when the Taoiseach replies to this debate, that he will be very tempted to tell us about the votes which Deputy Flanagan has got at successive elections in the constituency of Laois-Offaly.  That would be a legitimate approach for him.  If he is tempted to pursue that line, I suggest to him, before he does that, to give a little thought to this.</P>
    <P>The fact that Deputy Flanagan has been re-elected at successive elections to this House usually if not always, and I think it was always since the <Col N="835" /> second general election, at the top of the poll is no answer to the putting forward of his nomination as a member of the Government.  Many Deputies have been re-elected at election after election, some of them at the top of the poll, and many of them make very good representatives for their constituencies.  That is why they are re-elected.</P>
    <P>I would not deny that Deputy Flanagan appears to be a very good representative for his constituency.  He would not continue to get the support he has got in his constituency if he was not a good representative.  The fact that a Deputy is a good representative for his constituency does not mean that he would make a good Minister or that he should be nominated as a member of the Government. I suspect very strongly, in the case of Deputy Oliver Flanagan, that many of those who vote for him would be among the first to say that he is a good representative but not suitable material to be in the Government.</P>
    <P>In this matter of the nomination of Deputy Flanagan to be a member of the Government, to be the Minister of Defence, the responsibility does not lie with Deputy Flanagan, it lies with the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach made the choice and is proposing this to the House.  It is no answer for the Taoiseach to tell us that Deputy Flanagan has demonstrated that he has the support of his constituents.  Deputy Flanagan has the support of his constituents as a Member of Dáil Éireann. The Taoiseach has the responsibility for putting him forward as a member of the Government, not the people of Laois-Offaly.  The Taoiseach has taken on that responsibility and it must be discharged.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach will do his best to discharge that responsibility shortly in this House, but in the end the judgment on whether the Taoiseach has discharged that responsibility will not be made in this House, it will be made outside the House at the next general election and it will not be made only in Laois-Offaly, it will be made in every constituency.  I have no doubt <Col N="836" /> whatever as to what the verdict on the Taoiseach's action today will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose this debate might be described as a preChristmas free-for-all.  I will try to stick strictly to the facts.  Deputy Lynch, the Leader of the Opposition, complained that on a previous occasion when a matter of this sort was debated, the debate was widened, and he went on to refer to events of May, 1970.  Deputy Lynch chose the date, perhaps I will be accorded the privilege of choosing the quotations.  On that occasion the then Taoiseach announced that the then Minister for Justice had tendered his resignation. The reason I refer to this is because the Leader of the Opposition used some words of criticism about the fact that I had, as he put it, concealed from the Dáil some weeks ago the offer by the then Minister for Defence of his resignation as Minister.  I informed the Dáil of his offer after it was made, but when the then Taoiseach on 5th May, 1970 in Volume 246 of the Official Report, column 519, announced that the then Minister for Justice had tendered his resignation I asked:</P>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say if this is the only Ministerial resignation we can expect?</P>
      <P>The then Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is referring to.</P>
      <P>The Order of Business was then proceeded with and the financial resolutions were discussed.  I demurred to the idea of taking the motion to appoint Deputy Desmond O'Malley as a member of the Government.  Business proceeded and the budget debate was proceeded with.  On the following day there was a motion by the then Taoiseach not merely to appoint Deputy O'Malley as a member of the Government, but as a result of what might be described as a nocturnal spree, three other members of the Government left office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to recall this because Deputies opposite who have spoken on this debate have been very vocal about what Deputy Flanagan said or <Col N="837" /> about what somebody else said.  Recently in this House we had a debate in which Deputy Haughey and others were concerned about the respect that they asserted I showed for the Constitution. The facts are that two members of the then Government did not tender their resignation, in fact they did not accede to the request of the then Taoiseach to give him their resignations.  For the first time under this Constitution, and as far as I know under the 1922 Constitution, the Taoiseach had to terminate their assignments.  In other words, they were sacked.</P>
    <P>The Ministers sacked at the time were Deputy Blaney and Deputy C.J. Haughey.  The then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Kevin Boland, was so outraged at what had happened that he tendered his resignation and his colleague the then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Paudge Brennan, also resigned as a Parliamentary Secretary.  It is important to get this into perspective.  The facts were that the then Minister for Finance met with an accident prior to the budget and the then Taoiseach took over and introduced the budget.  Those present in the House at that time including the then Leader of the Labour Party, my colleague the Minister for Health and I, expressed our sympathy at what had happened.  That had occurred in April 1970.  Subsequently in May the then Taoiseach visited the then Minister for Finance in hospital and discussed at some stage with Deputy Neil T. Blaney what he had discovered had happened.  In the Dáil Debates to which I have referred the then Taoiseach said that he would take action, but he recalled that I paid a little call on him that night.</P>

Public money was misappropriated and three Ministers failed to tell the then Taoiseach.  This was not a speech, a comment or a discussion document as Deputy Dowling said this morning.  I understand that Fianna Fáil discussion documents are brought forward by Deputy Brennan, when he is not being run by the dissidents as a candidate for the Presidency.

There is no need for me <Col N="840" /> to quote again from the report I referred to because Deputies are familiar with it.  It shows that not merely were statements made but that three Ministers of the then Government failed to inform the then Taoiseach of what was happening.  What happened?  One left the party, another resigned from the House and another went to the back benches and while there he remained silent.  Time passed.  Then when he was on a canvass in North-West Dublin who did he meet accidentally but the Leader of his own party.  It was almost like Livingstone and Stanley.  They met in Dublin North-West; they were previously acquainted but in case they had forgotten each other they were reintroduced.  After some time the Deputy was invited down to the front bench and to celebrate his return he met an old colleague, Deputy Blaney.  The latter put an arm round him in the corridor&mdash; outside the bar there is a long chair &mdash;when they met.  Deputy Blaney is on record as saying that Ministers of the then Government were responsible for starting the Provisional IRA.</P>

This was not a speech, a comment or, in the words of Deputy Dowling, a discussion document.  This was the action of the Committee of Public Accounts after an exhaustive and extensive investigation. Under the rules of that Committee it is comprised of Deputies from all parties.  Deputy Briscoe was a conscientious objector and he resigned from that Committee.  In case people may think I am giving a partial account of what happened, I would also point out that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Keating, also resigned at one stage.  Both Deputies were replaced; strangely enough, Deputy Briscoe was replaced by Deputy Dowling and Deputy Keating was replaced by Deputy Cluskey.  It is not necessary to repeat what is contained in the report because Deputies opposite, the <Col N="841" /> House, the Press and the media are familiar with it.  It found for the first time in the history of the State that public money had been misappropriated without the Ministers named in the report informing the then Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputies opposite really had their hearts in this debate. They introduced it as an effort to cover up for recent events and to try to score off the Government.  In fact, the debate could be described as a non-event. They anticipated that references would be made to this report but I do not want to traverse old ground.  I suppose few people know Fianna Fáil better than I do.  Deputy Flanagan and I have looked at them from both sides of the House and we know them fairly well.  However, there is one person who knows them better that we do.  We speak from external knowledge but he speaks from internal knowledge.  He was once described by the present Leader of the Opposition when he was Taoiseach as &ldquo;a rock of integrity&rdquo;.  On 8th December last there was an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> headed: &ldquo;Ex-Minister finds peace&rdquo;. I will give a few quotations from that article.  He said:</P>
    <P>As far as the party was concerned the prior concern was a personal one.  We, as individuals, fourteen <Col N="842" /> of us, had acquired permanent jobs in Government.  We were there 12 years and were starting another term.  So there was a vested interest in staying.  Money and power had taken over the party and they were not prepared to give this up for the people of the North.  They had grown to like being the representatives of the major party in the country, so the initial treachery was allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>The most telling quotation was the following:</P>
    <P>The party founded by my father absorbed my life from my boyhood and I am sorry it is such a disaster. It could have been otherwise.</P>
    <P>I do not think any more telling condemnation of the party opposite could be made than that expression by Mr. Kevin Boland.  He was reared in Fianna Fáil, he knew the party and he had been a colleague of the Ministers concerned.  He was described by his then Leader as &ldquo;a rock of integrity&rdquo;. That is his verdict of Fianna Fáil.  It is the most effective, severe and in many respects the most accurate that anybody could make.  I will leave it at that.  I will settle for it.  I could not be more severe in my comments.</P>

    <Title>Salmon, Eel and Oyster Fishing Licences (Alteration of Licence Duties) Order, 1976: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
    <P>Salmon, Eel and Oyster Fishing Licences (Alteration of Licence Duties) Order, 1976,</P>
    <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid on the table of Dáil Éireann on the 3rd day of December, 1976.</P>

      <P>When this discussion was adjourned last week I expressed my surprise that there should be opposition to this motion for increasing the licence duties chargeable for fish netting generally.  The main opposition seemed to centre on the licence duties chargeable on driftnetting, and it was indicated that an increase of £47 from £3 to £50, was too sizeable and should not be approved by the House.  I had mentioned that the £3 licence duty for drift-netting was established in the year 1848 when that amount of money was a far different figure from what it is today, and I am virtually certain that £3 in 1848 was much greater than £50 is in 1976.  Therefore I did not see any justifiable grounds for the opposition to this increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisional figure for our salmon catches this year, 1976, is of <Col N="845" /> the order of £5.3 million.  That is what the catch is deemed to be worth, and what we are doing here in this measure is asking for a general group of increases on the several netting licences.  The Exchequer contribution for this current year is £390,000 to boards of conservators.  The contribution from licence duties is £42,000, and on the assumption that a similar number of licences will be taken out in 1977&mdash;and I have no doubt that that will happen&mdash;the new figure will be £152,000.  Therefore we are asking the holders of the several licences to contribute an additional £110,000, and I expressed the view here on the last occasion that I was quite satisfied that there were no objections to making this contribution.</P>
    <P>In the course of my discussions with licence holders, and particularly drift net licence holders, they made it quite clear to me that they were anxious to make a greater contribution towards our salmon&mdash;as one could describe it&mdash;conservancy fund. They appreciated that the nominal figure of £3 in this present year was a ridiculous contribution.  On such recommendations, and in view of the fact that I had already indicated to the House some months ago that we had in mind to make these increases, the question at issue then was what was the better channel through which to collect the additional revenue. Naturally, increased licence duties was one way.  The Opposition here in the Dáil and also the Opposition in the Seanad indicated another way.</P>

      <P>This is the third time we have debated this question in recent weeks.  Although I asserted in the course of my contribution on previous debates that it was helpful to have discussions on this exceptionally <Col N="846" /> important question of fishery development, in my view we are going too far now.  I do not wish to stifle the Opposition but this is gimmickry.  It leads us to the position whereby we have to publicise the limitations of our case and, naturally, that will move outside the House.  I have not the slightest doubt that had the Opposition sought discussions with the Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries and Foreign Affairs on this vital issue they would have been forthcoming.</P>

As everybody is aware, we had discussions with representatives of the fishermen and organisations interested in this vital issue.  We set down in our case that we thought it was vital in order to develop our fishery industry that we should get an exclusive band of 50 miles.  The Government's view is that we must make the best effort possible to achieve that objective.</P>

      <P>In the course of the debate last night some niceties were exchanged between the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kelly, and Deputy Haughey and both of them affirmed that they were committed Europeans.  They were in agreement that any moves made on this and any other question should be made by this House on the basis that we are committed Europeans.  An interjection of Deputy Haughey's removed any doubt.  He was surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary should express some doubts.  I agree with their conclusions.  The people want us to remain in the community and, as one who opposed entry, I feel we should <Col N="847" /> continue our membership and try to get from the Community the best concessions in all fields.</P>
      <P>In my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries I am mainly concerned with the development of our fisheries and the efforts to get the best possible concessions for our fishermen. The big question of renegotiating our fisheries position arose some time ago. We expressed the view on many occasions that we were dissatisfied with the disastrous policy obtaining and that it was necessary to make changes.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated that his Department, who are mainly concerned with the discussions with the EEC Commission and the Council of Ministers, would go along with such discussions with our partners in a constitutional way and within the framework of the Community. That is the best approach.  An exclusive band is necessary and essential but I cannot agree with the assertion of Deputy Fahey, my predecessor, that a 50-mile exclusive band is there for the taking.  It is not there for the taking and for that reason I am sure that when Deputy Fahey contributed he was talking with his tongue in his cheek.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will make his own case.  I do not know whether the people opposite want me to use up my time answering ridiculous questions and suggestions from them.  I do not propose to do that.  We have an objective, this exclusive band, and it requires completely new negotiations. That is what we are trying to achieve with, if possible, the approval of our Community partners.  This is not a short cut to an exclusive fishery band, in my view.  We must get there piecemeal and first, we had to consider how to bridge the gap created by the differences of opinion expressed by the different Governments and particularly the difference of opinion which this Government put forward with the Governments of at least seven out of the nine member countries. I felt we must have an interim agreement, that there was no possible hope in Ireland abruptly telling the Community &ldquo;We must get a 50-mile exclusive band or nothing.&rdquo;  If we were to do that, we would not get a hearing.  We would not get approval and whatever action would be taken inside or outside this House by the Government to establish this band would not get recognition.  That is the difference between trying to get a band in such a way and trying to get it with the consent and approval of our Community partners.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party conscience is now pricking them about the way they let down the fishermen and nobody knows that better than the fishermen.  My view was that we must have an interim agreement because of the ravishing of our stocks by boats from outside, whether from Eastern Europe or from our Community partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" /> We had a clear picture of the position when our Naval Service arrested two boats off the south coast.  Everybody knows what fish the Bulgarian boat contained, fish some of which possibly was caught inside our existing limit and the remainder quite close to it.  We had the same position when the Russian boat was arrested with a complement of 101 men which indicates its size and the magnitude of its fishing activity.  In my discussions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs we decided that one of the first things we should try to achieve&mdash;I have always been factual on this matter and I shall be factual tonight&mdash;was to secure, if possible, Community approval for the removal of such people as the Bulgarians, Rumanians, East Germans, Russians and others.  It would be a step forward towards our goal if we could remove them and the third countries such as Spain, if at all possible. In the negotiations that took place this week that was one of the main items put forward by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>You did nothing but in my view this so-called Front Bench Opposition want to spoil my time.  Long they will be in Opposition. Our view was that we should work, if possible, with the consent of the Commission.  Is this not what this firmly committed European, Deputy Haughey, last night said he would do to see how far we would get?  The Minister did say that if we did not make the progress that we felt we should make at this stage other action would be taken.  It was made abundantly clear, and it is my conviction, that we should go to the Community to get the assistance we require to police the 50-mile band and to develop our fishing industry.  We are expecting aid from the Community for our fishery development before the year is out.  We are tied to the Community.  I do not think the knot can be cut to loosen us from them.  If there is such an opinion held by Members of this House, it should be expressed in no uncertain terms.</P>

      <P>First we want to deal with the eastern question and then get the best concessions in the interim period.  That is not a general statement but a reasonable one.  We tried to bring the people in the Community <Col N="852" /> towards our view of a 50-mile exclusive band.  That is how I see it and I have no doubt the way the Minister for Foreign Affairs saw it too.  It is one thing to talk in this House but when one goes abroad and hears Ministers of equal importance giving their views which are violently opposed to ours, what do you find?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you pull out?  No.  Despite that violent opposition, there is an air of sympathy which we are cultivating as best we can.  This package, if I may use the term, is a unit, an internal regime on an interim basis and an external regime.  One is contingent on the other.  It was made clear that if one failed so would the other.  What would happen if no agreement was reached?  I will give my own views; I do not want to express views for the Minister or anybody else.  We would reach a chaotic state.  If we took unilateral action, I doubt if it would get respect from anybody, irrespective of what might be said here.  It would not help us, in the Council of Ministers, to rid our waters of East Europeans&mdash;Russians, Bulgarians and others.  That is the first essential step we must take but we cannot do it alone because we do not have the power or authority to do so.  It may be even more difficult than anticipated for the Community, with all their strength, to get these people out of our waters but we are heartened by the fact that Russia has declared a 200-mile zone.</P>
      <P>A fisherman from Killybegs might not find much comfort in the fact that although the Russians have gone the Dutch have moved in.  We are trying to make interim regulations that will put us in a favourable light and bring us part of the way towards our ultimate goal.  At every meeting it is clearly set down that these discussions were without prejudice to our final objective of a 50-mile exclusive band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the meeting of the Council of Ministers on Monday the Commissioner repeated that our ultimate objective of the 50-mile band was <Col N="853" /> reserved.  The members of the Council failed to agree, and I do not know if any agreement will be reached at their next meeting.  No one knows what the position will be. I believe it would be a marked advantage for our fishery development if a fair and reasonable agreement was reached.  I would not like to see the meetings of the Council break up without reaching agreement. We have set down measures which we consider fair and reasonable and which will satisfy us in the interim period.  We are conscious of our obligations as members of the Community and we are not treading softly.  We are fighting softly the hard way.</P>
    <P>It might be said that the Government in their negotiations in this vital matter are too soft.  That is far from the truth.  As I said, we are fighting softly the hard way.  We are giving facts and figures to people who have their own problems and trying to get them to see our point of view.  We only concern ourselves with their problems in so far as they affect us. We belong to a group of Nine.  We are dealing with a policy which Deputy Haughey told the Dáil last night was drawn up before the three additional countries joined so that it would be binding on them.  Everybody knows Norway in their referendum voted against accession and that they did so mainly because of what they regarded as a disastrous fishing policy.</P>
    <P>I will not go into other matters that Deputy Haughey mentioned because of the time at my disposal.  Everybody knows it was essential to set down in writing the interim proposals we have in mind.  They are the subject of discussions in the Commission and we hope they will be acceptable as an interim arrangement.  I say with all the vehemence at my command that it will be the first beneficial step, far more beneficial than this Bill which has been brought in by Fianna Fáil as a political football.  We are charged with the responsibility of governing and we will govern, as far as fisheries are concerned, with responsibility.</P>

      <P>It is accepted that members of national parliaments read, discuss and assess debates in other member states.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us examine the case for the 200-mile limit.  Of course, we are glad to get it but it is nothing <Col N="855" /> without the exclusive limit we are seeking for our own fishermen.  It will put some people out but it will leave our wealthy fishing grounds as a playground to other EEC members who in turn will have the right to barter that 200-mile limit to others in return for access to their waters.  The Russians have been given until 1st January unless they negotiate, but obviously, they will be back in a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>This 200-mile limit is not the great gift it is being held out to be and our fishermen see the uselessness of it. They want to see an exclusive limit available only for our own people, and this prospect has been seriously diminished.</P>

      <P>Apart from that they must have that 50-mile limit to give them a sense of security.  Without that we will not get the necessary continuity in the development of fisheries. If people contemplate a 50-mile limit that is going to be exhausted within a particular time then they are not going to be so interested in expensive equipment and gear in order to hand down to their sons and those who will come after them a valuable industry.  Continuity gives security and without security and long-term planning this cannot be brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we entered the EEC, which the Parliamentary Secretary and his party sternly opposed, we knew we were putting ourselves in a position to develop certain sectors of our economy with the assistance of EEC membership. Indeed, if we were not members we would not be talking here today about the possibility of doing things we can, must and should do.  It is in that context that we should make the most <Col N="856" /> of what is available to us to develop our most important industry.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach pointed out that we are beneficiaries under the EEC.  That was a generalisation with relation to our membership. We can easily point out on the other side that in our fisheries and the 200-mile limit which has been set up we are placing at the disposal of other members a bonanza which they did not possess but which is of magnificent benefit to them.  All we are asking is that part of that 200 miles, one-fourth of it, be exclusively provided for our own development of our own industry. That is a simple thing.  What Fianna Fáil did or did not do in the Treaty of Accession has no relevance here now.  There was no question of the 200-mile limit then.</P>
    <P>Remember that immediately prior to the Treaty of Accession there was a common fishery policy agreed between the then Six and when we signed the Treaty of Accession there was a derogation, if you like, at Article 2141/70 which covered the entire nine members, not the three then entered.  Any other derogation from any existing article related to the new entrants only including ourselves and the other two partners being admitted at that time.  This related only to a 12-mile limit.  There was no question of a 200-mile limit then.  The 200-mile limit has come up since and we are now in a completely new ball game.</P>

      <P>We heard a lot, too, about doubling our catch in three years.  That was a tremendous achievement and some of us were only a little apprehensive as to whether we would be able to provide the fleet necessary to enable us to double the catch.  Indeed, I was wondering whether it was in value or in quantity.  The Parliamentary Secretary in answer to a parliamentary question assured me it was in quantity that we would double our catch in three years.  I have been <Col N="858" /> informed, as the newspapers say, reliably informed, that there are terms worked out for 1977 and that the provision in those terms for 1977 in relation to the Irish catch makes for a 6 per cent increase.  I hope that is not true.  The Parliamentary Secretary will deny it if it is not.  I will give him the opportunity to interrupt now and say I am wrong.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of a 6 per cent increase in our catch which was confidentially conveyed to the Department and reported as such the other day without any mention of terms is untrue, the Parliamentary Secretary states, but I have been reliably informed that in those terms which can be confidentially conveyed to our Government, they provided for only a 6 per cent increase.  Therefore, the other 94 per cent increase would then have to take place in the following two years.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that is wrong and I am prepared to accept that.  He has the inside information and I will say nothing further about it.  However, I could not help noticing the lack of reference to this double catch arrangement that had been made for three years.  I am delighted that the Parliamentary Secretary has corrected me and said that the arrangement for 1977 of 6 per cent is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a lot of sympathy for the position in which the Government found themselves in relation to our fishing industry.  I am not at all hopeful that they see the way so clearly after some of the comments I heard and read in relation to the recent efforts to establish this 50-mile limit. I am a little despondent about the approach of the Government in this debate as in the motion we had down last week.  They seem to rely entirely on criticising Fianna Fáil or pointing out what Fianna Fáil had done wrong <Col N="859" /> and emphasising what was wrong; emphasising too, that unilateral action is not acceptable to them, that we must be good boys within the Community where we are such net beneficiaries and we must remain good boys and take no action that would offend in any way any of our partners. That spells only despondency to me, a fear of what is ahead and that there is compromise, preparing us for something that will not be in keeping with what we want.  I would have liked to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say &ldquo;We are delighted the Opposition have made those proposals in this Bill. We are not prepared to accept them because it is the Government's duty to oppose such a Bill.  It strengthens our hand and we will stick out for a 50-mile limit no matter what happens.&rdquo; We have had no such statement.  We had references to what Fianna Fáil did not do and gimmickry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Government to approach those matters in a proper fashion instead of accusing the Opposition of playing politics. Since the debate last week I can feel a greater sense of determination by the Government to try to retrieve some of the ground they lost when they accepted the 200-mile limit.  It is immaterial to us what the Government accuse us of.  We will do our duty as an Opposition should.  This will place <Col N="860" /> the Government in a position where they will feel bound to make the best possible effort and to settle for nothing less than the 50-mile exclusive limit.</P>
      <P>The former Minister for Defence is on record as saying that if we got the 50-mile limit we could not police it.  I heard him on radio in the last few days defending that attitude.  I suppose one could say that we can police nothing, that we would need to have a policeman at the door of every business premises and bank and also a soldier if we were to do what is regarded as policing in relation to the mainland alone.  We do not need to have destroyers and battleships rigged around the coast to protect our fisheries but we need to have sufficient not to make it worth-while for those who want to risk using our waters illegally.</P>
      <P>I do not believe it would require a great deal of money to provide that type of service.  One or two helicopters can do a great job in this respect.  The amount of money involved for protection, against the background of the potential value to us, is not prohibitive. It can be done over a period.  We have the right to get every possible assistance from the EEC to do this.  The overall spirit of the Treaty of Rome is that the EEC members should ensure that the economy of each member is brought into harmony with the others.  In order to do that they must be allowed to exploit to the utmost whatever resources are available to them.  It is essential that those resources be confined to the use of the nation using them as much as possible.</P>
      <P>One of our main industries after agriculture is fishing.  Our EEC partners could not for one moment sustain a case against our seeking to hold a certain area of the sea for the exclusive use of our industry to enable us to plan and arrange, on a long-term basis, the proper expansion of that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We assume that not merely should we have that exclusive limit but that we should have, as members of the EEC, the necessary assistance from EEC funds to enable <Col N="861" /> us to do it.  It takes a lot of money to establish and expand a fishing industry. We made it possible for men who had not the price of boats to get them by paying a percentage of the cost and paying the remainder by a deduction from their catch.  We took a first step then towards enabling young men to put boats to sea which they could not possibly have done if that arrangement was not made.  This is the way we established an industry which required a huge amount of capital.</P>
      <P>We have prospects, as EEC members, of getting extra capital to more rapidly develop that industry.  I am sure that each of the other eight members must concede that we are only within our rights in seeking, for the benefit of our economy and allowing us to come into harmony with their economies, to have an absolute right to declare, as the Parliamentary Secretary says, a coastal band which will be exclusive to our fishermen.  This will enable our fishermen to have security. There will be time at our disposal and we can do whatever we want in connection with our fishing industry.</P>
      <P>How can we conserve our fisheries if we allow 200 miles to be used by virtually everyone, by the other eight member states and those with whom they make arrangements to fish within that limit for the rights they will seek to get fishing in other waters?  That is what this debate is about.  There is no need for Members on the other side to get hot under the collar, be worried and make excuses which should only be made by the people who are opposed to our getting this limit if they were sure they could get away with it.  I would not blame the other member states for seeking to keep us off this exclusive limit because these waters will be a playground for them.  If we were in their position, we would try hard also.  Surely there should be no difficulty in establishing what we are now seeking to do.  We must forget about the Treaty of Accession because we are in a completely new ball game now.</P>

      <P>I have listened to three Opposition speakers in relation to this private Bill that is propounded by the Opposition and I note a great note of dejection.  Speaking as a lawyer, I note an irrational and rather misguided approach to this entire subject. We are members of the EEC.  We signed the Act of Accession and we are not entitled to resign from our obligations under the treaty or under the Act of Accession.  Our fellow partners in the EEC and in the Commission must observe their responsibilities and their duties also.  The Opposition are making the case that the Irish sea fisheries industry would be safe and secure for all time if we took unilateral action and declared an exclusive 50-miles zone.  They say that this measure that they have brought before the House is necessary.  They seem to forget that we have already on the Statute Books, the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959, which gives the Government of the day power to declare an exclusive fishing zone which is not limited to three, six or 12 miles. There is also power in that Act to discriminate if they can between the boats of different nationalities.</P>

    <P>This hullabaloo that is going on under this proposed Bill is utterly unnecessary.  The legal instrument is already there in our Statute Book, that is, the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959, as amended by the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1964.  When we were negotiating for the EEC we on this side of the House did not know what the inside operations or difficulties were in relation to the negotiations.  We could <Col N="863" /> only judge the negotiations by what we were told officially in this House.  As far as I can gather from reading the debate prior to the finalisation of our accession to the EEC, the Government of the day took the view that we would be in a better position if we got in and negotiated afterwards rather than laying down hard and fast rules before we went in.  I understand that was the attitude taken by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and I assume that he did that with the encouragement of the other Ministers in the Cabinet of that time.  Maybe the Government of the day did not appreciate that if they signed a document they were bound by that document, particularly if that document was a treaty of international standing with wide ranging effects.  It was primarily an economic treaty.  It was not like the Convention on Human Rights which dealt with other matters.</P>
    <P>As a result of my recent researches, I have become more and more convinced that our negotiators of that time were not aware of the seriousness with which the wording of the Act of Accession required to be scrutinised and, if necessary, amended before signature.  Deputy Brennan this evening has been unequivocal in advocating unilateral action.  He used that phrase again and again.  We signed the Act of Accession in 1972 or early in 1973.  Surely our negotiators were aware of the fact that one of the institutions of the EEC was the European Court of Justice, and surely they were aware that the function of the EEC Court of Justice functions was not to make regulations or clauses in the treaty but to interpret them as they stood.  If that was the case, how is it that our negotiating Minister and the Taoiseach, both of whom signed the Act of Accession, were not aware of a case decided by the European Court called Costa v. Enel.  Judgment of the court was delivered on the 15th July, 1964, and now we hear mighty voices propounding a doctrine of unilateral action.  On page 586, paragraph 3, of the Official Report of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, 1964 it is stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> By contrast with ordinary international Treaties, the EEC Treaty created its own legal system, which, on the entry into force of the Treaty, they became an integral part of the legal systems of the Member States and which their courts are bound to apply.</P>
    <P>By creating a Community of unlimited duration, having its own institutions, its own personality, its own legal capacity, and capacity of representation on the international plane and, more particularly, real powers stemming from a limitation of sovereignty or a transfer of powers from the States, to the Community, the Member States have limited their sovereign rights and have thus created a body of law which binds both their nationals and themselves.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Brennan this evening, and he was a member of the Cabinet at that time, it is patently obvious that neither he nor the Cabinet were aware of what the meaning or the effect of signing the Act of Accession would be.  However, one has to go a little further.  I see a useful chink of light which helps us to deal with the awkward predicament in which we have been placed by the faulty negotiation procedures of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>Not alone do member states have obligations, the Commission also has obligations.  It must see that the terms of the EEC Treaty are put into full and proper force.  I would recommend a recent case to the Deputies on the opposite benches who have been propounding their views in relation to the laws concerning the EEC Treaty.  I am referring to the Kramer case.  In fact, there were three cases heard at the same time&mdash;Nos. 3, 4 and 6 of 1976.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph 11 of the judgment of the court the following useful statement is made and it is of considerable interest to us when discussing our fisheries predicament.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Under Article 3 (d), the adoption of a common policy in the sphere of agriculture is specially mentioned amongst the objectives of the Community. <Col N="865" /> Under the combined provisions of Article 38 (3) and Annex II to the Treaty, fishery products are subject to the provisions of Articles 39 to 46 concerning agriculture. Article 39 specifies, among the objectives laid down for the common agricultural policy, those of ensuring the rational development of production and of assuring the availability of supplies.  Under the combined provisions of the first three paragraphs of Article 40, the Community must establish, by the end of the transitional period at the latest, a common organisation of agricultural markets, able to include all measures required to attain the objectives set out in Article 39.  To that end, Article 43 (2) confers on the Council the power, and imposes on it the duty, to make regulations, issue directives or take decisions.</P>
    <P>We know that the regulation affecting fishery structures has already been referred to in this House.  In Article 1 of that regulation it is stated &ldquo;the aim of encouraging rational use of the biological resources of the sea and inland waters...&rdquo;  These are duties that are imposed already on the Commission and on the Council of Ministers.  The point I want to stress&mdash;I think the Minister for Foreign Affairs has done so already, as have other spokesmen on this side of the House&mdash;is that we can only operate within the context of the EEC Treaty and the regulations emanating therefrom.  I want to stress my attitude which is this: I do not decry any exclusive 50-mile zone but, at the same time, that is by no means the end of the story.  Deputy Brennan blithely said: &ldquo;We will declare a 50-mile zone.  There is money available in the EEC to develop our fisheries.&rdquo;  Is he out of his mind?  Does he think the EEC will give us all the money we want if we are going to take unilateral action without consultation with our fellow partners in the EEC?  These are dreams, an utterly unreal approach to these matters.  We must be factual, we must deal with the situation as we find it.</P>
    <P>Let this House not forget that the situation as we find it is the situation that was handed to us by the previous <Col N="866" /> Government and no amount of shouting and roaring and fine speeches from the Opposition benches will do any good.  We must use our brains to get the best deal we can, having regard to the rather awkward position in which we have been placed.  It is more than evident that when the Opposition were negotiating not alone did they not realise the economic implications but they did not know at the time the legal implications.  The case I have quoted was a 1964 case and the negotiations for the Treaty were in 1972 and 1973. The former Government must have been aware that of all the EEC countries, excluding Norway and Italy, we had the largest increase in our GNP in respect of our fisheries.  It was a very important matter for us.  It was a new industry growing rapidly with every prospect for the future but no safeguards were provided for in the negotiations because of the reason given by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs. He said: &ldquo;It is better to get in first; we will see how we can work out afterwards.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with a matter which Deputy Haughey has been propounding for some time.  I think he said it twice&mdash;once in the debate on the motion and again in regard to this measure.  He takes the view that as we had only exclusive fishery limits of 12 miles, that as that was all that was contemplated in the Treaty of Accession, we can simply by virtue of that fact pass legislation in this Parliament declaring a 50-mile exclusive zone. He takes the view that in doing so we would not be in breach of our obligations under the Treaty.  That is far too facile an argument.  It is based on a false legal premise.  It is based on a time argument, namely, that as there was only a 12-mile exclusive zone in 1972-73 in 1976 we are not bound by that any longer.  He maintains it only speaks as of the date the Treaty was signed.  If Deputies examine both the Enel and the Kramer cases they will find that argument is knocked on the head and has no legal validity.</P>
    <P>It has also been contended that we are prepared to take an indifferent view on this side of the House of the fishermen's demand for a 50-mile <Col N="867" /> zone.  Apparently that idea has emanated from the fact that we have pointed out to the Opposition the difficulties that have resulted from the terminology of the Treaty of Accession. All we have done is to tell Deputies exactly what the legal position is so far as we know it.  Apparently some Members on the other side of the House feel that, if we declare a 50-mile zone, that is an end of the story and everything else will work out all right after that.</P>
    <P>There is no precedent for the steps the Opposition Deputies advocate, none in either international law or under the law of the EEC.  If you want a legal instrument to stand up, you have to get some minimal consensus from other countries.  There is no such thing as a pure unilateral action in terms of international law. Would we not look right idiots if we were to make now, as of this moment, a declaration for a 50-mile exclusive zone without at least getting the understanding, sympathy and support of our EEC partners?  The wording of that judgment that I quoted pointed out the duties and obligations of the Council of the Commission and of all the members of the EEC in relation to CAP, and fisheries falls under CAP, and shows we have a good argument in law within the realms of the terms of the EEC Treaty and this business of dashing off and producing a little two-section Bill here is not a solution. Indeed, this Bill is a very dangerous one.  I have already referred to part of the wording which appeared in the original motion debated on 7th or 8th December.  The same dangerous wording appears again in this Bill in section 2 which purports to be an amendment of section 3 of the 1964 Maritime Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act and purports to replace subsection (1) and (2) of that section.</P>
    <P>This new subsection (1) provides:</P>
    <P>Fishing in that portion of the exclusive fishery limits of the State which lies inside the line every point of which is at a distance of 50 nautical miles from the nearest point of the base-line shall be restricted <Col N="868" /> exclusively to vessels operating from ports in the State.</P>
    <P>The effect of that is to allow certainly every EEC boat in the zone.  There is no restriction there&mdash;vessels operating from ports in the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">

      <P>Right and, if you are fishing in a 50-mile zone, you are, of course, registered there.  All you need is to take your ship and come in and collect your take.  I do not share the same confidence in the wording of the section as Deputy Gallagher does because the words &ldquo;operating from ports in the State&rdquo; are used. That is not a trade term in legal language.  This is a layman's wording. It has no legal significance and no special connotation.  It does not cover the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; and, if registered was intended why was it not put into the section?</P>

A boat could be operating for three months from Brest and operating for three months out of Dunmore East.  That is the danger.  I take the view, and I have pointed this out to Deputy Gallagher and his colleagues, that this Bill is absolutely unnecessary because the power is already there in the Maritime Jurisdiction Act of 1959 as amended by the 1964 Act.  Of course, I know what is behind this Bill.  It is giving the Opposition an opportunity to keep shouting &ldquo;A 50-mile exclusive zone&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I had almost completed my remarks when the debate adjourned earlier this evening.  The only opposition to the motion asking the House to approve of an increase in licence fees was in respect of drift net licences.  I think I have dealt adequately with that question and that there is nothing further to say, taking into account the fact that the licence fee of £50 compares very favourably with the fee that was set down earlier in 1848.</P>
      <P>It is pleasing, however, that despite the fact that our stock quantities are giving us cause for worry, the total income from our salmon fisheries, as provisionally estimated, stands at more than £5 million.  I can assure the House that any additional moneys collected by way of this measure will be utilised to develop our salmon fisheries, and that utilisation will be carried out jointly by the boards of conservators and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  I am, therefore, asking the House to voice approval of this measure.  It is more or less a measure that was invited, and I see no reason, at a time when salmon are, on the average, making more than £20 apiece, why we could not ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In view of the unconscionable increase in the price of the drift salmon licences, would the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department consider setting up some machinery for the payment of these licence fees by instalments?  Is he aware that the fishermen in my constituency, in Youghal, for example, in addition to paying £50 for a salmon licence also pay the Duke of Devonshire £20, and is he prepared to accept the fee in moieties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that suggestion.  The number of licences issued is relatively low, 1,046, and the intake from the licences is exceptionally high.  As Deputy Brosnan knows, a Deputy representing a coastal area, those who pass the test and qualify for a drift net licence are a favoured section of the community. At present we have representations from people all over the place, many of them quite justified applicants if we had the licences to spread around. I spread them around much more than my friend, Deputy Fahey, but we have to take conservancy into account.  I had occasion to mention in the Seanad earlier this evening that, were licences £1,000 a piece in 1977, we would have more applicants than we have licences.  However, that is not the yardstick it is measured by.  This is a once-for-all payment so far as the licence is concerned, and we are taking cognisance of the views expressed <Col N="873" /> here and in the Upper House by the Opposition as to whether levies should be imposed.  What we are asking is an increase of £110,000 from an industry which has yielded £5.3 million this year.  All that money, together with additional funds from the Exchequer, will go towards further developing this industry.  The contribution in the current year was 8 per cent, and surely that was not a realistic contribution so far as the moneys provided for boards of conservators are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  I think it is unpardonable that you should have to make such a request to people who are elected as allegedly responsible people while I am speaking about something which is seriously affecting the business and everyday life of Dublin city, Waterford city and indeed, Limerick city for a few days this week.  One would have thought that the newly-appointed Minister for Transport and Power would have seen the urgency of moving in to solve this situation immediately the problem arose.  Instead, he and his colleague, the Minister for Labour, sat back in typical style and allowed the position to worsen.  I shall not split hairs with anybody: I do not think it is relevant whether one says the dispute spread to Limerick or not: the important thing is that we did have an added strike in Limerick this week although the CIE management saw fit to correct a statement of mine a few days ago.  The point is that there were strikes in three of our major cities, two of them still continuing, and only when the newspapers announced that Fianna Fáil were going to pursue the matter in Dáil Éireann did the Minister for Labour, as usual belatedly, step in to <Col N="877" /> try to solve the problem.  On this occasion he happened to be in the country; there was another Dublin bus strike when he was far from our shores while badly needed here.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the disappointing industrial relations history of CIE.  A certain amount of blame for this dispute must rest on both sides.  I, like all our party spokesmen and our party generally, will always approach these disputes in a very responsible and reasonable attitude unlike the attitude of the Minister for Labour when he was on this side of the House.  He never approached such disputes in a rational and sensible way but called for fire brigade action which is not the easiest or best solution to industrial disputes.</P>
      <P>Blame for this dispute rests on both sides.  Management must accept a share of the blame for the timing of the revised schedules.  One thing which is so badly needed and is so often lacking in the best of us is common sense.  The timing of revised schedules which could precipitate such a dispute in the heart of winter prior to the Christmas shopping rush was badly planned.  I shall not say the other side are blameless; they are not. There is much wrong on both sides in this dispute which I believe differs from some previous disputes in that company.</P>
      <P>This Minister has a role to play and when he has the Worker Participation Bill which is slowly dragging through the House accompanied by so many other Bills he will have a role to play in implementing worker participation. I refer to this because I believe&mdash;and the Minister in introducing the Bill said&mdash;that worker participation will have a very important part to play in industrial relations.  I entirely agree that it should and could have a very important part to play&mdash;but not in the type of worker participation being introduced by this Minister because it is not adequate or effective or involved at meaningful levels of management where communication is so badly needed.  Communications in CIE are certainly not as good as they should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> The Minister must also investigate whether the works council is working satisfactorily.  Is there an honest approach on both sides?  Is the conciliation machinery adequate and satisfactory?  Is it necessary to have it revised?  If we are serious about worker participation the works councils must be effective, must be able to achieve something within their companies.  This Minister has a heavy onus placed on his shoulders now.  I wish him well in his new Department. I believe he has a load on his shoulders which could have been eased if the Minister for Labour's proposals on worker participation had been more constructive, far-reaching and aimed specifically at management levels where such disputes can be discussed, reconciliation can be achieved and views expressed in a forthright and honest way.</P>
    <P>Buses are an essential service.  It is the responsibility of a Minister to ensure that essential services are maintained without disruption.  Who are the sufferers in this dispute?  First, the working people, especially of Dublin city.  We have seen a two-fold threat to their jobs.  The first is because of loss of trading in some centre city shops; the second comes from the possibility of a worker being consistently late or not able to make his or her place of employment in a reasonable time.  The second sufferers are the traders.  I believe there has been a 20 per cent drop in sales, despite inflation, on a day last week which was compared with a day the previous year.</P>
    <P>The general public and the housewife need these services at Christmas time especially.  These people have been waiting in queues for a long time and they do not know if the buses will ever arrive.  All this is happening in inclement weather.  School children, too, are suffering.  Do they deserve that?  This Government do not mind sitting back and allowing them to suffer.  Recently the key Minister, the Minister for Finance, thinking aloud, said he was considering discontinuing school transport in rural areas.  Some of the speakers from these benches <Col N="879" /> said that that was a new term for talking through his hat.</P>
    <P>As I said, I believe there was a lot of bad judgment in this case.  Intervention should have been made at an early stage to relieve the inconvenience and the cost to the economy in this period immediately preceding Christmas.  I tried to raise this issue by way of Private Notice Question yesterday but due to the rule of procedure of the House it was not possible. I am making these points now because I believe the Minister for Labour would not have intervened yet but for the pressure which eventually came from this side.</P>

      <P>I am anxious that the Deputy relate his remarks to the Supplementary Estimate for Transport and Power.  I am also anxious to dissuade him from straying into an area which is the responsibility of another Minister, the Minister for Labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing the grant in respect of rail passenger services and CIE generally on this Supplementary Estimate.  Surely it is relevant to discuss CIE even when it comes into the area of another Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing the Department of Transport and Power in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I am discussing.  CIE is a State body under the control of the Minister for Transport and Power.  I now want to refer to the concern felt by many CIE employees, especially in the road freight services, about possible redundancies. They fear that it is the aim of CIE, or possibly the Department, to see the road freight section run down.  I hope this is not so but the morale of the employees has to be restored and their fears allayed. Otherwise there will be a drop in the morale and job satisfaction that is so essential to any employee's contribution to the work he is engaged in every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> I am asking this new Minister to give assurances to our spokesman that he will ensure continuation and revitalisation of road freight services in depots throughout the country.  CIE are also involved with other countries. They have a 30 per cent share in Irish Ferryways.  I want the Minister to assure us that CIE's continued interest in this company is not in danger.  I understand this to be a profitable unit in the CIE network and I want to see it continued.  There is a fear among those employees that their jobs are in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>In the road freight depot in Cork, probably one of the biggest in the country, there is an excellent group of people, both at management and operational level.  Many of these men have given long and valued service to the company but they too fear for their future and I hope the Minister will reassure them.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate brings to our attention certain savings on the Estimate itself.  Some of them are surprising. In my opinion, no blame can be laid on the shoulders of the present Minister because he has not been long enough in that office to shoulder any responsibility for the Department not playing their role in the employment that is so badly needed at present.  I want to know from the Minister how it is that the £500,000 allocated to Cork Harbour has not been spent.</P>
    <P>The first indication the Leader of our party had of who was to be the new Minister for Education was when the former Minister for Transport and Power, in typical Coalition fashion, called a Press conference in Cork to announce the approval by the Government of the Cork Harbour plan, two days before the ministerial reshuffle. The harbour announcement had been eagerly awaited and was well received, but one questions the sincerity behind it.  How closely was the announcement connected with the event of the following Wednesday or Thursday when the Taoiseach moved the Cork Minister to the Department of Education?  One has to ask was he playing local politics, because four years ago, just before the Government took office, the Cork harbour plan had been laid before the <Col N="881" /> Department, and in the meantime pressure had been put on the Minister and the Government, and that Minister and the Deputies behind him voted against a Fianna Fáil motion calling for approval for that plan.</P>
    <P>Four years went by, and nothing will convince me that that announcement a couple of days before the Cabinet reshuffle was not pre-empted by the imminent move of the Cork Minister for Transport and Power from that Department.  But worse, in answer to questions in the House from Deputy Barrett and to requests from the Cork Harbour Board last spring, the Minister said £500,000 had been allocated in the 1976 Estimates for that work.  Now, in December, 1976, we understand this money has not been spent.  Why?  Would the jobs that would have been created by this expenditure not have been of benefit to Cork in these times of terrible unemployment?</P>
    <P>The development of Cork Harbour, and of harbours generally, will become an even more important part of the work of this Department in the future. We have heard of the need for the provision of specialised facilities at our major harbours.  That was the case made in relation to the Cork development. All the preparations, including the submission of plans to the Department, were completed in 1972 to tie up with the purchase of 600 acres of land by the IDA in the immediate vicinity of the harbour to coincide with the provision of the necessary infrastructure, such as a water scheme, to serve the industrial development of the harbour area.  That land is lying idle and the harbour plan has become a political football.</P>
    <P>Tied up with the harbour plan, naturally, was the very important matter of employment.  The jobs that would have been created during the construction work would have been of immense benefit in these days of hardship and the aim was that when the harbour had been developed in stages, as industry in the area progressed, more and more jobs would have been provided.  One could go on to point out the lack of commitment by the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Col N="882" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that the Deputy would confine his remarks to the Supplementary Estimate, which is very limited.  I am concerned that he is going into detail which should properly be reserved for the main Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Supplementary Estimate there are several subheads.  I do not wish to argue with you because you have always treated me fairly, but you will appreciate how we have been prevented from any worth-while debates on Estimates because of the appearance of several of them together.  Here I am referring to a saving of £610,000, of which £500,000 was allocated to the Cork Harbour scheme.  We need further harbour development and we need more employment and one is entitled, therefore, to ask why this money has been saved.</P>
      <P>On the second page of the details accompanying the Supplementary Estimate there is reference to a surplus in regard to Aer Rianta in their operations at Dublin, Shannon and Cork. There is what I take to be a saving of £380,000.  It amazes me that a Cork Minister who has just left this Department would in conscience allow that money to be saved at a time when Cork Harbour needs to be developed and when the world knows that Cork Airport, its runways and buildings, are not properly equipped to cater for the traffic such an airport should be able to handle.</P>
      <P>I referred a while ago to the necessity for job satisfaction and morale-boosting of employees within CIE and in Cork Airport at management and employee level.  There has been a suspicion that the Minister and his Department instead of showing anxiety to up-grade the airport prefer to leave it as a small country airport. Yet on Friday of last week a plane load of people from Brussels could not land at Dublin or Shannon because of fog and they were glad to have Cork then.  It did at least give those people an opportunity, despite the inconvenience, of being landed there although they had to be conveyed to Dublin by train in the early hours of the morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> Someone must ask about that kind of saving of money at a time when people are crying out for jobs and we have in the building industry alone an unemployment figure of something like 23,000.  This Government are in no way interested in or committed to the provision of job opportunities.  It is in Departments such as Transport and Power and in the State bodies operated under that Department that jobs of a productive nature can be generated.  When almost £100 million was paid out in the past year for dole and unemployment benefit, necessary though that be, would it not be far better to save the wages content in the expenditure of that £610,000?  It would have been an overall saving for the economy because the money for Transport and Power and for Social Welfare is coming for the most part from the already over-burdened taxpayers, the working people especially. PAYE contributes, VAT contributes, the Excise contributes.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister not see to it that those jobs, so necessary, were provided?  We are not talking about just spending money or building harbours or extending airports or runways just for the sake of doing it. These things are necessary and are an investment.  During the past year a worth-while number of jobs should have been provided that could well have made some impression on the almost 112,000 people on our unemployment register.  Add on the 40,000, 50,000 or perhaps 60,000 that nobody is too sure of, the school leavers, the young people who are not on that unemployment register.  We are talking then of a figure between 160,000 and 180,000 on whom we could have made a worth-while impact by reducing those figures to some reasonable extent.</P>
    <P>Instead the Minister sits back and allows the savings to be made.  We had today the disappointment of a measure specifically designed towards getting people back to work.  We are going to see it fall because the Dáil adjourns tomorrow and will not sit again before the date on which that Bill goes out of existence, 8th January.  I tried to raise that on the <Col N="884" /> Adjournment and because of the rules of procedure of this House I was not allowed to do so because I would be as an ordinary or private Member of the House creating legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to pursue it too far.  I will not make it awkward for you, Sir.  However, I believe it is related very closely to the points I am making and the lack of commitment by this Government to providing jobs.</P>
      <P>These were a few comments I wanted to make on the Estimate for Transport and Power.  I am glad to have the opportunity of expressing some of these ideas.  I look for certain assurances from the Minister through our spokesman.  Finally, I would also make a request to him.  I presume that he has some up-to-date information on the bus disputes.  The Minister for Labour and I am sure the Minister himself have been beseiged with requests from people all over the city that in the name of God they would do something quickly to get the services working.  I do not want to preempt the satisfactory outcome because I hope that it will be satisfactory, but our need is growing more critical and even if we have to ask the management of CIE to say &ldquo;We will defer it until a few days after Christmas&rdquo;, that will have to be done.  We have eight, nine or ten more shopping days to Christmas.  In the interests of the people working in the centre of the city, in the interest of the traders employing people in the centre of the city, in the interest of the public of Dublin especially who are experiencing such problems in going to their employment and going to do their Christmas shopping this must be done. Schools will be closing in a few days although many will be open until 22nd.  Those children are suffering during a period of inclement weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="885" /> I accept that this Minister is hard-working and I ask him in the interests of those people of Dublin to ensure that at least some time tomorrow he will get those buses rolling again and rolling properly, even if only on a temporary basis for a few days until after the Christmas period.  I appeal to him to do it and to assure us in his reply that he will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald has so rightly emphasised the situation existing in the public transport service in Dublin and Waterford and to a lesser extent in Limerick.  Perhaps it is fortunate and appropriate that we should be discussing the trouble in CIE between management and unions which, whatever the rights on either side, has certainly penalised the citizens of this city.  I walked down O'Connell Street last Saturday afternoon and I saw people standing in the cold waiting for buses which did not come.  When they did come they were overcrowded and could relieve little the crowd waiting there and in other places.  I often wonder why we inflict such suffering on ourselves.</P>
      <P>I am not competent to allocate blame nor is it my function to do so, in relation to the bus dispute.  I appeal to both sides in the dispute, knowing it has to be settled sooner or later, to give the people of this city and Waterford a break.  We are entering the season of goodwill and it is an appropriate time to make an appeal. The House has under discussion various pieces of legislation for worker participation, the protection of workers and better management generally. Here we find a service on which many people who do not belong to the affluent sector but who live in the new dormitory towns outside the city depend so much.  People's lives in those areas are disrupted if buses are not running.  There is a great loss to industry because people cannot get to the factories early in the morning or get to their offices or shops in time. There is also great loss to traders in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest loss is felt by the young family who have bought a house out in the suburbs.  Today Dublin Corporation opened a new <Col N="886" /> housing estate in Killinarden, between Tallaght and Blessington.  One can well imagine the state of mind of young husbands in that area who try to get to their jobs when no bus services are available.  Those people cannot afford cars so they have to lose one day's pay or even several days' pay.  When there is a CIE dispute each side feels that they have got the right on their side.  Is it too much to ask, while realising that there are rights and wrongs on each side, that they appreciate this, but that there are thousands of people in the city and suburbs who cannot carry on without a bus service?</P>
    <P>In the Book of Estimates under Transport and Power I see that CIE have a subsidy of over £28 million which is quite a hefty sum for this small State although I am sure it is put to good use.  We should look at that subsidy and decide if it is sufficient. Some day we will reach the stage when the bus service will be treated as a kind of social service and no bus fares will be charged.  Every year we increase the subsidy so I can see the time coming when we may have a free bus service.  It may sound a bit absurd at the moment.  Even though a free bus service would cost the taxpayer a lot of money it would be better than no bus service which is costing him a lot of money.</P>
    <P>We have to examine our transport policy.  Before I proceed further I want to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and to wish him well in his Department which is not an easy one by any means.  We must see what is wrong with CIE when we have so much industrial unrest there.  I do not believe that because a man takes a job as a CIE bus conductor or driver he changes, or that because a man takes a job as manager, departmental or otherwise, he changes.  It is essentially a matter of human relations between the two sides.  I do not believe that there is such a thing as industrial relations.  It is human relations in industry and human relations in our personal lives.  If we cannot think of the common good we will run into trouble and have chaos like we have at the moment in our bus service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> The people in the outer suburbs of the city must feel very frustrated when they find there is no bus service for them even though they are heavily taxed to provide such a service.  The Minister should look at the public bus service especially in the city.  Almost one-third of the population live in the greater Dublin area and in a few years' time the population of this city will probably be one million people. The CIE management have drafted a rapid transit plan.  I believe there is some merit in it.  The Minister should ask where they stand now.  Is the plan being held back by the Department of Transport and Power or have CIE not finished their study of it?  The Minister should sit down with the CIE management and unions and tell them that the rapid transit plan has certain merit.  I have studied it and I think it is attractive.  Our streets are so full of vehicular traffic nowadays that when our buses are running they find it hard to get through the maze of traffic and keep to a schedule.</P>
    <P>It is time that we looked at a partially underground and partially on the surface system.  People talk about the great cost of such a scheme.  Would it be so great when we realise the cost of the present inadequate and unsatisfactory bus service we have?  We have some kind of disruption too often in our public transport.  It is very easy to stand up here and criticise without offering a solution.  The only solution I offer is that each side should recognise the rights and obligations of the other and come together even a few days before Christmas, as Deputy Fitzgerald appealed, in this season of goodwill and decide to give back the bus service for Christmas.  The Minister should then call both sides together, sit down with them and work out a solution.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour told the House that he had intervened in the dispute.  This goes on all the time. Buses are disrupted.  We have total strikes or partial strikes but a bad bus service.  The Minister will intervene, hopefully, with success; it will go on for a while; the House will vote more money to CIE, and then we will have more disruption on the buses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> Dublin is becoming a very sophisticated cosmopolitan place and the good neighbourliness which can be seen in the country areas is dying out in some parts of the city.  Very often country people can get lifts from neighbours and so on, but this is dying out in the city.  A fresh look must be taken at the transport system as run by CIE. How can other cities of Europe have good transport systems without frequent disruption?  No doubt they have transport problems, but they do not have them on the scale we have. The unions have a tough task trying to satisfy each of their members.  They are doing everything possible to ensure that the men have proper standards, wages and so on.  CIE must put forward some account, a book-keeping record or a profit and loss account at the end of each year.  If we are going to continue subsidising CIE, it is time we took a hard look at the structures to find out the basic weaknesses and what causes the frequent disruptions.  Both sides appear to be communicating.  They should adopt a plan because neither side can win total victory in the interests of the people who are living in the city suburbs who need a proper bus service.</P>
    <P>Years ago I wrote on the possibility of using the suburban rail services and after a lot of agitation CIE agreed to open a suburban station in my area.  Other suburban rail services could be used in order to create a better transport service.  We can have a train service out past Cabra into the Docks area and across to the south side.  People might have to walk to the station but at the moment they are walking from the furthest suburbs into town.  These services could be used in relation to the transit plan for CIE which I mentioned.  I do not know that any member of the public takes these plans seriously because we have been waiting for them for so long.  I appeal to the Minister and to his colleagues to take some new initiative tomorrow morning so that we will end this trouble, so that transport services will be back to normal for the last few days before Christmas.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I put a question to the Minister for Transport and Power to <Col N="889" /> ask him if the survey which is being carried out on the ports of the country will be published.  The Minister said that it will not be published and I think that is a great mistake.  Policies in relation to the modernisation and the rationalisation of our ports will have to be implemented so that they can become as competitive as Cross-Channel ports.  Cross-Channel ports cannot be compared with Continental ports for efficiency and I would prefer if we studied the ports of Europe rather than the British ports.  When this report is finished, it should be published so that the port authorities can study and discuss them with a view to getting the best possible plans for the ports.  I refer mainly to the Port of Dublin because I represent the Dublin area.  A great extension of Dublin Port has taken place and modernisation is a great advantage. The new roll-on, roll-off service and the container traffic are of great advantage. A port which was modern ten years ago is not modern today without changes in the whole fabric so that cargoes are loaded and unloaded and dispatched to their destination as quickly as possible.  When the roll-on, roll-off service started the dockers, understandably, resisted.  The full picture was not put before the dockers and they resented this.  They thought modernisation would lead to further unemployment and it has.  The dockers of Dublin Port have now realised and are appreciative of the great problems and have co-operated very whole-heartedly in the big change in the port.  It is not right to ask them to make sacrifices or to accept change without being consulted. Unfortunately, we will see a continual shrinkage of labour in most ports unless we can attract sufficient movement through the ports to provide jobs for all the dockers.  The scene has changed in many ways and I am not sorry to see the change.</P>

      <P>There is a considerable amount provided for CIE in the Supplementary Estimate.  The part they have to play in the development of our ports is obvious.  I will give one instance of the huge Asahi plant in Mayo where the raw material will come to the Port of Dublin and be sent by rail to Mayo.  I hope this will bring added revenue to CIE but it is only an indication of what they can do.  Our aim should be to press ahead with the industrialisation of the country and ensure that industries are located throughout the regions so that there is not a concentration on the east coast.  If there are plants located throughout the country CIE will have a bright future.</P>
      <P>The concentration on the east coast of a large percentage of our industries operates against CIE.  We have little heavy industry but what there is is situated on the east coast and imports and exports go mainly through the Port of Dublin.  At the moment it handles 64 per cent of our total trade.  CIE have a large part to play in the expansion of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, we may have to continue subsidising CIE to an even greater extent but it is impossible to set out the limit to which we should subsidise them.  Apart from inflation there is much progress in technology.  Despite many efforts during the years to modernise CIE they are somewhat out-of-date in <Col N="891" /> many ways.  Probably they had not enough money to update their plant and the transport system and perhaps the Minister would consider arranging for some person to study CIE and their operations.  In the past many efficiency experts were called in to study the organisation and it may be that were it not for their reports CIE would be in an even worse state than they are at the moment.</P>
    <P>I remember when the subsidy for CIE was about one quarter of what it is now.  Even allowing for the fall in the value of money it must be obvious that we have been generous in our subsidies to them.  I do not think any rail service in the world is paying for itself; all of them are subsidised.  This applies even to countries such as the United States and Canada.  We are a small island and we have a problem in regard to this matter.  It may be small in comparison with that of the countries I mentioned but it is big when we consider our resources.</P>
    <P>Occasionally CIE take action that must be commended.  Last week they operated a train service from Derry to facilitate people to shop in Dublin. I do not know if the people got good value with regard to their fares or their shopping but I am sure it was good for them to have a break.  I hope all the people of Derry and of the North generally will avail of these services.</P>
    <P>CIE have taken commendable action with regard to the bus service and in their advertising.  I understand that some of their hotels are being sold but I do not know if that is a good policy.  I am sure CIE have made the Minister aware of the situation and I expect he will have to sanction any sale that takes place but I think before this happens he should look into the matter.  He should consider if it is a sound policy and he should also take into account the future of the workers in the hotels.</P>
    <P>All of us hope that the tourist industry will improve and will achieve even greater success in the very near future.  Our countryside, especially the west, will continue to attract more <Col N="892" /> people from overcrowded Europe. They enjoy driving on our roads which are not crowded, apart from this city.  It is a pleasure to drive in the summer through the more remote parts and I am sure that tourists from abroad value this very much.</P>
    <P>We may have to put more money into tourism, bus services and the various activities of CIE so that we will have a proper transport system.  I should like to see the Minister going ahead with the rapid transit service which CIE have prepared.  It may solve our problems in this city.  It would be a faster system if we did not have to depend all the time on the buses in the city when they are running normally.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a difficult task to tackle but the challenge is a worth-while one.  Any Minister for Transport and Power who improves the system will earn the thanks of the people.  A national transport system is essential.  The system will cost money and that money will have to be provided out of taxation.  At the moment CIE have to be subsidised and it is very frustrating for tax-paying citizens to know they are paying for an unsatisfactory system.</P>
    <P>The bus service is the most important service provided by CIE because the buses carry the majority of passengers using CIE.  The ratio of cars to people is low compared with other EEC countries.  We must, therefore, build a system which will cater for the needs of the people.  It has been argued that we should revert to private enterprise transport.  Running an 18-hour a day bus service every day of the year is a costly operation. The vehicles must be maintained and the employees must be paid proper wages and salaries.  I cannot visualise private enterprise making transport pay.  Indeed, if it could pay, I believe the clamour for such a transport system would be much louder.  Again, private enterprise would want to concentrate on those areas which provide the best financial return and CIE would be penalised by having to provide transport in the less lucrative areas. <Col N="893" /> CIE will be with us for many years yet.  Our task is to get down to improving the system.  Every year CIE have to get an allocation of public money and sometimes there is a second allocation in the same year.  I sympathise with those running CIE. Their job is an onerous one.  I sympathise with the workers in CIE, particularly the bus drivers.  Driving buses is no easy job.  Acting as conductor is no easy job in cities and towns.  There are all sorts of hazards, not the least being constant road repairs involving the build-up of traffic or inconvenient detours.  Public demonstrations can be a nuisance too.</P>
    <P>I believe the solution to present difficulties lies in an underground traffic system.  The Government are strangely silent about a rapid underground transit system.  To me it looks very attractive.  CIE have produced coloured brochures showing how such a system would operate.  The Government should take a look at this.  There must be an early decision on it.</P>
    <P>At the moment we have a stop/go bus service.  I live near a depot and every morning I listen to find out whether or not there will be a bus.  If I hear one I say: &ldquo;Thank God, the bus is running today&rdquo;.  We must get down to the cause of the disruption in CIE.  Disruption does not happen for no reason at all.  Every aspect of CIE must be thoroughly surveyed and examined. It is a false economy to say the total subvention will be £30 million.  There is bound to be another subvention later on.  No one will object to paying taxation for a proper transport system but subsidising an inefficient system is something people will not tolerate.</P>
    <P>The Minister is new to his office and needs time to look around.  Because of the weakness of our public transport system he is faced with a tremendous challenge.  Perhaps some day we will have a Government and a Minister who will give us a proper transport system.  It is absolutely essential to social and economic survival.  One can imagine the reaction there would be to any suggestion to drop certain Government services because they were too costly. <Col N="894" /> People want health services and social welfare services, and I submit that in a community like the Greater Dublin area an absolute essential is a proper transport system.</P>
    <P>From time to time, in order to help out CIE, the suggestion is made that cars should be kept out of the city. Of course, the motorist, who is paying his taxes has rights, and if that suggestion were adopted the whole structure of the city would change. The commercial element would move out into the suburbs and big shopping centres would develop there.  Much of our city is dying and I believe that is caused by the bad transport system. Some people want to live in the city areas but because they cannot get housing there they move out.  When a new dormitory town like Blanchardstown is created it is said that customers are created for CIE, but this also adds to the CIE burden because the extension of bus services costs them more money</P>
    <P>During the valley period of the day CIE services do not pay but then, say, at mid-day when there is a big demand for buses, because, perhaps, of excavations of the street or a public demonstration, the services are disrupted. All these problems must be considered if we are to provide a proper service.  Many people would not use their cars if they were sure of an adequate bus service.  That is why I suggested to the Minister earlier on &mdash;and if he does not some future Minister will be forced to look at the matter&mdash;avoiding free bus services in order to attract people to use buses more and more.  However, even if there was a free service, we would have to ensure that the buses run on time and are adequate in number.  When one drives out in the morning one notices the number of cars with just a driver in each.  It is said that one bus can take the contents of 70 cars.  That may be a simplistic way of looking at it but it is substantially true.  Therefore, we must take into our confidence the motorist and CIE, including the management and the workers and, for the common good of the city and the country, work out a proper transport system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="895" /> In addition to the frustration involved the men who are in partial dispute with CIE at the moment are losing heavily in wages.  I do not think these men want to have this system going the way it is.  It should be possible to give them a proper return for their labour and provide a proper standard of maintenance for vehicles. CIE can never be a profit-making concern any more than the Department of Defence or the Department of Health can be profit-making.  One thinks in terms of cash being profit, but the whole city would profit by a proper service.</P>
    <P>I do not think private enterprise can supply the answer to this problem. People may well say that public enterprise is not the full answer either.  One of the obstacles, I suppose, is that CIE have never had adequate moneys to carry out any worthwhile reorganisation. Therefore, each time the problem arises they cut back services, especially train services.  It may be very easy to economise by closing a branch railway line, but we are probably paying for it in other ways, for instance, by the number of vehicles that must use the roads and the cost of maintaining our roads to take the very heavy traffic on them.</P>
    <P>The whole system of transport has changed so much that very often in the suburbs there is a new complaint, that of people parking juggernauts outside their front doors.  The driver may be leaving in the morning for Italy or somewhere else on the new ferry service.  Dublin, in parts is an 18th century city trying to take 20th century traffic.  Therefore, in dealing with CIE and their problems one should also deal with the local authority to see what part they can play in bringing about a proper transport system.  Most other cities have the same problem in regard to their preservation.  When there are traffic jams and buses cannot get through, the question arises whether the street should be widened and worthwhile buildings knocked down.  Again, the preservationists will say you cannot do that.  There is general frustration and all the time the bus service is losing money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> I hope the Minister will be able to solve the present difficulties of CIE so that the bus service will be back to normal, and that he will then have a global look at this problem of transport.  I am speaking particularly for the city of Dublin.  As regards the CIE board, apart from having the people at the top at the moment and representatives of the unions, I suggest that a regional board be established by CIE to look after the greater Dublin area.  That board could be composed of the management, representatives of the unions and the local authority.  Discussions between those people would mean that it would be possible to find out the problems in the city bus service.  It may be a fact that the staff of that company feel frustrated because of the traffic conditions they must contend with daily.  If that is the case one can see the reason behind the claims of the men at present that their vehicles should be kept up to a proper standard.  It would be wrong if our public transport vehicles were allowed out in service without being properly maintained.</P>
    <P>If it is a fact that CIE, with the grant we give them and their receipts, cannot afford to run a modern transport service we should do something about it.  Even though some may feel that CIE are being given too much money we must examine the position and see if the company are being given an adequate amount to provide a proper service.  If the management of CIE can prove to us that the grant given to them is not adequate it is our duty to take a new look at the position.  If one lives in the city or visits it occasionally one is aware of the frustration felt when the bus service is disrupted.  There must be something wrong somewhere when trouble breaks out so often in CIE.  It is pitiful to see people standing at bus stops for long periods waiting for buses.</P>
    <P>The Minister should contact his colleague, the Minister for Labour, and join with him in bringing together the management of CIE and the unions for discussions on the dispute. There is an urgent need for a settlement of this dispute; it must be settled tomorrow.  Trade in the city is <Col N="897" /> being disrupted by the dispute and there is a possibility that many stores will have to lay off workers because of the drop in business.  Some people are blaming the unions and maintain that they are too strong but I do not think so.  There is an onus on all of us to work for a proper system in CIE. There are no short cuts and those who suggest that the concern should be handed over to private enterprise should bear in mind that private enterprise would only take the paying part of the company.  CIE would then be left with the unprofitable sections. While I agree with private enterprise I also agree with the principle of subsidisation. If it was suggested that private enterprise should take over our water supply systems people would be horrified at the thought of having to pay for water, although I accept that we must contribute to the cost of our water supplies through our rates.  Our public transport system is a vital part of our society and it is wrong that our people should be deprived of it particularly when people are being housed in areas as far away from the city centre as the foothills of the Dublin mountains.</P>

    <P>Expenditure on the social assistance schemes is normally borne in full by the Exchequer.  The break-down of any additional expenditure on social insurance schemes between employer, employee and Exchequer would be directly proportional to the share of the cost which each would be required to bear.</P>
    <P>A 20 per cent increase has not been calculated in respect of treatment benefit, pay-related benefit and miscellaneous grants as they are not in the same category as the other payments and percentage increases would not be the appropriate method of improving them.  As marriage grants were terminated in October, 1973, a percentage increase could not be applied to that scheme.</P>

      <P>Public Service remuneration in this context means the remuneration of civil servants, national and secondary teachers, the Defence Forces and Garda together with the Exchequer contribution to the pay of nurses, doctors and other health board employees and vocational teachers.
