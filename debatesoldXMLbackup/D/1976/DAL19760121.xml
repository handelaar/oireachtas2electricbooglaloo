    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will consider placing the care of young people, in so far as the State is concerned, under one Minister as there are at present three departments involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Health announced in October, 1974, that the Government had decided that, in future, he should have the main responsibility, including that of co-ordination, in relation to child care.</P>
      <P>A Task Force on Child Care Services was set up by the Minister and their interim report, furnished in November, 1975, is being studied by the Department of Health and the other Departments concerned.</P>

      <P>This matter is not under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that the time has now come when the State ought to be in a position to honour people of distinction whether that distinction has been acquired within the State or outside it rather than depend on the National University and the University of Dublin to give such degrees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the time has come but I suppose there are more urgent matters to be attended to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of that.  Is the Taoiseach not aware that certain suggestions have been made along these lines, not so much at present but over a number of years past, and that all that appeared to prevent it was an absence of negotiation between political parties as far as <Col N="3" /> agreement amongst them was concerned, agreement that might be obtained in certain circumstances?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Leader of the Opposition has stated, this matter was the subject of some discussion and consideration some years ago but no agreement was reached on any proposals that were discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Government were given any advance notice of the sending of members of the Special Air Services Unit of the British Army to Northern Ireland; and whether any communication was sent to the British Government in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to both parts of the question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  It would not be in accordance with practice to reveal details of contacts between the two Governments on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask whether it was impressed on the British authorities that such a unit of the British Army having been introduced they should be impartial in tracking down murder gangs and other people responsible for violent acts on both sides rather than concentrating on one only?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware that aspect of the matter was referred to initially in the statement that was made.  When I spoke on the matter I made the same views known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask whether it was pointed out to the British Government that special care should be taken to ensure that there would be no unauthorised crossings of the Border from the North of Ireland, such crossings which give rise to exacerbated feelings in this matter and which would be counter-productive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government are aware of the concern felt here on any unauthorised crossings of the Border.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that these hospitals should be described as &ldquo;mini-hospitals&rdquo;.  They will be general hospitals as in other areas. At present, as regards Portlaoise and Mullingar hospitals, each has departments of medicine, surgery and obstetrics with one clinical consultant in each department.  The planned developments will expand these into two-consultant departments in each case and, in addition, departments of paediatrics and gynaecology will be established in each hospital.  The question of providing other specialties, such as acute psychiatry, geriatric assessment, ophthalmology and ENT will be considered.  Support services such as radiology, pathology and anaesthetics will continue to be provided and will be expanded as required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my announcement in relation to the national hospital plan, community hospitals will have a very significant role in the total pattern of the health services but their exact functions will be worked out by my Department in consultation with the health boards.  A discussion document on the role of the smaller hospitals, produced by Comhairle na nOspidéal, has been circulated to Deputies.  This document suggests the type and range of services which might be provided in community hospitals and will form the basis for the consultation between the health boards and my Department about the detailed way in which each designated community hospital will work.</P>
      <P>Community hospitals should have a range of consultant out-patient services, the type and frequency of which would be related to local needs. Examples would be medical, surgical, obstetrical, gynaecological and psychiatric clinics but others would be considered also.  This means that a high standard of out-patient care would be available.  Immunisation and vaccination clinics and child welfare clinics could also be held at the hospital if circumstances so indicated.</P>
      <P>In addition it could be expected that radiology and pathology services would be available for both in-patients and out-patients.</P>
      <P>In so far as in-patient services are concerned, there would be a medical officer in charge of the hospital, probably local general practitioners given right of access to continue treatment of their patients and consultants, including those attending out-patient services, would be available on a consultative basis to see in-patients in the community hospital, including patients of their own discharged from the general hospital.  Resuscitation facilities would be available for local accident cases before treatment in the general hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the hospital should provide an active service related to <Col N="13" /> patients who need medical care below consultant level or nursing care, including patients needing examination and tests prior to admission to the general hospital, or who require continued hospital care after discharge from the general hospital.</P>

The Deputy wants a simple decision as to whether there will be 22 extra beds in Rathdrum. According to one of the suggestions that is contingent on 11 beds being taken from Wicklow District Hospital. I do not think I would be in favour of that at the present time because there is ample accommodation there for another use that the health board have in mind for Wicklow District Hospital.  The 11 beds can be retained in Wicklow and the other improvements suggested can be carried out in Wicklow also with regard to ambulance control and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will sanction the spending of £1 million on St. Brendan's Hospital, Dublin as the money is needed for urgent repairs to achieve a reasonable standard of comfort for the patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not received any proposals for works costing £1 million at St. Brendan's Hospital, Upper Grangegorman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> St. Brendan's is a huge complex of buildings some over 150 years old.  In 1965 the patient population of the hospital exceeded 1,600 and this apart from the age and structure of the buildings created major problems for the development of therapeutic procedures there.  The solution to this problem lay and still lies in large measure in the reduction of the patient population and in the development of further psychiatric services in the community.  This development has been proceeding.  Some years ago the Dublin city and county region was divided into seven catchment areas, each with its own psychiatric team developing acute treatment services, hostels, day hospitals and other community services. Through this rearrangement the patient population at St. Brendan's was reduced to less than 1,100 and a further reduction can be anticipated as the area services continue to develop and expand.</P>
    <P>Apart from the major drop in patient numbers at the hospital with consequent improvements for the patients, many innovations and structural changes have been carried out over recent years.  These include a new admission unit, lowering of boundary walls, a new geriatric unit, a special unit for alcoholics and various reconstruction work and improvements to catering, sanitary and other facilities at the hospital.  Because of the reducing population and the out-dated nature of much of the complex of buildings there must, however, be serious doubts about the wisdom of further substantial expenditure on works at St. Brendan's Hospital.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly there is a need to spend some further resources on improving the living conditions of the long-term patients.  But, in my view, emphasis in future spending should lie in the creation outside of St. Brendan's of more facilities such as hostels, group homes, day hospitals and domiciliary services which will serve to ensure a more desirable living environment for the patients.  As resources become available this is the approach I intend taking in regard to our mental hospitals in general.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister state if any study has been made by his Department into what has happened to the 500 people discharged from St. Brendan's Hospital?  We have the &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; syndrome where patients are finding their way back or into prison or hostels in Dublin where they are not provided for.  Many of these patients have been institutionalised by the previous system that was in operation and, as a result, they are not able to fend for themselves in outside society.  It is not good enough that relatives are under pressure to have these patients discharged without proper care being provided for them and, unfortunately, this is happening at the present time.  I would ask the Minister to see that this is not done. We have the situation that money is not being spent on this hospital and the patients are shoved in anywhere away from the hospital for the sole purpose of running down the hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that of any scheme this one should be the last to be hit by the <Col N="22" /> economic climate, no matter how bad it may be?  The programme of construction of welfare homes for the aged should not be affected.  In any Christian society surely the aged should be looked after first and any cutbacks should not affect a charitable and worth-while programme such as this.  It was prepared by the Eastern Health Board; they were working on it and some buildings have already been constructed.  Will the Minister not reconsider this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The record with regard to building welfare homes is not 100 per cent but it is a reasonably good one.  In the health board area in which the Deputy is interested four such welfare homes were opened in recent years.  In July, 1974, a home was opened in Bray at a cost of £145,000; a home in Ballymun was opened in 1975 at a cost of £200,000; another was opened at Clonskeagh at a cost of £190,000.  Donnybrook, which was built by the Sisters of Charity, was given a grant of £50,000. The programme for the establishment of welfare homes approved by the then Minister was 48.  Of these 22 have been completed and three are in the course of construction so it does not necessarily mean to say that there is no work being done on welfare homes this year.  Six are at tender stage and seven are in the course of planning.  Whilst I am not entirely satisfied, we have made progress.  We have shown our concern for the aged and as soon as more money becomes available I intend to push ahead with this scheme for the building of 48 homes, possibly more, as soon as I can.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the action he intends to take to ensure continued service to the people within the Eastern Health Board region in view of the financial predicament that the board find themselves in; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that the Eastern Health Board are in a serious overdraft situation; and if he will take steps to ensure that they get sufficient finances to avoid large overdrafts which add to the financial burden of ratepayers and taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputies have in mind the question of borrowing which was discussed at a meeting of the Eastern Health Board on 7th January, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Temporary borrowing by way of overdraft is a normal feature of financing revenue and capital expenditure, pending full recoupment by way of Exchequer grants or loans in respect of approved expenditure.  Because of the substantial rise in the total expenditures of health boards during 1975, and because I was unable to fund increases in costs until the House passed the Supplementary Estimate of £36.725 million last November, the overdraft limits of health boards had to be increased temporarily. While the overdraft level for the <Col N="24" /> Eastern Health Board had reached a figure of over £9 million in November, this figure was reduced through the making of substantial payments to the board, so that at the end of 1975, the overdraft level had been reduced to about £5½ million.</P>
    <P>The question of the current level and the type of borrowing which the board consider it necessary to raise from their bankers is at present being discussed between my Department and officers of the board.  I expect that this issue will be resolved in the near future but I would stress to the House that the issues which arise in no way affect the solvency of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's thinking with regard to transferring this overdraft into a term loan which will result in an increase of 1½ per cent on the standard rate of interest to be paid, which is a savage burden to impose on the Eastern Health Board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that the borrowing will cost 1½ per cent more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On a term loan, yes.  I understand that&mdash;I ask the Minister to clarify the matter for me &mdash;at the moment they are on an overdraft which the bankers want to transfer from the direct bank into their finance corporations, which will be a term loan and which will be at 1½ per cent higher interest rate.  Are they the facts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department and the Eastern Health Board will discuss the possibility of funding by way of loan rather than by overdraft, which can be called in at any time, in other words, a term loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will this mean that a higher interest rate will have to be paid by the Eastern Health Board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be negotiated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us the interest rate being charged on overdrafts?  The suggestion is that the interest rate will increase substantially with this term loan.  This is <Col N="25" /> the worry.  The overdraft is at a normal interest rate but the term loan is far in excess of that.  This is what is creating the biggest burden for the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said before, this will be the subject of discussion in order to try to facilitate the Eastern Health Board and not to make their obligation so binding as it would be with an overdraft rather than a term loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the overdraft necessitated because they do not receive their grants in time from the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice has been that there would be 95 per cent recoupment but there were unusual circumstances last year in increases in prices and increases in wages.  The delay was&mdash;I can take a certain amount of blame for this&mdash;that the Supplementary Estimate enabling me to make a substantial grant to the Eastern Health Board was not passed until November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely in view of the fact that the health board have so much business with the banks the onus is on the banks to provide this overdraft.  The problem is with the banks not with the Department.  The banks are not giving out the money. They want to switch to term loans at higher interest rates.  There is a lot of money involved with the business they do with all the health boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his Department will provide funds for the purchase of an <Col N="28" /> EMI Whole Body Scanner; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>An application was received some time ago from one of the Dublin hospitals for approval of the purchase of an EMI Whole Body Scanner.  This application is being considered in my Department in the light of the many demands being made on the limited funds available at present for hospital improvement schemes.  No decision has yet been reached but in view of its cost, around £250,000 it is unlikely that it will be possible to provide a grant for this equipment in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this scanner is known as the cat scanner.  Is it true that the Department would make great savings in expenditure if such a machine were used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware that there would be a great saving. There is no evidence as yet to prove that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>While realising that there are many demands on the Department, I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that the use of this machine could reduce considerably the number of hospital admissions and the Department could save enormously.  It was found out in Britain that by using one of these machines a fantastic amount of money was saved.  People can have investigations carried out in minutes which would normally require a stay in hospital of one to two weeks with many expensive tests.  Would the Minister bear this in mind before he rejects the application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not entirely reject it, but reject it for the moment. One of the hospitals has established a committee to inquire into the cost, possible ways of raising money and, I presume, the use of the machine with a view to saving money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the provision of at least one of these machines is absolutely essential to this country?  Could he confirm my information that the British health service intend to provide 30 machines this year and that they represent both from the economy and strictly medical points of view an enormous advance?  In those circumstances, would he not regard the amount of £250,000 as of relatively minor importance?  Furthermore, would he look at this question in the context of the country as a whole, be careful to avoid a situation where every hospital will feel that it must have one of these machines and ensure that, whatever approach we adopt with regard to the provision of one of these scanners, it will be in the best interests of the entire hospital service?  If he intends providing one or two machines he should make sure that they are strategically situated and are not used by any hospital as a status symbol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree substantially with what the Deputy said.  These EMI scanners are fairly new.  My information is that they are not in great use in Great Britain. Although I believe they would save money, they would also greatly facilitate the medical profession.  To be honest, purchase of a machine would have to be deferred until other demands, which are regarded as priorities, are met.</P>
      <P>In the last ten or 11 questions I have had suggestions from Deputies opposite which, if implemented, would cost millions and millions of pounds. I can think of certain priorities only. I want to ensure that the services will be carried on in a good and efficient way, but suggestions to expend millions of pounds just cannot be entertained this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical advantages which would accrue are, I understand, enormous, because this is something new, different and unprecedented. <Col N="30" /> Would the Minister not have a cost-benefit analysis carried out of this particular expenditure because my information is to the effect that the employment of one or two of these machines, strategically based, would result in enormous savings?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you call on the Taoiseach to announce the Order of Business, I should like to seek your guidance in respect of a parliamentary question of a particular nature.  Last week I submitted a question: &ldquo;To ask the Taoiseach whether the Government had yet received a reply on the findings of the European Commission on Human Rights in the case of Ireland against the United Kingdom.&rdquo;  You informed me, Sir, by letter this morning that the question was out of order because it related to a matter which was <i>sub judice.</i>  The question, as it appears on its face, makes no reference to the merits of the case and therefore can have no bearing whatever on the decision, judgment or recommendation to be made in the case.  It was simply a question seeking knowledge as to whether or not the report of that Committee had been received by the Government.  The answer is relevant in another context, in the context of the Bill that is coming before the Dáil on its Committee <Col N="45" /> Stage immediately after Question Time today.  I am asking why in these circumstances, in so far as the answer could not possibly affect the subject matter of the case in question, you ruled it out of order?</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I would like to take the opportunity of paying tribute to the memory of John A. Costello, former Taoiseach, who died during the recess.</P>
      <P>John A. Costello was a Member of this House over a period of nearly 40 years and was twice Head of the Government.  During those years he was a fine example of the best traditions of this Parliament and in his conduct of public affairs gained the widest respect.  He was a model of fairness and charity in his dealings with people.</P>
      <P>Before his entry to this House he had, of course, served the State with distinction, as assistant to the Attorney General and, later, as Attorney General.  He achieved high distinction too in the practice of the law and in recent years was an honoured figure as father of the Irish Bar, of which he had been a member for over 60 years.  Last year he received the freedom of the city of Dublin in appreciation of his contribution to Irish life.</P>
      <P>In his public life and as a devoted family man, John A. Costello was an exemplary figure in every respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to his son, Deputy Declan Costello, Attorney General, and to the other members of his <Col N="47" /> family the sincere sympathy of the Members of this House.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central</i>): I beg to move the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order No. 30 for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, that is, the inadequacy of the steps taken by the Minister for Finance to prevent Irish Life, a State body under his control, from purchasing their requirement of office furniture from a foreign manufacturer.</P>

It cannot be suggested that the Minister has no direct responsibility to the House when, as Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, the Minister is a 90 per cent shareholder in this company, shares which he holds on behalf of the people and in respect of which he is responsible to the people.  The only way he can exercise that responsibility and answer for it is through this House.</P>

    <P>As far as the urgency is concerned, as Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, this is the first occasion on which we had an opportunity to raise it in this House.  This is also a matter which <Col N="49" /> we are told the Government are investigating at present and, within hours or days, for all we know, the Government may come to a decision on it and we might have no opportunity of raising it here.

In coming to that decision, a Ceann Comhairle, did you take into account the fact that both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated in public &mdash; or rather the Government Information Services indicated in regard to them &mdash; that they have investigated and reported to the Government about this matter.

I understand there was some contact between the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and our spokesman on Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Kennedy, but because Deputy O'Kennedy was attending the funeral of the mother of a colleague of his he was not present this morning to make contact with us.  After the long recess we are asked to give a Second Reading to these Bills today and I should like an explanation for that.</P>
      <P>I should also like to know why the amendment to the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill, 1975 has not appeared.  I should also like to know why the Juries Bill has not appeared. These are matters of urgent public importance, matters which we believe should have been attended to sooner particularly since the Minister for Lands announced, on behalf of the Minister for Labour, that the amendment to the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill would be introduced on the first day of this session, That Minister also informed us that the Bill would probably be circulated during the recess.

Without this legislation jury trials cannot take place on criminal matters and people are being remanded on bail or in custody without having their natural and fundamental right to a trial by jury.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reply to the points made by the Leader of the Opposition with regard to Nos. 1 and 2 on the Order Paper.  These two Bills are necessary in order to remedy legal deficiencies which stand in the way of our ratification of the Lomé Convention.  There are two respects in which our existing legislation is an impediment, through things that are not in it, to ratification and ratification is a matter of urgency because most other countries have ratified the convention.  It is important that ratification should take place by the end of the month because that will affect the date of the entering into effect of the convention.  That is the reason for the urgency of the two Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for that explanation but I should like to point out that it is not unusual for the Department of Foreign Affairs to seek instant legislation from this House on many matters.  As long as the Minister occupied the important and difficult position of President of the Council of Ministers of the EEC he had good reason for such a request but that period has long passed.  I would have thought that the Department would have been in a position to prepare the necessary legislation in proper time.  The Minister signed the Lomé Convention, in his capacity as President of the Council of Ministers of the EEC, more than six months ago but what has happened since?</P>

      <P>These legal defects have emerged and the important thing is to remedy them so as not to hold up ratification.  Ratification is taking place fairly rapidly and I understand that the only country outstanding, at present intends to take the legislative action necessary to enable it to ratify the convention by the end of the month.  That is the reason for the urgency.</P>

In so far as the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill is concerned the amending legislation is being drafted.  In this connection, as the Deputy is probably aware, there are complications in respect of the terms of the Rome Treaty and that aspect is taking longer than anticipated.</P>

      <P>I feel strongly about this amendment because too often we have had Acts passed in this House ostensibly to cover emergencies, just to cover emergency situations existing at those times, but unfortunately once they became Acts and part of the statute book they forever remained with us.  This is a very dangerous situation.  Whether we like it or not, this is repressive legislation intended to cover an emergency.  In normal circumstances we would not even consider discussing a Bill like this.  Each of us on all sides of the House would be opposed to this type of legislation in normal times.  I accept these are not normal times.  The Minister has said in his opening speech that they are not normal times.  He has brought in the Bill to cover this abnormal situation.  If what the Minister has said is true, if what the Government say is true, then there is nothing wrong with this amendment.</P>
      <P>All the amendment means is that after one year this Act will expire.  If a situation should still exist in our society that would warrant the Act being extended, there is no reason why it could not be reactivated or extended by means of a resolution passed by both Houses.  There is ample precedent for it in many Acts passed in the twenties when Cumann na nGaelheal were in power: they brought in repressive legislation to cover the troubled times we had then but in every one of those measures there was provision for them to expire at the end of a year or two years as the case was.  Then they automatically expired.  Only in two cases were those Acts extended.  One was extended for five years but it was repealed after two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would therefore ask the Minister to show his sincerity and the Government to show their sincerity. <Col N="59" /> They have said this Bill is to meet a situation existing now.  I hope we will have a stable society and there will not be any need for this legislation in future years.  I hope we will see an end to terrorism, the bomber and the paramilitaries and that we will have a settled society where people can live in peace.  In the meantime, I think it is bad in this democratic State that we should have an Act like this on the statute book.  This is the one opportunity we have of saying: &ldquo;Allow this Act to expire at the end of one year.  If the situation warrants it we can ask for its reactivation&rdquo;.  If we do not accept this amendment we may never get the opportunity to repeal the Act and I therefore ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to the amendment.</P>

      <P>First of all, I want to thank Deputy O'Malley and other members of my party for giving Deputy O'Connell the opportunity to move his amendment.  Had Deputy O'Malley not acted as he did then Deputy O'Connell would not have been able to move his amendment.  It was interesting to note, from this side of the House, that no member of his party, or indeed of the Minister's party, was willing to facilitate or help him in any way.</P>
      <P>I wish to move amendment No. 4 in my name.  This amendment deals specifically with sections 2, 3, 11, 12, 18, 19 and 20 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just a technicality.  As I understand it, then, we are discussing it and the moving of it comes at a later stage.  The sections which I mentioned relate to the apprehension and trial of prisoners in each jurisdiction and provide for the taking of evidence in one jurisdiction and the trial in another.  They provide also for the handing over to the security authorities in Northern Ireland of offenders apprehended by the Garda <Col N="60" /> Síochána in the Republic.  To that extent those sections referred to in this amendment introduce a completely new departure from the ordinary criminal law of this country. As amendments Nos. 2 and 3 in my name suggest, it is our strong feeling these sections are contrary to Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>In view of the important and grave departure from the ordinary criminal law involved in those sections, my amendment suggests that they should remain in operation for 12 months only from the coming into operation of this Bill.  That would enable the operation of those sections to be examined in 12 months' time by way of a motion before this House.  A comprehensive review of the operation of the new sections could be made then by the Minister for Justice and, of course, full debate could take place. There should be some indication within 12 months as to the constitutionality of those sections and the degree to which they depart from Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Indeed, the practical administration of those sections could also come up for review in 12 months' time.  Therefore, this represents a very reasonable approach to what is a new departure from the ordinary criminal law of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw a distinction between our amendment and the amendment being discussed with it in the name of Deputy O'Connell.  He proposes to deal with the matter of review of the Bill as a whole after 12 months.  In my amendment I seek only to deal with the sections which relate to the apprehension and trial of what are called fugitive offenders.  It is important that we do not go the whole way, as suggested by Deputy O'Connell because, in effect, his amendment would bring the whole Bill under review in 12 months' time and thereby include some very desirable sections in the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill relating to areas of the ordinary criminal law.  In particular I refer to sections 21 and 22 dealing with the amendment of the Larceny Act of 1916, the Criminal <Col N="61" /> Justice Act of 1951 and the Firearms Act of 1925.  These are desirable amendments to our ordinary criminal law and should be part of separate legislation.  At any rate they are incorporated in this Bill.  We have no objection to improvements of the ordinary criminal law of the land and that they be given the full force of the law.</P>
    <P>What I want to emphasise in my amendment is that we feel there is a distinction to be drawn between the ordinary criminal law of the land and the special, new provisions being introduced to deal with the trial and apprehension of fugitive offenders. This is a new departure.  We want to concentrate the review by the Oireachtas in 12 months' time on how those provisions operate.  We have no objection whatever to desirable improvements in the ordinary criminal law being implemented fully.  To that extent I would suggest our amendment represents a more rational approach, with due respect to Deputy O'Connell who seeks to include all matters in the Bill &mdash; some matters which are desirable &mdash; and lump them together with the special provisions to which we take great objection being incorporated in the permanent law of the State without examination by the Oireachtas in 12 months' time.</P>
    <P>In regard to the details of the sections concerned, the important sections are 11 and 12 relating to the provisions for the taking of evidence in Northern Ireland, under section 11, and in the State under section 12.  The effect of section 11 and the other sections involved is that a man who is free in the State or who has been granted freedom by way of bail order by the courts &mdash; in either event, he is a free man in the Republic &mdash; may be handed to the authorities in Northern Ireland for the taking of evidence. The dangerous aspect of this is that he may be handed, as a free man in the Republic, into the custody of the police in Northern Ireland; he has no right to be present at the court taking evidence against him in Northern Ireland, except the right to be present in the custody of the police of Northern Ireland.  Subsection (2) (a) of section 11 specifically provides <Col N="62" /> that.  I suggest that this is a very limited right that considerably circumscribes the defendant's right to proper trial, in particular, his right under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights to have minimum rights when charged with a criminal offence, to conduct his defence in person, to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; to examine and have examined witnesses against him in regard to the charge laid against him.  I feel I should read paragraph (3) of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights to emphasise my point:</P>
    <P>(3) Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:</P>
    <P> (a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him;</P>
    <P>(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;</P>
    <P>(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;</P>
    <P>(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him;</P>
    <P>(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.</P>
    <P>That Article envisages that the accused man will have a free and open right to defend himself, in person, and make all the necessary preparations and arrangements for a fair and proper trial.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) allows the accused the right only to attend to hear evidence against him when he is in the custody of the police of Northern Ireland.  This may run counter to an order by our <Col N="63" /> courts granting him bail.  The whole purpose of bail is to enable an accused to conduct his defence in a proper manner.  This is an entirely new departure in regard to the trial of an accused person and would seem to be in contravention of Article 6 of the Convention on Human Rights.  A number of other sections to which I have referred hinge largely on the basic objection I have to subsection (2) of section 11.</P>
    <P>We would also like to see section 12 reviewed after 12 months.  That section deals with the taking of evidence here for a criminal trial in Northern Ireland.  I do not intend to go into the section in detail because I believe it will be largely unworkable.  It is very difficult to envisage a situation in which evidence would be taken here in respect of a criminal trial in Northern Ireland because of the enormous difficulties involved in bringing security forces from Northern Ireland into the Republic.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of operation, I believe section 11 is the only section likely to be workable and there is a very grave legal objection to the section in that it visualises a free man in the Republic being handed into the custody of the security forces in Northern Ireland.  Every accused person has the basic right of being present at the hearing of evidence against him. Being in the custody of security forces to whom he has grave objection will prevent him from organising his defence properly.  The alternative is for him not to allow himself to be put into the custody of the police in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>A totally unconstitutional situation arises, a situation completely contrary to Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention on Human Rights.  The accused will not be present at the examination of the witnesses against him.  He will not be able to challenge their veracity.  The evidence taken in his absence, because of his unwillingness to place himself in the custody of the security forces in Northern Ireland, will be the evidence used against him in the court in this State where he will be charged and tried and the court in this State may <Col N="64" /> proceed to convict the accused on the basis of a written statement of evidence taken in Northern Ireland in the absence of the accused.  This is the nub of the situation as I see it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is abundantly clear as a result of the detailed exposition by Deputy Collins that we are here moving into new, uncharted territory as far as criminal law and procedure in this State are concerned.  It is a fundamental right of any accused person to be present at his trial in order to cross-examine witnesses.  The suspension of the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act of 1967 and many other provisions in this Bill are clearly not in line with the tradition and practice of the criminal law as we know it.  The Minister will concede this. He will have to.  This is uncharted territory. We are here introducing provisions which limit the rights of an accused while giving to the courts or the police rights they do not now have. Before we write into our statute law something that is inconsistent with normal practice and procedure we should consider the position very carefully and include a power of review for this House.  This we must do and this we must be seen to do because it is important not just for the present but for the future record of history.</P>
      <P>We may recognise, as Deputy O'Connell said, that we are in unusual and tragic circumstances and the hope is, as he also said, that these circumstances will not continue.  The Minister must recognise that these provisions infringe the rights of the accused and I believe the House must be given the authority to come back in 12 months' time and review the operation of these provisions.  If we do not do that we are not being mindful of our obligations as a Legislature.  We cannot throw away our responsibility. We recognise the Government will push this legislation through.  We have made our position clear.  We are determined to the best of our ability to oppose infringements on rights or minimise those infringements to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation involves our jurisdiction with &mdash; let us face it &mdash; a jurisdiction against which, even up to the Order <Col N="65" /> of Business today, we have lodged complaints at the Court of Human Rights, with a jurisdiction against which we have made charges.  Under this Bill our agencies will mingle with those agencies against which we have had cause to complain.  Under this Bill they will be obliged to co-operate.  We still believe these agencies to be less than perfect.  Surely, in deference to our institutions and in deference to this House, we must put in some power of review.</P>
    <P>This is a new departure.  We have no idea how this legislation will work. The Minister cannot tell us and I honestly believe he will not even try to tell us.  We have expressed grave reservations.  It is significant that Deputy O'Connell has expressed the view he did.  I believe that view is representative not just of Deputy O'Connell but of many Members on that side of the House.  Our view is known.  I believe Deputy O'Connell's view is not unrepresentative.  I believe Members on the opposite benches, so obviously absent from the Government benches, would, if they were here, say there is something radically unacceptable in this legislation and ask for a review or some limitation on its application.  Our spokesman on Justice has cogently put forward our case.  I do not purport to speak for Deputy O'Connell but I understand him to be concerned about the introduction of these procedures and I am of the opinion that he would not object to the Minister's accepting an amendment in the form of that tabled by Deputy Collins.  It would be very undesirable for us to let this through as it is in the knowledge that never again may we have an opportunity of endeavouring to avoid the defects which we believe will arise in the course of this legislation. It is all right for the Minister to say that in the event of the manifestation of certain defects he will bring the legislation back to the House but while we have confidence in his integrity, we must ensure, as the legislative assembly, that the legislation will be brought back if necessary.  That is the purpose of the <Col N="66" /> amendment and we urge the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far the debate has ranged widely over the Bill.  I expect this is because the sections that are under debate, in so far as Deputy Collins's amendments are concerned, are at the heart of the Bill.</P>
      <P>During the Second Stage debate Deputy O'Connell indicated his anxiety that the Bill should be of a temporary nature.  My recollection of the debate at that stage is that he raised this matter in the context of his being of the opinion that certain of the amending sections were repressive and he drew attention to the heavier penalties being introduced by way of the substantive criminal law amendments.  The Deputy raised the question as to whether the onus of proof was being shifted in relation to firearms offences.  I dealt with those points in detail when replying to that Stage of the debate.  I said then that it would be clear to the House that the substantive amendments to the ordinary law are desirable and are not draconian.  By definition all criminal law is repressive in that it endeavours to repress crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments to the substantive criminal law are good because they remove anomalies and leave the law tidier and more acceptable in so far as lawyers and others are concerned. Such people will be able to see exactly what is involved.  By tidying up the definitions and making the penalties more consistent with the crimes, certain technical difficulties and anomalies are being removed.  The penalties provided for are maximum ones but it will be a matter for the court, within the maximum, to apply the penalty appropriate to each case. As I also indicated on the previous occasion the question of the burden of proof is a technical matter and there is no question of an accused person being asked to prove his innocence.  I had thought that I had removed much of the Deputy's anxiety in regard to that aspect of the Bill.  From what Deputy Collins has said I understand the Opposition to be in agreement with me in so far as the amendments <Col N="67" /> being made to the substantive criminal law are concerned.  The Deputy said he would have preferred to see them in a separate Bill.  I should not quibble with that but since this vehicle presented an opportunity for making the amendments, we took advantage of it for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the features of the Bill which concern Deputy O'Connell will not be such as to cause him concern when he considers what I had to say in reply to the points he made on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>The parts of the Bill relating to the taking of evidence on commission are temporary because they exist only for so long as the Special Court is in existence.  Once the Special Court is disestablished this provision falls.  The principle of extra-territoriality remains. After the disestablishment of the Special Court, the trial of an extra-territorial offence will have to take place in the courts here and in these courts all the witnesses concerned would give evidence.  We all look forward to the time when circumstances in our country will permit of the disestablishing of the Special Court.  When that happy day comes, these provisions for taking evidence on commission, although remaining on the statute book, will be inoperable because the Special Court is the tribunal specified in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We cannot blind ourselves to the fact that we are living in an awful time in this island.  The phrase &ldquo;unusual circumstances&rdquo; has been used by people on the other side to describe current times but that phrase is much too mild because we are living in a time when horrible acts of savagery are being committed.  If some of the people who commit those savage acts flee to this jurisdiction I do not think we could hold our heads up among civilised nations unless we were able to take action to bring them to justice and make them amenable for those acts.  Because of the nature of the extradition code, the law prevents them from being handed back to the jurisdiction in which they committed those crimes.  Therefore, I hardly think that anybody would <Col N="68" /> quibble with our taking steps to rectify that situation.</P>
    <P>We must examine the mechanics by which we propose to deal with this situation.  Having regard to the realities of life on this island it is unreal to think that many people from the North who would be involved as witnesses to some of these savage acts and, consequently, who would be required to assist in the bringing to justice of the perpetrators of these acts, would not be apprehensive about coming to this jurisdiction because they consider &mdash; but consider wrongly &mdash; that this jurisdiction is inimical to them and shows that the people here show support for the people who commit these savage acts.  These witnesses would be concerned for their safety so it would be closing one's eyes to reality to assume that in all the circumstances they would be prepared to give evidence.</P>
    <P>There is no point in providing for the trial of savage offenders unless we provide for a system whereby evidence can be taken against them.  It is clear that our courts cannot be given jurisdiction to compel witnesses to come from another jurisdiction.  Therefore, unless we have the provision for the taking of evidence on commission the Bill will be useless.</P>
    <P>However, while providing for the taking of evidence on commission we write into the Bill, too, strict safeguards to ensure that any such evidence will be full and fair from the point of view both of the accused and of the prosecution, in regard to legal representation and in regard to the presence of the trial judges, giving them a right to ask whatever questions they consider necessary, subject to matters of privilege and so on.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that the Convention on Human Rights has been breached.  I deny that there is any such breach and I am confident that should anybody attempt to test the Bill on those grounds, his case will fail.  If an accused person wishes to go North to hear evidence being taken on commission he must do so in custody.  During my Second Stage speech I dealt at some length with <Col N="69" /> the reason for that.  What is important is that while in custody the accused would be guaranteed immunity. This provision is written into the Bill and into the reciprocal legislation. He is guaranteed immunity from all proceedings, civil or criminal, while in custody for the purpose of evidence being taken on commission.  The Opposition spokesmen so far have not referred to this provision.  The guarantee is one that is backed by the full resources of this State.  Should there be any breach of it either in the letter or in the spirit, the reciprocal arrangement must cease to operate.  This is the sanction to ensure that the guarantee of immunity will be maintained and observed in the spirit and in the letter.</P>
    <P>It needs to be emphasised that that guarantee of immunity is there, that an accused person is not being asked to go in custody to the other jurisdiction. If he wants he can go with a guarantee of immunity from all proceedings, civil and criminal, and that includes questioning and interrogation. That immunity must be honoured in the spirit and in the letter.  It is important that this be said because that kernel point was glossed over or omitted.  Certainly it was not advanced by any speaker on the other side&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point made was that if an accused person decides not to go across for the taking of evidence against him his right to a fair trial would be impugned and thereby diminished.  This overlooks the point that if he decides not to go, notwithstanding the very clear guarantee of immunity that is given, he is entitled to be represented by solicitor and counsel who may be representing him at the Special Court here.  If we have a situation where an accused person may go with a guarantee of <Col N="70" /> immunity, or if he does not go himself he can send his solicitor and counsel &mdash; he can also bring his solicitor and counsel with him &mdash; it is unreal to argue that should he decide not to go and not to send his solicitor and counsel that thereby he is denied a fair trial.  We must have a sense of realism about this.</P>
      <P>I am not terribly impressed with the arguments that he is being asked to deliver himself up to a jurisdiction with which we are in contention before the Court of Human Rights.  That is unreal in view of the very proper statement attributed to the Leader of the Opposition last week in Brussels when he called for the support of people on both sides of the Border for their respective security forces.  The time has come when the acts of savagery have reached such a pitch that we have to face up to the reality, which is that either we fight against anarchy or it overcomes us.  This is part of the fight against anarchy.</P>
      <P>It is an important Bill because I think it will end the scandal of the fugitive offender.  &ldquo;Fugitive offender&rdquo; is a legal term to cover a savage terrorist and that is the kind of person we are after.  When one reads the offences covered by this Bill one sees there is nothing there about the person making political speeches or holding political views.  They are specific criminal law offences &mdash; murder, manslaughter, arson, kidnapping and false imprisonment.  They are a horrible litany of offences that are well nigh a daily occurrence in Northern Ireland. If we down here can assist in any way towards the ending of that regime of terror up there we have an obligation to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concede that this is a novel procedure in our criminal law but we are dealing with a unique situation that can only be solved by devising a novel solution.  However, because it is a novel procedure it is not to say it will be unworkable or bad.  I have demonstrated here that there are safeguards to ensure that the novel procedures prescribed will not in any way infringe or diminish a person's rights, whether under the Constitution or the European Convention.  It is <Col N="71" /> quite clear they are there.  In addition, the measure must be of a temporary nature because these novel procedures only subsist so long as the Special Court is in existence.  Once it is disestablished these procedures fall and extra-territoriality in the ordinary way resumes.  If there is an extraterritorial offence for which extradition is not possible, it can only be tried in the courts here provided the witnesses from the other jurisdiction are prepared to come down here.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the arguments that because it is novel there should be a time limit of one year but it is closing one's eyes to the reality of the situation in this island.  The proper time limit is the existence of the Special Court.  It was established in the past for the special need of this island to deal with emergency situations and when they ended it was disestablished. The same will happen this time and all of us fervently wish the sooner the better.  That is the proper time limit rather than writing in one year.  It could be asked why not write in two years or six months? Who is to say what is the proper time?  We cannot foretell the future. The time limit should be the existence of the Special Court and that is what is in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard the Minister on the points raised but in general what he had to say was an effort to justify the Bill more or less on the basis of a Second Reading speech and it was only in the last minute of his contribution that the matter of a time limit was dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My mind goes back to this House in May, 1972, when, in a situation of considerable emergency, I had to promote a Bill that subsequently became the Prisons Act, 1972.  The circumstances in which that Bill was promoted were that there had been a serious riot in Mountjoy Prison instigated by members of the IRA.  A great deal of damage had been done in the prison and, in fact, it became so seriously damaged that it could hold only a comparatively small number of prisoners although its <Col N="72" /> population at the time of the riot was several hundred.  We were faced with the specific problem that we had about 40 or 50 prisoners who were dangerous subversive criminals and we had no suitable accommodation for them because of what they did in Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>It was clear that the rebuilding of Mountjoy would take several years at least and the provision of other prison accommodation in the State that would be suitable to hold prisoners of that kind would take some years.  I introduced a Bill, the effect of which was to allow me to transfer certain types of dangerous subversive prisoners to military custody because of the situation that had arisen in Mountjoy.  Military custody was not the kind of custody we were talking about here, the military custody of the British Army or the Special Armed Services.  It was the custody of our own Army, in particular the military police of our Army who were subject to the discipline of their own officers who, in turn, are subject to the Government and this House and, where appropriate, they are subject to the civil jurisdiction of our ordinary courts.  It was a totally different situation from this.</P>
    <P>There could have been no serious belief on the part of anyone in this House that our military were going to ill-treat in any way anyone transferred to military custody under that legislation.  However, at that time there was great opposition to the Bill from those who now sit in Government and those who support them. There were very strong suggestions that while the Bill might be necessary for a short time because of what had happened in Mountjoy it should be only for a very short period.  Amendments were put down by people who are now members of the Government seeking to limit the operation of that Bill; in one case it was suggested it should be for three months; in the case of another Member who is now a Minister six months was suggested and another Member suggested 12 months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> I said the best estimate I could make at that time, acting on the basis of the advice available, was that it would be at least three years before suitable alternative accommodation could be made available for the prisoners in question.  I suggested to the Opposition that, while I did not see the necessity for a time limit because I did not see anything in the Bill that needed curtailment or was in any way dangerous or inimical to human rights of those who might be affected, in a spirit of compromise I was prepared to put a three-year limit on the Bill which was the period I was advised was the minimum necessary.  That was not acceptable. The very strong opposition to the Bill continued and I was in the position that we had approximately 40 men in custody in the Curragh.</P>
    <P>Strictly speaking, their custody was not lawful because they were, effectively, in military custody although they were, technically, in civil custody because we had two prison officers there to try to give a veneer of legality to the whole situation.  Notwithstanding the fact that that was well known the opposition to that Bill continued on the grounds that it was highly undesirable and so on.  Finally, on the third morning of the debate I came in here and said to the Opposition that the Bill was terribly urgent, that I was prepared to make a reasonable sort of compromise that was anyway possible in order to try to secure its speedy passage. I agreed to a two year limit on the Bill although I knew at that time it would be inadequate.</P>
    <P>That was finally agreed to.  As far as I recall the Fine Gael Party did not vote against the Bill and some Members of the Labour Party did.  The Bill passed later that day and passed through the Seanad the following day. I viewed with no little amusement, indeed with some irony, my successor, who led the opposition to that Bill and who called for a very short life to it, coming in here in 1974 and asking the House to agree, by way of a further Bill to the extension of the Act of 1972 which the House very readily agreed to.  There was none of the histrionic nonsense on that occasion that <Col N="74" /> we saw in 1972 because we saw, as I forecast at the time, that the need was still there.</P>
    <P>I believe it is only now, four years later, that suitable alternative accommodation is becoming available and that a new prision is nearly complete in the Curragh.  I do not know if it is proposed to extend the 1972 Act, as amended by the Act of 1974, further. Certainly at that time the necessity for time limits on Bills of almost any kind to deal with security matters of the sort we are talking about for the most part in this Bill was very clearly felt. The present Minister for Justice was to the forefront in making the arguments for a time limit on the Prisons Act, 1972 even though its only purpose was to put a certain limited number of prisoners into the custody of the Army.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to contrast the provisions of that Act with what is before us today and to look at what is here. If the positions were reversed and I had the temerity, as Minister for Justice, to introduce a Bill of this kind does not everyone here, including the Minister for Justice, know very well what Deputy Cooney's reaction to such a Bill would be?  The outrage and the horror that would be expressed hardly bears imagining if we have any memory at all of the outrage and horror that was expressed from these benches between 1972 and 1973.</P>
    <P>Although we think much of this Bill is wrong and is unworkable we have not put up any obstructive opposition to it.  We have criticised as we thought it necessary to do so.  Our criticisms are those of many sections of the general public but they have for the most part been disregarded. There is one final gesture at least we can make in relation to the Bill, if we are unable to stop its passage because of the operation of the Government Whip, notwithstanding the feelings of various Deputies on the Government side, that is we should seek now that some time limit be put on the Bill, not on it as a whole, as Deputy O'Connell suggested, but on certain parts of it, not because they are novel but because they are the sort of things we do not think should exist permanently as part of our criminal law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> Deputy Collins has been very careful in amendment No. 4 not to make it a blanket amendment of postponement for 12 months but simply to pick out sections which are unusual or unique to which objection is taken. The objection that is taken to several of those sections by us is not based on what they are endeavouring to do and in many cases is not based on the principle of what is involved.  Our objection is based on the methods which it is proposed to use allegedly to achieve these ends.  It is worth nothing that the only really substantive thing the Minister said at the end of his reply to Deputy Collins was that there was already a limitation, so far as the taking of evidence in Northern Ireland was concerned, under section 11 because it could only come into operation while the Special Court was sitting and the Special Court would only sit when a declaration was made by the Government under the 1939 Act.  He said that was not a permanent state and, therefore, to some extent the procedure was subject to that limitation in time and when things quietened down sufficiently in the country to enable the Special Court to be disestablished then these provisions would no longer form part of the law.  The Minister may well have unwittingly misled the House in saying that because the way he said it gave the impression that not alone section 11 but all the other sections, which are set out in Deputy Collin's amendment, would not operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me clarify the matter by saying that I said that the extra-territorial offences, which are those created by sections 2 and 3, would continue to operate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has clarified that because I believe some Members of the House may well have had the impression that all these sections would lapse if and when the Special Criminal Court lapsed.  I was going through the sections while the Minister was speaking on this point and the only one which would lapse is section 11.  Therefore, we would have <Col N="76" /> the position that sections 2, 3, 12, 18, 19 and 20 would continue in force irrespective of whether or not the Special Court was sitting.  Some of these have very serious and long term effects.  For example section 18 takes away the right of the defendant to require the attendance on the taking of depositions of a witness against him. That is a very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not an absolute ending of that right.  It is only provided that the justice is satisfied that the person is outside the jurisdiction and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way the justice could be satisfied, with the greatest respect to the Minister, that it is not reasonably practicable to secure the attendance of a witness is when the witness is outside the jurisdiction and the subpoena or a witness summons cannot be served on him. All a witness, who does not want to give evidence, has to do at a deposition here is simply stay outside the jurisdiction and he cannot be served. The justice cannot but be satisfied then that it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance before the justice for his examination.  If he is outside and stays outside the jurisdiction, the justice must be satisfied that it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every time one reads this Bill one sees more in it, unfortunately; not more things that would help to counter violence or subversion in either part of this country, but things which could be used &mdash; and for all I know and we must assume will be used &mdash; in relation to cases which have nothing to do with so-called political violence and subversion.  For example, it could be a case of a man who was up for a non-violent crime or alleged offence which has nothing to do with violence, subversion or anything of that kind. If, for example, some person makes an allegation to the police that somebody else has defrauded him and makes a long statement to that effect, and the Director of Public Prosecutions serves that statement on a <Col N="77" /> defendant in a book of evidence, and if the person making the statement decamps to Northern Ireland or England, and if the defendant &mdash; as he is perfectly entitled to do &mdash; requires that man to swear to the truth of what he has alleged in his statement, his right to have him there is taken away permanently by section 18, because that section is not subject to the limitation in time that the Minister is talking about.  In my view, the Minister cannot be so insincere that he wants that kind of thing to happen. I believe that, no less than myself or Deputy Collins, he does not want that to happen and he has a way of ensuring that it will not happen, that is, to accept amendment No. 4 in the name of Deputy Collins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is objectionable in principle, as the Deputy seems to be arguing, allowing it on the statute book for a year does not meet the Deputy's objection.  His amendment should be to repeal it entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many things in this Bill which I would like to see repealed entirely but we clearly have no hope of having them repealed. The Minister is adamant about that.  If the Minister is agreeing now to take out section 18, which I urge on him, we would gladly withdraw the amendment so far as it refers to section 18.  When the Minister considers the effect of section 18 he may well agree with me that it is highly desirable that it would be withdrawn.  Section 11 is the only one which is subject to the rather indefinite time limit the Minister referred to.  We should look at the reality of the situation here at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can any of us seriously say that we believe the Special Criminal Court will not exist in six, 12 or 18 months' time?  Can any of us seriously say we believe there will not be a need for this court in six, 12, 18 or 24 months? I do not think we can.  It has existed for over three-and-a-half years.  I am afraid the general security situation of the country as a whole is not improving. Some recent events would lead one to believe that it is rapidly disimproving and is a great deal worse <Col N="78" /> than it was some years ago.  Is it not illusory for the Minister to suggest that in a sense there is a time limit on section 11, because in practice it might not operate for a number of years to come? All of us would fervently wish that it were not so, but if we are honest with ourselves we can see the Special Criminal Court still existing in this country in several years' time.</P>
    <P>I do not want to refer again to all these individual sections which have been referred to by Deputy Collins and the Minister.  We will have the opportunity of debating the merits or demerits of each as we go along.  It suffices to say that there are sections here which are unusual, to say the least of it, unworkable unquestionably and it is widely believed that several of them contravene the European Convention on Human Rights. There is doubt about the constitutionality of others.  These beliefs are pretty widely held by diverse groups throughout the country.  In all the circumstances, the least that might be done is to put a limitation of time on the operation of some of those sections.</P>
    <P>If 12 or 24 months prove to be too short, the Minister can come back here as he did in 1974 and extend the period.  There probably would not be any great opposition to a reasonable extension if it were found necessary. But to leave these things as a permanent part of our criminal law in my view is quite wrong.  The Minister suggests that, if anybody believes the European Convention on Human Rights is contravened by some of the sections included in Deputy Collins's amendment, we should test it.  That is a rather facile suggestion, to say the least, on the part of the Minister.  As far as I recall we, as the Government of Ireland, started the action against the Government of the United Kingdom in the summer of 1971.  We are now in January, 1976 &mdash; four-and-a-half years later &mdash; and we have not got even the preliminary decision as yet. We have it from the papers because it seems to have been leaked all over Europe.  Maybe the Minister also has it because the questions were refused <Col N="79" /> today.  They were not allowed let alone answered.  Officially we have not the preliminary decision.</P>

      <P>The decision of the commission on this matter, so far as one can draw an analogy with our own law and legal procedures, is roughly equivalent to the decision of a District Court in an indictment case, in other words whether there is a case to send forward for trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the Minister's suggestion that there should be a reference to the European Commission on Human Rights and, I suppose, subsequently to the European Court for a ruling as to whether or not certain sections of this Bill which are included in those enumerated in Deputy Collins's amendment did or did not contravene the European Convention on Human Rights.  I am not certain at all that there exists in the European Court the same type of procedure as we have in the High Court or the Supreme Court here, where a citizen is entitled to bring what is called a declaratory action in the High Court for a ruling as to whether or not a section is <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution or otherwise ineffective.</P>
      <P>I believe that such a right very probably does not exist in the European system and the only person who could in those circumstances take action in the courts would be somebody who was physically interfered with in such a way that he believed or alleged that his rights under the European Convention were infringed and that interference was done under a section in this Bill which he felt contravened the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out before the interruption, even if a case was started immediately after the passage of this Bill &mdash; we have the experience of the case taken by the Government here against the British Government in 1971 which now after the passage of four-and-a-half <Col N="80" /> years still has not got to the stage of a decision on the preliminary question of whether or not there is a <i>prima facie</i> case to send to the court to try &mdash; it is quite illusory for the Minister to suggest to this House or to anybody who might be affected under this Bill that they have any useful way of going to the European Court on Human Rights to have any part of this Bill, or this Act as it would be then, declared to be in contravention. It would be several years before any decision would be made there, and whatever terms of imprisonment might be imposed on someone under this legislation might well have long since expired before any decision would have been obtained in Europe. We have complaints from time to time of delay in the law in this country which are sometimes quite justified, but the sort of delays we know are a pale shadow of what appears to be accepted as normal in certain of these European institutions.</P>
    <P>As I say, I do not want to go into the various other sections in detail now.  I propose to avail of the opportunity to speak on them as each one comes up.  But I do want to remind the Minister for Justice that in 1972, on a Bill the importance of which was only a fraction of this and under which the potential danger to the rights of the citizen was nil, because they were simply being transferred from the custody of our own prison officers to that of our own Army, he made a stronger case than anyone else for the necessity for a time limit, and in order to meet him and to meet his colleagues who are now in Government, I agreed to a time limit even though I know it was too short, and I was justified in my belief and knowledge that it was too short, because ironically my own successor, Deputy Cooney, had to extend it.</P>
    <P>The circumstances there bear no relationship whatever to the circumstances of what is contained in this Bill, and if there was a need for a time limit on that Bill, which I did not altogether accept but which I did agree to at the time, there is certainly ten times more need for a time limit on this Bill, not on the whole Bill because <Col N="81" /> some of it relates to the normal substantive criminal law&mdash;and that is recognised by Deputy Collins&mdash;but on certain sections of this Bill on which very clearly there is need for a time limit.  I believe some of the sections should not be in it at all; I made that clear, but if we are going to be lumbered with them anyway, let us at least not be lumbered with them forever but let us have some reasonable limitation on the period of time for which they will form part of the law of our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with two amendments together, that put down by Deputy Collins and an amendment put down by Deputy O'Connell.  I suggest that the case for our amendment in the name of Deputy Collins is by far the strongest and merits very serious consideration by the Minister.  If it comes to the point, I will certainly vote for Deputy O'Connell's motion in the event of Deputy Collins's motion not succeeding, because, while amendment No. 4 is the more desirable amendment to adopt for reasons which have been very fully explained, I still see considerable merit in Deputy O'Connell's amendment in principle.</P>
      <P>The philosophy behind both amendments is the same.  I see it as a wish to express a positive distaste, not necessarily for this legislation, but for legislation of this order.  I think that sort of distaste is shared by all right-thinking legislators.  No legislator likes to deal with repressive legislation of any sort and everybody, including the Minister, admits that this is repressive legislation.  We would all prefer to deal with law reform, enlightened improvements to our body of law, better family law, laws to bring about improved social justice in different areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is not a perfect world and unpalatable things have to be done by legislators in the public interest from time to time.  We have had to do them when we were in Government.  I personally had to do them when I was Minister for Justice. In the order of things, every Minister for Justice, even in the most civilised <Col N="82" /> country, will have to do things from time to time which are unpalatable and distasteful but necessary.  That is the way in which we should approach this legislation.  By adopting either of these two amendments we can indicate that this is not the sort of legislation we want to pass.</P>
    <P>If it has to be done, and if the Executive in the full discharge of their responsibility insist that this legslation be passed, we are entitled to ask the Government to indicate that they do not like it any more than we do by putting a limit to its duration.  I think it is a very fair proposition for us to put to the Government that the Government and the Opposition should, in effect, say to the nation: &ldquo;This legislation is deemed to be necessary in the interests of public safety and public welfare, but it is of such a nature that it is not the sort of legislation we would like to see in permanent form as part of our statute law.  We will get rid of it at the earliest possible moment and we will write into it the date of its own expiration.&rdquo; That is a fairly common practice in democratic legislatures.  It is one which we should certainly adopt on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The objection to Deputy O'Connell's amendment is that there are some sections in the Bill which the Minister for Justice has told us, and quite rightly so, constitute normal improvements in our criminal law.  They are the sort of amendments to the criminal law to which any Minister for Justice in any legislature which was anxious to keep up with the times and have a modern corpus of statute law would be giving effect.  Personally I am delighted to see the section dealing with aggravated burglary which is becoming a very serious menace particularly in this city.  Deputy O'Connell's amendment would have the effect of bringing these sections to an end after 12 months as well as all the other sections.  To that extent I think our amendment is preferable. Our amendment would have the effect of bringing the unrepresentative and undesirable sections to an end after 12 months, while leaving extant those sections which constitute normal improvements <Col N="83" /> to our criminal law, and to which nobody has any particular objection.</P>
    <P>Here I might say&mdash;and the Minister has admitted this&mdash;it would be infinitely desirable if these normal improvements to our criminal law were incorporated in a general reforming statute.  Criminal law being so important, and having the impact it has, should not be dealt with in any tinkering way.  Whereas one can sympathise with the Minister's wish to avail of this opportunity to effect these specific improvements, nevertheless, on the whole, I think everyone would prefer that, if any changes in the criminal law were to be made, they would be made in a comprehensive integrated statute where everything could be seen side by side with everything else.</P>
    <P>That is the way to reform any branch of the law and particularly it is the way to reform the criminal law. In any event, the Minister has availed of this opportunity&mdash;and nobody will object very strenuously to what he has done&mdash;to make these changes.  While Deputy O'Connell's amendment would have the effect of bringing these changes to an end, as well as the Bill as a whole, I would certainly be prepared to go along with his amendment in my anxiety to ensure an expression in this House that this is not desirable legislation and that the House is prepared to tolerate it and put up with it only for the minimum amount of time necessary.  I suggest that is the way in which Deputies should approach these two amendments.</P>
    <P>I am reinforced in my wish to have a limitation of duration written into the Bill by studying the document, the report, from which this legislation emanates.  This legislation is a concept of the Sunningdale Agreement.  It was agreed at Sunningdale that the legal problems raised at that time should be referred to a very special, expert and high level commission.  They were so referred and a commission were appointed and duly reported.  I want to refer the House to the report of that commission.  It is the Law Enforcement Commission Report <Col N="84" /> which was made to the Minister for Justice of Ireland and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  I quote from paragraph 2 of chapter I of the report.  These distinguished lawyers said:</P>
    <P>It is essential, in our opinion, that the practical measures that are taken should not infringe the right to a fair trial which each jurisdiction cherishes and which is protected by the Constitution of Ireland or by any international convention or declaration to which either Government is a party.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3 states:</P>
    <P>At the outset we appreciated that we were being invited to consider how best to introduce into the two legal systems some special and limited provisions to deal with a special problem.  Accordingly, we have accepted as our basic premise that any proposals we make should be precisely defined and should not extend beyond the need created by the problem.</P>
    <P>They are very important sentiments expressed by that commission.  They were very clearly directing their minds to a particular situation of limited duration.  Admittedly nowhere in the words themselves do they indicate that the measures they propose should be of limited duration, but I think it is implicit in what they say. I should like at this stage to give another quotation from what they said in support of that:</P>
    <P>Though the problem is urgent and serious its solution requires not far-reaching law reform but immediate practical measures to bring a limited, though very dangerous, class of offender to justice.</P>
    <P>In that quotation there is a clear indication that the Law Enforcement Commission did not particularly like the proposals they were making, but were prepared to put them forward for precisely defined objectives and not to extend beyond the need created by the problem.  We can find in those words very real justification for asking the Minister to make the provisions of this Bill of a temporary nature.  The commission were anxious <Col N="85" /> to deal with the brief handed to them by the parties who came together in the Sunningdale Agreement, and no more.  They were putting forward proposals which were limited.  I suggest limited in power, limited in their ambit, and also, I believe, implicitly in what they say, limited in time.</P>
    <P>The Minister, by way of interruption, posed the question to Deputy O'Malley: if the Bill is objectionable in principle what is the point of making it temporary?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction, that was in relation to a specific section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to deal with the general argument.  It is justifiable, sometimes, to accept things which are objectionable in principle but in doing so to make it clear that they are only being accepted under duress because of the situation and that they will be got rid of at the earliest possible moment.  It is legitimate for us to argue here that because the Bill is objectionable in principle we should seek to have it dispensed with at the earliest possible moment.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in opposing the amendments, made three points and I should like to deal with them now. He dealt with the question of the Special Criminal Court and in that regard his argument is double-edged. Some people have criticised the Bill in general on the basis that it institutionalises the Special Criminal Court and the Minister has been at some pains to rebut that accusation.  In dealing with these amendments today he said the Bill was, in effect, temporary because the special provisions in it in regard to the taking of evidence in the North of Ireland on deposition are contemporaneous with the Special Criminal Court and if the Special Criminal Court is stood down those provisions disappear with it.  That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Special Criminal Court no longer exists the power to take evidence on desposition in the North of Ireland goes with it.  The Bill will continue to exist and be operable by <Col N="86" /> the ordinary courts but that particular power goes at the same time as the Special Criminal Court goes.  Surely, if the Minister wishes to argue that that situation makes the Bill temporary in itself, it is equally valid to argue on the other side that that situation creates a need to keep the Special Criminal Court in existence. I am sure we all agree that the provisions of this Bill would become largely inoperative if the power to take evidence on deposition in Northern Ireland was not included in it.  If those powers are to go when the Special Criminal Court goes there is every reason on the part of the Executive to wish to keep the Special Criminal Court for as long as possible if only to keep those provisions in existence.  I suggest to the Minister that his argument that because the provisions in relation to evidence on deposition will disappear with the Special Criminal Court is one in favour of regarding this Bill as temporary does not stand up.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a point which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, and myself, adverted to during the Second Stage debate. Both sides see this point from different aspects.  The Minister, in arguing for the provisions for the taking of evidence on deposition said it was possible to visualise situations where witnesses from the North of Ireland would not be prepared to come here because they would be apprehensive and, therefore, it would be difficult to institute prosecutions. That is a valid point but if it is valid from the point of view of prosecution witnesses it is more valid from the point of view of defence witnesses. Surely the Minister must see that if a person is prosecuted here and the witnesses on whom he could rely to clear him of the charge were apprehensive about coming here it is a more serious matter than the failure of prosecution witnesses to come here and assist in the prosecution of the charge.  The Minister is resorting to very double-edged arguments in this regard.  One of the criticisms made against the provisions of this Bill as far as the accused is concerned is that the accused will be unable in certain <Col N="87" /> circumstances to get witnesses to testify on his behalf because of the situation that prevails in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Defence witnesses can also be heard on commission in the North if they do not wish to come down here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I am dealing with the Minister's point in regard to witnesses coming down here. The Minister used the argument about prosecution witnesses being apprehensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is more important in the case of a defence witness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is equally important but in the case of prosecution and defence witnesses if they are apprehensive their evidence can be taken on commission in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on some common ground there.  The Minister thinks that from the point of view of the prosecution this is a danger and I suggest it is a more serious danger from the point of view of the defence.  The Minister sought to persuade us that an accused person could quite safely go North to sit in at the taking of evidence on deposition in his own interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On commission.  The Deputy said, &ldquo;on deposition&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an important aspect of the Bill.  It is crucial to the Minister's defence of the provisions that an accused person can go North and be present when evidence is being given against him and taken on commission by the commissioners.  The question that arises is: would an accused person be prepared to go to the North? Could he travel North with a feeling of safety and security?  The Minister has told us that there are all sorts of guarantees.  The big argument he used to persuade us that everything was all right in this connection was that if these guarantees were not adhered to, if the authorities in the North do not honour their obligations, the whole <Col N="88" /> thing will break down.  Surely, in support of that, if the Bill was declared to be of limited duration and could only be extended by this House is that not a persuasive argument to everybody concerned, whether they are Northern authorities or not, to ensure that the terms of the Bill are scrupulously and honourably adhered to?  From that point of view the amendments which seek to place a limit on the duration of the Bill are worthy, and from that point of view, apart from any other, the Minister would be entitled to support either of the amendments.</P>
      <P>I have other arguments to make in favour of the amendments but I will refrain from doing so because they would touch on the European Convention on Human Rights and we will be dealing with that aspect on Deputy Collins' other amendments, Nos. 2 and 3.  Therefore I do not wish to be repetitive, but I wish to say at this stage it is our view that in many respects this Bill is undesirable and that it should be seen to be terminated on its face.</P>
      <P>One of those compelling reasons is that we are founder signatories in good standing, something we can be proud of, of the European Convention on Human Rights and we should be totally averse to doing anything to affect our international reputation in that regard.  I am afraid this Bill in many respects brings us in conflict with the convention.</P>
      <P>For that reason the Bill should be seen to be of a temporary nature.  I will not elaborate on how the Bill is in conflict with the convention because we will have an opportunity of doing that on amendments Nos. 2 and 3.  I have outlined the perfectly valid ground for making the Bill of a temporary nature and for supporting either amendments Nos. 1 or 4, depending on how much importance you attribute to keeping in being ordinary changes in the criminal law.</P>

      <P>Apart from the arguments made by Deputies Collins, O'Kennedy, O'Malley and Haughey, I strongly support the amendment in the name of the spokesman charged with the shadow portfolio of Justice.  The arguments already made by the <Col N="89" /> Deputies mentioned do not need repeating and I will not take up the time of the House doing so.</P>
      <P>However, it is well we should make it clear that in some way we have been charged with trying to hold up progress on the Bill.  The Leader of our party made the position clear in that respect.  I would remind the House that the Bill was sent to the Seanad and ordered to be printed on 10th April, 1975, and that here we are dealing with the Committee Stage only, almost a year later.  Therefore, when somebody suggests that the Opposition are attempting to delay the progress of the Bill and examines the progress of the Bill from its initiation in the Seanad, down through the slow tortuous legislative pipeline to the Dáil, it will be found that it is the Government who must be considered guilty of delaying the progress of the Bill.  If the legislation were of such urgency, why did the Government not give it priority in the House?  We know the Government's legislative record since they came into power almost three years ago, a pretty dreadful record.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition indicated on behalf of the party, who subscribe to his view, that we are not against the intention in the Bill of bringing to justice those who are guilty of crimes either in the name of the UK according to the Loyalists, or of the Republic by those who describe themselves as Republicans, but a real case has been made for an annual review of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of the administration of justice in the North East of Ireland in the past six years has been dreadful, to say the least.  To have any meaning at all, justice must be seen to be applied equally to all sections and there is no gainsaying that justice was not applied equally according to the concepts of the democratic nations. There was a deliberate effort made by the Government in an artificial State deliberately to preclude the minority from all opportunities, a deliberate and successful attempt to exclude the minority from an equal application of justice, to exclude them from positions of prominence which by ordinary <Col N="90" /> decent standards they had the ability to attain.</P>
    <P>It has been well settled on this side of the House that we have no time, good, bad or indifferent, for the bomber, the murderer, the kneecapper, the sectarian assassins of whichever side of the so-called sectarian divide. It has been suggested by Deputy Haughey that when times were tough in the climate of the nation we introduced what might be considered in times of peace to be repressive legislation. Sometimes the climate of the nation demands that legislation be brought in to protect democratic institutions. If it was necessary to introduce legislation of that sort, Fianna Fáil were never found wanting.  That is what sickens me about this Government. Day in, day out they set themselves up as a law and order Government as if they cornered the market on law and order.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  Any Government charged with the governing of a country must as a matter of duty protect what they consider to be the best interest of that country and its people whom they represent.</P>

    <P>We say that not even the minimum standards required by our adherence to the European Convention on Human Rights are incorporated in this Bill.  It is as well to put on the record a communiqué of the Council of Europe dated 21st December, 1971, not to be published before Thursday, 23rd December, 1971 entitled &ldquo;Ireland Against the United Kingdom&rdquo;.  It is an important document because it strengthens the argument put forward by this side of the House in regard to the minimum standards of human rights demanded in legislation even in times of difficulty.  This document is available to any Deputy in the Oireachtas Library, to anybody who may be interested <Col N="91" /> in researching matters of this nature.  There is no answer to this document in relation to the need for an annual review, as is sought in the Fianna Fáil amendment in the name of Deputy G. Collins.  I would urge the House to consider the Fianna Fáil amendment very seriously, with its call for a 12-monthly review of the legislation proposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>This communiqué sets out very briefly that on the 16th December, 1971 the Government of Ireland filed with the European Commission on Human Rights an application in accordance with Article 24 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It continues to say that the Irish Government first refers to the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act, Northern Ireland, 1922, and the connected Statutory Rules, Regulations and Orders and submits that this legislation is in itself a failure by the United Kingdom Government to comply with the obligation in Article 1 of the convention to secure to everybody within its jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section 1 of the convention.  It further says it is also submitted that the methods employed or permitted by the United Kingdom Government in the implementation of the legislation constitutes an administrative practice in breach of Article 1.</P>
    <P>The communiqué goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The application then refers to certain deaths in Northern Ireland in August and October, 1971, and it is submitted that this constituted a breach of Article 2 which guarantees the right to life.</P>
    <P>The application further refers to the taking into custody of persons on or after 9th August, 1971 under the Special Powers Act and alleges that they were subjected to treatment which constitutes torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention.  In support of this allegation, and particularly as regards about 90 cases, the Irish Government has submitted statements, medical evidence and the text of the Compton Report.</P>

      <P>I was just quoting from the communiqué which set up the case of Ireland against the United Kingdom.  I seem to have run into some difficulty as to whether I should be allowed by the Chair to continue along those lines.  It seems to me that the full content of that communiqué issued by the Council of Europe has very strong relevance to the case I make for the Fianna Fáil amendment in the name of Deputy Collins.  It seems to me the document summing up the reason for taking that case has considerable relevance and considerable merit in its relevance.</P>
      <P>The fifth paragraph states:</P>
      <P>The Irish Government also claims that internment without trial, as carried out in Northern Ireland... constitutes a violation of Article 5 (which guarantees the right to liberty and security of person) and Article 6 which guarantees, <i>inter alia,</i> the right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal of the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the application submits that the exercise by the United Kingdom Government, and by the security forces under its control, of its powers to detain and intern <Col N="94" /> persons is carried out with discrimination on the grounds of political opinion and is thus a breach of Article 14 of the Convention (which prohibits discrimination on various grounds) in connection with Articles 5 and 6. Similar allegations are made in respect of the exercise of the powers to search homes and certain other matters.</P>
    <P>The penultimate paragraph of the document is as follows:</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Convention the Commission will first have to decide on the admissibility of the application.  If the application is declared admissible, the Convention will then, in accordance with Article 28 of the Convention, establish the full facts of the case and at the same time will be available to the Parties with a view to securing a friendly settlement of the case on the basis of respect for human right.</P>
    <P>Of course, the friendly settlement situation has not arisen.  The matter has gone to full decision and that is another day's work.</P>
    <P>If no friendly settlement is reached, the Commission will make reports on the cases to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.  It will then be for the Court of Human Rights or, if the cases are not brought before the Court, for the Committee of Ministers, to decide whether or not there have been violations of the Convention.</P>
    <P>The leader of my party, the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lynch, was prevented by the Chair today from asking a question as to whether the final report had come and was available to the Government in connection with the case of Ireland versus the United Kingdom.  That was ruled out of order by the Chair.  That is the Chair's prerogative and it is not my intention to question his ruling on this occasion.  Nevertheless one can only speculate as a result of what one reads in the newspapers as to whether in fact this decision is available to the Government.  We believe the Government <Col N="95" /> have the decision but they will not publish it because it does not suit them to publish it during the course of the debate on this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>To return expressly to the amendment, having put on record the reasons for the taking of the case of Ireland versus the United Kingdom, it appears to me that if a situation existed as set out in that communiqué in the North East of this country in 1971, it is possible the same situation could arise again in 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979?  We, a sovereign state, had to take a case against another sovereign state.  In those circumstances the Fianna Fáil amendment must be seen in its true light. Injustice was worked to the nth degree. It was alleged by one Government against another that they breached article 2 of the Convention on Human Rights which guarantees the right to human life.  Having breached that Convention the allegation quite clearly is that that Government are guilty of of murder.  Article 5 deals with the liberty and security of the person. Article 6 <i>inter alia,</i> deals with the right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that this Bill is designed to deal with people who, it may be alleged, commit the various crimes set out in the Schedule: murder, manslaughter, malicious damage, offences agains the person, explosives, robbery and burglary, firearms and so on.  One of the real beauties of real democracy &mdash; I mean beauty in its real sense &mdash; is its subscription to the rule of law. That rule of law should be applied impartially.  Everyone should be given a fair hearing.  That is something that should be insisted upon.  Despite the fact that there may be lawful allegations against some who would try to drag down this country, they are nevertheless <Col N="96" /> entitled to a fair trial.  It may be alleged that they did not give those they killed or maimed any trial whatsoever. Accepted, but nevertheless we must adhere to certain minimum standards of justice and of human rights and we believe this Bill must adhere to the rights set out in the European Convention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to interrelate a complex and confusing situation. I am posing the question whether there is a possibility that a situation which arose in the past may not arise again in the future.</P>
      <P>If we are to deal with that part of the country against which these allegations are made, allegations which we believe will be substantiated and if we believe that that situation may exist again, should we not have a review of the legislation as set out? There is an unanswerable case to be made for such a review.  It is not good enough for the Minister to dismiss the amendment proposed by Fianna Fáil simply by saying that some parts of the legislation as enshrined in the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1975, will fall when the Special Criminal Court goes into a limbo.  It was not our desire that there exists an instrument such as the Special Criminal Court but the exigencies of the time demanded that such a court be set up and in those circumstances we realised where our duty lay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support strongly the point of view expressed by Deputy O'Malley in connection with the facilities in respect of prisons sought by those who were then in Opposition in relation to a <Col N="97" /> time limit on the legislation that was going through the House.  Apparently those people had great difficulty in accommodating their former liberal consciences in relation to a reasonable request that the provisions of that Act remain in existence legally for three years.  After considerable pressure and requests they conceded that a review in relation to that legislation should take place after a period of two years. I recall clearly that Deputy O'Malley, as Minister for Justice, leaned over backwards in that regard.  However, the former liberal consciences had to come before us cap-in-hand in 1974 asking that that legislation be continued, legislation to which they objected strongly at the time of its introduction. I support this amendment in the name of Deputy Collins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>We have indicated clearly our objections in principle to this Bill and we have stated our reasons why it will be unworkable in the situation that exists on this island.  In his amendment Deputy Collins indicates the sections to which we have particularly strong objections, but our difficulty as an Opposition is that since the Government have a majority the Bill is likely to be passed. Therefore, we are obliged to endeavour in so far as possible to persuade the Minister to limit the functioning of the Bill and, in particular, those aspects of it that we see as most objectionable.  Deputy O'Connell has expressed reservations in relation to the entire Bill.  However, there are some sections of it to which no reasonable person could object.  For example, section 5 represents an improvement on the Larceny Act, 1916 and strengthens the criminal law code in that respect.  Similarly, the following section, which relates to the same Act, will strengthen also the functioning of the criminal law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, section 21 can hardly be objected to.  But having regard to our reservations on the Bill in general and apart from the case that we shall be making in regard to other sections relative to the Convention on Human Rights, our concern is that if the Government are to insist on putting <Col N="98" /> the Bill through its duration should be as limited as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he does not see the need for the amendment proposed by us since the use of the Bill will be limited to the duration of the existence of the Special Criminal Court.  But he knows that that court would not be likely to be in existence were it not for the situation that exists in the Northern part of this country.  Since the best efforts of all those trying to bring that situation to some sort of resolution do not seem likely to be rewarded, it is not likely that the Special Criminal Court will cease to exist in the immediate future.  So far as any reasonable person can foresee it may be years before that court, which most democratic people would regard reluctantly as being necessary, will no longer be needed.</P>
    <P>It is possible to justify the existence of an instrument of that nature if we are to have regard to the defence and protection of our democratic institutions, but I cannot apply the same criteria to the sections of the Bill that are referred to in Deputy Collins's amendment since those sections relate to the introduction into our law of extraordinary legislation.  It is legislation that is fraught with the greatest dangers in many respects.</P>
    <P>In his earlier reply the Minister referred to remarks made on this side of the House in regard to section 11 and said that the defendant in surrendering himself or having to surrender himself voluntarily to custody of the security authorities in the North of Ireland would have immunity.  As I understand the situation there could be many people liable to some form of prosecution who would not believe what the Minister is saying with regard to immunity.  He may be quite right but he should remember that we are dealing with human beings in a human situation, with the sense of credibility of any individual placed in such a situation.  It is reasonable to assume, as speakers on this side inferred on Second Stage, that there can be no doubt about the lack of confidence many people would have in the state of law as it exists in the North of <Col N="99" /> Ireland, and the fact that there are cases before the Court of Human Rights at the present time bears that out.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 in the name of Deputy Collins is a reasonable one in view of the grave doubts, uncertainty and fear which can exist in persons regarding what might happen to them in the circumstances set out in section 11.  I would urge the Minister to give serious reconsideration to it.  I am sure he must feel a strong sense of reluctance about a Bill of this kind.  As Deputy Haughey has pointed out, we would support the amendment put down by Deputy O'Connell because it expresses the same kind of reservation, although it does not go as far as the amendment put down by Deputy Collins.</P>
    <P>The fundamental difficulty we have with regard to legislation of this kind, particularly the sections referred to in the amendment, is the uncertainty regarding political and, to some degree, other laws in the area concerned to which this legislation is directed.  Therefore I would urge the Minister to give consideration to the very reasonable amendment put forward by Deputy Collins on behalf of our party.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion the Deputy did not like what I said. There were a number of points raised since I last intervened.  However, many of them were not relevant to the amendments in that they were arguments for the deletion of the sections covered in Deputy Collins's amendment rather than arguments for giving those sections a temporary life.  They were arguments to show that the sections were bad and objectionable, arguments which the Opposition probably believe were good ones but with which I do not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> When speaking on the section providing for the person being taken in custody to hear evidence on commission, Deputy Ruairí Brugha said that in effect people will not avail of that right to go in custody because of the situation we are in.  When it suits the book of the type of person with whom we are dealing he will know very well what is meant by a guarantee of immunity and will be quite prepared to go if it suits him. We are dealing in this Bill with savage terrorists.  The point I am making is that the argument made is one for deleting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The arguments go to the principle and the merits of the Bill, not so much to the question of the time limit.  Some arguments were specifically on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley used the rather odd argument that some years ago he had a Bill which we opposed and sought to have amended to have it made a temporary measure.  At the time he warned that this was a bad proposal and he said that he was proved right subsequently when there was a change of Government and I had to seek an extension of the legislation. That seems to be an argument in favour of what I am proposing, not to make the mistake that Deputy O'Malley thinks I made then of having <Col N="101" /> a time limit.  I could not see the relevance of that argument this afternoon against what I am proposing.  It supports what I am proposing.  It is clear that the situation which that Act dealt with has carried on longer than anticipated and it meant coming back to the House.  We should learn from what happened and not attempt to put in a time limit that would be unreal and unrealistic.  That is the lesson to be learned from that episode.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that a motion approving the terms of the Lomé Convention was passed by Dáil Éireann on 4th November, 1975.  At that time I informed the House that legislation might be required to give effect to some provisions in the instruments. The first area in which legislation is necessary is that of diplomatic privileges and immunities.</P>
      <P>Protocol No. 5 to the convention provides for privileges and immunities. It provides that certain named categories of persons, such as representatives of the Governments of the EEC and ACP states and members of the consultative assembly set up under the convention, shall enjoy &ldquo;the customary privileges immunities and facilities while carrying out their duties under the convention and while travelling to and from the places at which they are required to carry out those duties&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not found possible to give effect to these immunities by order under the terms of the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act, 1967. This Act makes provision by which immunities can be conferred by order on international organisations of which the State becomes a member and on officials of such organisations and delegates to them.  Under the Lomé Convention there are organs, such as a Committee of Ministers and <Col N="102" /> the Consultative Assembly, on which all the EEC States and ACP States will be represented, but there is no organisation as such of which all the States or their Governments become members.  For this reason the power to provide for immunities by order under the 1967 Act was not applicable.</P>
    <P>This explains the necessity for legislation. Now I come to the form of the legislation proposed.  It would have been possible to introduce a Bill providing only for the privileges and immunities of persons covered by the Lomé Convention.  However, on the advice of the Attorney General I decided on a Bill which was wider in scope and provides that orders can be made providing for immunities whenever an obligation to grant such immunities is imposed under an international agreement to which the State or the Government is or intends to become a party.</P>
    <P>This is desirable because it is possible that the European Communities will be making further external agreements with third countries similar in form to the Lomé Convention.  Such agreements are likely to provide in many cases for aid to these countries, so making the individual member States such as Ireland necessary parties.  They are also likely to provide for immunities for those involved in their implementation and administration. It would be unfortunate if ratification by Ireland had to be delayed in each individual case while parliamentary time was found to process legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas on the relatively subsidiary matter of diplomatic immunities.</P>
    <P>In commending this Bill to Deputies I should stress that it is really only an application of the mode of granting immunities contained in the 1967 Act.  It is firmly within the principle of that Act, a fact stressed by the manner of its drafting as an additional section of that Act.  There is no logical reason why it should be more cumbersome or difficult to give legislative effect to immunities for which provision is made in an international agreement to which the State is a party just because that agreement does <Col N="103" /> not involve the State or the Government becoming a member of an international organisation.  The safeguards under the 1967 Act will apply to any immunities granted under this Bill.  An order will have to be made by the Government and this will be subject to annulment within 21 days by either House of the Oireachtas as provided by section 3 of the 1967 Act.</P>
    <P>The convention cannot enter into force until it has been ratified by all the member States of the Community. Seven of the other member States have already done so and the remaining country, Italy, is understood to be about to take the necessary steps to do so.  It is my wish, and I am sure that both sides of the House would share this wish, that Ireland ratify the convention as soon as possible. By ratifying this convention which, as the House so clearly recognised in November, marks a new and important initiative in relations with the developing countries, Ireland will once again demonstrate her solidarity with the less fortunate peoples of the world.  It is essential that Ireland be in a position to fulfil all her obligations under the convention before proceding to ratification.  I would therefore urge the House to vote this legislation as a matter of priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has given the reasons why he is urging the House to vote this legislation through as a matter of priority, we on this side of the House are prepared to respond to that request.  I would like to say at the same time that there may be aspects of the extension of the Bill which, having regard to the priority, we might not be able to consider to the extent we would like and with the limited time available to me it occurs to me that if we had a little more time we might have been able to make some suggestions, whether or not there were any grounds for some of the apprehensions we might have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that despite the courtesy from himself and his Department in letting me know generally this would be coming up and a copy of this Bill was delivered to my base in Dublin last night unfortunately <Col N="104" /> I was not there and did not see it until about 3.30 this afternoon when I came from the country. It is important that where matters of this nature seem to be urgent and require priority to give effect to what the Minister has rightly said is the universal wish of this House and the nation we should have an opportunity of ensuring that it will be applied for that purpose and where possible to limit it to that purpose.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that we have to ratify this and to do so effectively we have to put through this legislation.  Accordingly, in view of the principle behind the Lomé Convention, we are very anxious to see that our country is not seen to be impeding the implementation of the convention.  If anything, we would be happier if we had known that we had ratified the provisions possibly earlier than the others.  I appreciate that this delay cannot be attributed to the Minister but where the legal advisers of the Government have reason to ascertain that there may be matters they should deal with as a matter of urgency they should do so.  In view of the concern which has been expressed and the part the Minister played in relation to the Lomé Convention it is rather inappropriate that we are at the tail end of the field in ratifying it.  That is the first point I would like to make.</P>
    <P>We are anxious to ensure, in so far as there is no organisation, as the Minister indicated in his opening address, which would be covered within the scope and the interpretation of the existing Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act, 1967 in relation to the Lomé Convention, that the persons acting within the Lomé Convention, namely, from the committee of Ministers through the various agencies of the convention would be granted the same immunity, protection and status made available to other international organisations. We have had, because there is no such organisation, to couch this measure in very general terms.  The proposal will enable the Government by order to make provision to enable international organisations, communities or bodies, their institutions or organs and their property and persons <Col N="105" /> to have and enjoy in the State any inviolability and so forth.  That is obviously very broad.  It means that we have to rely on the Government for the time being to ensure that this protection and privilege will be accorded only to appropriate organisations within the Lomé Convention and indeed to appropriate persons.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the original Act and sees the bodies that are included within the scope of that Act as organisations one finds a large number in section 16 such as the World Health Organisation, International Civil Aviation Organisation, International Labour Organisation and so on.  Would it not have been possible to designate more specifically some structure or organisation under Lomé as they have been designated here?  It would be in the interest of the ACP countries not in the European Community operating under the Lomé Convention to endeavour to set up a permanent structure.  We became aware that there is not that institutional organisational structure in view of the necessity for this Bill.  I was not aware of it at the time we were discussing the matter previously and I do not think the Minister was either although he may have been more aware of it than I was.  He may have been a little more aware than I was.  In my view it would have been better, for the purpose of the Lomé Convention, if there was some such organisation.  It would be tidier, for the purpose of diplomatic immunity and privileges, if we could specify, as has been done in the original Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act, 1967, the people and organisations to whom this applies and, secondly, could limit the application of that special privilege to specific organisations.</P>
    <P>Even with the best intentions in the world and with the best supervision of the Government, there is the possibility that this could be extended, not in relation to Lomé but to any others who seek to get the benefit of this general provision, because of the likelihood that the European Community will be entering into relations with other states he thinks undesirable.  I go along with the Minister in this.</P>
    <P>This is a privilege, a protection, a <Col N="106" /> special status which a state accords to the representatives of organisations or states.  Every country must be assured as far as possible that this privilege will be clearly defined and tightly controlled.  I would like to give some grounds for apprehension.</P>
    <P>The schedule to the original Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967, incorporates the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  This sets the guidelines for diplomatic privilege and protection.  It reads:</P>
    <P>
      <i>The States Parties to the present Convention</i>,</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recalling</i> that peoples of all nations from ancient times have recognised the status of diplomatic agents,</P>
    <P>
      <i>Having in mind</i> the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations concerning the sovereign equality of States, the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of friendly relations among nations,</P>
    <P>
      <i>Believing</i> that an international convention on diplomatic intercourse, privileges and immunities would contribute to the development of friendly relations among nations, irrespective of their differing constitutional and social systems,</P>
    <P>That was one of the main underlying purposes of that Convention.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Realising</i> that the purpose of such privileges and immunities is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions as representing States...</P>
    <P>The underlying principle is to encourage goodwill among nations and contribute to the development of that relationship.</P>
    <P>We would be less than realistic if we did not recognise that since the convention was effected there have been some significant developments in international relations.  I am not saying this is happening in Ireland but it is fair to say that it is a matter of judicial knowledge that many of the major powers have within their diplomatic representation people who are as much concerned with the undermining <Col N="107" /> of the authority and influence of the other major powers in that country as they are with maintaining and creating good relations with the state to whom they are accredited. This poses particular problems for a small country such as ours if we have to cope with the secret service, whatever name it is called.  It impedes the development of the relationship between states and imposes very significant costs on personnel and so on.</P>
    <P>If we were in Valhalla these things would not happen, but the reality is that, unfortunately, they do.  That makes it all the more appropriate when an extension of our Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act is being discussed in this House.  We should say clearly to any nations who have the courtesy of diplomatic representation here that if they want to achieve the purpose of the Vienna Convention the activities of the representatives who have diplomatic privileges and immunity should be directed towards the development of friendly relations among nations, &ldquo;irrespective of their differing constitutional and social systems&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Allegations&mdash;and sometimes more than allegations&mdash;have been made in the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>The London Times</i>, and even in some of our own newspapers, that there has been an unfortunate trend over the past number of years for diplomatic representatives to become involved in secret service activities.  We want to have the best and most fruitful relations with all nations.  It is the peoples of the emerging nations of the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries who, I am sure, were envisaged in the original Vienna Convention.  I cannot imagine anything better calculated to contribute to the friendly relations among nations and to develop the international brotherhood to which we are committed.</P>
    <P>This Bill is concerned about this. For that reason the Minister has our support.  I am not trying to raise scares; I am trying to be analytical and say with conviction that we believe the privileges accorded to representatives should be in accordance with the spirit of the original <Col N="108" /> Vienna Convention.  A member of the Opposition does not have the resources available to him to undertake investigations to establish breaches but there is a common knowledge&mdash; I am not talking specifically of this country now&mdash;that it would be very unusual if there were not within the diplomatic representations of the major powers here people whose main concern was not to better relations between Ireland and the major powers, but rather to vindicate themselves by reference to special Secret Service activities in which they engage in these countries.  That is regrettable but it is one of the reservations I have about persons and the extension under this.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear from the Minister if there is any indication that there will emerge under the Lomé Convention a structure which would qualify under the organisation as set out originally in the Act and which would enable us in special circumstances to amend or delete this portion which has now been added and which is necessary for the purpose mentioned by the Minister.</P>
    <P>A brief perusal of the original Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act indicates that where possible, one does and should identify the organisations to whom this privilege is being accorded.  It is no harm to give an indication of the nature of such organisations and to read them out as defined in section 16.  These are the organisations to which Part IV of the Act applies: the World Health Organisation, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the International Labour Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Monetary Fund, the Universal Postal Union, the International Telecommunication Union, the World Meteorological Organisation, the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultation Organisation, the International Finance Corporation, the International Development Association. There are other organisations <Col N="109" /> of which we have been a member for some time and which are better known to us in international relations, such as the Council of Europe, and the special provisions for that are related here.  Part VI of the Act deals with the European Council for Economic Co-operation and Development.  Part VII of the Act deals with international councils.  Therefore it seems that the ideal thing is to identify the organisations with which we are concerned, and I would be happy if it would be possible in future to do that.</P>
    <P>There is no activity before this House which we more fully support than that which is promoted under the Lomé Convention.  There are no persons or bodies to whom we would more readily accord the privileges of diplomatic immunity than those persons and bodies operating under that convention.  While I may have used the occasion to make some other references, it is only because of the general extension and the nature of the extensions that have become necessary. I should like the Minister to indicate if some institution will come into being which will enable us to specify the particular organisation here, and in my view having had only a limited period to look at this legislation, enable us at some time in the future, to delete, by way of amendment, this particular amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise it is unsatisfactory for the Opposition that the text of the Bill was available to them only last night.  The difficulties arose for several reasons.  First of all, a doubt existed initially as to whether in fact legislation was necessary.  The reason it is necessary is that on reflection it emerged that the European Communities Act does not cover this matter in part at any rate because the provisions of the Lomé Agreement cover matters outside strict Community competence, for example, aid. Therefore it was necessary to establish if there was a need for legislation or whether the European Communities Act covered it or not, and this involved a difficult legal point which had to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> Secondly, even if legislation was needed, a question arose whether legislation had to be introduced in advance of ratification or whether one could ratify with a slight reservation or a declaration and legislate subsequently, which would have enabled us to ratify earlier and leave the legislation over so that it was not handled in a rushed way.  This, it was eventually established at discussions in Brussels would not have been acceptable for a reason which, I think, is partly political rather than strictly legal, that there was a danger that if EEC countries ratified with reservations, even in our case, of an entirely technical character, this could have provided a precedent for other countries, ACP countries, to ratify with reservations of a much more significant character.  It was only when the political objection, if I may call it that, to proceeding in that manner became clear, that the need for legislation arose.  The third reason was that, as the House is aware, another Bill is before the House, which we shall be dealing with shortly, and a question arose as to whether the two Bills should be one or two and a question also arose as to whether other matters unconnected with Lomé should or could be dealt with under the other Bill.  These are all considerations which delayed action on this and have led to the unsatisfactory position that the Deputy did not have the Bill before him until last night, and I very much regret that the cumulative effect of these was to produce that result.</P>
    <P>I shall not develop the theme the Deputy spoke on recently, the possibility of people with diplomatic privileges abusing them.  This possibility clearly exists.  There is evidence that in parts of the world at certain times this has happened.  If there was ever evidence of this happening here we would take the obvious and appropriate action in regard to it, but I would hope we would never have to face that situation.</P>
    <P>As far as this Bill is concerned, the probability is somewhat remote, because there are unlikely to be any permanent representatives of the organs of the Lomé Convention here anyway; and indeed it would only be <Col N="111" /> rarely that officials covered by diplomatic immunity or parliamentary representatives would be visiting here.  In fact, when I raised the question as to whether, as I said, we had to have legislation before ratification, given the improbability of a situation arising that somebody would be here and park his car in the wrong place or do something like that, legislation was thought to be necessary.  I do not think the broader question raised by the Deputy arises on this Bill, but it is something which in other contexts we have to keep an eye on.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked whether I thought that an organisation might emerge from the Lomé Convention which would render superfluous this provision here.  I do not think that will happen.  The Lomé Convention, being a successor agreement to the Yaoundé Convention and several agreements of this kind, has evolved in negotiations between the Community and a growing number of countries in Africa, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific.  A feature of the development of this arrangement between the Community in its original smaller form and these other countries, and now the enlarged Community and the wider number of countries, has been a movement away from too close an association in both the general and the proper sense of the word &ldquo;association&rdquo; between Europe and these countries.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the old arrangement under the Yaoundé Convention was known as an association and the organs were referred to as organs of the association, although I do not think that organisation, as it existed, constituted an organisation in the proper sense of the word.  There was this concept of an association.  A feature of this agreement has been the disappearance of this word.  Although a number of our partners in the Community were anxious that it should be kept, there was a very strong sentiment amongst the ACP countries, and particularly among the new members on the ACP side, that the word &ldquo;association&rdquo; should not be used and that the relationship between these countries <Col N="112" /> and the EEC should not be described as one of association.  They wished it to be a more general and looser arrangement.</P>
    <P>Some of them saw in the word &ldquo;association&rdquo; some vestige of neocolonialism, perhaps, and one of the features of the negotiations was their rejection of the use of this word.  So, in fact, the movement is away from a rather close integration which theoretically could have become closer and developed towards an organisation.  It is away from that towards a looser relationship. I do not see any likelihood that the EEC and ACP countries together would come to constitute an organisation as such.  If anything, the movement is in the other direction.</P>
    <P>Not only is the Bill necessary, but it is likely to remain necessary for reasons which I must say I can appreciate. I can understand the feelings of these countries.  I was not disposed as Irish Foreign Minister to press them on this issue of the word &ldquo;association&rdquo;, although it was something which our partners thought important and which I had to raise as President of the negotiations.  I do not think the evolution will be in that direction.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke of the desirability of identifying the organisation.  I was not quite sure what he meant.  At present there is not an organisation to identify.  If he means the organs or persons in question, of course these will have to be identified within the order to be made.  The procedure laid down here is entirely within the framework of the original Act, but allows for the situation where there is not an organisation but where there are people who have to be covered by diplomatic privilege.  Because we cannot exclude the possibility&mdash;although there is no immediate likelihood of it &mdash;of other arrangements similar to this being entered into between the Community and countries in other parts of the world, it seemed better to draft the Bill in general terms, rather than to relate it specifically to the Lomé Convention.</P>
    <P>Of course, in every instance the Dáil will have an opportunity to approve the international agreements which will give rise to the need for these immunities and, following that, <Col N="113" /> it will have an opportunity to seek to annul an order made which must, of its nature, specify the organs or persons to be covered by diplomatic immunity.  These safeguards will ensure against any possibility of abuse, and ensure that the Dáil has its proper role in determining whether it wishes to accept agreements of this kind, or whether it wishes under these agreements to extend diplomatic immunity to the persons or organs in question.</P>
    <P>These seem to me to be the main points raised in the discussion.  If there is anything I have overlooked, or any other points which the Deputy would like to raise, I should be happy to deal with them.  I think I have dealt with the points raised.  I should like to thank him for his courtesy in facilitating us on this matter.  It is of practical importance because if, as we understand to be the case, the Italian Parliament, even in the absence of a Government, holds the necessary emergency session to carry through the necessary legislation and to ratify it by the end of the month, had we failed to do so, the coming into force of the convention would have been held up for a month.  It is not just a question of a day, or a few days. It comes into force on the first day of the second month after ratifications have been completed.  So there is a practical issue of a whole month involved here.  As the Deputy said, we would prefer to have been among the first to ratify.  We certainly did not want to be the last, and we certainly did not want to be the last holding up the coming into force of the convention. That is why it was necessary to proceed in this way.</P>
    <P>There is one final point which, perhaps, I might make.  The need for this legislation derives from the fact that the convention covers matters outside the strict Community competence. Because of the fact that our European Communities Act is very tightly drawn, we require legislation. I understand that the British Act is more generously worded, despite the greater hesitations of the British Parliament and people in the matter of EEC membership.  It enables the British Government to act by order. They do not require legislation.  The <Col N="114" /> vigilance of Parliament here, the representations of the then Opposition in the debate on the European Communities Bill, and the willingness, be it said, of the Government of the day to facilitate the Opposition in ensuring that Bill was tightly drawn, all that happened four years ago, made this legislation necessary.  This is an indication of the way in which the vigilance of Parliament ensures that Parliament in the long run has more work to do.  Perhaps that is not a bad thing and it is better that we should ensure that Parliament has tight control in these matters.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Under the Lomé Convention there are organs, such as a Committee of Ministers and the Consultative Assembly, on which all the EEC states and ACP states will be represented, but there is no organisation as such of which all the states or their Governments become members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume by that he means all the states both of the European Community and the ACP.  The ACP would be an organisation within the terms of the diplomatic relationship, I presume.  That being so, in so far as we would be according diplomatic protection, as we have accorded it, either to the European Community, the agencies and officials of the Community, or the members of the European Community in their individual rights, is it just possible that what we could do under this is simply to extend the privilege to the organisations known as the ACP states rather than trying to say that because there is no permanent structure for ACP and the European Community together, we cannot extend the privilege to that structure which does not <Col N="115" /> exist?  Quite frankly, this is top of the head with me at this stage and I do not expect a top of the head response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always a danger, as the Minister said, about legislation coming in as quickly as this without the adequate notice which we all recognise is necessary.  The Minister referred to the European Communities Act for which we can all take special credit, and more notably the Government who introduced it.  Anyone looking at that Act knows immediately what it represents.  The Bill has no reference at all to the Lomé Convention, or to the organisations, or to the European Community and the ACP states.  It simply seems, on the face of it, to any student of legislation, to extend the scope of the designation under section 42 of the original Act to persons where that was not previously possible.</P>
      <P>Drawing on the Minister's analogy about the nice type of legislation we have in the European Communities Act, it might be desirable too that there should be some way of identifying this Bill so that it will be clearly seen to relate to the associations of the European Community and the ACP states under the Lomé Convention. They are not strong reservations but they are the kind one could develop with greater conviction if one had an opportunity of looking into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the second point, it is inherent in the nature of the decision to make the Bill a general one, capable of application to other instances, that the Bill cannot refer to the Lomé Convention.  Either it seeks to limit itself to the particular task to hand or it is to be drafted in a general way, as we have drafted it, in case similar issues arise and to avoid the need to come to the House again in those circumstances.  If one chooses to do the latter, as we have chosen to do, and cautiously because of the possibilities of the future then the Bill is <Col N="116" /> necessarily general in character and there is no way in which one can bring the Lomé Convention into it without making it specific and thereby undermining the purpose of making it general.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that there is a contradiction in terms there and one has to do one thing or the other.  The Deputy may well argue that we should stick to the Lomé Convention at this stage and let other things take their course.  He could argue that there is no imminent probability of a similar relationship with other states and that we should wait to see if that will happen, but I think it is better to provide for it in this way.  Once we decide to provide for it in that way we can not work the Lomé Convention into the Bill as such.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised the question as to whether the ACP states are an organisation.  I am in doubt about this.  It is possible that they are not but it is a legal point and one which would be interesting to debate but it might have to be decided in The Hague or somewhere like that.  I am not sure what would determine what is an international organisation.  There are many loose comings together of countries and this is particularly true amongst the developing countries who come together on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. They may have a secretariat but are they an organisation?  I know one such grouping of countries in the developing world in respect of which it was not possible for us to discover who held the presidency of it, what were the rules for the presidency or how long the presidency lasted.  The countries concerned, including a country which was reputed to hold the presidency, were not in a position to indicate to us what the position was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the kind of international organisations which the Deputy listed as being in the original Bill there is great precision and legal detail and things being tied down tightly so that we know where we are but there are organisations, loose associations of countries, which are more vague and it would be hard to say what constitutes an organisation in that respect.  In the case of the ACP states they came together <i>ad</i><Col N="117" /><i>hoc</i> for this negotiation.  At the time they came together great doubts were expressed as to whether they could come together and stick together.  Some of us urged them to do so and they did with remarkable success despite the great divergence of individual interests. The fact they did stick together was what made this regulation worth while and to ensure it was a success.  They stuck together as an <i>ad hoc</i> group for this purpose.  I am not sure, therefore, whether ACP is an organisation and I am not sure how one could legally determine whether it is an organisation or not.</P>
    <P>Whether it is or not is irrelevant in the sense that section 40 of the Act under which one can designate international organisation, community or body for the purpose of giving these immunities, applies only to bodies of which we are a member.  Even if the ACP States were to be defined as an organisation it still would not come under section 40 because we do not belong to it and are unlikely to.  We have heard of another nearby country thinking of joining a foreign organisation some distance away but whatever about that happening it is unlikely that we would join the ACP States.  The need for legislation arises because of a defect in the 1967 Act.  When I say defect I do not say it by way of criticism of those who introduced it.  When I debated it in the Seanad it never struck me, and I can understand why it did not strike the Government, that the case we are now facing would arise.  It is a lacuna in the Act for reasons that are understandable but it is one that has to be filled somehow by legislation.  That cannot be done by order because we are not a member of ACP, even if ACP is an organisation. The legislation is necessary and this form of legislation, although on the face of it it does not tell people why it was necessary when introduced, gives us the possibility of dealing with similar cases in the future with all due safeguards for the Dáil which will have to approve the agreement in question and will have the opportunity of annulling any order made under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The second aspect of the ACP-EEC Convention of Lomé and its related internal agreements for which specific legislative authority was found to be necessary is the obligation upon the State to enter into contracts of guarantee with the European Investment Bank as provided by Article 9 of the Internal Agreement on the Financing and Administration of Community Aid. Under this article, member States of the Community undertake to act as guarantor for the bank, in proportion to their contributions to its capital, in respect of all financial commitments arising for its borrowers out of the loan contracts concluded by the bank.  This guarantee is restricted to 30 per cent of the total credits opened by the bank under the loan contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> Ireland's share of the capital of the European Investment Bank is 15 million units of account (u.a.) out of a total of 2,025 million ua, or 0.74 per cent approximately.  Under the convention and internal agreement it is proposed that the bank should provide loans amounting to 400 million ua.  As the guarantee by the member States is restricted to 30 per cent of this amount the contracts of guarantee to be concluded by Ireland would be in respect of 0.74 per cent or 120 million ua, for example, 888,000 ua, or approximately £500,000 at the current value of the unit of account.  This is, of course, the cumulative liability in respect of the totality of loans to be made by the bank for the duration of the convention. Under the Bill now before the House, it is provided that any payments to be made on foot of the contracts of guarantee will be made out of the Central Fund.  However, as these loans will be made for productive purposes, repayment problems are not envisaged. I am advised that no such problems have ever arisen in the case of previous conventions.</P>
    <P>The ACP-EEC Convention of Lomé (Contracts of Guarantee between State and European Investment Bank) Bill, 1976, is designed to empower the Minister for Finance to fulfil the obligations undertaken by this country under Article 9 of the internal agreement. For the reasons I mentioned earlier in relation to the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities (Amendment) Bill, it is desirable that Ireland should be in a position to ratify the Convention of Lomé as soon as possible. I would therefore ask the House to approve the Bill now before it as a matter of priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>For the same reasons as I mentioned in accepting the urgency of the last Bill, we also give this Bill a rather speedy passage. I would hope that in view of what has happened this evening, when we have had two Bills which are of their nature so urgent, the legal advisers to the Department would give a little more thought in future to what is involved in our obligations under these conventions and would <Col N="120" /> adequately notify us in advance. I always find myself somewhat compromised in a situation of this nature when I find the purposes so clearly indicated by the Minister, who has asked for an immediate response from this side, and I find it rather difficult to give that response because our obligation and function here is to examine legislation, and it is not possible to do that adequately at such short notice.  This Bill might be more appropriate to the Department of Finance than Foreign Affairs and possibly it is our spokesman on Finance who should be dealing with it.</P>
      <P>I have one query.  The Minister may or may not have satisfied himself on this and the effect of my query may be helpful to what we both want. He said that under the Bill now before the House it is provided that any payments to be made on foot of the contracts of guarantee will be made out of the Central Fund.  If that event arises will that mean it will be in addition to the payments which the Minister would normally make through his Department?  To the extent that it will be, I welcome it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It seemed more sensible for me to take both Bills than to have the Minister for Finance coming in on one of them, they are so closely linked.  It is the Department of Finance who are concerned with this one.  The only burden that could arise here would be in the event of default, which has been shown to be highly improbable.  The Deputy said he would welcome any additional moneys that might be paid out.  I do not think we should welcome the possiblity <Col N="121" /> of default and I doubt if that was what the Deputy intended.  I know that what he meant was that any additional contributions we could make should be made.  The Deputy will find when he looks through the Estimates that there is provision in the international Co-operation Vote for a sum of £1 million designed to cover principally our obligation under the Lomé Convention&mdash;our obligations other than this contingent obligation. This seems more appropriate out of voted moneys, I understand, than from the Central Fund.  As the Deputy is aware, some of the forms of development aid which we are concerned with are paid from the Central Fund and it is thought proper, for reasons which are complex and which I am not at the moment briefed to explain in detail, that the basic aid should be given from voted moneys. The Deputy will find that this £1 million is somewhat greater than we had estimated to be required in the present year for the Lomé Convention but there may be other obligations of aid, arising from the EEC membership payable from voted moneys rather than the Central Fund.</P>
      <P>I might add that I hope we will have a chance to discuss this in the House before long under some heading or another and that the Deputy will find when the full financial provisions are announced that we have met our obligations under the medium term commitment we entered into. The increase in total aid this year is something greater than that required by the formula and therefore to some extent we have caught up part of the shortfall of last year and there is no question of falling further behind.</P>

      <P>I was making the point that I was pleased with Deputy O'Malley's argument in relation to the Prisons Act, which was repeated by Deputy Andrews.  He made the argument that when he was piloting that Bill through the House the Opposition insisted on a time limit being put on it, and he pointed out how unwise it was of the then Opposition because the then Opposition finding themselves in Government had to come before the House seeking an extension.  I agree entirely with Deputy O'Malley and accept his strictures that a suggested time limit was unwise.  I entirely agree with Deputy O'Malley that it is by experience we have to learn.  It is a lesson that could be applied to this Bill.  It would be unwise to attempt to put a time limit on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> Deputy Haughey made the point that the Law Enforcement Commission report talked of a limited measure and that implicit in that report was the meaning that the Bill should be of a limited nature.  Deputy Haughey interpreted that to mean limited in point of time, among other things.  It would be fair to say that the report of the Law Enforcement Commission also spelled out and recommended that there should be extraterritorial jurisdiction and recommended also the taking of evidence on commission in criminal cases.  Of course, they had good legal principles on which to base those recommendations, which are the ones now translated into this Bill.  But it is straining the wording of the commission's report to suggest that &ldquo;limited&rdquo; in the sense in which it was used by the commission could refer to placing a time limit on the operation of the Bill.  I think they used &ldquo;limited&rdquo; in the context of the emergency situation with which they were asked to deal and for which they were asked to suggest a solution, it being part of the emergency on this island arising out of terrorist activities, chiefly in the North and partly in the South.  In that sense, it was a limited solution to deal with that emergency but not limited in time, because the only limitation in regard to time is the length of the emergency.  That is what must be the limiting factor in the context of time.</P>
    <P>That is why I am not disposed to accept these amendments.  I think that the proper limitation in terms of time is the ending of the emergency, when the need for this legislation will have disappeared.  This legislation is needed to deal with the emergency we have at present.  When that emergency disappears, the need for an amount of legislation will disappear because the Special Court will disappear.  That is the ending that would be relevant. That is the time criterion that would be relevant in this context.  With respect, I think Deputy Haughey was straining the wording of the report of the Law Enforcement Commission when he suggested that it could be interpreted <Col N="124" /> as lending weight to the arguments of the Opposition for a specific time limit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey also criticised the criterion of the end of the Special Court as being the limiting factor on the operation of this legislation.  If I did not misunderstand him&mdash;he can correct me on this&mdash;I understood him to say that I was, in fact, making a double-edged argument.  I was saying that, when the Special Court falls to be disestablished, this legislation, in so far as the commission procedure is concerned, will fall also because it cannot be operated without the existence of the Special Court.  Of course, it will be an action of the Government that will end the courts operation, because an order disestablishing it will have to be made.  But it is circumstances, circumstances pertaining to this island at the particular time which will determine whether that order is to be made.  Any Government in power, no matter from which side of the House, would be only too anxious to disestablish that court and to see the day come when it could be disestablished. I am sure it is not suggested that a Government would wish to continue that court in order to keep the provisions of section 11 in being because, if the circumstances are such that the court can be disestablished, then the circumstances will be such that the problem of the fugitive offender will be with us no longer.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Members of the Opposition accept and praise the provisions in the Bill amending the substantive criminal law.  I take the point, and I concede that it would have been perhaps nicer to have had a special Bill for that purpose.  This vehicle was available and the amendments were highly desirable.  It would have been wrong to put them off until we had an opportunity of having a special Bill. My experience of initiating legislation is to seize the opportunity when it comes.  It is in that context that these amendments to the criminal law are made in this Bill.  I am gratified that they are accepted and, indeed, welcomed because, when this Bill was first published, many commentators seized on these substantive amendments of <Col N="125" /> the criminal law and criticised them as being repressive and Draconian, whereas they are not.  They tidy up the criminal law and make it applicable to the requirements of the age.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the prudent time limit on this Bill is not some arbitrary date, whether it be six months, a year, 18 months, or even two years.  I am satisfied that, having regard to the need for which this Bill has been introduced, the time limit is the ending of that need.  That can be established by the ending of the Special Criminal Court.  We will all know when the emergency on this island has ended and when the need for this type of legislation has ended.  That is when the Bill will end.  That is already written into the Bill.  That is as it should be.  To suggest or prescribe what must be an arbitrary time limit would be wrong.  Again, I would refer to the arguments made by Deputy O'Malley to reinforce that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister is not prepared to accept my amendment.  There are a few points I may have overlooked when I spoke initially.  It is a very dangerous precedent to introduce, shall we say, emergency legislation like this and to use that opportunity to bring about major changes in the substantive law.  It is a bad atmosphere in which to discuss this, because it should be part of a comprehensive Law Reform Bill. Major changes in the law should not be discussed with this measure and I cannot accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Changes in the substantive law should be discussed on their merits, debated and introduced irrespective of this measure.  I should not like to be associated with any use of emergency legislation like this to bring about such changes.  We could readily introduce the necessary legislation within a year or two years as is envisaged. There is nothing at all to prevent the Department of Justice from investigating this, introducing such separate legislation and debating it on its own merits.  I am not saying that the changes proposed in this Bill are wrong.  But I am saying we should not discuss them in a highly emotive atmosphere like this, when we talk <Col N="126" /> about the North, bombers and terrorists.  It is very wrong to do so. There are many dangers in changes in substantive law we should like to debate and argue on their own merits. Because of that, I cannot see the logic in the Minister's statement that this is the time to introduce it.  I say it is not the time to introduce it and it should be brought in as a separate Bill for discussion.</P>
    <P>If we are not careful, we will get an erosion of our liberties, our rights and so on under the guise of a Bill introduced for an emergency.  We had a declaration of emergency in this country by way of a temporary Bill in 1939 or 1940 which is still on the Statute Books 35 or 36 years later. That is very dangerous.  There are tremendous powers enshrined in that emergency Bill <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Constitution. The powers granted in that Bill, in that emergency, supersede all other laws.  It is a very serious matter.  I cannot accept that this Bill will disappear automatically.  We will not have the North and its problems with us forever.  To my way of thinking, that is the suggestion of the Minister, that this must be permanent because the problem will always be with us. My argument is that it will not.  I think we will come around to a situation in which people will see the logic of having an ordered society.  I do not think this is the answer to it.  We should legislate for that situation.  If it continues, there is nothing to prevent us introducing appropriate legislation. We are a democratic institution. We can introduce any legislation at any time and have it debated here.  We may have a completely different situation in a year or two years' time.  We could debate it then but I am very loath to give Ministers, or the Oireachtas, powers like these. The Minister says that prisoners going into custody in the North will be guaranteed immunity with regard to questioning and interrogation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned this.  The SDLP rejected the RUC.  That is the first point.  They say they are a discredited force.  We will <Col N="127" /> be handing over to them certain persons; we will give those persons into the custody of what the SDLP say is a discredited force.  I wonder what has happened to that discredited force since the security forces in the North were brought before the European Court which has changed them? Has there been a Bill of Rights in the North?  Has everything altered?  I do not think so.  Of course, there is terrorism and we have done nothing to bring about a proper state in the North acceptable to all.  All we are doing is bringing in this repressive legislation.  Can the Minister tell me there is a restructured RUC?  It is not restructured.  Far from it.  Yet the Minister says we have absolute guarantees. Guarantees given by whom? Britain gave guarantees for 50 years in the North but those guarantees counted for nothing where civil liberties were concerned.  That is the situation that developed.  What guarantee has the Minister got if he sends someone into the custody of the security forces in the North?  Of course, we have bombers and anarchists and terrorists. We also have people who have not been found guilty of any offence who will be handed into the custody of forces about whom the Minister will give guarantees.  I cannot accept that unless the Minister can tell us that this is acceptable to both the majority and the minority in the North and acceptable to the parties representing the minority.  If we have that guarantee, then by all means hand them into the custody of the security forces but, until we have that guarantee, I have grave doubts about all this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important matter. We are talking about security forces and we are making sure everything will be all right.  It is nonsense to say everything is all right.  It is not all right.  We should be pressing the British Government for a restructured security force to make this acceptable. When we do that we can be logical and give guarantees, but we cannot give guarantees at the moment. We must have some time limit.  Everything has a time limit.  The amendment asks for one year.  At the end <Col N="128" /> of the year the position can be reviewed and we can discuss the matter all over again.  If the situation worsens, we can bring in more legislation to deal with it.  I cannot accept the argument that this is a good time to make changes in substantive law.  Hitler convinced the German people it was a good time to make changes in substantive law and that proved a most dangerous exercise for democracy.  I would not like to be assosiated with legislative measures on the basis that we will change them when the opportunity calls for change.  I prefer to discuss changes in substantive law on their own merits.</P>

Remember, their unwritten Constitution gave guarantees <Col N="130" /> with regard to civil liberties and civil rights throughout the United Kingdom. The British gave these guarantees. Were the British able to enforce those guarantees of civil rights in the North for the past 50 years, civil rights that are included in their unwritten Constitution?</P>

      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the position.  What we must guarantee here is that a person going to the North will be immune from civil or criminal process so that all that will happen is that he will attend at the commission, listen to the evidence and return here.  That is what we wish to achieve but if it is not achieved the arrangement ends.  It is in ease of the other jurisdiction that this operation should continue.  So one must assume that they will ensure that the immunity they have provided for will be honoured.</P>

      <P>In those circumstances what means have we of getting the necessary information from the accused in the North?  Must we go through a long process of taking evidence from him or how do we decide whether any statement he makes is correct? Do we send our people up North for the purpose of such an investigation?</P>

Also, I might ask how long any process of investigation would take.  Might it not be drawn out over a long period and might there not be as many as 20 accusations to be investigated?  In the meantime do we continue to send more accused persons up North or will it be the position that on receipt of the first complaint, we call a halt to the sending of any other accused persons to that jurisdiction?  Any investigation of a complaint could take as long as a year.  In the meantime would the reciprocal arrangement be discontinued?</P>

      <P>The reciprocal arrangement is in the British Act.  The point about the investigation is that if a complaint is made, it is investigated by the Garda here.  I could not describe in precise detail at this stage the mechanics of any such investigation. It would depend on the facts of the situation and I would be prepared to rely on the good sense of the authorities here to enable them to judge whether the complaint was, <i>prima facie,</i> well-founded.  If it was considered to be well-founded, I can assure the Deputy that nobody else would be allowed North.</P>

      <P>If a person who is accused is delivered into the custody of the RUC and if, on his return he has complaints to make to the Garda, how are the Garda to investigate these complaints?  The accused may not be able to express himself very well. Can the Garda go up North for the purpose of any such investigation and, <Col N="132" /> if so, who do they investigate there? Alternatively, do they write to the chief constable informing him of the complaints they have received to which they might receive a reply informing them that there was no foundation for the accusations?  What is involved here is the question of civil rights.  The liberty of the individual is of the utmost importance.  I uphold the premise that a person is innocent until proved guilty.</P>
      <P>In the event of a person not being able to express himself very well, the Garda might take the attitude that he had no complaint to make.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that the Garda will be able to assess the accuracy or otherwise of any complaints.  I could not support that sort of situation.  I shall not support it.  We are enacting laws that will affect people's rights and we should be able to guarantee those rights.  Britain was very quick to bring their Doctor Cassidy case before the UN Commission but did not bring any of the Northern Ireland cases of torture before that Commission.  I am no Republican but I am very concerned with the question of rights. What we are doing here is taking a lot on face value and this concerns me greatly.</P>

      <P>The Garda have not the evidence at their disposal to allow them to assess the veracity or otherwise of complaints.  Neither have they the means of investigating such complaints unless we provide the means by which they could go to the North and interrogate those persons there who are accused of ill-treating someone from this part of the country.

I would have complete confidence in their judgment and discretion and in their <Col N="133" /> experience of investigating such matters.  In the event of a complaint being made, obviously what would happen would be that facilities would be sought to investigate it and, if these were not forthcoming, the complaint would have to be regarded as well-founded, and, then the reciprocal arrangement would have to be ended.  On the other hand, if the facilities for investigation were afforded and if, after investigation, a report was made and considered by the Government, a decision would be reached as to whether the complaint was well-founded.  If it was considered to be well-founded, the reciprocal arrangement would come to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>As a non-lawyer perhaps my reasoning is somewhat irrational but I am entitled to my method of reasoning.  The provision to which the Minister has referred should be incorporated in the Bill.  I am not casting any aspersions on the Garda although that was what the Minister inferred.  All I am saying is that they have not at their disposal the means for investigating those complaints by reason of the fact that they have not access to every aspect of a case of accusation of torture or ill-treatment.  Anyone's judgment can be misleading if the necessary information is not at his disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How long would it take for a case to be investigated?  Would the investigation take the form of a letter initially to the chief constable who might reply to the effect that the letter was receiving attention?  If, some time later, there was no further correspondence from the authorities in the North, might it be the case that the Garda would send a reminder to which might be received the reply that the matter was receiving attention and that they would write again in due course?  That sort of situation could continue for a further six <Col N="134" /> months and meanwhile a number of other accused persons could be sent to the North.  The Minister means the best and the intention is good but in practice it is not like that.  Meanwhile, ten others may go up North and the letter we receive does not stop them.  Where is that incorporated in the Bill?  Where is that protection and guarantee?  Let us stop the hypocrisy and talk straight.  We know the way civil servants work&mdash;they have to work like that.  They acknowledge a letter sent to them.</P>
    <P>The situation is that the person concerned may make an accusation against unknown people; he may not have their names and addresses.  He is making accusations without being able to substantiate them with regard to identification.  Will the Garda take him up North and ask him to pick out a person in an identification parade?  I am not a lawyer but I am talking about a matter of common sense.  It may happen that the person accused may be ill and what will happen in that case?  A person from the South would not know where he was taken and his accusation cannot be substantiated because he does not have the names of the people accused. Will the Garda ask him to provide further information?  This is important because they would be obliged to ask that.  I am not casting any aspersions on the Garda but I know of their limited functions in a situation like this.  They would ask for further details.  The situation is that the person is not able to provide more information because he does not know where he was when in the North.  In such an instance will the case be dropped?</P>
    <P>The Minister has given all that he can give but I do not think it is good enough.  We should have further answers and I am going to debate this all night unless we get better answers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The picture the Deputy has painted presupposes that down here all of us are knaves or fools, that we are going to be codded up to our two eyes in the aftermath of a complaint.  It has been implied that when a complaint is made we write a letter, that we get a letter back, <Col N="135" /> that nothing happens for six months but that in the meantime the whole thing goes gaily on and that people are sent North.  I have already said to the Deputy in explicit terms that if such a complaint is made it will be investigated and the facilities to make a full investigation will have to be provided. Pending completion of that investigation, no more people will be sent North.  Obviously, we have to make sure that the guarantees given were not dishonoured and, if we find that they were dishonoured, then the arrangement as regards people going North stops.</P>
      <P>The amount of investigation to be carried out in any particular case so that the complaint can be properly reported on will be for the Garda to decide on the facts alleged in that case. It is rather pointless for us here to be hypothesising all sorts of situations. That is a futile kind of exercise. What we have to do is to be satisfied that the principles are right and I am quite satisfied the principles are right. There is a guarantee of immunity and the sanction to enforce that guarantee is non-operation in the working of the reciprocal arrangement.  If we are satisfied the guarantee is not being honoured in the letter and the spirit, we do not work the arrangement any longer.  To ensure our satisfaction, we will have to be offered and will ask for the fullest facilities necessary to establish the validity or otherwise of any complaint.  If we do not get those facilities, it will be taken as an act of bad faith so as to justify the ending of the arrangement.</P>
      <P>I cannot go into details of imaginary cases at this stage but the Deputy can be quite certain that the position of an accused person in the North will be that he will be guaranteed immunity both in the letter and in the spirit. Should there be any breach of that guarantee&mdash;I would consider a breach of that guarantee a failure to allow full facilities to investigate an allegation of maltreatment&mdash;the Deputy can take it that the reciprocal arrangement will have to be at an end.</P>

Legislating in this House is a very important matter and we must be serious about it.  We are obliged to consider every eventuality and in every Bill, no matter how good, we must consider how it may adversely affect other people.  To my mind the guarantees are not sufficient.  Britain guaranteed freedom of speech and civil rights throughout the United Kingdom.  I do not have to say how bad things were in the North.

That is a guarantee that is given.  The sanction to enforce that is that the jurisdiction which complains of the breach of the guarantee would no longer work the reciprocal arrangement.  That is the sanction and that is the muscle to ensure there is no breach of the immunity.  I am quite satisfied with that muscle.  If there is a breach of immunity, that is the end of it.</P>

      <P>It has been bothering me all night how little the Minister has said.  He has nothing to say to justify this atrocious legislation he is trying to foist on the House.  During this discussion not one Member of his party has shown his face in the House except when I called a House several times.  These are the people who are allegedly backing the Minister. I am totally against the Bill in principle. There is no need to go over that now; there will be plenty of opportunity during discussion of the sections to go over it in detail.  This Bill brings discrimination to a point we have never known on this side of the Border. It has been commended to the House by the Minister with his tongue in his cheek, talking about how satisfied he is with the undertakings he has got.  He knows as well as I do that no matter what any Minister says during the course of the passage of legislation it does not count for anything when it comes to the interpretation of the law as it ultimately goes on the statute book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation, if it is passed as it now is, will be interpreted only in relation to what is in it and not in regard to what the Minister says he believes he is being told by somebody in Westminster or elsewhere.  The Minister is conning the House when he tries to persuade Deputy O'Connell he is satisfied that these undertakings will be kept, that there will be a recognition in spirit in so far as the guarantees of immunity are concerned.  The Minister must think we all came down in the last shower if he thinks that is any guarantee in these circumstances where we will not be dealing with our own judiciary or police force but with those outside this State as now defined. This is a discredited police force, one which has shown over the years that it cannot be trusted, and a judiciary composed of political hacks, who were appointed as such.  To those we may arrest here on the acusation of the police up there we say: &ldquo;Go back up to your accusers.  Go into custody with your accusers.  You are guaranteed immunity, <Col N="140" /> even from questioning and interrogation&rdquo;. The big guarantee we are told, is this.  If this Government are not satisfied that such immunity is granted in law and in spirit to any accused foolish enough to return up there to his accusers, then the whole arrangement will cease to operate until the matter is investigated; or if it is found that such immunity has not been granted and observed in the letter and the spirit then we will cease to operate this reciprocal arrangement altogether.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to talk in those terms.  It is all very well for a member of the Minister's party backing him in the House or any other Member to accept the Minister's assurances on this matter.  But it is the accused person who must accept the Minister's word in this matter.  The accused person has only the Minister's word to accept.  Yet he knows well that time without number our courts interpret the law as it is on the statute book regardless of what any Minister promoting that legislation may have said in the House, regardless of how he may have put a slant on it or how he saw it operating. That does not matter at all.  It is how the judiciary will interpret this legislation in the courts that will matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows this better than I do, because he has been a practising member of the legal profession for many years.  He knows the record of what was said in the House during the passage of any legislation by the Minister promoting it is of no use on behalf of his client unless it is in conformity with what the legal people in our courts and in other courts determine.</P>
    <P>In regard to the accused person who goes back to his accusers and voluntarily hands himself over into their custody, is the Minister really satisfied that this is the <i>quid pro quo,</i> that this matches the situation where we would not have witnesses available to come from the Six Counties into our courts because of their apprehension for their own safety?  They would be apprehensive of coming to our courts to help prosecute a person accused in our courts at their behest and on their evidence.  While they are apprehensive about that, while we are prepared in <Col N="141" /> this House to make special laws to enable them to give their evidence in the Six Counties territory, we say that that is balanced by the accused being given what is his natural right, something that will come to be accepted as his legal right: that he may be present when the evidence is given.  He is guaranteed immunity while in the custody of his accusers.</P>
    <P>This is the most daft situation which ever came before any legislature, never mind here.  The Minister is aware that these people make accusations.  We are prepared to deal with the powers that be in the Six Counties whoever they may be &mdash; we know what they are today and what they were yesterday and we do not like them, but we do not know just who or what they will be tomorrow. We say to them: &ldquo;What you cannot do yourselves, we will do for you.  You make the accusations and the requests here and we will pull them in. We will then go to the Six Counties, sit in your courts and listen to the bribed evidence of your own informers&rdquo;&mdash;it is not beyond them to do that as various reports over the last five or six years have shown.  &ldquo;We will do all that for you because you are afraid to come down here lest something might happen to you.&rdquo;  If we cannot guarantee their safety coming to our courts to give evidence to prosecute those whom they accuse of acts committed in the Six Counties, why should we take away the natural and legal right of an accused person to be present at his own trial, which is, in effect, what we are doing? We are saying to them: &ldquo;You are free to go up there.  In fact, we advocate that you go there, but first you must be handed over in custody to your accusers, to those who hounded you out of the Six Counties and who want to wring your neck.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have been told that this Bill has been copperfastened and is to be accepted and believed because the Minister has been assured by some person or persons, through the agency of the British Government, that they &mdash; the British Government &mdash; will ensure that that immunity is observed in the spirit, in the letter and in the law.  It was asked in the last few minutes who are these <Col N="142" /> people who are giving these assurances which the Minister is passing secondhand to this House.  None other than the British Government who have taken over part of our country and held it in bondage down the years, who have given guarantee after guarantee and reneged on every guarantee so far as the minority are concerned.  These are the people whose word we are now taking.  We are attempting to do their dirty work for them and give it a gloss it would never have if they tried to do it themselves in their own courts with trumped up evidence, informers' information and paid witnesses to give evidence to make the charge stick.</P>
    <P>Are the people who were put behind bars, the hundreds who suffered in the internment camps, not the prime examples that we as a Government took issue with the British Government and went to the Court of Human Rights?  If that is the sort of people we were dealing with then &mdash; and there is no reason to believe they are any different today &mdash; surely we are prostituting ourselves in doing this and trying to put a facade on it that because the accusers are afraid to cross the Border to make their own accusations stick, to do their own dirty work, we are going to do it for them and give the accused the right of attending his own trial but in the custody of his accusers. How can there be justice there?  How can there be any faith in the mind of any accused, no matter how innocent he may be, when he is going back to face people who will give evidence on oath before a member of the courts of the Six Counties; people he has probably run from because he knows them?</P>
    <P>This is the situation in which we find ourselves tonight.  Either of the proposed amendments is at least some acknowledgment to the outside world that many of us are totally opposed to the whole idea of this legislation.  Even our Government who are proposing it on behalf of our people are not satisfied that all is well in the Six Counties.  If this Bill is passed as it is, with no strings attached, it is an acknowledgment to <Col N="143" /> the world at large that we in this Parliament acknowledge the justice, the impartiality, the uprightness, the honesty and the fairness of the Establishment in the Six Counties today. We are doing this at a time when we have not yet heard the findings of the court to which we appealed and to which we gave the overwhelming evidence which showed that those who were lifted &mdash; many of them innocent with no charges sustainable against them &mdash; were tortured and died of their torture.  These are the people we are dealing with today but we could be dealing with worse tomorrow because of developments, political or non-political.  We could be dealing with a more diehard extremist outlook in the Establishment than anything we have ever known.  Yet we are trying to get this Bill into legislation without any time limit, regardless of how the situation may change.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to regard the people in the Establishment in the Six Counties as above board, as equal to our judiciary and Garda force. That is why we are trying, even at this late stage, to devise some means whereby, if it must go through by weight of numbers whipped into the lobbies behind the Minister, there is some point in the not-too-distant future when we will either have an opportunity of reviewing it or it will come to an end and if it must be extended, it can be extended only by further legislation and in the light of experience gained in the interim period.</P>
    <P>If the Minister cannot guarantee the safety of the witnesses who come to our courts to help prosecute an accused because of accusations made in the Six Counties, no doubt by the Establishment, why should any citizen of this country, North or South, be handed over to the tender mercies of those same people, those same accusers, in the Six Counties merely because they have not the guts to come into our courts to give their evidence standing up straight and without any hoods on their heads?</P>
    <P>How are we to be satisfied, as Deputy O'Connell asked, that where <Col N="144" /> an allegation is made after such a visit &mdash; if such a visit is ever made to a Six County court to take evidence on commission by an accused &mdash; as to the substance or otherwise of an allegation made by such prisoner while in custody in the Six Counties that he has been ill-treated?</P>
    <P>The Minister said these guarantees of immunity include questioning and interrogation.  Do they include the hooded treatment, the sound treatment, the SI treatment which leave no physical evidence whatsoever? How are we to be satisfied that those who operated such outrages in the past will not do so again to people we hand into their custody for the purpose of appearing at their own trial?</P>
    <P>If we were to write 20, 30 or even 40 more pages into this Bill, it would mean nothing.  There is not even an attempt to write anything into the Bill that anybody could hang his hat on to challenge this matter.  We are to take it by way of assurances given by a Minister &mdash; no doubt in good faith so far as the Minister is concerned.  How far has he been brainwashed?  As a member of the legal profession how can he accept assurances from the people in Britain or their agents in the Six Counties in the circumstances I have outlined?  How can you accept these assurances and try to convince the Members of this House that they should accept these assurances from these people or their agents who have proven over the years that they can never be trusted?  How can we trust them now?</P>
    <P>Why the revised urgency to get this Bill into law?  Why has it ever come before us?  And since it is before us, can the Minister not listen to the common sense of the Opposition who have spoken here tonight and put a limit on the time for which this legislation is to operate?  The Minister should ask himself how he could ever come to the conclusion he has expounded here tonight that assurances from a British Government or their tools in the Six Counties can be relied on.  It absolutely amazes me that a legally trained man like the Minister <Col N="145" /> for Justice could swallow that sort of hogwash and use his undoubted ability and eloquence in this House to try to get it across to those uninitiated in the intricacies of the law and the legal system either here or elsewhere that these verbal assurances spoken here and written into the record of this House are worth the paper they are written on, which he knows they are not.</P>
    <P>The Minister says categorically that if an accused person comes back after one of his safaris to the courts in the North for evidence to be taken against him, and makes a complaint, until such a complaint has been investigated fully and conclusively &mdash; I take it that means to a conclusion whether satisfactory or otherwise &mdash; no further accused persons will be sent up North. In other words, no further cases will attempt to be tried in our Special Court here.  The Minister is saying that if one such case comes back and says: &ldquo;I have been brutally treated&rdquo; in any respect whatsoever, the Minister will set in motion this mystery machinery which to his mind is a satisfactory and full method of investigating the complaint of such an accused, and that until it has done its work to a conclusion there will be no further cases brought before our Special Court at the behest of the authorities in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Such an assurance is not worth the paper it is written on, because it is not the Minister for Justice who will be operating the law.  It will be his Special Court, his special branch, his gardaí and other officers of the law and the judiciary.  They will be operating the law as it emerges from this House on to the Statute Book, disregarding what the Minister or other members of the Cabinet may have said as to the manner in which the machinery will be used.  Therefore, the Minister should not persist in saying that the fears expressed by various Deputies here are unfounded.</P>
    <P>If this is the best the Minister can do by way of assurances, he should drop this Bill altogether.  He should phase its withdrawal as he phased its introduction into this House.  It would be the best thing that ever happened, <Col N="146" /> because if we do not introduce a time limit or provide for a review in a short time ahead, then we are acknowledging as never before the entity known as Northern Ireland and acknowledging as never before the existence of a judiciary in the Six Counties and regarding it as impartial.  Above all, we are giving our stamp of approval to the totally discredited RUC, and we are saying to the British occupation forces, to the special branch, to the SAS and other such kindred spirits who move around the Six Counties and the Twenty-six Counties, as the Minister is, I am sure, aware.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister should be.  These are the people of whom we are saying: &ldquo;We trust you to the extent that we take your evidence in your own courts on commission to prove the case against those whom you accuse but have not been able to catch&rdquo;.  The Minister, in spite of that, is not prepared to put a time limit on the provisions or provide for a review as has been sought in amendment No. 1 put down by Deputy O'Connell or what has been sought in amendment No. 4 in the name of Deputy Gerard Collins which refers to the outrageous sections, Nos. 2, 3, 11, 12, 18, 19 and 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Minister is flying in the face of all the knowledge and evidence over the years when he makes these statements about the effect of the law rather than interpreting in detail what the law will be if this Bill goes through unchanged, and this is what the Minister should and, I hope, will give us in respect of every line of the Bill.  This is what this House is entitled to have from the Minister who is promoting this legislation so that we may examine it, and discuss it, and probe it before it goes further.  Even though we may be totally opposed to it, that does not take from us the right to have every last comma in every line explained by the Minister, as to its legal effects and not as to how he thinks it will operate, or what <Col N="147" /> arrangements he has made for its operation with his counterpart either in the Six Counties or across the water.  That is what we should be talking about rather than what the Minister has been saying here.</P>
    <P>If we wanted any further evidence from the Minister as to the hollowness of his own assurances, what better evidence is there than the fact that it has taken almost five years &mdash; and there is still no conclusion &mdash; to get from the European Court on Human Rights a decision on our accusations against the British about their maltreatment and their malpractices and their abuse of prisoners in their custody and in the custody of the forces in the Six Counties?  If it takes that long to get a decision from the court I have mentioned, how much longer would it take to get satisfaction from the people in the Establishment in the Six Counties, to whom the Minister or the British Minister must have recourse if any investigation is to take place consequent upon an accused person who has been in custody in the Six Counties, but came from our courts, making a complaint when he returns?  What sort of hearing will his allegation get? What sort of investigation can it possibly be given?</P>
    <P>Can the Minister write into this Bill by way of amendment words which will ensure that the assurances he has given will be real so far as such persons are concerned?  Unless he can do that, he is doing a disservice to this House and to the name of this State and the standing of its law.  Nothing he may say as his best belief in any way equates with what should be written into the Bill, if it can be written in.  If it cannot be written in, he should tell that to the House, and tell us the reason why, and he should scrap the Bill which would be the sane and sensible thing to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that the Minister's intentions may be good. When we were in Opposition, and when we were fighting the Forcible Entry Bill, which we fought very <Col N="148" /> vigorously, if I may say so, we got an assurance from the then Minister for Justice that that Bill would not be used against an ordinary homeless person who might squat.  The Minister was in Opposition then too and he was very vocal.  Let us not kid ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>He knows that assurance was given by the Minister. It is on the records of the House.  That Forcible Entry Act is now being used against people who squat.  The Minister's statement in the House counts for nothing.  He said the Forcible Entry Act would be used against subversives. It is now being used against homeless people who find an empty place and squat.</P>
      <P>I was hard on the Minister some time ago but he has not given any satisfactory answers to my questions. He could not substantiate any of his statements.  Does he not think my amendment is reasonable?  I am suggesting that the Bill should be reviewed in a year.  It would expire in one year and we could come back here and have a simple resolution passed by both Houses.  There is nothing wrong with that.  The Minister said he is against the amendment because in the Bill there are changes in the substantive law.  We are prepared to sit extra days if a Law Reform Bill is introduced.  The Minister's parliamentary draftsman could draft one.  I believe we need this protection that the Act will be reviewed in 12 months' time.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister assure us that he will put down an amendment to the Bill building in a safeguard for innocent persons?  People are innocent until they are proved guilty.  Will the Minister provide a proper means for investigating complaints to satisfy my mind and the mind of the ordinary person?  If he could do that, I would be very happy to support him.  He will have to give that assurance.  Otherwise I will vote against him.  I will feel justified in voting against him on this.  He has not given any satisfactory explanations.  He has just said he is satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> If he says he has and can prove he has secret information and assurances from the British Minister and the British Government that is all right. I do not think he has.  He is basing his case solely on the word of somebody up there.  There is no safeguard for persons who make accusations of brutality, ill-treatment or torture.  If the Minister will bring in an amendment to meet my point, I will support him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a point arising out of what the Minister said in reply to Deputy O'Connell.  It seems to me that the Minister has forced himself into an absurd position in attempting to reply to the valid points put forward by Deputy O'Connell.  The Minister is now taking the position that, if any accused who has gone to the North of Ireland for purposes of being present at the taking of evidence on commission, returns and complains about his treatment, that will immediately bring the Bill to a stop, and that nobody else will go North under these provisions until that complaint has been investigated. If we were seeking any evidence at all that this Bill is totally unworkable, that statement by the Minister proves that it certainly would not operate, or that it would operate only for a very short time indeed.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the Minister, I do not think that is what would happen, that once one person made a complaint that the guarantees of immunity had not been adhered to the Bill would come to a complete stop.  I do not think the Bill can come to a complete stop.  It is fallacious for the Minister to make that suggestion to us.  He has argued very trenchantly against Deputy O'Connell on the basis that, at the first element of dissatisfaction that arose here as to this question of the guarantees of immunity, the Bill would cease to operate.  However, statute law does not work that way.  Even if the Minister were totally dissatisfied about the way our witnesses were being treated when they travelled to the North, this Bill would still be on the Statute Book and there would be an obligation on the authorities here to operate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> We have a very conscientious Attorney General at the moment who, because he thought his duty indicated that he should do so, and because he felt the statutory law obliged him to do so undertook a prosecution against some unfortunate family planning association.  The fact that he was laughed out of court did not alter the merits of the case.  I maintain that the Minister cannot give that reply validly to Deputy O'Connell because, no matter what happens in the course of the operation of the Bill, the Bill still remains law.</P>
    <P>If, under sections 2 and 3, someone commits an offence there will be an obligation on the Minister's Department, the Attorney General and the whole legal process here to have a prosecution instituted in those circumstances even though they may be totally dissatisfied about the situation in regard to guarantees of immunity.</P>
    <P>At first sight one would be inclined to take the following words in section 11 at their face value: &ldquo;while he is in custody in Northern Ireland for the purpose of the taking of the evidence, he will be immune from detention and any kind of suit or legal process, in respect of any cause or matter, civil or criminal, arising before his arrival in Northern Ireland for the purpose aforesaid&rdquo;.  If one reads the section more carefully one will see that all that happens is that where a court makes an order under this section it shall inform the accused that while he is in custody in Northern Ireland he will be immune from detention. There is no guarantee in the Bill of anything.  The court here, in making an order to enable an accused to go north to hear evidence, will inform him that this is the position.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell us where the guarantee about which we have heard so much is; where is the guarantee of immunity?  We should be clear about the fact that it is only immunity from detention and any kind of suit or legal process; it is no guarantee of immunity from questioning. That is not in this section although the Minister reads it into it. The Minister has not satisfied anybody in the House that he is justified in <Col N="151" /> reading immunity from questioning into the wording of this section. Section 11 only provides machinery for the taking of evidence and provides an obligation on the court here to inform the accused that he shall be immune.  It is a completely different thing to inform an accused that he shall be immune and guaranteeing him immunity.</P>
    <P>Unless there is something in the British Bill from which this guarantee of immunity can be derived &mdash; if there is the Minister should tell the House about it &mdash; how can our legislation guarantee behaviour by agencies and forces in the North of Ireland?  It cannot and, in fairness to the Bill, it does not purport to.  The Bill just states that the court shall tell the accused something.  As Deputy O'Connell has pointed out there must be some follow up to that; there must be some machinery or agency whereby that guarantee is operative in the North of Ireland. I do not know if it is in the British Bill, and if it is there I should like to hear about it.</P>
    <P>If there is no such immunity anywhere I do not see how any accused person can be expected to go to the North to be present at the taking of this evidence.  If a person cannot go north to be present at the taking of the evidence on commission with absolute immunity then the Bill breaks down and becomes completely unacceptable.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to the equivalent British Bill, the Criminal Jurisdiction Act, 1975, and to paragraph 4 (2) of Schedule 4 which deals with the attendance of an accused.  It states that so long as an accused is in Northern Ireland pursuant to this Part of the Schedule he shall be kept in custody, and that while being kept in custody he shall be immune from arrest or detention, and from any other proceeding whatsoever, related to any criminal or civil matter which arose prior to his arrival in Northern Ireland in custody.</P>

That is what I have been arguing all along, but Deputies on the other side are not prepared to accept this or cannot see it.  Immunity is given and the question then arises of the guaranteeing of that immunity. The immunity is given in black and white in this.</P>

      <P>May I finish?  The immunity is given in the British Bill and I have read out the text granting that immunity.  What now arises is the guaranteeing of that immunity to ensure that the immunity given by the British Parliament is honoured in the spirit and in the letter.  The guarantee is action by this State should it be dishonoured, the action being an ending to the reciprocal arrangements for the taking of evidence outside the jurisdiction.  That is the guarantee.  In other words, the arrangement whereby people are sent to have evidence taken on commission comes to an end; that is the guarantee.</P>

      <P>What the Minister read referred to proceedings relating to something or other, and I should like to know if the Minister is telling us that his interpretation of that, from a legal standpoint, is that it includes questioning, interrogation, hooded treatment and sensory deprivation, which is one of the new ones? Are all these things included and is total immunity guaranteed?  This refers to proceedings.  Surely the proceedings talked about there are legal proceedings, criminal or civil, that might be taken?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister charged Deputy O'Connell with raising a hypothetical situation.  The questions raised by Deputy O'Connell were very practical.  The Minister is the one who is coming back with hypothetical situations.  He keeps relying on the broad statement that the immunity is total.  I have taken a note of the British Act which is almost the same as this Bill, with slight changes in the order of words.  It does not give the total immunity the Minister said it does.</P>
      <P>Let us be frank and face that.  It is immunity from detention, from any suit or legal process, in respect of any cause or matter, civil or criminal, arising before the matter reaches Northern Ireland.  It is immunity from proceedings or detention.  There is no suggestion, and I do not see how the Minister can suggest in this House because he is cornered, that this gives immunity against ill-treatment or against interrogation.  He must know that people have been interrogated before proceedings were instituted, or without any proceedings.  Does it, for instance, give immunity of a kind that will forbid him being left in solitary confinement while he is in custody?</P>
      <P>It is ridiculous for the Minister to say these immunities are there. They are not.  I will come back to what Deputy O'Connell has said.  He asked a practical question.  The Minister had said that where such a complaint arises he would have the matter investigated by the Garda.  Deputy O'Connell asked how.  That is no hypothesis.  What power of investigation have the Garda or can they have or will they have to investigate a complaint and form a conclusion that would satisfy the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question posed by Deputy O'Connell is no hypothesis, but the Minister has left a very hypothetical situation in the air when he comes back to say that he will take a decision as to the continued operability of the Act on the basis of satisfactory <Col N="156" /> investigation by the Garda in a jurisdiction in which they have no control.  What we are trying to do here in the two amendments is to provide that the Act be operative for a period of 12 months so that we who have this responsibility can come back after 12 months and hear the Minister say it has worked or it has not worked because these imperfections were there.  Then we will take the responsibility to extend or to finish the legislation one way or the other.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous for the Minister to say that he will decide on the basis of Garda inquiries, when they have not got the information directly available to them, whether the Act remains operable.  That is not discharging the Minister's function which we are trying to help him to do through these two amendments, both of which are quite clear.  We do not like the Bill, but we are asking that we have a look at it after one year and then let us decide.  In the course of the entire evening the Minister has not argued against the amendments or given one cogent reason why they should not be accepted. There is the suggestion about the Special Criminal Court, that the Act would last only as long as the Special Criminal Court.  That, of course, is nonsense.  That court was in existence long before the Bill came into being and it may be in existence for the purposes of dealing with what is happening in this jurisdiction long after this kind of need is there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy O'Kennedy is saying is that certain consequences might flow from this Bill because the Garda cannot or would not have power to investigate a particular complaint, that there is no mechanism <Col N="157" /> written into the Bill for such investigation. There is not, because the reality of the situation would be that a complaint is made, facilities to investigate it would be requested and, if they are not forthcoming, the complaint stands and that ends the reciprocal arrangements. That is the guarantee.  If these facilities are forthcoming, they will have to be forthcoming to the extent requested, required or needed by the Garda to carry out the investigation to their satisfaction.  I cannot see how putting a time limit of a year on the Bill would improve it if there are all these fears of terrible things happening. If they are to happen they could happen within a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy hear me out?  Does he want to hear me out? If a complaint is made and the facilities are not given or are only partly given, and the investigation drags on, then, should any cases have arisen in the meantime, there will not be the reciprocal arrangements in relation to those until such time as the matter under investigation has been cleared up one way or the other.  A suggestion was made that if the Bill becomes law it will not be possible to postpone it. I am saying it will, because starting proceedings under this Bill involves Executive action on receipt of the book of evidence from the North by the authorities in the South and then its presentation to the prosecution authorities.  The Executive will have power to intervene to ensure that no other cases come for prosecution until such time as any outstanding complaint comes to be cleared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister mean by saying facilities will be made available?  A complaint by an <Col N="158" /> accused to the Garda of ill-treatment in the North while he was in custody there has been made.  The Garda ask for facilities.  Could the Minister elaborate on his statement on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda will have to be afforded the facilities they need to enable them to investigate a complaint, whether by taking statements or by questioning people.  I cannot envisage what the facilities might be until we would know the circumstances of a particular complaint, but the Garda will have to be afforded the facilities they would require to deal with a particular complaint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>If an accused person said he was ill-treated or tortured and he makes a statement to the Garda, that would be the normal procedure. The Minister envisages that he would make a statement to the Garda, that would be the normal procedure, and the Garda would write to the North. Would the Minister say then that facilities would be afforded if the Northern authorities institute investigations in the North?  If they say: &ldquo;We are investigating the matter&rdquo; would that constitute facilities being provided; would that negative the Act?  If they said: &ldquo;Our investigations are commencing&rdquo; and the Minister does not hear further for two months would he consider that would be sufficient to warrant breaking the whole agreement, the reciprocal arrangement with the North?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not necessarily warrant the ending of the arrangement.  What it would do is postpone action under the reciprocal arrangement, pending the completion of the investigation.  It would be a matter for the Garda as to the mechanics and how they would carry out their investigations, and I would leave that to their professional judgment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

The authorities in the North could just as readily sit up all night investigating these, 24 hours of the day, and write back the next day saying: &ldquo;Our investigations are complete; we are satisfied&rdquo;.  How would the Garda know that that investigation was an intensive one and justified a letter from the Chief Constable in the North stating that?

      <P>What we are now debating is the quality, efficiency and sufficiency of the advice the Garda will give to me in a particular case. That is something I do not think one can debate <i>in vacuo,</i> so to speak.  It is something one can assess only in a particular case when the whole thing lands on the desk of the person responsible. I cannot say that, in a particular case, the Garda advice would or would not be taken.  The whole thing would have to be read in the circumstances of that case and considered as a whole.  For me to say &mdash; in the example given by the Deputy &mdash; that the Garda would or would not be satisfied is not appropriate.  I do not know what reaction the Garda would have to any information they might receive.  It would be a matter for them, or whoever would be the competent authority, to come to the Minister with a report and their views on it.  Then a political decision would be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me the Minister is either being very naïve about this or he is saying: &ldquo;There will be no such complaints made so the matter does not arise.&rdquo;  The Minister is naïve to think that the Garda could assess a letter from a Chief Constable stating that. They could not assess that no matter how well trained they were.  One would need to be a Garda Commissioner to make an assessment of a <Col N="160" /> letter saying: &ldquo;We are satisfied there is no substance in the allegations made by such and such a person&rdquo;.  Or the Minister seems to be assured in his mind that everything is so hunky-dorey in the North, that the security forces there are above reproach; that everything brought before the European Commission on Human Rights by this Government was wrong; we must make &ldquo;reparation&rdquo;&mdash;if I may use that word because it is a very important one.  Therefore, we were wrong in our accusations that it was an ill-considered move to make; everything is right in the North; the SDLP are wrong; they are misguided; the security forces are normal, it is a properly structured force acceptable to everyone; these accusations made over the years are wrong, there will be no question whatsoever about ill treatment, brutality, torture, interrogation in depth, call it what you like. That is what the Minister is saying.</P>

      <P>I should like to take the Minister upon a point he made just before the adjournment.  I had said that the reason why &mdash; if the Government were insisting on this Bill &mdash; the Opposition were seeking a time limit on specific aspects of the Bill specified in the sections referred to in amendment No. 4 put forward by Deputy G. Collins was because I doubted if, in the current situation, individuals would voluntarily submit themselves to the custody of Northern security authorities.  In answering that the Minister said, I think, that the sort of people who would not want to surrender to the custody of the Northern authorities would be the sort of people who were guilty of very grave offences.  I think the Minister used the word &ldquo;savages&rdquo;.  I think Deputy Haughey agreed with him in regard to the particular type of offence.</P>

      <P>I intended putting a question to the Minister regarding <Col N="161" /> the Schedule to the Bill before we took this amendment because it is a very broad Schedule.  But, in the course of the past 15 minutes, the Minister has said that the procedure under this Bill will be that the Executive will decide on prosecutions sought, I presume, by the Northern authorities.  The words he used were &ldquo;the Executive can intervene&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister mean that the Government here will decide, on this very broad Schedule, whether a prosecution sought by the Northern judicial authorities will be based on some criterion?  If so, I think we should know what.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the question of Excutive intervention in the context of the reciprocal arrangement coming to a standstill in the course of investigation of a complaint made by a person who had gone North in custody.  The Deputy can take it there would be no intervention in regard to what prosecutions would or would not be mounted in the normal operation of the arrangements. It would be only in the usual instance of there being a complaint investigated with regard to infringement of the immunity that the Executive would intervene to call the arrangement to a halt and ensure that no books of evidence coming down from the North were acted on pending that investigation.  In the normal way, the books of evidence would be dealt with by the law officer, who would assess them in the same way as the book of evidence coming to him in the ordinary way.  He would assess that book of evidence, draw up the indictment on foot of it and give directions for prosecutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it will not, Deputy.  What will happen is that <Col N="162" /> there will be a person in this jurisdiction against whom allegations are being made; he will be alleged to have committed an offence in the other jurisdiction.  In the normal way the book of evidence will be prepared &mdash; it will have to be prepared in the other jurisdiction because that is where the offence was alleged to have been committed and that is where the evidence will be available.  That book of evidence will be submitted to the police authorities here who, in turn will submit it to the law officer concerned, who will then assess it. The law officer here will then decide whether or not a prosecution lies. If a prosecution lies, he will also decide what are the charges and he will frame the indictment in the normal way as if the matter were initiated here.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has cleared up that point. With regard to the question of confidence on the part of an individual in the Northern Ireland security forces and his willingness to surrender himself to them, I believe such confidence cannot be generated by anything that may be said by the Minister, by the Government or by those in Northern Ireland.  It is a question of public belief in the stability or otherwise of the existing situation there.  To generate confidence and enable this Bill to <Col N="163" /> function would require a major political change and that change has not yet taken place.  There are good reasons why individuals might lack confidence in the impartiality of the authorities in Northern Ireland.  There is enough evidence, for example, in the failure of British security there to uphold the Executive in the past 18 months.  There is, too, the case in which the British authorities in regard to an individual sought by them alleged that individual to have been in Britain on a certain date while the Irish security authorities said that on that date they were interviewing the particular person here.  I submit there are good reasons for a lack of confidence in the security authorities. That is one reason why the Opposition are seeking a time limit on the Bill.</P>

On the other hand there have been appeals from a wide spectrum of political, clerical and lay opinion both here and in Northern Ireland for support for the security forces in Northern Ireland, the latest being that made by the Leader of the Opposition in Brussels.  We have to have a balanced approach to this.</P>

Apart from that, the Minister in his reply satisfied Deputy Brugha, but he did not satisfy me, about this question of the Act coming to a stop.  The Minister suggested a very nice, open, honourable process would take place. The book of evidence would arrive from the North and the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions would study it and decide whether or not a prosecution should take place.  That is nonsense.  That is misleading the House.  What would happen would be the book of evidence would be concocted by people about whom we would know nothing and it would be sent down here and if it contained a <i>prima facie</i> case, concocted or otherwise, the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General would have no option but to prosecute.</P>

      <P>He is immune from arrest or detention.  In that context &ldquo;detention&rdquo; means imprisonment or can mean detention of a juvenile in an institution for juveniles.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not confusing anything.  The position is clear.  By definition there is no right to do anything illegal.  Consequently it is not necessary to give immunity against something which there is no right to do.  The distinction here is that the British authorities or the authorities here could have the right to take proceedings, civil or criminal, against a person coming into their custody, but they are prohibited from availing themselves of that right by reason of the guarantees of immunity, and that is what must be provided for.  There is never a right to do anything illegal or extra-legal in respect of a person coming into the jurisdiction, so one does not have to provide against something that is illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>So there is no need for a guarantee against questioning or interrogation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that. Deputy O'Connell may interpret me in any way he wishes but I shall not accept his interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, there is no need for guarantees against torture, <Col N="168" /> brutality or ill-treatment since all of these things are illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for immunity against them since such deeds are already illegal.  We are constantly mixing up immunity and the guaranteeing of immunity.  The law provides immunity against something that is illegal.  The question that arises is the guaranteeing of that immunity. Let not the Deputy mix up the two concepts.  The guarantee of immunity against legal or illegal process is contained in the action that each Government can take against the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it this way: a person is immune from torture, brutality or ill-treatment, and all we are doing is guaranteeing that immunity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say where in the Bill is that guarantee provided for?  Have we anything other than the word of the Minister in Britain?  We must remember that the record to date of those authorities from whom we are taking this written assurance leaves much to be desired.  Would the Minister agree on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The guarantee of the immunity is contained in the fact that if the immunity is not honoured the arrangement will not be operated. That is a mutual guarantee.  If we abuse the immunity we cannot expect co-operation from the other side, and <i>vice versa.</i>  That is the guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this whole thing is one-sided.  Is it not discrimination at its worst?  Regardless of whether we limit the provision or provide for its review after a year, in practice it will operate only in so far as the minority in the Six Counties are concerned and may be used, falsely or otherwise, by the authorities in that part of the country.  There is no question of reciprocity or of the agreement having any meaning in so far as this legislation is concerned.  The whole thing is an empty, useless operation, <Col N="169" /> merely a bit of window dressing to give the impression that the other side are giving us something.  They are giving us nothing.  We are the ones who are giving all and are exposing our citizens to the dangers inherent in sending them up North in order to give them the opportunity of being present at their own trials when evidence is being taken on commission. We are doing this because the accusers are afraid to cross the Border to give evidence here.  Why should we in practice wipe out the absolute right of any person being given every facility to defend himself at his own trial? Telling them that they may be present at the hearing of evidence on commission is not fulfilling that right.  A person who has suffered for many years at the hands of the establishment in the Six Counties or whose family have so suffered, may decide finally to leave and come across the Border, but if he is accused by the authorities there the Minister tells us on the one hand that the process that would go into operation would be something to be determined by our courts while on the other hand he tells us distinctly that the process would be at Executive level.  Which is it to be?  Will the matter be one for the courts or will it be one for the Executive here?  Obviously, it cannot be both.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>To make the distinction for the Deputy&mdash;the legal decision as to whether a prosecution will be taken is for the law officers of the State.  I indicated that there might be Executive intervention in the circumstances where there was a complaint of breach of immunity in the North, where there was bad faith in the operation of the legislation.  In that situation clearly political considerations would come into being.  We would point out to the other authority that this was a reciprocal measure, that until we were satisfied there were clean hands on both sides, the legislation could not be operated down here. In that situation it would be a political intervention, but in the absence of bad faith in the operation of the legislation in the North it would be a routine matter between the law officers.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise the matter of a person who might go to the Six Counties to hear evidence against him.  To whom does such a person make a complaint on his return to custody on this side of the Border?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify his interpretation of the other situation, namely, whose responsibility will it be to take action on request from the authorities in the Six Counties to arrest and to take into custody a person accused of some offence named in the Schedule to this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us consider the situation where a case is brought as a result of a request from the authorities in the Six Counties and where an accused person is brought before us here and where, in accordance with the rights given in this Bill&mdash;which are much less than his natural and legal rights should be&mdash;he goes to the Six Counties to hear the evidence given on commission against him.  If while in custody he is abused in some way or thinks he is, or if he alleges he was so abused even though he was not, he makes a complaint accordingly, that is pursued to its conclusion by the Minister and his Department <Col N="171" /> and until they are satisfied that it has been concluded in a satisfactory manner no other case will be taken in our courts on foot of a request from the Six Counties.  The Minister has said in regard to complaints that ultimately it will be the Government or the Minister who will make a determination as to whether investigations have been properly concluded but, on the other hand, he has told the House that no other cases will be taken while the investigation is proceeding.  However, on the third stage we find it will not be within the competence of the Government to decide that no other case will be taken while the first case is being investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that it will. Clearly there is a political element involved at that stage.  If there is a reciprocal arrangement and there is bad faith being shown by the other side in the operation of it the Government here would indicate to the Government in the other jurisdiction that we were suspending the operation of the legislation, that requests for arrests or prosecution could not be dealt with until the matter was cleared up.  It is as simple as that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us suppose that there were 20 complaints in the course of a week or so and that 20 people were picked up.  If the first person comes back and makes a complaint nothing is done about the other 19 people until the complaint is pursued to a conclusion that is satisfactory to our Executive.  If it takes one year to do that, will the other 19 people be held in custody or will they be let out?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that this debate was nonsense because some speakers asked questions that he considered foolish although they appeared quite sensible to me.  If a person is in custody in the Six Counties during a hearing of evidence against him on commission, I take it from what the Minister has said that such a person is guaranteed immunity from detention and/or arrest.  What difference does it make when a person is in custody whether he is guaranteed immunity from detention and/or arrest, because, for all practical purposes, he is in detention?  What is the difference there?  What is the purpose of the guarantee and who will it satisfy?  Secondly, how can the Minister in his capacity as Minister for Justice in an Irish Government suggest to this House in furtherance of his arguments to put through this proposed legislation that we are doing it on a reciprocal basis with what has happened in the British Parliament when in practice, as distinct from theory, this law is only intended and will only operate where the minority in the Six Counties, those of republican outlook, are concerned?  Why should we set up this paraphernalia in order to deal in a discriminatory fashion with those who have been so long discriminated against on the other side of the Border?  That is what we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, can the Minister visualise a situation where an alleged loyalist terrorist is being hounded so diligently by the forces of the Crown in the Six Counties that he must jump across the Border rather than be caught?  If such a situation should happen by mistake, as when the British Army frequently make mistakes about the Border and cross into our side, if an extreme loyalist terrorist with a price on his head in the Six Counties is running from the RUC and the UDR&mdash;of which he may be a member in good standing&mdash;can the Minister see such a person brought before the court <Col N="173" /> as a result of a request from the Establishment in the Six Counties? Of course, such a person would jump at the chance of going before his own courts, these impartial courts presided over by the impartial judges and before which will come the impartial RUC, the Special Branch, the SAS and the British Army to give evidence against him.  He will be quite happy going back to the North with the guarantee of his immunity, as mentioned by the Minister, not only from arrest and detention but from any danger of being beaten up, hooded or any such other atrocities committed against so many of the minority in the past.  That is in the extreme, exceptional case where, by mistake, he crosses the Border rather than be chased by them, if they were chasing him.  We know this and the Minister knows it.  The facts are there for anybody to see that the forces of law and order in the Six Counties stand completely discredited.  The Minister knows that in relation to the percentage of the population in the majority and the minority in the Six Counties when one takes the number of those interrogated into account one finds that the percentage is doubled in the case of the minority as against the majority.  If we look at the 1,500 dead we find a similar situation whereby the percentage of Loyalists killed is only half that of the minority in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>However, if one is not satisfied with that one has only to look at the people prosecuted for serious offences in the Six Counties and look at the table of sentences handed out to people convicted over the last four to five years.  What do we find?  We find, again, that the number brought before the courts on serious charges in the Six Counties bears no relationship to the percentage of the bodies to which they belong, the majority or the minority.  Their numbers are in converse ratio again to the actual numbers on the ground.  If further evidence were needed as to the lack of faith in just treatment for all in the Establishment in the Six Counties we have only to look a little further and examine the records where there have been convictions.  What do we find?  We find that the sentences <Col N="174" /> delivered are approximately half if you belong to the majority in the Six Counties as against the minority.  How then can the Minister, or anybody else, come to any conclusion other than that the Establishment in the Six Counties are no better than they ever were and that there is no possibility of fair play or equal justice for all in that quisling state?</P>
    <P>The Minister should be taking that into consideration at this late stage instead of involving himself unnecessarily in guarantees in relation to verbal assurances which he may have in relation to something over which he has no jurisdiction.  The Minister would be much better employed if he added up the things I am talking about, went back to the Government and asked them to look again at this Bill.  How can one expect to get fair play for all from the SAS, the British Army, the UDR and the RUC in the Six Counties when one knows their record in the past in relation to the minority?  The Minister, in relation to this Bill, is giving in to the British Government and the Establishment in the Six Counties.</P>

An insurance number which referred to the claimant was traced but under this number there was no record of employment contributions. Following inquiries by a local officer of the Department it was found that the claimant's employer had not been stamping the insurance cards of his employees.  The full amount of contributions due from the employer has not yet been collected, but the contributions due in respect of the claimant have been treated as paid at the correct time, and a cheque for the amount of benefit due has been issued.</P>

      <P>The resolution referred to by the Deputy proposes essentially that the Council of Europe should become involved in the co-ordination of the shipping policies of its members. However, the shipping policy matters referred to by the Deputy are already being adequately catered for by other international organisations of a regional and global nature.  Such matters as pollution of the sea and the conditions of seamen are the concern of specialist international bodies, for example, the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation and the International Labour Organisation, which are particularly equipped by reason of their expertise and experience to consider and resolve the problems arising in their specific areas of concern.  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development plays a co-ordinating role in relation to the policies of its member States on the economic aspects of shipping policy mentioned in the resolution.  In <Col N="36" /> addition, the Council of Minister of the European Communities is at present considering the question of the feasibility of Community action in the field of sea transport.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances it is considered that the action recommended in the resolution is not opportune and the Permanent Representative to the Council of Europe has accordingly been instructed not to support the resolution.</P>

      <P>It was reported in the Press on 18th and 19th December, 1975, that at the annual meeting of the General Council of the Bar of Ireland on 17th December, barristers had decided to increase their fees by 66? per cent with effect from 1st January, 1976.</P>
      <P>Under the Prices and Charges (Notification of Increases) Order, 1975, any person proposing to increase the charge for a service rendered by him is required to give two months' advance notice of the proposed increase to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  No such notice of a proposal to increase barristers' legal fees was received in my Department.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of the matter by the National Prices Commission at their meeting on 23rd December, 1975, a letter was sent by my Department on 2nd January, 1976, to the Bar Council inquiring whether there was any foundation in fact for the newspaper reports in question, pointing out the legal requirements in relation to increases in charges and requesting their observations as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>A reply from the Bar Council was received on 14th January, 1976, indicating that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Press report was inaccurate and unauthorised.  Neither the Bar Council nor a General Meeting of the Bar determines the fees to be <Col N="38" /> charged by barristers, which are the subject of arrangement between the individual barrister and his instructing Solicitor.</P>
    <P>Scales of minimum fees for certain types of work may be recommended from time to time by the Bar Council or by a General Meeting of the Bar, and the General Meeting of the Bar held on 17 December, 1975 adopted such a recommendation in relation to fees chargeable for certain types of work in the District Court, the Circuit Court and the High Court.</P>
    <P>The contents of letter of 2 January, 1976 were being brought to the notice of the Bar generally so that individual barristers might know that if compliance with the recommendations of the General Meeting involved them in any increase in fees previously charged by them it was the view of the Department that this requires two months' advance notice to be given to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Bar Council had sought formal legal advice in relation to the statement in the Department's letter that &ldquo;legal fees charged by barristers come within the scope of this Order&rdquo; and the Opinion given did not support this view.</P>
    <P>The advice to me is that the order does apply to the fees charged by barristers for rendering professional services.  In the circumstances, I wish to make it clear that I expect barristers who propose to increase their fees to give me advance notice as required by the order.</P>

The National Prices Commission, in fact, in their monthly report for October, 1975, gave the results of a survey on soft drink prices which had been carried out by the prices inspectorate of my Department.  The commission concluded that excessive margins were being taken on soft drinks sold for on-premises consumption in hotels, lounges, public bars, cafés, and so on, and that the desirability of introducing a Maximum Prices Order for soft drinks sold in these premises should be considered.  Before making a recommendation on the matter, however, the commission have invited comments from interested parties and the deadline for the receipt of these comments by the commission will be the end of the present month. Any recommendation made by the commission will receive immediate consideration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the present position as regards the use of CIE buses for transporting school children to swimming pools (a) during school hours and (b) outside of school hours; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>As announced in January, 1975, the use of school buses is no longer legally restricted to transporting children to and from school; they may also be used to take pupils to and from school-related physical education activities.  This would include visits to swimming pools.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are still some labour difficulties to be resolved by CIE before the scheme can be implemented.</P>

      <P>In reply to Question No. 4 on 4th December, 1974, I indicated that I had <Col N="42" /> come to no definite decision in regard to the introduction of legislation in this area and that, even if I were satisfied that legislation was desirable and would be useful, I would not be in a position to undertake it for some time.  That remains the position as far as I am concerned.</P>
