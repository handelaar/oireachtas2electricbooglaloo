      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of refrigerators which were imported in the first three months of (a) 1975 and (b) 1976.</P>

      <P>Imports of domestic electric refrigerators numbered 1,592 in the period JanuaryMarch, 1975, and 23,044 in the corresponding period of 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that an increase of this magnitude in the import of refrigerators will cause havoc in our industries producing electrical products?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is entering into the area of policy which is a matter for the appropriate Minister.  This is a statistical question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It might interest the Deputy to know that a possible reason for this is that the rates of import duty on these commodities were reduced as and from 1st January, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the total annual sales of refrigerators here is between 30,000 and 40,000 and that the imports for three months reached 20,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that informal contacts which the Central Statistics Office had indicated that the very high <Col N="1830" /> figure for the first three months of this year is due to re-stocking.  That is a very healthy sign for the economy and I am sure the Deputy will agree with that.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the imports from Russia number approximately 1,164 compared with no imports last year and that the imports from Britain number approximately 15,000 compared with a few hundred last year? I understand that the imports from Britain are bought through an agent and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to refer that matter to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to see whether or not the imports into Ireland from Britain are in fact first imported into Britain from other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer that matter to the Minister but I should like to confirm that Britain is the largest exporter of refrigerators to us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of disquiet among many housing authorities that they will not be in a position to complete as many local authority houses in 1976 as in 1975; and whether he proposes to provide sufficient funds to these authorities to enable them to complete more houses in 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  I would draw the attention of the Deputy to my <Col N="1831" /> general review of the local authority housing construction programme in 1976 in the course of the debate in this House on 11th and 12th May on the housing motion tabled by Members of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>For the Deputy's benefit, I will state again the main facts of the present situation.  The Government allocation in the public capital programme for 1976 for local authority housing is £65 million&mdash;an increase of £11 million, or over 20 per cent on the 1975 revised public capital programme allocation of £54.1 million.</P>
      <P>In deciding allocations to housing authorities, I took special account of the serious housing position in the Dublin area where well over 5,000 approved applicants are waiting to be re-housed in spite of the considerable progress made by the corporation recently after years of relative neglect by the former Administration.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation, as a result of the better progress now being made, needed a major increase in their allocation this year.  I have them over £11 million more in 1976 that in 1975&mdash; equivalent to the total increase, at national level, in the public capital programme allocation for local authority housing.</P>
      <P>As a direct result of this major diversion of resources to meet the needs of larger families on the corporation's approved waiting list, the amount of money available for new work elsewhere is less than I would like.  Some delay is inevitable, therefore, in the commencement of some new housing schemes outside the Dublin area, particularly in areas where needs are not acute.  As a result there may be some decline in completions in individual areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nationally, last year 8,794 local authority dwellings were completed, an all time record and some 1,300 dwellings above the target set by me for 1975.  As a result, total completions this year may be below the target of 7,500, roughly by an equivalent amount. However, I expect the total of local authority housing completions in the two year period, 1975 and 1976, to be <Col N="1832" /> in line with the public housing target of 15,000 for that period.</P>
    <P>There is no obligation on me&mdash;indeed on any Minister for Local Government&mdash;to provide each year, a progressively increasing amount of money for new housing completions to a housing authority.  The Deputy must be aware that the level of the construction programme fluctuates from area to area, and from year to year, and that as a consequence the number of completions in a given time in any area may vary widely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when he announced his capital allocation for housing this year he did not take into account the 20 per cent increase in building costs? Is the Minister aware that the number of starts made by some local authorities this year is down from 240 to 41, approximately?  Is he aware that the starts on 1st January, 1976, are well down on the number of starts for the same period last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is partly right and partly wrong.  The Deputy seems to think that because Kerry County Council completed an all time record last year that they should attempt to break that record this year. It would not be reasonable to assume that that would be so.  In fact, in 1972-73 only 141 houses were built in. Kerry while in 1973-74 105 were built. In the nine months of 1974 the number was 140 while 316 were built last year.  It is estimated that 187 will be built this year which is the most Kerry County Council would be able to handle.  It is an average of 250 over two years, roughly twice as many as were built in previous years in Kerry. If Deputy O'Leary is talking about Kerry he has very little to complain about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking in relation to the country in general.  Can the Minister say when the additional allocations will be made and whether they will be made in sufficient time to enable more houses to be completed by 31st December, 1976?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Additional allocations will be made in time to start them <Col N="1833" /> after the middle of the year but they will not be completed by the end of the year.  Nobody would expect them completed by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Dublin Corporation may have to dismiss 500 workers because of lack of finance from the Government?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that his decision of 1st January last to remove the right to a State grant form 50 per cent of those who would normally build their own houses has thrown a considerable number of people onto the local authority list and that the extra houses built by the local authority would not compensate for this difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Callanan said that the grant would not buy the nails for the houses.  If the grant would not buy the nails, I do not know how Deputy Faulkner can say that it is stopping people from building their own houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister said that the increase on this year's allocation was taken up entirely by Dublin Corporation, does he not acknowledge that the remainder of the local authorities are working on a figure which is a 20 per cent cutback in real terms? <Col N="1834" /> The experience all of us have with people seeking local authority housing is that we can give them no hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They have twice as good a chance of getting a local authority house as when Fianna Fáil were in Government because we are building twice the number of local authority houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us a factual indication of the period involved from the time when normally a local authority requests permission to build houses until they are completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authority houses do not require planning permission. Local authorities starting houses in January of the year in most cases are able to finish them in 12 to 15 months. If they are small schemes, they are occupied within six months.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government it took six years from the time of application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept that. Perhaps we were lethargic in that respect.  May I suggest, therefore, that the vast majority of the houses built in the last three years were those which were planned and approved by Fianna Fáil?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he intends to make regulations to provide for uniformity of approach by local authorities in the provision of dumping facilities for persons who wish to dispose of trade and domestic refuse; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to a question on 18th December last, a general review of the arrangements relating to waste collection and disposal has been undertaken to ascertain whether new measures are needed.  I cannot commit myself to any particular proposal at this stage, but I intend to bring forward whatever statutory or other measures are required in the light of <Col N="1835" /> the review to enable local authorities to deal with the waste problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, in the absence of guidelines to local authorities and the provision of dumping facilities, there is a growing tendency to indiscriminately dump trade and domestic refuse and that this is seriously interfering with scenic and other amenities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Regretfully, it happens from time to time.  Lack of public spirit is causing this to happen.  While local authorities have the right to provide dumps for refuse which they do not collect themselves, there is no onus on them to do so.  I have asked local authorities to pay particular attention to this problem.  I am told that in one or two areas the situation has not improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how the situation in other countries compares with the situation here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Most countries are the same as our own.  The EEC Directive on waste, which was adopted in July, 1975, provides for the designation by member states of authorities to be responsible for the planning and organisation of waste disposal operations. Eventually the law will have to be strictly administered.  Local authorities seem slow to prosecute people for roadside dumping, even when they know where the refuse comes from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Ray Burke Mr. Ray Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The reluctance of local authorities to prosecute could have something to do with the ludicrous fines that are imposed when a conviction is obtained.  Could the Minister see his way to introduce legislation which would amend all fines under local authority legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In most cases the fines are very small.  There is a special position in Dublin since both Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, with the exception of one area, had to close dumps which were available to everyone until recently.  I agree that the matter is worth having a look at and we are considering the question of fines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Works necessary for eliminating pollution caused by discharges from public sewerage systems are included in the ongoing sanitary services programmes of local authorities. <Col N="1838" /> Such works already qualify as sanitary services schemes for loans from the local loans fund and for the generous State subsidy provided in respect of loan charges.  I might add that the capital provision for sanitary services in 1976 is £23 million compared with £8.23 million in 1972-73 and that State subsidies in the same period rose from £2.034 million to £4.907 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be so.  There is nothing unusual about such a situation because if a scheme is being undertaken in one year there is no reason why the local authority concerned should receive in the following year the same amount of money as they received in the previous year either for that scheme or for any other.  Schemes must be undertaken in the order of priority laid down by the local authorities.</P>

In those circumstances how can they be expected to deal with the problem of the pollution of lakes and rivers from the same allocation?  Is a special scheme not required to deal with pollution?</P>

In these circumstances would he not accept the argument that to reduce the amount of money as between one year and another is not the way to approach the problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that many lakes and rivers which were rather bad in this respect a few years ago are now showing signs of improvement while there are others in respect of which there is suspicion now.  What I said was not that there would be a lesser amount overall but that a lesser amount would be given for specific counties.  It would not be reasonable to say, for instance, that because we gave £5 million to Tipperary three years ago we should have given the same amount last year and again this year.  The money available for this purpose must be spread around.  The Deputy is aware that local authorities decide on the order of priorities of schemes.  Naturally, they only get enough money to meet the cost of whatever scheme they are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that the Minister picked Tipperary at random but it was a very bad example.  Is he not aware that the local authorities operate under many disabilities in dealing with water pollution but that the main problem is the lack of adequate finance?  There is no need to go back five years but as and from today can the Minister assure the House and all those concerned with the problem of pollution that there will be adequate finance made available to back the powers which are being provided for in the Bill; otherwise the Bill will be totally inadequate?</P>

      <P>If I could be sure that every Deputy here would follow me into the voting lobby, I should have no hesitation in putting pressure on the Minister for Finance to provide <Col N="1840" /> the necessary moneys for this work. No previous Government whether it was Coalition, Cumann na nGaedheal or Fianna Fáil realised the seriousness of not providing adequate money for sanitary services and we are now in the position that, although, the allocation for these services has increased from £8 million to £23 million it is merely a drop in the ocean in the context of the problem as a whole.  Never before has the situation been so critical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The funds available for road fund grants to local authorities in 1976 have already been allocated and there are no other funds at my disposal from which an additional grant for improvement works on this road may be made this year.  It is open to Kerry County Council, should they wish to do so, to consider providing for the improvement of the road with the assistance of the grants available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Kerry County Council state that this matter is subject to verification by the Department, that they have no say in the matter?  The road concerned is the main road to Dublin.  It runs through Milltown and Farranfore and it is used by huge milk tankers which carry loads of up to 30,000 tons in weight.  People are terrified of using the road.  In those circumstances I ask the Minister to have it listed for next year's grant allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are many national secondary roads in Kerry, comprising a total of 164 miles. Of those roads 32 miles are in need of improvements, improvements that <Col N="1845" /> would cost a considerable sum of money.  However, the Deputy can be assured that whatever money can be allocated for such work will be made available.  The officials in my Department are aware of the situation and we will be glad to help out as best we can.  We will be glad to try to help out if we can.  I am sure Deputy O'Connor is aware that it is difficult to find all the money and this year quite a lot of money was allocated in block grants for the purpose of doing roads which had not been done for many years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a three mile stretch of road.  Two or three sections are very narrow and have had turns. Perhaps it could be widened for sighting purposes.  It is a very dangerous section and I would ask the Minister to get his Department to direct Kerry County Council to carry out these improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that a survey carried out by An Foras Forbartha showed the road was deficient in capacity and payment and it is accepted that improvements, including widening, need to be carried out; but such works are not considered of equal priority to other works required on the national network both in County Kerry and nationally.  According to my expert's advice, even Kerry County Council would not put that portion of the road at the top of the priority list. There is no point in leaving it half done.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether or not they have taken it over, but whether or not they have taken it over, apparently the situation is that there is still some work which has not yet been completed by the contractor which the NBA, who are only an agency and who do not build houses, are asking to have carried out.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Murphy would not expect me to give him a list of the odds and ends of which he and I are both aware which were wrong with those houses almost immediately after they were occupied. We saw them.  We saw people who were prepared to point out numerous defects within months of occupation. That is why I stopped that type of scheme.  It would not be much use to Deputy Murphy or the House if I <Col N="1849" /> read out a list of the small things and big things which still need to be corrected. The National Building Agency have assured me whatever should have been done will be done before the contractor gets his money.</P>

If Deputy Murphy likes, I am quite sure I would be able to supply him with details of works which require to be done, but it would be unfair for me to start reading out in this House a long list of places where nails were not put in, and so on.</P>

Is he also aware that there is an urgent need for 35 farm homes and we have only £25,000 left out of our allocation for this year to provide them?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  Of course the Deputy is aware that there will be a further allocation where it is needed.  The Deputy might go back a little further than the past two years. The reason so many homes were required is that practically none were built for years in Monaghan except a few pre-fabs here and there for people for whom houses could not be built. Deputy Leonard must be aware of this because he has been a member of Monaghan County Council for some time.  He is trying to throw on to my shoulders responsibility for something which was building up over the years. He cannot get away with that.</P>

      <P>I have given the reply. I am sorry if Deputy Leonard was not listening.  I said the information sought is not available in my Department. The reason it is not available is that the housing authority did not prepare the follow up plan as they were asked to do.  That is really beside the point because what Deputy Leonard is trying to say is that last year his county council prepared for many houses which were not built. Now he is deliberately taking the county apart from the urban areas and he is saying that there was, in fact, a smaller number of houses built, according to him, in the county and he is alleging the same thing is likely to happen this year.  I am putting the answer straight to him: in the years previous to that Monaghan County Council built no houses at all in the rural areas except small pre-fabs for old folk and I think anyone who tries to blame me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If Deputy Brennan will allow me, the position is that in Donegal at the present time there are 402 local authority houses in progress, 402 in a county where, despite a number of Ministers for Local Government, a relatively small number of houses was built over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

Deputy Brennan asked me about people who were burned out being housed.  How would we at local government level make provision for someone who got burned out?  Surely Donegal County Council has the same method as every other county council in the country has of providing houses as a matter of urgency by way of temporary accomodation at least for people unfortunate enough to have their houses burned down.  We must face the situation as it is.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to his question of 20th February, 1975, regarding the survey.  As the survey covered only a relatively small sample of dwellings, it was decided to get more detailed data on a wider range of dwellings. All housing authorities have, accordingly, been asked to undertake a statutory assessment of the needs for dwellings in their areas including an assessment of the needs of households in unfit dwellings.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the rethatching of a house has to be done fairly frequently to keep the house in good repair.  It would mean that with the rethatching having to take place every few years grants in respect of the work would have to be paid much more frequently than on other houses and I would not be prepared to waive the regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to introduce a new scheme of grants specifically for thatched houses. Does he not recognise that there are many such houses throughout the country that could be preserved?  In these times of housing scarcity, which my colleagues have amply illustrated by means of questions already, where any house can be preserved and kept in the housing stock this should be done.  Would the Minister not consider a separate and distinct scheme of grants in respect of thatched houses which would enable them to be thatched regularly, thereby preserving them for occupation?</P>

    <Col N="1861" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think the Deputy will agree that while there is an arrangement whereby a thatched house can be covered by a grant it would be unreasonable if we had a specific grant covering only the thatching of a house.  There are dozens of things that, when considered on their own, appear to qualify for special attention.  It would be wrong at this stage to introduce specific grants for the thatching of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that thatched houses and cottages are in a special category? They are attractive and they help to make the countryside more interesting for tourists and for all of us.  A special scheme for thatched houses and cottages could be justified because valuable and important houses could be preserved in the housing stock. Otherwise they will deteriorate and fall into ruin, as is happening throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If he has, the Deputy will not put the old type of thatch on it.  I agree that the old thatched houses are getting scarcer but the reason is not so much the thatching but the fact that many of them have mud walls and they are not able to stand the rigours of time.  Many of them were built many years ago.  I would be prepared to look at the matter but I cannot offer a lot of hope to the Deputy that the scheme he proposes can be introduced at the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

First of all, most of them, having regard to the location of mines, have to travel up to ten and 15 miles to work and the Minister's recent budget meant a net loss of approximately £3.50 a week to them. Secondly, as I say in my question, by comparison with people earning similar salaries now, let us say, £5,000, their expectation in approximately five years' time will be something of the order of £2,000 whereas people on similar salaries would be expecting, in normal progression, £15,000?

      <P>Yes, I was.  Would the Minister ensure that, because of the special nature of the work a miner does, the allowance for expenses, which all tradesmen can legitimately claim, would in the case of miners be adequate and generous because of the special conditions in which they work?</P>

      <P>The tax code is such that it allows any taxpayer to set off against tax liability any expenses necessarily and exclusively incurred in connection with his vocation, as Deputy Haughey knows.  It is a matter for taxpayers to discuss this with their tax inspectors.  As a matter of practice, the Revenue Commissioners discuss these matters with trade union representatives of any representative group of workers.  That has been the practice in this case.  If there are representations to be made in this matter, then they should be made in the normal way to the Revenue Commissioners who I am sure will bear in mind all relevant factors.</P>

It is proposed to deal with the debate on the adjournment on a token Vote for my own Department, which I have now moved.  As the House is probably aware, I understand that the Superintendent has been in touch with the Whips to the effect that there is a reconstruction problem involved in dealing with the Senate Chamber and it is expected that it will take some time.  The anticipated adjournment is approximately the normal length of time but it may be a week or two longer.</P>

      <P>But the normal procedure is not very specific.  The Taoiseach may or may not indicate to the House the date on which the Dáil will be adjourned and resumed when he moves the motion for his own Estimate.  He may do so in the closing speech.  In that event we will want to know in what manner we can propose the adjournment of the House.  I understand, after inquiry from the Ceann Comhairle's office, that there is no formal vehicle by which we can move a motion to oppose the adjournment of the House at a specific time. Since I am unable to get the information I require, I may say that it is the intention of the Opposition to oppose the motion on the Supplementary Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department and also to seek a specific motion on the adjournment of the Dáil, which we also intend to oppose if it is intended to adjourn the Dáil this week.</P>

      <P>There is no mystery about this.

The alternative procedure, which has sometimes been adopted, is that there is a debate on the motion &ldquo;That the House do now adjourn&rdquo; until a specific date.  Personally, I do not care which way it is taken.  At a certain stage on Thursday I assume that we will propose that the House will adjourn until whatever is the fixed date.  If the Leader of the Opposition prefers a debate that way, there is no difficulty as far as I am concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>These two amendments to the Bill were made by the Seanad at my request.  They arise from difficulties which have arisen in relation to particular development proposals for which planning permission has been granted on appeal subject to the most stringent environmental and other conditions.  So far as I am concerned, anybody who is dissatisfied with an appeal decision is entitled to go to the High Court to seek to have the decision quashed if he has reasonable grounds for doing so, but I do not think that a person should be entitled to obstruct a developer by <Col N="1880" /> threatening to take a High Court action at some future date.</P>
      <P>Under section 82 (3) of the 1963 Act, which is being replaced by a provision of section 42 of the Bill, an appeal lies to the High Court on a question of law which arises on any appeal, and such an appeal to the High Court must be taken within three months after the giving of the decision or such longer period as the High Court may in any particular case allow.  Apart altogether from this provision, the general law entitles a person at any time to apply to the High Court for an order of <i>certiorari</i> or a declaratory order seeking to have a particular appeal decision quashed and there is no time limit on this.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I have no wish to deprive anybody of right to apply to the High Court seeking to have an appeal decision quashed in a case where the person considers that there are grounds for so doing, but I think it is only reasonable that, if a person wishes to exercise this right, he should initiate the proceedings within a reasonable time.  It is only fair that there should be some provision to ensure that all objections to a particular development proposal can be brought to a speedy end.  For this reason I put down amendments which in effect involve a reasonable regulation of the right to access to the courts to question a decision made either by a planning authority on an application for permission or by the Minister or the board in an appeal case.  There are precedents for this type of provision both in English law and in our own law, for example, in the provisions of the Housing Act, 1966, dealing with the confirmation of compulsory purchase orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given a considerable amount of thought to the period which should be allowed under the proposed new provision for the initiation of proceedings in the High Court.  In the interests of bringing a case to finality and enabling a worth-while development to go ahead as quickly as possible, I would like to provide for quite a short period.  However, I think we must recognise that people who may have a legitimate grievance will need <Col N="1881" /> time to consult with their legal advisers and to weigh up the pros and cons of proceedings in the courts. Moreover, if we were to provide for an unduly short period there could, perhaps, be a danger that the entire provision might be found to be unconstitutional in that it would represent a unreasonable interference with the right of access to the High Court. In all the circumstances, I have been advised that a two-months' period would be appropriate, and I had the amendment drafted accordingly.</P>
    <P>I should, of course, point out that even if we set a fairly limited period for applying to the High Court in a case where the validity of a permission is being challenged, a considerable delay could still result before the case would come to a hearing or judgment could be delivered.  I am advised that nothing can be done about this by way of further amendment since it would not be appropriate to attempt to regulate court procedure in the Bill.  I might mention, however, that once proceedings are initiated in the High Court, a developer will have some remedy because, if there is unreasonable delay on the part of the person who instituted the proceedings, an application can be made to the court for an order either directing that the statement of claim, and so on, should be lodged quickly or, alternatively, striking out the proceedings.  The type of case about which I am particularly concerned is the case where a person does not actually institute proceedings but threatens to do so if and when a development commences.  I am satisfied that the proposed amendment of the 1963 Act would, at least, prevent this type of situation arising in the future.</P>
    <P>The amendments themselves are largely self-explanatory.  The first proposes that the existing section 82 (3) should be redrafted to confine it to cases where points of law which arise in appeal cases may need to be referred to the High Court either by the Minister or the board.  A new subsection (3A) is then being inserted to provide for the type of limitation about which I have been speaking in <Col N="1882" /> the case of proceedings designed to challenge the validity of a planning decision.  The second amendment of section 42 is purely consequential; it takes account of the redrafting of section 82 (3) which is effected by the first amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the first amendment is simply a drafting amendment in subsection (3) where the words &ldquo;by it&rdquo; are inserted?</P>

      <P>I agree in principle with what the Minister has stated and with the amendment.  I believe there should be a time limit and there have been cases here in this country where threats of proceedings resulted in our losing industry.  I would accept fully that it is only right that we should endeavour, through our legislation, to avoid this type of thing in future.</P>
      <P>The only point with which I have a slight problem is in relation to the amount of time given to the person to institute proceedings.  The Minister has stated that he went into this very thoroughly, and I would simply ask him if his legal advisers would agree this was, in fact, sufficient time for a person to actually institute proceedings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 35, between lines 53 and 54, the following section inserted before section 44:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;44.&mdash;Section 42 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, as amended by sections 86 and 91 of the Principal Act, shall be construed and have effect as if `or such extended period as may at any time be agreed in writing between that authority and the person proposing to execute the work,' and `or such extended period, as may be <Col N="1885" /> appropriate' were inserted therein after `within two months' and `such two months', respectively.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment was also made by the Seanad at my request.  Section 91 of the 1963 Act amends section 42 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, so as to extend from one month to two months the period within which a planning authority must give a decision on whether any building work is in conformity with building regulations. The preparation of such regulations is now at an advanced stage.  It is likely that, in some cases and through no fault of their own, the planning authority may not be in a position to give a fully considered decision on applications within the prescribed time due, for instance, to the complexity of the project or delay on the part of the applicant in furnishing necessary supplementary information in good time.</P>
    <P>It seems reasonable, therefore, in the interests of both planning authority and applicant that there should be some provision for the extension of the time allowed for dealing with applications.  The most acceptable way of providing for such an extension would be to amend the existing law by providing that the time limit may be extended to the extent that the person proposing to carry out the building work agrees in writing.  This amendment, therefore, inserts in the Bill a new section which amends the 1878 Act so as to allow such an extension to be agreed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept this amendment. I feel it is helpful and an improvement on the situation as it was. I am, therefore, in agreement with the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister propose to set up the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The new Act will come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed by order by me. Different days may be fixed for different provisions of the Act.  Generally, it is the intention to bring all sections of the Bill into operation as <Col N="1886" /> soon as possible but it must be recognised that this cannot be done at once.</P>
      <P>I hope to be able to bring a number of the provisions of the Bill into operation within about a month of its enactment.  These are the provisions in relation to development plans and most of those relating to planning control and enforcement.  It will, of course, be necessary for my Department to provide advice and guidance for planning authorities as to the intent of these provisions and their practical operation.  Hence the need for some little delay in bringing them into operation.</P>
      <P>A further group of provisions in the Bill are dependent for their operation on the making of regulations.  The conflict of interests provisions are an example.  I hope to be able to make the necessary regulations and take the other steps necessary to bring these provisions into operation in the autumn.</P>
      <P>Finally, there are the provisions relating to the establishment of the board and the transfer of appeals functions to them.  While it is my aim that the board should be established and take over responsibility for dealing with appeals as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted, I must make it clear that before this can actually be done a great deal of administration work will have to be carried out and various sets of regulations will have to be revised. Moreover, if there is to be a smooth transfer of functions with minimal disruption of the important work of deciding appeals, it will be necessary for the board to have some time to prepare for their task.  I can assure the House, however, that in so far as I am concerned, the sooner the board become operational the better.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for dealing with roughly 4,000 planning appeals each year is not something which I or my Parliamentary Secretary want to retain for even one day longer than is absolutely necessary.  However, looking at the matter realistically, I envisage that it will require about six months or so to prepare for the full transfer of responsibility to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1887" /> When Senator Dolan asked me about this in the Seanad I gave the same reply to him.  I assure the House that I will try to have it in operation as quickly as I can because I cannot see the end of it quickly enough.  I am told by my experts it will take approximately six months to have the board finally operating properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is a fact that very many worth-while changes have been made in the Bill, public attention has been focussed on the question of the board and the transfer of the Minister's powers to the board. For that reason, and because this is part of the basic reason the Bill was introduced, I would be glad to see the board in operation as soon as possible.  The Minister says it will take about six months before the board are actually in operation.  Does he intend appointing the members of the board in considerably less time than six months?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would imagine within the next couple of months we will have to be preparing for the new members of the board.  It is not everybody who will be anxious to be a member of the board because they will not have the experience I have had of trying to deal with appeals.  I would say that maybe within two or three months we will have to be trying to get at least a panel of members from which they would be selected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <P>It is true to say that although the Bill was a long time before <Col N="1888" /> the House a very good job was done on it.  The worth-while result has been because of the fact that the Minister accepted quite a considerable number of amendments and the Opposition did very considerable work in relation to the submitting of amendments.</P>

      <P>I am a great believer in democracy and this is an example of the democratic way to deal with legislation. All Bills, no matter what they are, should be debated fully in both Houses.  They have been dealt with not always in a reasonable way but eventually when we got the nitty gritty, the contentious things away, we came down to the discussion.  I would like to pay a tribute to Deputy Faulkner who was very constructive and also Deputy Haughey in the proposals he put in.  I am grateful for it and I hope the Bill will be successful in its time as the 1963 Act was.  While we did not think at the time it would be so successful, it did a good job considering it was pioneering legislation.  I hope this will be the same.</P>

      <P>In page 2, line 25, after &ldquo;refuses or&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is that the intended new subsection replacing the section of Social Welfare Act, 1952, <Col N="1889" /> should quite clearly indicate wilful neglect. In other words, it should read:</P>
    <P>... who refuses or wilfully neglects to attend in accordance with the notice or who, having so attended, refuses to give evidence or refuses or fails to produce any document to which the notice relates shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding £100.</P>
    <P>Then the effect of my amendment would be to give the section more force.  It would quite clearly indicate that if a person wilfully neglects to do such and such a thing according to the section, under those circumstances he necessarily would be liable for the offence created.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I see what Deputy Andrews is getting at, but Deputy Andrews rightly has been insistent that social welfare legislation particularly should be made less complicated and as uniform as possible.  The reason it has been left out is that in the original context of the 1952 Act section 49 (4) (b) this word did not occur and it was in order to try to have uniformity in social welfare legislation as far as possible that it is not included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand we have to be rather expeditious on this legislation, having regard to the build-up of other legislation ahead of us.  Consequently, it will not be my intention unduly to delay the House on the Social Welfare Bill before us.  However, the Parliamentary Secretary rightly states that it is a concern of mine and no doubt his that we should be making legislation, particularly in the field of social welfare, complicated, but the insertion of one word certainly will not complicate the issue in this instance.  If anything it would make it more understandable and comprehensible and that would be my reason for putting in the wilful intention to commit the offence created, producing of course the sanctions set out in the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no strong feelings on the matter and I am advised <Col N="1890" /> that it does not add any legal force to the Bill.  The intention was to try to have it worded similarly to the 1952 Act but I am not going to oppose it just for the sake of opposing it and if the Deputy feels strongly that it will help or enforce the wording of the Bill in any way, I am prepared to accept the amendment.  The only thing I would point out is that if the amendment is accepted, consequently it will be necessary or desirable to amend line 27 similarly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the penalties in section 3 are quite considerable.  I wonder could the Parliamentary Secretary outline to the House why the penalties were increased in such a draconian fashion.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that the penalties for offences under section 49 of the 1952 Act were rather minor.  Is it the <Col N="1891" /> view of the Government that the increase in the penalties as envisaged by this section will go towards a greater discouragement of intended offenders under the section and is this the philosophy behind it?  The Parliamentary Secretary might also outline the methods of detection conducted by the Department of Social Welfare in relation to this and related offences and all offences under the social welfare code?  Is it his intention to create a sort of corps of individuals specifically charged with the supervision of the social welfare code in general?  It would appear that that is the philosophy behind the big increases in fines and terms of imprisonment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the last question put by the Deputy, I should like to state that every social welfare officer, indeed, every official of the Department, is responsible, if he comes across an obvious breach of the code, to take appropriate action. Apart from that there are inspectors based at the social welfare offices throughout the country who have direct responsibility in this area.  In reply to the first question put by the Deputy it is, as I stated previously, my hope that the penalties provided under this Bill will not have to be imposed.  I hope the fact that they exist and that it is possible for a court to impose both of these maximum penalties will act as a deterrent. The Deputy mentioned that he was at a loss to understand why we thought them necessary and desirable.  We were led to believe in this House that they were thought necessary and desirable by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer the Deputy to columns 13 and 144 of Volume 289 of the Official Report of 24th March, 1976 which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the number of persons who engage in this type of activity is relatively small, when an abuse is discovered the media build it up as big as they can.  It makes good reading. It is spoken about and built up out of all proportion and a type of resentment and resistance among the general public can be and to some <Col N="1892" /> extent has been built up by the highlighting of these isolated cases.  That is where I see the dangers of the anti-social behaviour that these persons engage in and within a very short period of time a Bill will be introduced into the House for consideration of the House that will increase very substantially the penalties for persons who engage in this kind of activity and are found by the courts to have engaged in this kind of activity.</P>
    <P>Mr. Andrews: Hear, hear.  We would welcome it.  The Parliamentary Secretary will get our support on it, anyway.</P>
    <P>If one gets that kind of response during a debate on a Social Welfare Bill from the Opposition spokesman on Social Welfare one is entitled to assume that there is general agreement with regard to the desirability of this Bill and the penalties provided in it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be under the impression that a crime or an attempted crime is only serious or important if a big number of people commit or try to commit that crime. I cannot accept that view.  The number of people engaged in a fraudulent claim against the social welfare code does not take away from the seriousness of the offence.  It does not take <Col N="1893" /> away from the anti-social nature of the act.  We should not judge the desirability of deterrents in relation to the number of people who may or may not be engaged or could be assumed to be engaged in a particular behaviour. The fact that the behaviour is wrong, the degree of seriousness with which the Oireachtas views that wrong behaviour, can be and is interpreted by the courts by the maximum penalties prescribed under law.  I was gratified&mdash; I acknowledge this publicly&mdash;by the agreement of the Opposition spokeman, Deputy Andrews, that the number of persons who abused the social welfare code is relatively small and that the publicity given to the abuses blows it up completely out of proportion to the number engaged in them and the amount of money involved.  That is not the point.  Whether there is one abuse, hundreds of abuses or ten thousand abuses, we have to take it seriously.  We do not judge the position by the number of people involved but by the seriousness with which we view the offence.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3a:</P>
      <P>In page 5, after line 45, to add the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Children's Allowances Act, 1944 is hereby amended by&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the insertion in section 12 (1) of the following paragraph after paragraph (c):</P>
      <P>`(d) who buys, sells or offers for sale, takes or gives in exchange or pawns or takes in pawn any children's allowance book,'; and</P>
      <P>(b) the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (1)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>`(1A) In any proceedings under this section the Court shall have particular regard to the economic circumstances of <Col N="1896" /> the person selling, offering for sale or pawning such children's allowance Book.'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment arose out of a point I made in relation to the section on Second Stage.  My view is that there should be specific reference to the interchange of children's allowance books between the people who are probably under pressure and consequently need money and those so-called human beings who take the allowance book and give the unfortunate oppressed person money.  This amendment was moved by me to take account of the special circumstances, social and otherwise, that would require an unfortunate citizen of this State to hand over his or her children's allowance book to some person who would be anti-social enough to take that book and hand cash to the oppressed person in exchange for it.</P>
    <P>I agree&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary will no doubt make the point&mdash;that this amendment may reek of legislative piety, that there is no need for this pious intent in legislation and that its legal effect would appear to be nil.  I would accept, if that was to be the criticism, that this amendment is set down as a guide to the court to take into account the special circumstances of a citizen who would have to hand over his or her children's allowance book in exchange for money.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I propose this amendment on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The principle behind the amendment is to ensure that the oppressed person would be given special consideration and that the oppressor would not be given any consideration.  The person handing over the children's allowance book may be a person who in the normal way would do it whether he had money or not; but in the main you will find that there are people who have to deliver their children's allowance book to these people.</P>
    <P>In our society children are generally treated with a high degree of respect and have a prominent position in the average family.  If a mother is forced to dispose of her children's allowance book&mdash;an allowance which is specifically <Col N="1897" /> to cater for the child and to provide money to ensure that the child has food in its belly&mdash;she should be given special consideration by the court.  The maximum penalty should be inflicted on the person taking the allowance book.  One is open to the accusation that the amendment itself is somewhat flabby in the legislative sense.  Nevertheless, the intention of the amendment is important.  If the amendment is defective&mdash;and there is a possibility that it is&mdash;I would accede to the Parliamentary Secretary's request to withdraw it at this stage and to reintroduce it, perfected on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy, it is not necessary to accept the amendment in order to provide for the contingencies he says may arise.  Such situations are provided for adequately in section 9 of the Bill not only in respect of children's allowance books but in respect, also, of pension books and other such documentation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in relation to penalties, those laid down by the Oireachtas are the maximum which may be imposed.  There would be an obligation on a court to use their discretion in regard to all the circumstances obtaining in any case which may come before them, not least of which would be the mental anxiety and financial pressures on anyone who, technically, may be in breach of the law.  Therefore, I am sure that on reflection Deputy Andrews, as one associated with the courts, will accept, first, that it is not necessary to provide specifically for contingencies in respect of children's allowance books and, secondly, that it is the practice of the courts to take into consideration all the circumstances surrounding a defendant. We are merely setting down the maximum penalties that may be imposed.  There is hardly any Deputy who would wish us to interfere in any way with the normal discretion that can be exercised by the courts in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is correct in his observation <Col N="1898" /> that section 9 refers to children's allowances but if he refers to the section mentioned in section 9, that is, section 12 of the Children's Allowances Act, 1944 he will realise I was fully aware that penalties for the abuses in question are being increased by virtue of section 9 of this Bill.  What I wish to do is to add after section 12 (1) (c) of the 1944 Act a paragraph (d) as set out in my amendment.  As the Parliamentary Secretary stated, nobody in this House would suggest interfering with the discretion of the courts but in the circumstances of such a serious anti-social offence as that which we are contemplating here, it might be as well to spell out in legislation that particular regard would be had to the person who is oppressed by the oppressor.  Since there is so much talk of reforming social legislation, it would be no harm to include a provision of the type mentioned in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I could accept the amendment if it were not for the fact that the situation to which it refers is provided for already.  Surely Deputy Andrews is not suggesting that it is a lesser offence to take a person's old age pension book and use it in the way in which he suggests children's allowance books might be used.  I join with the Deputy in condemning the despicable behaviour of those who traffic in children's allowance books but I expect that such people are very small in number.  I expect, too, that with the development of the credit unions, this abuse is not practised as widely now as it may have been in the past.  While the very admirable development of the credit unions may not have eliminated these abuses, it has curtailed them considerably.  I cannot regard it as being a lesser offence against society to take advantage of an old age pensioner in regard to his pension than to take advantage of a mother in regard to children's allowances.  In section 9 we are making it an offence for anyone to traffic in relation to any of the documentation in regard to social welfare.  I do not think we can go further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, I am not opposing merely for the sake of <Col N="1899" /> opposing but I would remind Deputy Andrews that he has been one of the most vocal critics of the complexity of the social welfare code and that to accept unnecessary amendments to subsections of this Bill would complicate that code further.</P>
    <P>The decision as to what penalty, if any, and having regard to the maximum laid down by the Oireachtas, is a matter entirely for the discretion of the court and, no doubt, the elements referred to by the Deputy would be taken into consideration by the court in reaching their decision.</P>

      <P>In regard to conviction of an employer failing to stamp the cards of an employee, in the absence of the Parliamentary Secretary the last evening, I placed a lot of emphasis on this important section and appalling abuse.  At this stage of the Bill I feel the Parliamentary Secretary should give it very serious consideration. The problem is that where a man or woman may work for ten <Col N="1901" /> or 15 years not knowing that the employer is failing to stamp cards, and then makes an application for social welfare benefit, it is only then that the employee becomes aware of the fact. Yet the factory inspector, I understand, is supposed to check all documentation to ensure that the employer stamps all employees' cards.  There can be a lot of hardship involved here&mdash; of which I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware&mdash;when people may have to wait for months while an investigation continues by Departmental officials.  We should endeavour to bring about a more lenient approach where the employee is concerned.  I believe that, where evidence is submitted to the Department of Social Welfare, payment should be made forthwith to the employee rather than his having to await the outcome of a prolonged investigation.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it is time that some documentation was prepared by the Department and sent to an employer to be filled in by him every quarter, to be signed by an employee, whether a shopsteward or somebody of that kind in order to ensure that later, if and when there is abuse, the records will show that the person was in the employment of the employer at the time. After all, the employee has made a contribution, through the employer, to the Department of Social Welfare. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would give us a little more information as to how we can check this type of abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the seriousness of the type of offence Deputy Wyse has outlined.  Indeed, I welcome his comments on it and also his total condemnation of employers who engage in that practice.  I do not know of any case in which a period of time such as the Deputy mentioned, of ten to 15 years, elapsed before such abuse came to light. There have been cases where a couple of years have elapsed and we were not aware that the employer was not stamping the cards of a number of employees.  But, where this happens and we are satisfied there has been no collusion between the employee and the employer for the nonstamping <Col N="1902" /> of cards, we credit the employee with full benefit.  I would not be prepared to say that a long period of time elapses before payment is made.  Although I have been critical of delays in social welfare payments, I have been agreeably impressed by the speed with which officers of the Department have been able to establish whether or not collusion has taken place and implement clearance of payment of a particular benefit to employees who find themselves in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>In perpetrating such a practice not only is the employer defrauding the State but he is also robbing his own employees.  He is stopping their part of the contribution from their wages and using it for his own purposes, not forwarding it to the Department of Social Welfare, with total disregard for the consequences on those people in his employment.  The provision in this Bill for very substantially increased penalties for that type of practice, I hope, will act as a deterrent.  I hope such employers will realise now that the penalties that may be imposed by the courts are such that the risk is no longer a good one and that anybody who has been, or who may be anticipating, engaging in such practice will be deterred from doing so by the passage of this Bill.  I was glad to note, and appreciate, the highlighting of this aspect of abuse by Deputy Wyse.</P>

      <P>I must say I agree fully with this particular section but is it not true that there is little use in talking about fines and so on unless you have sufficient inspectors going about seeking out abuses?  There are reasons why the Minister is unable to employ more people as inspectors and that is why I am suggesting to the Parliamentary Secretary that there should be some form to be signed every month or, perhaps, every quarter by both the employer and the employee so that, should a dispute arise and there has been abuse, there would be some record in the Department. I know the Parliamentary Secretary is trying to come down on this particular abuse.  It is appalling. <Col N="1903" /> Last week I had six cases on my hands.  One was that of an individual who set up in business and after eight or nine months we could not find him and it is the unfortunate employees who suffer.  If there was a form proving that an employee was employed that would safeguard the Department and it would certainly help the employee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the fact that this is a very difficult problem.  As I said in my Second Reading speech, there are 88,000 registered employers and this is an extremely difficult area to police.  That is why we have enforced the law with regard to inspection of relevant books, and so on.  I also mentioned at the same time that I am examining the situation to find out whether it would be possible to give the right to a trade union representative to inspect all the cards of his members in a particular employment.  Under existing law an employee has the right to inspect his own card but there are inhibiting factors militating against an employee going up to his employer and saying he wants to see his insurance card, thereby implying he does not believe the employer is stamping the card.  If we could give the right to an accredited trade union representative, that should go a long way towards solving the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8a:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 37 to 41 and substitute &ldquo;the defendant shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a little bit of badinage about the intention behind section 11.  My proposition was that the onus of proof was being shifted onto the person accused of an alleged offence under the social welfare code and it appeared to me that was a wrong legal philosophical concept.  Clearly, that is the position here and that would appear to be the intention of the Parliamentary <Col N="1905" /> Secretary.  As we pointed out on the last occasion, we are operating here under the common law accusatorial system as distinct from the inquisatorial system and a person is presumed innocent until proved guilty.  That is to me a proper legal concept.  It is one to which we have been subscribing since we came under the common law code. The Parliamentary Secretary made the point on the last occasion that if what I suggested were accepted I would be encouraging people to make false statements and, arising out of these false statements, it would be a matter then for the Departmental officials, the Garda, or whoever it might be, to prove their case against the individual. That appears to me to be a reasonable proposition.  At present an accuser must prove his case against the accused and if the accused cannot produce evidence to convince the court, then the court finds him guilty of the offence.  The accuser must make his case and it is for the accused to rebut the allegations made against him.  The section, as it stands, reverses that situation.  The accused is guilty in the first instance and he must prove his innocence.  This is a dangerous departure, if my reading of the section is correct.  We did not have much of an opportunity to go into the matter in depth on the last occasion but no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will convince me that my interpretation is not altogether correct.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made the point that there are a number of precedents in relation to a section of this kind.  I have not the benefit of the back-up services available to him.  I should like to know if there are sections of this nature in other Acts under the social welfare code or is this the first time that such a section has been included? This is just a query and is not in any sense a trap for the Parliamentary Secretary.  If he thinks it is such, I do not wish him to reply to the query.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy qualified his remarks by saying that he may be under a misapprehension with regard to the section; his reading of it, as indicated by his amendment, bears out that he is under a misapprehension. <Col N="1906" /> The presumption of innocence until proved guilty is a fundamental provision of our legal system and it is not necessary to legislate specifically for it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned that if the accuser goes into court and presents his evidence the obligation lies with the accused to rebut it and he seeks to replace the following:</P>
      <P>the defendant shall be presumed to have given any information contained in the application (or to have caused it to be given on his behalf) and, where such information is false, with full knowledge of such falsity and with intent that it should deceive; but this presumption may be rebutted.</P>
      <P>What we are proposing is a departure with regard to social welfare legislation but there are a number of precedents. In this connection I would mention the Criminal Justice Act, 1964, and the Road Traffic Acts where this provision is quite common.  This is not a new feature of our legal system and in no way does it presume guilt. If a person makes an application and states certain alleged facts that are found to be untrue, it presumes that the person in making the application falsely stated the facts.  If this is not the case, the person has an opportunity in the courts of putting forward his case or of explaining where the mistake occurred.  I am glad the Deputy qualified his remarks at least by questioning the assumptions he made. There is no intention to change the onus of guilt to the accused person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has put an excellent defence of a bad case but nothing will convince me that the interpretation he has put on it is the correct one.  As we understand it, the section applies to the various enactments set out under subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f). The Parliamentary Secretary has made the important point that this is a completely new departure so far as the social welfare code is concerned. I do not understand why it is necessary at this late stage to introduce such a section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are making the case that where <Col N="1907" /> a person is accused he is brought into court on foot of statements made by him under the social welfare code.  In the first instance he has to rebut accusations made against him.  That appears to be shifting the onus of proof.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct and the Deputy knows it.  I do not mind his making a case but I object when he deliberately misinterprets and mis-states the situation.  In the first instance, the onus and responsibility would lie naturally with those making the accusation and the Deputy knows that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the Parliamentary Secretary is rushing to the defence of the indefensible.  I have put my case on my reading of section 11 (2) and this is why I introduced what I consider a gem of an amendment. It is a very fundamental amendment to ensure that the legal code is preserved against attack by legislation of this kind.  Let us go through section 11 (2). No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will help the innocent on this side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could find them I would be glad to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will accept that I am innocent until proved guilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Innocent of what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Innocent of misrepresentation, as the Parliamentary Secretary has suggested.  It is very unreasonable of the Parliamentary Secretary to make that case when he knows it is not so.  The very maximum I could be accused of would be misinterpretation but certainly not of misrepresentation.  That was never my intention.</P>
      <P>As it appears my amendment will not be accepted and because of some kind of agreement between the Whips. I do not wish to take up the time of the House for much longer.  I realise that there is a large backlog of legislation to be dealt with after this matter.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1908" /> Where in a prosecution for an offence under any of the Acts to which this section applies, or under regulations made under or applying the provisions of any of those Acts, it is shown to the satisfaction of the court&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that an application has been made by a person (in this section referred to as the defendant) for benefit, allowance, pension or assistance under any of the Acts to which this section applies, and</P>
    <P>(b) that as a result of that application benefit, allowance, pension or assistance under any of the Acts to which this section applies has been paid to any person (whether or not such benefit, allowance, pension or assistance was that applied for and whether or not it was paid to the defendant),</P>
    <P>the defendant shall be presumed to have given any information contained in the application (or to have caused it to be given on his behalf) and, where such information is false, with full knowledge of such falsity and with intent that it should deceive; but this presumption may be rebutted.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary in those circumstances to accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained to the Deputy, there is no intention&mdash; nor does this Bill try to shift the burden of proof from the accuser to the accused.  That is a fundamental principle in our law.  This Bill does nothing to change that.  The Deputy's amendment is totally unnecessary because it seeks to amend something which does not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary explain why this section has been inserted?  As he has stated, it is a new departure.  Would he explain in detail why he found it necessary to insert it in the legislation before us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this section, if people give information to the Departde <Col N="1909" /> ment and, on the basis of that information they are paid benefit or assistance, or money, or even if they are not paid, if they make application and seek to obtain it and the information they give is false, that will be used in any proceedings.  That is what the section seeks to do.  It will be entirely a matter for the courts whether or not they accept it as evidence.  That lies in the discretion of the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not answered my question. Why did the Government feel it necessary to insert what the Parliamentary Secretary has said is a new departure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Andrews made a most eloquent case in favour of the insertion of this during the Second Stage debate.  In his opening remarks he went through quite a long list of prosecutions under the various Social Welfare Acts.  He also stated there were quite a number of dismissals. It was found that it would help in ensuring that a conviction could be obtained where an offence had been committed if the statement of the person making the claim was before the courts and where it could be clearly shown to be false, but the onus was on the accuser to show there was a false statement and that no payments would have been made but for the fact that a false statement had been accepted as the truth, and that the statement was knowingly false when it was made.  It does not shift the onus of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As reported in Volume 291 of the Official Report of 22nd June, 1976, I argued persuasively against section 11.  I say that with all the humility at my disposal.  I made a fairly reasonable case which I extended here this afternoon about the shifting of the onus of proof.  The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that effectively section 11 is a new departure in legislation of this nature. That was an interesting comment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a new Bill.  There is a penalty of £2,000.  The provision for two years' imprisonment is a new <Col N="1910" /> departure.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the last opportunity we shall have of discussing the question of social welfare in Dáil Éireann for some months, can the Parliamentary Secretary tell the House what is the up-to-date position in relation to the consolidation of social welfare legislation?  As we have agreed, this is certainly an appalling prospect for any person, to have to measure up to consolidating social welfare legislation introduced since the foundation of the State.  It is, nevertheless, a prospect that has to be faced up to, because we cannot continue with the type of legislation which is now before us, namely, the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1976. The consolidation of social welfare legislation is one of the major and fundamental reforms required.  It is a huge problem and one that cannot be minimised.  It should not really be brought into the political arena, not that there is anything wrong with politics or politicians; personally, I feel privileged to be a politician.  However, there is, if not an immediate need for reform by way of consolidation in social welfare, a sense of urgency called for in the matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary might assist the House in this respect by giving us an up-to-date report on what progress has been made in regard to consolidation.</P>
      <P>The Government have apparently taken on themselves the mantle of being the heroes of the social welfare recipients and have, no doubt with the help of their propagandists and those people who have certain media outlets open to them, got across the view that they were almost entirely responsible for the social welfare code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but in talking about consolidation and about reform in the area of social welfare. <Col N="1914" /> I referred the Parliamentary Secretary specifically to the lengthy sections 4 and 8 and said it represented a departure for the Government in relation to their intended programme of social welfare reform, that the mind boggled when there were sections containing 160 lines in one instance and over 140 in another. Therefore, the consolidation of the social welfare code would be uppermost in our minds.  No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will come back with the argument that we were in Government for 16 years and so on, but on the basis of having been in Government for 16 years and more, we feel that we did discharge our functions in the whole area of social security in a proper fashion.  Maybe the Parliamentary Secretary would help us in respect of the question of consolidation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of what Deputy Andrews has contributed now I find has no relationship whatever to what we are supposed to be discussing on the Bill.  However, he did raise the question of consolidation.  I am somewhat surprised, because he raised the same question last week, and I gave the answer to it last week.  We are operating mainly under the 1952 Social Welfare Act.  I never heard the need for consolidation mentioned by a Fianna Fáil speaker until the last two years.  In fact, the first person to mention the question of consolidation in this House was myself in the Social Welfare Bill.  Deputy Andrews was realistic enough, when he raised the same issue last week, to acknowledge that it was a very complex and a very detailed operation.  Undoubtedly, he was correct in stating that.  The need for consolidation is probably more urgent now because there has been a lot of activity in the last three years in the social welfare field and there has been a lot of legislation.  The inactivity in the 16 years previous to that probably did not highlight the necessity for consolidation of the social welfare code as much.  That might be the possible explanation why it has now dawned on some of the Fianna Fáil spokesmen that there is need for consolidation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1915" /> As I said last week, in reply to the same query by the same Deputy, a draft Bill is with the Attorney General. We have made very substantial progress in a very complex and a very detailed area.  It is my hope that a consolidation Bill will be before the Dáil in the autumn.  I accept the point made by Deputy Andrews of the desirability of such a Bill.  I hope when the Bill is out that it will help Deputies and others concerned in the field of social welfare in their work and in their research.  I do not believe there are any other issues raised by Deputy Andrews on this Bill which call for reply.  I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the House for the way, in the main, the Bill was dealt with.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that under the Premium Employment Act, 1975, which was passed in July last year, the premium employment programme was launched to provide financial incentives to employers to take on workers who had lost their jobs.  Under the programme, two separate schemes were inaugurated, one for certain manufacturing industries and the other for agriculture.  The currency of both schemes expired on 26th June, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As already announced in the course of my speech on 26th May, 1976, on the Estimate for my Department, I propose to extend the duration of both schemes for roughly a further six months.  The purpose of the amending legislation, as indicated in section 1 of the Bill now before the House, is to obtain statutory authority for the proposed extension.  The proposed new termination date referred to in the Bill&mdash;8th January, 1977&mdash;was adopted so as to coincide with the fourweek payment cycle up to the end of December, 1976.  The reason for prescribing the commencement date&mdash; 26th June, 1976&mdash;in section 2 of the <Col N="1916" /> Bill is to preserve the continuity of the schemes from the previous termination date, as prescribed in the 1975 Act, up to the new termination date on 8th January next.</P>
    <P>During the past year certain modifications were made in the original programme.  For instance, the scope of the scheme for manufacturing industries was extended to include food processing, which had been omitted initially, with effect from 5th December, 1975, after the seasonal peak in that industry had passed.</P>
    <P>In addition, the premium rates were improved.  Initially, the premium rate per eligible worker was fixed at £12 per week up to 3rd April, 1976, after which it was to be reduced to £6 per week for the period 4th April, 1976, to 26th June, 1976.  However, as I already announced in this House, the amount of the premium has been raised to £15 per week with effect from 4th April, 1976, instead of being reduced to £6 as originally envisaged. The second-phase rate, which has been increased from £6 per week to £7.50, will now apply from 19th September, 1976.</P>
    <P>The basic objective of the premium employment programme is to get as many as possible unemployed workers restored to employment as quickly as possible.  The State pays a subsidy of £15 per week to an employer for additional unemployed workers taken on over and above the number employed as at 20th June, 1975.  It is a condition of the programme that the unemployed worker must have received unemployment benefit at least once since June, 1974, and was signing-on at an Employment Exchange or attending an AnCO training centre for at least four weeks prior to being re-employed.</P>
    <P>The total number of workers who have been re-employed to date under the programme is over 5,000.  The vast majority of these workers were re-employed in manufacturing industry. I am encouraged by the fact that these workers might otherwise be still without a job but for the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I must say, however, that I am far from satisfied about the extent to <Col N="1917" /> which the scheme has been used up to now.  However, with growing evidence that there is now a prospect of a recovery in the economy, there should be a greater incentive for employers to take on additional workers in the expectation that the level of demand both in the domestic and export markets will increase. The latest CII/ESRI business survey, which was taken in the first three weeks in May, showed that the recovery in economic activity had in the main continued, though at a slightly reduced rate.  The level of exports has continued to improve and over the next few months the forecast was that production would continue to increase as would exports. Home sales were also expected to remain stable.</P>
    <P>As far as unemployment is concerned, the latest live register figures are those for the week ending 18th June, 1976, which showed that the number of persons on the register on that date was 109,700.  This represents a decline of over 500 on the previous week.  Apart from slight increases in two successive weeks in early April this year, the number on the live register has fallen steadily from its peak of 118,427 on 13th February.  At the same time the difference in the level of unemployment between the two years is also narrowing.  For instance, on 9th January, 1976, the level of unemployment was over 21,000 above the corresponding level for last year. On 18th June this year the difference, compared with the corresponding week last year, had dropped to slightly over 7,500.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that we should capitalise to the greatest extent possible on any opportunities to take up the slack in our productive capacity and thereby reduce unemployment. The Government, as an example of their determination to take positive action to help those who are without jobs, have decided to seek the approval of the Oireachtas to extend the duration of the premium employment programme schemes until the end of the year.</P>
    <P>While the increase in the amount <Col N="1918" /> of the weekly premium to £15 should help to make the scheme more attractive, I have also arranged, in addition a publicity campaign in the newspapers, for the National Manpower Service of my Department and for AnCO, through their training advisers, to undertake an intensive canvass of employers to again bring to their notice details of the scheme and to encourage them to take advantage of it over the next six months or so. I also arranged to have eligible employers in manufacturing industry circularised, by post, about the improvements and extension of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Because of the higher rate of premium now applicable and in anticipation of an increase in the volume of payments, the present provision of £1.25 million in my Department's Vote for the current year may be inadequate. If it is I shall be very glad to introduce a Supplementary Estimate before the end of the present year to meet the extra financial commitments involved, because it will be sure evidence of a speedy pick-up in the economy.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy for 1976 is to give priority to expenditure that would promote growth and sustain or increase employment.  The premium employment programme is one component of that strategy.  One of the scheme's attractions is that its effects are immediate inasmuch as people are immediately restored to gainful employment.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted that the Bill provides for retrospection of the scheme to 26th June, 1976 on which date the original scheme expired.  I am anxious to avoid any interruption of payments to employers which might be occasioned by possible delay in enacting the new legislation.  For that reason, I would urge the House to give this measure a speedy passage.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When the forerunner of this Bill was introduced in this House about a year ago I, on behalf of my party, expressed support for it and went a bit further to say that it had about it an imagination that up to then had been non-existent with this Minister for Labour and, <Col N="1919" /> indeed, with his Government regarding the helping of people to be re-employed. Of course, my party and I support the meagre, miserable extension offered by this current Bill.</P>
      <P>I cannot commend anybody for any imagination on this occasion.  When the Bill was introduced a year ago we went to extremes and made pleas to the Minister to extend the scope of the Bill to cover industries not covered by that Bill.  He ignored completely or almost completely the pleas we made to him and left out those areas where the highest unemployment was suffered in the intervening period.  We asked him to have agriculture included.  He did, I think, when it went to the Seanad.  We asked him to have food processing entirely included.  He did, at the tail end of last year, six months later.  We asked him to include the building industry. He has made no move on that yet. We asked him to include the service industry, nor has he made any move there either.</P>
      <P>To support what I am saying with regard to lack of imagination shown by the Minister on this occasion, I would say at this stage that it is tantamount to criminal negligence the way the Minister for Labour and his Government have neglected the unemployed and have continued to do so.  He has given us the usual sort of propaganda in his Second Stage speech here that we know now it is just like beating empty drums and empty vessels.  I will in the course of my remarks here set out to disprove some of the points and claims he is making, and compare them with what he said a year ago.  The fundamental difficulty we are experiencing is that we have a Minister for Labour who not only is incompetent but, in addition, is showing a complete lack of interest, as, indeed, are his Government, in the field of employment generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To elaborate on the points I have made regarding the narrow format of the scheme, I take an answer which I got today to a query of mine on the total number of people employed under the premium employment programme, 1975.  When that programme <Col N="1920" /> was introduced in this House the Minister said that the target of that programme was 10,000 jobs.  I said to him that we needed no top limit, that we hope that 10,000 would be the minimum number of jobs created.  To help to create them we suggested that the scope of the scheme be broadened to include industries where reasonable numbers may well be employed.  The Minister, of course, in a typical manner despite utterances he may make otherwise, buried his head in the sand and said, of course, that £1.25 million had been provided in the Estimates and more would be provided if necessary. What did we spend?  What has been spent after a year of that scheme? £656,000, approximately half, 50 per cent of what was provided in the Estimates last year.  Worse than that, that is the gross expenditure of 50 per cent, but the net cost to the State is probably somewhere in the neighbourhood of 20 to 25 per cent, because when one breaks down the £656,000 one will find that those people who were re-employed, both themselves and their employers, contributed to a social welfare stamp in the first instance.  Many of them, I have no doubt, paid income tax.  Therefore, you will find that the net cost to the State was an awful lot less, certainly less than half of the £656,000 spent on that scheme to date.</P>
    <P>In addition to those gains and advantages for the State there was, of course, a very important aspect, a very important human factor, where the social or morale-restoring job provided for the person came into play or into consideration.  We have been listening to the Minister earlier this evening, to the pleas of this Government and their reference to social welfare. If they can claim credit&mdash;and I put a very big &ldquo;if&rdquo; there&mdash;or if, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, they were heroes in that regard, they are the damned opposite with regard to their efforts on behalf of the unemployed. If we analyse, we have 5,185 jobs created out of the target of 10,000 jobs after a year, 12 whole months elapsing.  That is half the target.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the points I made earlier, to the two extensions of the scheme.  The Minister extended the food processing in December and <Col N="1921" /> he created by that extension 33 extra jobs.  He extended agriculture around the time the Bill was introduced last year.  He created 32 extra jobs.  Those 65 jobs were very welcome.  They were an extension to the scheme, but we should look at the other areas where he might have extended the scope of it and the other industries he might have included.  We can examine the increase there has been in unemployment in what one could say is the intervening period, while not exactly, because the figures from the Central Statistics Office, although dated June, would, of course, refer to the period between mid-March last year and mid-March this year.  During that period if we take the building industry&mdash;and remember the building industry is our second largest&mdash;not only does it react quickly to promptings and assistance but the many allied industries, the many industries closely connected with it also react if money is expended in the building industry.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister in typical fashion will come back here to me this evening and he will say: &ldquo;But we have provided money here by way of capital expenditure&rdquo;.  This is necessary and has always been necessary but at a time of high unemployment we must use our imagination a little bit.</P>
    <P>If this Minister has failed the country it is a heavy responsibility on his shoulders and posterity will not easily forget that to him.  This Government's approach to all areas of employment has been a negative one.  Until a positive, aggressive attitude is adopted by them there will be no worth-while improvement. There is no point in the Minister claiming in his speech credit for reductions that are far lower than should be the case at this time of seasonal improvement.  We are talking about the best months of the year for employment.  At this time of the year we must think of the prospects between now and next December and January.</P>
    <P>In the course of his statement the Minister said:</P>
    <P>However, with growing evidence that there is now a prospect of a recovery in the economy, there <Col N="1922" /> should be a greater incentive for employers to take on additional workers in the expectation that the level of demand both in the domestic and export markets will increase.</P>
    <P>I should like to give further quotations from a speech made by the Minister when introducing this Bill last year and they will be ample evidence of how little we can depend on him for forecasting what is likely to happen.  I should now like to quote from Volume 284, column 1062, of the Official Report where the Minister said:</P>
    <P>This is an endeavour to bring us up to the period of general recovery which, it is generally anticipated, will occur in the spring or early summer of next year.</P>
    <P>We have not seen that recovery in the spring or early summer; I wish to goodness we had.  At column 503 of the same Volume of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The real purpose of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It&rdquo; is the premium employment programme.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;is to aid the areas worst hit which are in manufacturing industry. It is our idea that it should be a programme that would be easy to administer and effective.  It is only a temporary programme to take us through these months ahead to the summer of regrowth.</P>
    <P>Just 12 months later we are introducing an extension to the premium employment programme, an extension that is absolutely inadequate in the unemployment climate we have.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of people unemployed in the building industry between March, 1975, and March of this year was 5,243.  That industry was not included in the programme. Surely, if it was included we could have reduced that figure in some way with obvious benefits.  We would have had a saving in the amount of money paid out in unemployment benefit to people involved in that industry. The service industries were not included.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a few of the service industries.  The increase <Col N="1923" /> in unemployment in the distributive trades was 1,101, but the Minister did not think it worth his while to include it.  In &ldquo;personal services&rdquo; which includes hotels, clubs, restaurants and public houses the increase in the number unemployed was 1,017 but the Minister did not think it worth his while to try and reduce that figure. In transport and communication the figure was 1,013 and that was not included.  The number unemployed in those industries is very high and this has meant that the Exchequer has had to pay out a huge amount under social welfare.  The alternative would have meant that while we would have had a pay out by the Department of Labour we would have had a big saving in the Department of Social Welfare. That would have been in excess of any amount paid out under the premium employment programme by the Department of Labour.  That is simple mathematics and it is hard to understand why the Minister has restricted the scheme so much, particularly in view of the fact that he provided £1¼ million last year and had a gross expenditure of half of it.  There was an obvious overall saving for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The size of the premium has been increased to £15 but it will only remain at that figure until 19th September. From September to January the gross pay out will only be in the region of £7.50.  Where is the initiative being shown here?  Where is the Minister showing any imagination, even though he is responsible for employment? There is no initiative or imagination being shown by him.  We were told recently that up to the end of March £38½ million was paid out in unemployment benefit and £6¼ million was paid out in pay related benefit while unemployment assistance amounted to £42½ million.  That makes a total of £87¼ million but that does not include redundancy payments or the morale shattering aspect suffered by people during periods of unemployment.  The Minister has the audacity to tell us that his Department had spent a miserable £600 on this scheme to date.  The Exchequer, therefore, saved substantially.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1924" /> I would ask the Minister why he will not sensibly extend the scope of this scheme to cover industries where new jobs might be created.  I fully realise the necessity for regulations to prevent abuses of the scheme.  I raised questions a year ago regarding the four-week qualifying limit on the live register.  Our real unemployment figures are not those as expressed by the Minister or the live register: the real figures for those seeking employment at present must be in the region of 180,000 people.  This figure includes the 110,0000 unemployed, the 1975 school leavers who have failed to find employment and who are not as yet included in the live register, and this year's school leavers who are also on the employment market.  There is no point in discussing hypothetical figures.  A large number of school leavers have to be added to the live register.</P>
    <P>I remember the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach trying to defend the live register.  He said that it did not vary from the way it was prepared over the years.  That may be so, but it is no defence for a situation that has caused frustration for many parents, particularly for parents whose 1975 school leavers failed to find employment and whose brothers and sisters will be joining the queue in 1976.  There is no imagination or worth-while effort in this document. There is a small extension to a scheme that has already proved inadequate, that has not realised the target set for it by this Minister.  Is it laziness, inexperience or lack of concern that is inspiring him to allow these things to happen?  There must be some explanation. Unless this Minister realises that he has to grasp the evil of unemployment in a positive way there can be no future for our people.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister and some other Government speakers have said that we have not put any positive proposals before the House for improving the unemployment situation. I have spelt them out on a number of occasions.  I am not entitled to spell them out under this Bill but there are, even within the limitations <Col N="1925" /> of this Bill, areas for improving it. Two areas that come quickly to mind are the building industry and the service industry.  I have given figures to substantiate the big increase in unemployment in those industries between March, 1975, and March, 1976.</P>
    <P>This Bill reminds me of a leaking roof.  The Minister is plugging the pinholes and leaving the large holes open.  Surely the 65 jobs that were created in the two extensions made by the Minister could have been augmented by many hundreds if he had included the building and service industries a year ago.  Why are we confining it to manufacturing industry?  I realise the necessity to support manufacturing industry, but this Minister has made no effort to sustain or support ailing manufacturing industry.  In his reply today the Minister said that, of the 5,185 jobs recreated under the premium employment programme, 2,022 of them belong to the textile industry. When we appealed for assistance for the textile industry the Government allowed many factories to close in my constituency and in many others.  I am glad that 2,022 jobs have been recreated but I would venture to say that, had the Government and the Minister moved in time, many more jobs would have been saved in the textile industry.  There is still an area of the textile industry&mdash;the blanket industry&mdash;that is suffering severely. Two Ministers have been appealed to for assistance but they have refused to budge.  The blanket industry is going through tough times and is not in a position to avail of this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour has been a total failure.  His Government have criminally neglected the workers.  We will support this small effort but it is inadequate.  Are we trying to save another £600,000 on the Estimate in order to divert it somewhere else? Is the Minister genuine in saying that he would be very happy to look for extra money to increase the £1.25 million voted for his Department's Estimate for the current year if it is found to be inadequate?  Can we be expected to have confidence in his prediction?  The increase to £15 was <Col N="1926" /> announced with a fanfare of trumpets but there was little ballyhoo about the reduction to £7.50 which is to be affected in September, less than three months from now.  One can only hope that more than the £1.25 million will be needed but I find it difficult to believe that this will be the case.</P>
    <P>In a few months' time, too, we will be faced with the seasonal decline in employment.  We are now almost at the peak of the season in respect of employment but the decline usually begins sometime after the August holidays.  Therefore, a more extensive employment premium programme would be desirable at that time.  Any criticism offered from this side of the House is intended to be constructive. We support any vehicle which the Minister may use in an effort to recreate jobs, but we have not heard yet from him either in this House or elsewhere a worth-while reason for excluding from this legislation the building industry and the service industry.</P>
    <P>Last year he told us that this employment premium was serving two purposes: the creation of jobs and the assisting of manufacturing industry so as to tide them over a difficult period.  There is no argument for excluding any industry in which jobs may be created because every job created as a result of this scheme represents a saving to the economy. It was suggested last year from speakers on this side of the House that the scheme could be extended to local government employees.  If that point was valid last year it is more valid this year when most local councils are struggling to maintain their present volume of employment until the end of the year.  Another reason for including local authorities would be that the scheme might create further jobs especially since there is so much necessary and productive work to be done.  More important, though, is the wish of most Irish people to be at work rather than to be depending on the soul-destroying but so necessary social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House further as there are other Deputies who wish to contribute.  There is an urgency <Col N="1927" /> about this legislation.  While supporting any measure that will help to put people back at work we deplore the incompetence of the Minister and his lack of interest in doing anything worth while in relation to employment. Indeed, he has not even continued the decent bit of imagination that I credited him with displaying a year ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never seen a poorer attempt than this to cope with the employment problem.  The Minister places much emphasis on the live register as if that was the main consideration in dealing with the unemployment situation.  Unless he rids himself of his cavalier attitude to this problem and comes before us with some imaginative legislation we shall have to examine seriously his role as Minister and the manner in which he is mishandling the Department of Labour.  However, it may not be totally fair to blame him solely for the situation.  One could say that there is collective Government responsibility but that concept, like many other tenets of our democracy, is fast disappearing.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that the previous legislation in this sphere has resulted in 5,000 people obtaining jobs but, despite pleas from this side of the House, he has not agreed to extend the legislation to the construction industry in which there are 25,000 operatives unemployed.  In addition, there is the factor that in this city alone we need at least 12,000 new dwellings.  The extension of the scheme to the construction industry would give a much-needed impetus to that industry.  Apart from adopting the role of criticising the Opposition for allegedly not suggesting suitable ways of coping with the unemployment problem, the Government would appear to have lulled themselves into believing that there is nothing they can do to help.  There has been no imaginative thinking from them in this area.  We get little contribution from the think-tanks of the Government towards any reduction in the frightful unemployment figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Fitzgerald pointed out, if we examine the unemployment <Col N="1928" /> figures and take into account people who cannot get jobs&mdash;those who never appeared on the live register because they could never get a job&mdash;this year yet again, in a few weeks or so, there will be another 50,000 people, those leaving third level education.  Luckily some of them will get jobs but the great majority will not.  Even if 10,000 people are employed under this new chapter in employment, we will be thankful but it must be judged against the total number without jobs.  I am no expert on agriculture but I do see many facets of it that could benefit enormously from a real effort to support it, from a Government attempt to attract more people into it.  We could point to a dozen different industries which could benefit.  But I do not think the Government or the Minister have the will to come and say: &ldquo;Look, here we have a radical programme for tackling unemployment&rdquo; because nobody could call this the radical thinking of a semi-socialist Government.  Right-wing conservatives in some of the most Right-wing countries in the world would reject this legislation as a serious attempt by the Minister to do the job he suggests he is here to do.  Could the Minister not have included a proposal that where a firm takes on young people to train them they be given some bonus.  Such would encourage employers to take on young people who may want to be bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers, printers and so on. Surely the Minister could have worked out some type of scheme with the trade unions which would have made it attractive for employers to take on young people in industry.</P>
    <P>I want to praise AnCO on their efforts.  Certainly they do try to train more and more people.  But as imaginative or constructive thinking is not forthcoming from the Government, it is very difficult to get people to be enthusiastic about a great economic recovery, for which we hope, and which the Government promise all the time is just around the corner.</P>
    <P>I have often thought it ironic that this is called the premium employment programme.  Somebody advertising it used capitals for the initial <Col N="1929" /> letters, so that we had something called PEP.  PEP is an in word nowadays. Whatever this Bill may have, certainly it is not pep.  I feel the Minister realises that himself and knows it will not succeed to any great extent. It may give the impression or fool the weak-minded into thinking that something is being done but we know it is too little and probably too late to curb the growing unemployment.  The Minister will have to look to broader horizons when reviewing the situation of the live register.</P>
    <P>With regard to a radical programme &mdash;and here I may be straying somewhat from the Bill&mdash;sometime ago in the House the Minister and his colleagues told us that the banks were simply bursting with money, that they wanted to give it away in order to generate greater economic activity. While the banks' money may not be available this week or next, the trouble there will have to end some time. Could the Minister not approach the banks again and say: &ldquo;If you have got so much money in your coffers, if you want to play an effective role in regenerating our economy, we will put before the country a plan under which the money lying idle will be used to take people off the unemployment exchanges, give them work, so that we can build a better society.&rdquo; But we will not build a new Jerusalem through the efforts of this Government. We are facing a situation in which there may well be grave social unrest because we have got so many people unemployed and so many young people who cannot obtain employment. It is much later than the Minister thinks.  I would suggest that, in the interests of all of us, he try to do a lot better next time he introduces a Bill such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Fitzgerald said, nobody on this side of the House wants to hold up the passage of this Bill.  The amount of money being provided is totally inadequate.  We on this side of the House have been complaining about borrowed moneys for various purposes but none of us would complain to the Minister at money borrowed in order to get people back to work.  I spell out here this evening&mdash;<Col N="1930" /> and I hope the Minister understands it&mdash;the very serious situation of young, educated people who cannot get a job. It is the most serious situation we have had to face for years.  Furthermore, they cannot go abroad to obtain employment. Therefore, we must try to provide it.  I would be prepared to do this across the board for everybody who would employ a person at present unemployed, particularly younger people leaving school who cannot get jobs.  Deputy Moore mentioned a few moments ago the dangers of these people who are educated, with minds that want to be working on something.  If they cannot get work, I do not know what will be the thinking of those young minds. They feel the State owes them that, that it should provide them with a job.</P>
      <P>I am not at all happy with this small amount of money being made available in an effort to get people back to work.  I will support and vote for it but it is a miserable sum.  I would do it right across the board for everybody who would take a person off the unemployment register or from the dole queues.  The reason I say so is that a certain businessman came to me and said he would be prepared to add a couple of young people to his staff provided he got this premium. For example, local authorities could employ a lot of people.  I would borrow&mdash;and make no excuse to anybody &mdash;for this purpose and I believe the State would gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness, I should say to the Minister that I have not, offhand, the answer to the unemployment situation but I do believe that this is an emergency measure only.  The State will have to play a bigger part&mdash;by all means it should assist private enterprise and anybody who employs people&mdash;and act quickly to try to get people, particularly the younger people, off the dole queues.  If we do not, they will react violently.  I do not want to prophesy but I know young people, looking at this House, are asking what we have to offer.  They want jobs.  They are educated and they cannot get work.  This sum of money provided here is utterly ridiculous. Not alone that but it should be given <Col N="1931" /> across the board.  I agree that no young person and, for that matter, no not so young person wants to be on the dole queue.  The majority want work and there is an obligation on the State to provide work for them.</P>
    <P>There is no longer any outlet for our young people.  The emigrant ship is no longer there.  It should be a top priority for all parties here to see that the unemployed are put back to work. Last year a large number of school leavers could find no employment. This year that number will be increased by those leaving school this year.  What have we to offer them? Has democracy failed?  That is what the young people are asking.  We must put our heads together to solve the problem and I would like to see an all-party committee of this House getting together to solve the problem.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill. An incentive is necessary in order to provide employment for young men and women and for the not so young also who, through no fault of their own, have lost employment.  Even if the employment situation improves, this scheme will still be an incentive because it will be a bonus.  On an earlier measure I pressed for the inclusion of agriculture in this scheme. I welcome its extension now to agriculture and so will many farmers. There is widespread scope for the development of employment in agriculture and there is a growing need in that industry for young active men and women.  I would go further now and suggest that local authorities might become involved in this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated. Many doubting Thomases said the Bill, when first introduced, would not have the effects it did have.  I believe good progress has been made.  I represent a rural constituency and certainly Laois-Offaly have reaped the benefits of this scheme.  Were it not for the scheme many of the industries giving employment there today might never have got off the ground.  This scheme helps to meet overheads and costs. It goes some way towards paying the price of the social welfare stamp.  The cost to the Exchequer is not prohibitive <Col N="1932" /> when one considers the return from productive employment and there is a saving, too, from the point of view of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>I see the date here is 8th January, 1977.  I do not think it is wise to have any curtailment and I would have left it open.  I certainly believe the Minister was right in his approach originally.  The scheme has proved beneficial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to ask once more for the co-operation of employers.  Thousands of young people have been brought back into gainful employment by means of this scheme.  I ask all personnel management and production planners now to consider seriously the advantages.  I have asked all our manpower offices to contact local employers to examine afresh the steps by which this scheme at the new rates may, with co-operation from employers, succeed in reducing local unemployment.  Traders councils and chambers of commerce can assist by informing affiliated members of the advantages of the scheme.  I am especially anxious that the scheme should be availed of by those industries most seriously affected by the recession.  I refer to the textile, footwear and engineering industries.  That is not to say that the scheme cannot assist new industries.  It can assist such industries as pharmaceuticals, electronics and the petro-chemical industry which are still in their growth stages.  The premium by providing an incentive to employers to increase their workforce ahead of requirements puts them in a better position to expand production ultimately.  There is some evidence that the level of recession in some of our industries has now been reduced to a level consistent with a slowing down in overall demand.  We should not allow that situation to persist for so long that we are unable to meet the initial surge of demand that is sure to come.  The PEP will make it easier for employees to get a job and for employers to offer employment.  I would appeal to the employer who is delaying taking on workers until he sees more positive signs of an upturn; <Col N="1933" /> the programme gives him a substantial inducement to take on new workers.</P>
      <P>In previous recessions one could say that unemployment lasted longer than necessary because employers traditionally met improvements in demand after a recession by increasing the overtime rather than the number of workers on the payroll.  This programme will enable employers to take on workers now in anticipation of the improvement that is already evident in other economies and the signs of which are appearing in our economy.</P>
      <P>The international economic position is brighter than it was, the growth rates of the major economies are improving and there are signs of a new level of international co-operation in the management of world economies.  The agreements reached on planned growth in the OECD and in the EEC suggests that recovery can be sustained without a recurrence of extreme inflationary pressures.  We were unable to attend the tripartite meeting in Luxembourg last week because of the lack of agreement on pairing arrangements.  This country played a large part in bringing about that meeting; we put emphasis on the social policy of the Community, we considered there should be this meeting regarding the social and economic policy of the EEC and we maintained that the Community should answer up to the jobs crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the meeting in Luxembourg last week it was agreed that a growth rate of 5 per cent per annum should be targeted for with the objective of reaching a satisfactory level of employment by 1980.  It is not to claim too much, rather it is to be accurate, to say that in Ireland unemployment, seasonally adjusted, stabilised during the second quarter of this year.  In absolute terms, the numbers on the live register dropped by about 9,000 people.  It is not to claim too much but it is a point of hope that must be noted since it is accurate and based on scientific evidence that the pattern observable in the employment situation here is in contrast to that prevailing in Northern Ireland and Great Britain <Col N="1934" /> where unemployment continues to rise.  This would seem to confirm that the pattern of unemployment here is now more closely approximating to that in the rest of the EEC rather than Britain, as was traditionally the case.  Before our entry into the EEC, our unemployment position went hand-in-hand with what happened in Britain.  We are now seeing increasing evidence that because of the growing dependence of our economy on the EEC our employment pattern and the structure of our economy is becoming more closely aligned with that of the more modern economies in the rest of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is unacceptably high and nobody will deny that, but it is a fact that it is coming down in Ireland.  That is a matter of cold statistics.  There are still too many people unemployed but we should note the encouraging signs and see what they confirm, namely, that our unemployment pattern is becoming more aligned with the rest of the Community.  Of course, the position in the rest of the Community leaves little room for complacency.  There are still too many people unemployed in the EEC.  We have been seeking a response at Community level to these problems.</P>
    <P>There is one great reservation that must be applied when talking about the unemployment situation here.  If we are to maintain this more hopeful tendency, of our economy being aligned with the position in the other mainland economies of the Community, it is essential that our economic industrial costs be held at levels that will facilitate a significant and early reduction of present unemployment. It is essential that those costs be kept down if we are to have an early and significant reduction in the present unemployment figure.</P>
    <P>I would not claim that the programme we are discussing is the answer to our unemployment crisis. It is not, but it is a component in the overall answer.  It is an element that we thought would be helpful in inducing employers to take on workers during the recession.  It is true that I set an objective of 10,000 people to be <Col N="1935" /> re-employed under this programme and it is true that has not been realised. The programme needs the co-operation of employers if it is to be successful.  If the employers do not consider it is in their interests to bring new employees into the work force, the programme will remain underutilised and, obviously, that happened during most of last year.  Despite the most energetic attempts of officers of my Department, of the National Manpower Service and of the training authority, the total of our efforts were 5,000 people back at work.  However, we need not be ashamed of that figure.  Some 5,000 Irish people have got jobs because of the programme and for this alone the programme has been worth while.  Certainly it vindicates those who believed that an extension of the programme was called for and who argued for improving the financial inducements.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of the re-employed workers came back into manufacturing industry.  The scheme was drawn up to help industries that were in a serious situation and there is no doubt that those 5,000 workers would still be out of work were it not for the existence of this programme.  Deputies on all sides who have spoken on this measure in the House and who have supported it should feel some satisfaction that the fruit of our legislative endeavour had this practical good effect for so many Irish people.  There is a great deal of rhetoric spoken on the subject of unemployment but in this instance many Irish people have been brought back into employment.  We should not think the measure was not worth while.  It has been of great value.</P>
    <P>I am far from satisfied regarding the extent to which the scheme has been used.  There is evidence that as the economy improves the new incentives will be utilised even more by employers. The increase to £15 per week should encourage those employers who up to now have been reluctant to avail of the scheme.  We heard from Members opposite some of the criticisms that were mentioned previously.  Probably the one heard most often is the reference to the construction industry.  The explanation <Col N="1936" /> has been given before.  The officers of my Department and I would like to see the programme applied to the building industry but, after the most careful consideration, reluctantly we came to the conclusion that the pattern of employment in the industry and the constant job-changing between firms make it unsuitable for the programme. We held many meetings to see whether there was any way of getting over these difficulties but none could be found.</P>
    <P>The programme is intended to help those industries which have suffered because of the recession.  It is not intended to assist industries or services with an improvement in their employment position as a result of seasonal factors.  The thrust of the programme has been to assist those industries worst hit by the recession.  Having examined the matter pretty exhaustively, we came to the conclusion that the building industry could not be assisted by this programme and that it is better assisted, as it is assisted, by capital grants paid to it.  I will not detain the House by detailing once more the assistance which has been provided to the industry by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the factors which lead to the exclusion of the building industry from this programme are the subcontracting features of the industry which would lead to the possibility of very widespread abuse of the scheme, the diversification of a firm's business between different sites which would make it difficult to administer, the high degree of inter-firm mobility, the seasonal nature of the industry, the difficulty in establishing a base figure, and the most conclusive reason of all, that the industry is most suited to other types of incentives such as financial stimuli under the capital programme and budgetary measures. The industry has had ample help from these sources.  The same arguments apply to assistance to local authorities. This in an area better assisted by the Exchequer.  This programme is not appropriate for assistance in that area. I do not mean it in any derogatory way when I say most of the criticisms voiced about the working of the programme were heard here before, and I have no doubt they will be heard <Col N="1937" /> again.  In their heart of hearts Deputies will accept that this is a very constructive programme.  It has proved its worth in practice.  Its extension at enhanced rates at an extended level is fully justified.  People concerned with manpower planning in industries such as bacon factories, flour confectionery, cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery, margarine, distilling, malting, brewing, tobacco, the full range of our manufacturing industries to which the programme is applicable, now know that in the extended scheme they have a means whereby they can bring back extra workers at a time when it is in their own best interests to bring back workers.  There are signs of a recovery in our own economy, and more definite signs in the neighbouring economies with which we trade.</P>

      <P>He is long-term unemployed.  The programme is intended to help those industries affected by the recent recession.  There is a limitation on the programme.  It is <Col N="1938" /> not regarded as the answer to all aspects of unemployment because the main thrust of the Government in this area is through the budget and bodies like the IDA who deal with job creation. This is a limited measure to assist certain of our industries hit by the recession and to bring workers who lost jobs in those industries back to work.  The programme is geared in that direction.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have submitted a number of amendments on this section but for a number of reasons I decided otherwise.  When several amendments were submitted a year ago they were ruled out of order as imposing extra charges on the Exchequer.  I disputed that with you then, Sir, and I did not want a repetition of that dispute on this occasion.</P>
      <P>The Bill says the scheme so far as it applies to agriculture shall come into operation on 3rd August, 1975, and so far as it relates to manufacturing industries shall be deemed to have come into operation on 29th June, 1975.  The only difference is the extension to 8th January, 1977, from 6th June, 1976.  A year ago we believed this scheme showed some imagination but it was allowed by the Minister to drag its feet because its confines were too narrow.  There is no point in saying 5,000 were employed under this scheme who might not have been employed otherwise.  If the Minister had accepted our amendment, 10,000 people could have been employed as was envisaged when the £1.25 million was provided.  The fact that only half that sum was spent is an indictment of the operation of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the reasons why the construction industry and the services industry were not included. <Col N="1939" /> The reasons advanced by him do not stand up to examination or investigation. There is no reason whatever why they could not have been included. I take the point about the extension of the date.  We support the concept of the scheme, but we blame the Minister for continuing to confine its scope. It is too narrow to be as effective as it might otherwise be.  I want to be constructive.  The Minister advanced a number of reasons why the building industry was not included.  I accept that there are certain difficulties, but that is not an adequate defence.  Nor is the other explanation he gave adequate, that the Government's way of assisting the building industry is entirely different and that it is by way of capital investment.  Speaking on Second Stage, I predicted that answer. According to some statistics, 5,243 more jobs were lost in the building industry in a certain period.  In view of that, surely an effort should have been made to overcome the difficulties.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but he seems to be getting away from the subject matter of section 1, which is rather limited and is confined to the extension of the date of operation of the Bill from 26th June, 1976, to 8th January, 1977. I have given the Deputy some latitude, but I want him to have regard to the very limited nature of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If you read subsection (2) of section 2, I think you will forgive me for deviating a little from the narrow scope of the section we are dealing with.  I do not intend to be long.  I merely want to say to the Minister that, while some of the difficulties he has mentioned are real, they are not insurmountable in either the service industry or the <Col N="1940" /> building industry.  My party and I would be prepared to agree to any amendments that would broaden the scope of the Bill.  I would refer to subsection (3) (a) which reads: &ldquo;So far as it applies to agriculture (including horticulture)...&rdquo;  This was added on and it created 32 desirable jobs.  The Minister also extended the scope to food processing, and that produced 33 jobs.  I submit that if he would broaden the scope still further the number of jobs provided in other areas would be far in excess of that.</P>
      <P>We should make every effort to spend what is provided for in the Estimate and not have to confine ourselves to the narrow limits of this Bill.  It is disappointing that the gross expenditure was only half of what was provided in last year's Estimate.  I had a close connection with the building industry before my entry here, and I was very disappointed to read in the paper last week that one of our leading, long established Dublin building firms had got into financial difficulty, jeopardising the jobs of about 200 building industry workers.  As I say, the difficulties mentioned by the Minister can be overcome.  The sites do not matter because in most building concerns the head office administers the pay roll.  If we provided or recreated even 1,000 of those jobs, would the effort not be worth while?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has missed a real opportunity here for doing something worth while with what could be termed a most useful Bill if its scope had been widened. For example, as the Minister is well aware, Dublin Corporation have been told to cutback to the extent of affecting the jobs of 400 to 500 workers in a full year in the maintenance department.  This will result in houses falling into disrepair, and the cost of erecting new houses will be much greater than the cost of maintaining those men in employment. Immediately those men go into unemployment 75 per cent of what they were getting will fall to be paid for by the taxpayer in unemployment benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I promise to be very brief, and want simply to state that the Minister could still possibly extend the provisions of this Bill to cover people working in local authorities particularly. I know that what is happening in local government is far away from the Minister's Department, and yet they are directly connected in so far as the Minister for Labour is concerned with people in employment.  I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to examine this with a view to extending the provisions of this Bill, even if it was to be brought in before this Dáil goes into recess, to cover maintenance workers and give the local authorities the premium or some sort of contribution towards keeping these people in employment.  There are 400 or 500 people here in the city of Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This extention is welcome so far as it goes.  Even for the period it has been in existence, up to 26th June, 1976, sizeable progress has been made in that over 5,000 people have been employed under the scheme. Under any scheme that would come before the House one would rarely see a net improvement in the job situation of 5,000.  I would like to ask the Minister a specific question about the Table to this section which reads.</P>
      <P>(3) The Scheme shall</P>
      <P>(a) so far as it applies to agriculture (including horticulture) come into operation on the 3rd day of August, 1975...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is being extended now.  In his concluding remarks on Second Stage the Minister said the scheme would apply to people employed in bacon factories, meat processing factories and <Col N="1942" /> so on.  If a farmer has, say, three farm workers and he takes on a farm manager, does he qualify for the extra £15?  Jobs such as these provide exports and there is the extra employment involved.  The scheme is to run to January, 1977, and in that six-month period there will be four months of very intensive employment on farms, and I would like to know if the type of person about whom I have asked is covered under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Earlier I touched on the question of the extension of the scheme to local improvement and local employment schemes.  I do not intend to dwell on that because you have ruled it out of order, Sir, but I hope the Minister will consider these suggestions, because I believe he will be coming back to the House for further extensions after 8th January, 1977.  I hope the Minister will consider a much more wide-ranging scheme that will encompass more people.  It would be desirable if he could channel money from his Department to some of the authorities to enable them to provide much-needed incentives which will result in greater employment.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see the Minister extending the scheme to tourism, because excellent employment could be provided in hotels and restaurants for many young boys and girls.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a young man with active ideas and this is a scheme which has shown his common-sense approach.  I was very pleased to see agriculture involved.  I would be equally pleased to see tourism involved because this is an industry where many young people could find employment which is very necessary at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We constantly examine the possibility of extending the scope of the scheme in the light of our experience of its working and where it is possible to extend this scope without departing from its essential objective, which is to get people back to work who have had jobs in industries affected by the recession. That is the guiding criterion of this piece of legislation.  If we can get changes that strengthen that purpose <Col N="1943" /> we incorporate them without any trouble.  I can assure Deputies we will constantly keep that in mind.</P>
      <P>The main difference between the schemes as they affect agriculture and industry is that in agriculture the person who is to be assisted must be retained in continuous employment for a minimum of nine calender months before the premium can be paid.  The corresponding arrangement in the case of manufacturing industry is that the premium is payable in respect of net increases in each four-week cycle period over and above the base date of 20th June, 1975.  That is really the main difference.  There must be nine months before it can be paid out in agriculture.</P>

      <P>This was a scheme designed to provide 10,000 jobs but because the Minister was so lazy only 5,000 were provided. Deputy Enright referred to tourism on this section of the Bill, which endorsed what I said earlier in relation to this industry.  I am sorry it is not Deputy Enright we are facing across the House because I have no doubt he would have listened to the sensible pleas made from this side of the House and we would not have been given the unresearched, incorrect excuses given to us by the Minister.</P>

He is not pressing his colleagues to allow him to extend this scheme.  A total of 120 people are already gone from Dublin Corporation. What is the Minister doing about this?  We have window dressing from him.  Only half of the money provided is being spent.  The other half remains there.

If we make some worth-while suggestions the Minister might like to hear them. We are very often accused by the far side of not making good suggestions. While we accept this is an unemployment scheme and we see the Minister's point in it, we have always been told that the best method is prevention rather than cure.  Perhaps the Minister would get in touch with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, to see what he can do to assure the House that the 500 men in Dublin Corporation will not be dismissed.</P>

      <P>This Bill, the Employment Premium Bill, 1976, basically an extension of the Employment Premium Act, 1975, which now may be cited together with the Employment Premium Acts, 1975 and 1976, is an effort to recreate employment and get a number of people back to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that a Bill such as this should go as far as possible in an effort to provide as many job opportunities as can be done, particularly during a period of high unemployment as we have at present. <Col N="1947" /> In criticism I say that the Minister has looked on it.  He has not studied the situation and the problem of the situation on a year-to-year basis.  We have had two inadequate Bills now formed into one, and he told us a year ago that the first one was for a brief period to carry us over the few months until we saw a regrowth. Now we are told that this is a further carry-over operation.  If the Minister and his Government had looked more positively at the serious cancer of unemployment, the approach would have been an entirely different one.</P>
    <P>This Bill, of course, has advantages. The Minister has called for the co-operation of employers and of personnel managers and production managers.  I sincerely hope that this scheme is a huge success.</P>

      <P>My party and my colleagues always were and always will be concerned about employment, about having as many people as possible at work.  It has been spelt out here this evening by those who contributed that the desire of the majority of Irish people is a desire for genuine, honest work, but there are times when it is difficult to see whether the approach of this Minister and Government is a negative one or not.  Calling on employers is fine, calling on personnel and production managers is fine, but these people are not going to avail of a programme unless they see a need for having employment created in their industry.  Therefore, while it is desirable that we ask for their co-operation, that we publish it as widely as we possibly can and that we support it in the strongest possible manner, we must also look at the other areas that have not been covered.  I am not satisfied with any explanation given in this House this evening, or a year ago, that the building or construction industry, whichever title one cares to use, could not have been brought within the scope of this measure.  The same applies to the services industry, to hotels, guesthouses and tourism as mentioned by Deputy Enright.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume we may take it now that the Bill is the Employment Premium Act, 1976. The Bill contains an extended time for the payment of certain aids to manufacturing industry and to agriculture. For the achieving of the targets as were first outlined by the Minister a year ago when the target was 10,000 jobs, up to today 5,185 were achieved.  They were achieved for the most part in manufacturing industry, all but 32, so we can take it that 5,163 were achieved in the manufacturing industry.  The Minister may be under a false impression himself, as he did list a certain number of manufacturing industries in his concluding remarks on Second Stage where jobs could possibly be created. Yet many of the industries he mentioned are not included in those which have been assisted during the past year, obviously because they did not look for that assistance or, perhaps, were not qualified because possibly of their workforces having slipped below the 20th June level.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is not 5,185 jobs we should have achieved now under this scheme after a year, particularly when 10,000 was the target, but we should have at the very least been looking for a second 10,000 or even more.  We achieved only 50 per cent of target with the 1975 programme. It was the duty of the Minister to see why we did not, where the greatest loss of employment was, and if difficulties which were then experienced extended to cover any of those areas.  I submit that all those difficulties could have been overcome. The Minister, in a typically optimistic speech when he knows he is on a weak wicket, referred to the mainland of Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no doubt about it that under the Bill we were too late on the footwear and textiles scene.

I ask the Minister to co-operate with the city manager to try to keep those people at work.  It is no use paying people to get workers back in their jobs if others who have been in employment for a long time lose theirs.

      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I was dealing with points made by Opposition speakers and I mentioned the diversity of views during the debate on salmon conservancy.  A number of Deputies suggested that we should be much more liberal in the allocation of licences, but others expressed opposite views.  Salmon is a very valuable asset and we must always consider conservancy of those stocks.  At the same time, we must take account of what is happening in so far as the economy is concerned. Salmon exports in 1975 amounted to <Col N="1951" /> £3,129,994 as against £1.88 million in 1974.  Netting is mainly responsible for salmon catches and it is the fishing system that has come in for the most severe criticism.</P>
      <P>This is an industry which boosted our exports last year by more than £3 million and we could diminish that by making regulations that would be so rigid as to drastically reduce our intake.  That would be unwise.  However, we must make laws to limit the number of licences issued and if, as a result of our experience this year, we discover there is a need for more drastic limitation, measures will be introduced to do so.  I have introduced a number of by-laws aimed at salmon conservancy.  Deputies should be conversant with them because they have been publicly announced.  In the circumstances they are fair and reasonable.</P>
      <P>The issue of licences is a very vexed question.  I mentioned on the last occasion that if there were no restrictions we would have applications for more than 5,000 extra drift net licences.  We cannot do that.  We must impose restrictions and as a result many people are dissatisfied and are naturally very critical.  Every fairminded person will agree that we cannot extend the regulations or improve the criteria for the issue of drift net licences without damaging our salmon stocks.  Board of conservators have a very difficult job.  It is their duty to determine applications in accordance with control orders that I make, and from the information at my disposal I can say the boards do a very good job.  It is a thankless one because board members are criticised by unsuccessful applicants.  Still, they deal with applications fairly.  In two areas, two boards were abolished and two administrators were appointed.  These officers who are of the highest integrity are doing an excellent job.  When dealing with applications they act with complete impartiality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the present position in the Cork Fishery Board area which is now administered by an administrator.  He is thoroughly conversant <Col N="1952" /> with fisheries, particularly salmon fisheries, because of his work in the Department and he had no connection prior to his appointment with Cork county.  I felt it advisable to appoint a man of the highest integrity, a man who understood the salmon industry and had no local connections, because I could see difficulties arising if a local man were appointed to such a position.  It is he, in common with the other administrator and the 15 boards of conservation for drift net licences is successful. I have no function in that respect.  My functions relate to laying down the criteria on which applications are determined and the number of licences to be issued by each board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy was exceptionally critical of what was happening in Cork.  In 1972 244 drift net licences were issued in Cork.  At that time no restriction obtained and licences were freely available by paying the prescribed fee.  The Cork Fishery Board area comprises the greater part of the Cork county coastline, from Castletownbere, beyond Cork city to Ballycotton. The administrator has reduced the number of licences in that area from 244 in 1972 to 135 at present. This shows that, instead of issuing licences in parts of county Cork without justification, the administrator has imposed stringent regulations and scrutinised each application to ensure that it complies with the regulations set down by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  I am satisfied that he has determined these applications with complete impartiality.  This proves that when people allege that the Cork Fishery Board are doing something underhand in the granting of licences, they are mistaken.</P>
    <P>Because of the regulations the administrator had to reject many applications. In the Cork area&mdash;I am sure the same applies to other areas also&mdash; many people feel very much aggrieved about this.  I am satisfied that everything is fair and above board.  If a person qualifies for a licence he gets it and <i>vice versa,</i> with one exception&mdash; and this could apply in any of the boards&mdash;when the number of drift net <Col N="1953" /> licences is limited.  The number for the Cork area is 135 but if there are 140 qualified applicants the administrator, of necessity, must rule out five.  He will rule out the five who have the least claim to a licence even though under the regulations they qualify.</P>
    <P>The Galway board was mentioned. That board were unable to issue their full quota of licences because of the lack of qualified applicants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the board were justified in their decision and that it was mandatory on them not to grant licences to those who were not qualified.</P>
      <P>I referred to the change which came about as a result of the change of Government.  I believe the Fianna Fáil Government got very frightened with the reports which came to hand in 1972, and took exceptionally stringent measures to conserve our salmon stocks, mainly by reducing drift net licences.  While we get complaints from Galway Deputies about the present position on the limitation of the number of licences and the feeling that more licences should be issued, we find these complaints have no justification. We have substantially increased the number in some western areas.  In the Connemara area, under the order made by Deputy Fahey, the number of draft net licences issued was 16 and we increased that to 30; in the Galway district it was 25 and we increased it to 38; in Ballinakill it was increased from 31 to 47.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no discrimination against Galway or any other county.  Their proportions increased in the number of licences issued.  It has been alleged by some people that the reason why this order was changed was political, and that the Government were anxious to gain a few extra votes by making drift net licences more freely available than Fianna Fáil had in mind to do.  Everybody knows that Fianna Fáil wanted to phase out drift netting.  In countering the political <Col N="1954" /> charges I said in Deputy Gallagher's county, and I repeat, that if one was to view this on the votes question as is alleged, it would be far more advantageous to do away with drift netting because for every one person interested in our fisheries who is in favour of drift netting at least nine are against it.  All the inland men engaged in fishing and many people living not too far away from the sea are against it, so that instead of helping us politically these measures that we have taken are doing quite the opposite.  I am assuming that people will now see the justification for these measures, when we had an income of more than £3 million from salmon exports last year.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that these questions which have arisen about irregularity in the granting of licences and the allegations in relation to the question of political motivation will cease.  Let no one think that we are anxious to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  We are very watchful of our species because of its value to us and we are anxious to ensure that essential and necessary conservancy measures are taken and will continue to be taken.  This will be reviewed again when the present salmon season concludes.</P>
    <P>I put it to Opposition Deputies, were we justified in our actions to help our fishermen to £3 million additional income from the sea by way of salmon fisheries, which represents about 33? per cent of our total catch? Were it not for the measures that this Government have taken so far as our salmon fisheries are concerned many fishermen would not be doing as well as they are at present and many would find it hard to make ends meet.  The income of more than £3 million from our exports of salmon is a big advantage to our fishermen and to our economy.  It is also an advantage to processors and others who are directly or indirectly engaged in the work.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised by Deputy Daly in relation to issues which are not relevant to the limited measure before us.  He mentioned the need for conservancy and particularly the improvement in the pay conditions of <Col N="1955" /> waterkeepers.  Waterkeepers have a very difficult job and since this Government took office their pay has been increased almost three times over.  It was around £17 a week when we took office and it is now about £45 a week. There may be changes in new legislation to deal with their position and conditions of employment and so on. That remains to be seen.  It relates to what final policies emerge from the legislation which I hope to have before the House before the end of this year. As we are dealing with such a valuable species of fish I will say that the Department are doing everything possible to try to limit illegal fishing. I appreciate that it is almost impossible to wipe it out, but illegal fishing is exceptionally harmful and so far as I am concerned any people who are found to be fishing illegally and who are punished in accordance with the laws of the land will not get much sympathy from me or from the Department.  Such people do not deserve any sympathy.</P>
    <P>Waterkeepers have a very difficult job in the successful apprehending of men or women who engage in illegal fishing and bringing them before the courts.  I do not think it would be right for any higher authority to interfere in any way with the decisions of the courts.  Without reflecting in any way on the decisions of the justices in fishery prosecutions, the punishments in most cases are rather light. I do not see any cases reported in the papers where severe penalties are imposed by justices.  Everybody in this House will agree with the viewpoint that we must try to get people to respect our fishery laws in the same way that every other law in the land is respected.  If they want the law changed, they will then try to get it changed by constitutional methods, either by bringing pressure to bear on the Government and the Department with sound viable suggestions in relation to the changes necessary, and say where they are necessary or else by changing the Government, as happened on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>The second part of the Bill deals with the increase in the licences.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1956" /> Everybody will agree that the present licence fees are completely out of date. They were set down years ago when money was much more valuable than it is now.  I do not agree with the view expressed by Deputy Molloy that £2 for a rod licence would be a severe imposition.  I cannot say yet what, if any, fees will be chargeable to licence applicants, but I cannot agree that £2 would have any serious impact on any individual.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree.  The State is providing a good deal of money for sea fisheries and for inland fisheries and I think that those who are directly benefiting should pay some contribution and not ask others who have no interest in fishing to bear the full burden.  There are safeguards in this Bill so far as this House is concerned and I had in mind particularly that if this Bill were to be extended, say, in 1977, it could not be done just by an order without the approval of this House and of the Upper House. In the same way the licence fees cannot be increased without the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If increases arise of which Deputies are critical they will have an opportunity of expressing their views here.</P>
      <P>I thank the House for the measure of agreement accorded to this measure.  As far as I could ascertain the views expressed by the principal spokesman on fisheries, Deputy Gallagher, are somewhat similar to my own.  I do not think there is a very wide gulf between him and myself in regard to salmon fishing.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in this section seeks an extension to the time limit for the election of boards.  He also mentions 1977.

      <P>I think I can be positive in stating that unless something completely unforeseen happens there will be no extension beyond 1977.  This provision is only included in case the unforeseen did happen so that an extension could be granted.  The extension could only be granted, of course, with the approval of both Houses; it could not be done outside the Houses of the Oireachtas. While I see no likelihood of that happening this is put in as a safeguard. For instance, another person in my position might wish to do things differently.  Deputy Gallagher can be assured that there should be no difficulty regarding this section, that it is most unlikely it will ever have to be invoked.  If that happens it will have to come before both Houses.</P>

      <P>In this section the Parliamentary Secretary is seeking permission to increase licence fees and while there might be an argument for increases in some sections, the Bill itself is too vague.  We have no indication as to what the increases are likely to be and we cannot accept a pig in a poke.  We want to know exactly what he has in mind.  We want guidelines on what the proposed increases are likely to be.  We would like to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not yet determined the amount of the increase but whatever it will be, an order will be brought before this House and the Seanad for approval. Everybody will agree that there is justification for an increase.  We are limited under previous legislation to an increase of not more than 100 per cent and, as regards drift net licences, 100 per cent of £3 is only £3, making £6.  We think it should be much higher. I think there is very little objection by the fishermen to this measure as regards increasing licence duties but in any case the matter will come before the House for approval.</P>

      <P>Under the 1959 Act the licence was fixed at £3 and there was provision to increase the licence <Col N="1959" /> for drift nets by an amount not exceeding 100 per cent.  In other words, the Parliamentary Secretary has power to increase the drift net licence to £6 at present but it still remains at £3&mdash; is that correct?</P>

      <P>That is the figure in the 1959 Act.  I never had the privilege of having a salmon rod licence; it would be no good to me as I have nowhere to use it.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary not consider it extraordinary that he should seek authority in a Bill such as this to increase the licences under the 1959 Act to an unspecified amount when he has, under existing fisheries legislation, power to increase existing licences by as much as 100 per cent and has not done so?  If he considers that these licence fees are too low, as seems to be the case from what he has said here, surely he already has power to double them if he wishes to? After three years in office he has not done that.  Why then seek power to increase them to an unspecified sum when he has not exercised the power he already has under the 1959 Act?</P>

      <P>We were waiting for the legislation which I would hope to introduce this year to deal comprehensively with all matters relating to inland fisheries and also with increases in licence duties.  Unfortunately, we were unable to get this legislation ready before the summer recess but we should not wait until it is finalised to get approval for increasing licence duties.  From my knowledge there is little or no opposition to increasing the duties far in excess of 100 per cent which I am allowed to do at present. Increases of that amount would be insignificant.</P>

The Minister has authority to increase the existing licence fee by 100 per cent and the Parliamentary Secretary is now asking <Col N="1961" /> us to amend that section of the old Act without being specific about what he has in mind.  Surely it is unreasonable to ask us to accept something without indicating what he has in mind in relation to this section.</P>

      <P>I made it clear that the increases, by way of order, would be brought before the House and it will be open to Deputies to voice their opinions about those increases. This section gives me power to increase the licence fees and the amounts are not determined at present.  There is no question of increasing the licence fee under the section without referring the matter to the House.  There is nothing unusual in this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is asking the House for an extraordinary <i>carte blanche</i> under this section.  He must have his tongue in his cheek asking for permission to have legislation passed which will enable licence fees to be increased without any limit.  The 1959 Act was fair legislation and it stated exactly the powers of the Minister.  There was a basic licence fee figure which he could increase at his discretion up to an amount equal to the amount of the existing licence fee.  In other words, he could increase it by 100 per cent.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not acted upon the powers he has because he thinks such an increase would be too puny to bother with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our experience of the Government in relation to charges, such as taxation and fees under Government control, is that they impose extraordinary increases.  We have only to look at what happened to motor taxation.  A vehicle which could be taxed for £30 three years ago now costs £120 in tax. If we agree to this section, which we will not, we are supporting the Minister in a move which will allow him to increase licence fees for drift net, draft nets, fixed engines and rod licences to an unlimited amount.  The Parliamentary Secretary spoke about the necessity of bringing back an order to the House and told us we would have an opportunity of debating that order but he knows that the <Col N="1962" /> Government have a majority of votes and what is dictated by the Cabinet will be marched through the lobbies. If he gets this section he will have no hesitation in increasing the licence fees.</P>
    <P>We must oppose this section because we fear moves which would be made if the power is given to the Minister.  This debate has been very interesting in as much as we have had the first clear indication from the Government that they favour the imposition of a £2 licence fee on every rod and line cast into Irish waters, fresh or salt.  The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that the principle is acceptable to him, and he speaks for the Government in relation to this Bill.  I should like to issue a warning to him that he will not get that kind of legislation through the House easily.  I should like to warn every angling club and every citizen who enjoys as a pastime the casting of a fishing line, be it a rod line or an ordinary hand line, which is often the pastime of people who have not great resources, that this is now to be taken away from them.  The great claim made by Bord Fáilte over the past two decades was that we have some of the greatest free fishing waters in Europe but this is to be wiped out by the Government.</P>

      <P>We are talking about granting absolute powers to the Minister to increase fees to an unlimited figure.  We are making a basic change from existing legislation which restricts the increase to 100 per cent. It is a very dangerous power to give the Government particularly in their present mood.  We should also remember their recent history of tax increases. The Minister for Transport and Power who is charged with tourism is listening to the debate and he must be concerned at the possibility of destroying our reputation for having the largest free fishing waters in Europe.  I appeal to him to exercise his influence within the Government to put a half to whatever moves there are to introduce a £2 licence fee on <Col N="1963" /> all rod and line fishing.  The £2 is a misnomer.  That was the figure suggested by the Inland Fisheries Commission but recent practice has shown that that £2 would be considered a very paltry sum by the Government. It could be any figure; it could be £20.  We cannot agree to give the Minister this kind of power.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education, has the responsibility for all special residential schools and residential homes.</P>
      <P>While each of these institutions has an authorised accommodation limit, I understand that during recent years, in compliance with the recommendations of the Kennedy Report, the majority of them have been adapted to give effect to the concept of group homes while some homes have been closed altogether.  Thus, the total accommodation available in these institutions has been reduced gradually from approximately 480 places in special schools in the year 1970 to 280 places in 1975.  The corresponding figures for residential homes is 1,800 places in 1970 reducing to an estimated 1,700 in 1975.</P>
      <P>In addition to the aforementioned institutions there are a number of homes which are approved under the Health Acts for the reception of children into care.  These homes provide accommodation for approximately 400 children at present.  There has been no significant change in the number of available places in these homes since 1970.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>Special residential facilities are already available for 2,335 mentally handicapped persons over 16 years, a large proportion of whom have additional physical handicaps.  There are a further 720 places in planning or being built.</P>
      <P>The National Medical Rehabilitation Centre, Dún Laoghaire, provides special assessment, treatment and appliances for physically handicapped persons.</P>
      <P>There are six Cheshire Homes in different parts of the country with accommodation for 174 chronically disabled adults.  A new 35-bed Cheshire Home is being built at present at Bohola, County Mayo, with the assistance of a grant from the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
      <P>Many physically handicapped adults are maintained in chronic sick units provided by health boards.  There are no other proposals before my Department for the provision of residential centres for physically handicapped persons over 18 years of age.</P>
      <P>I should explain that in most cases it is much better for physically handicapped adults to be able to live in their own homes.  Grants are available from local authorities in cases where an extra room or other structural work is necessary for the proper accommodation of a physically disabled person in an existing house. Such structural work may include the provision of bathroom and toilet facilities at ground floor level and the building of ramps and widening of door openings for wheelchairs.</P>

Following a report by a social welfare officer, who made several requests for certain information which was not forthcoming, a deciding officer refused his application for a qualification certificate on the ground that as he had not furnished full particulars he had failed to show that his means were within the statutory limit for entitlement to unemployment assistance.

On receipt of the social welfare officer's report, a deciding officer reassessed his weekly rate of means at £15.79 with effect from 18th February, 1976.

      <P>Projects of an infrastructural nature not coming within the ambit of Directive 159/72, which could include, for example, a group drainage project, are eligible for aid under the FEOGA individual projects scheme. Funds under this scheme are, however, limited and it is a matter for the EEC Commission to decide which projects will be grant-aided.  The main conditions to be fulfilled are that the beneficiaries of the project provide at least 20 per cent of its cost from their own resources, that the State contributes financially to the project and that work on the project shall not have commenced prior to its submission to the Commission.</P>
