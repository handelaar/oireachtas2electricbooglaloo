    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The legislation which provided for relief of rates on agricultural land by way of the agricultural grant expired on the 31st December last.  The purpose of the present Bill is to continue the application of the agricultural grant in respect of 1976 and 1977.</P>
      <P>The agricultural grant is paid by the Exchequer to county councils to enable them to give abatement of rates to occupiers of agricultural land. In the present financial year £36.5 million will be paid over from the Exchequer to county councils by means of the agricultural grant to reduce the rates burden on the agricultural community.  This is an increase of £6.28 million on the amount of the grant in 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme of allowances provided under the Bill, a primary allowance as in 1975, gives relief of 100 per cent of the general rate in the case of land holdings the valuation of which does not exceed £20. <Col N="158" /> In the case of holdings between £20 and £33 valuation this primary allowance also relieves 100 per cent of the rates on the first £20 of the land valuation and the rated occupier is liable for rates on the remainder only. Land holdings with valuations in excess of £33 again as in 1975 qualify for a primary allowance of 80 per cent in respect of the first £20 of the valuation and a supplementary allowance of 30 per cent on the remainder of the valuation.</P>
    <P>The Bill as introduced, also provided for the continuance of the employment allowance of £17 per workman, heretofore given to farmers subject to certain conditions.  However, the Government gave the matter further consideration in the course of their examination of the budgetary issues. The original purpose of the employment allowance was, I gather, to encourage the employment of workers in agriculture.  It is doubtful if the allowance ever succeeded in promoting any additional employment on the land, but over the years it was argued that the continuance of the allowance was justifiable on the grounds that it provided an incentive for the employment on an all-the-year-round basis of farm workers who might otherwise be disengaged in slack periods.</P>
    <P>I think it will be generally agreed that the allowance did not succeed even in this modest objective.  The figures in the matter, in fact, show that there has been a steady decline in the numbers employed in agriculture all through the 30 year period since the initiation of this allowance. The total amount of the employment allowance expressed as a percentage of the total agricultural grant has shown a dramatic decrease in recent years.  In the year 1953-54 it formed 27.8 per cent of the total grant.  Last year this had fallen to a mere 1.65 per cent, and with the continued increase in the total grant, would have fallen to a still lower figure this year.</P>
    <P>The employment allowance now seems to fulfil no real purpose and it is not surprising that in debates on the agricultural grant in this House; in recent years, serious doubts have been expressed as to its continued usefulness. <Col N="159" /> I myself, when in Opposition, said that the grant of this allowance was a waste of money.  In the debate on the last Bill I repeated that I had not changed my mind in this regard and indicated that the grant of the allowance would have to be reviewed. In the light of the foregoing, the Government decided that the employment allowance should be terminated. Accordingly, I propose moving an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage providing for the discontinuance of this allowance.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 2 of the Bill is to provide that in future extensions of county borough, borough or urban boundaries, farmers whose land may be encompassed by revised boundaries will not lose the benefits of the rate reliefs afforded by the agricultural grant; this arrangement will apply for so long as the land continues to be used solely or mainly for agricultural purposes.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated, the legislation which provides for the relief of rates on agricultural land expired on 31st December, 1975, and this Bill is simply continuing to enable the county councils to give an abatement to the occupiers of agricultural land in their rating areas.  On this side of the House we have on quite a number of occasions introduced measures to give an abatement of rates to occupiers of agricultural land.  This was, to quite an extent, a recognition by us that the land was the source from which the farmer obtained his living and in a sense could be likened to the tools of his trade for an artisan.  The grant was applied particularly to give relief to the smallholder with the greatest relief being granted to those whose holdings were below £20 valuation. As the Minister has pointed out, those with holdings below £20 valuation qualified for the primary allowance of 100 per cent, the general rate in the £ and all of the holdings qualify for relief but not to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the second part of the Bill I could say that very serious <Col N="160" /> problems have arisen in the past where town and city boundaries were extended and where the outgoings of the farmers and rated occupiers generally were arbitrarily increased because of the fact that the new rate level applied and because the holdings of agricultural land which came within the new urban boundary lost the rate relief which they enjoyed.  It was to accommodate this situation that this Bill has been introduced and it is a continuation, in a sense, of our policy which involved the introduction of various measures over a period to reduce the rates liability and to transfer that liability to central Government.</P>
    <P>As far as I can remember the reason why the abatement of rates did not apply to agricultural land within the urban areas in the past was that this land was regarded as being more valuable than land in rural areas because it could be developed more easily for housing and other construction purposes.  It was very often serviced and could fetch a higher price than ordinary agricultural land. Some land which happened to be outside the urban area was also serviced but usually the amount of land involved in such circumstances was small and would be likely to be incorporated in the urban area at some stage.  With the rapid increase in the price of agricultural land, not in every case justifiable from the returns to the farmer, and also because of the fact that with all the modern technology available land can be developed for building purposes anywhere, and being so developed the old argument that land is more valuable in urban areas does not apply any longer.</P>
    <P>For this reason it appears that the Minister is creating an anomalous situation and he appears to be discriminatory in confining the Bill to continuing the relief of rates on agricultural land or land which is used for agricultural purposes which will come within the urban boundary in the future.  It is not regarded as proper that those who have got agricultural land, and who will in the future come within the control of the borough or urban council, should have to forfeit <Col N="161" /> their rights to the abatement of rates such as the provision granting holdings not exceeding £20 land valuation the right to qualify for a primary allowance of 100 per cent of the general rate in the £.  Equally, it can be held that those holdings which were brought within urban areas in the past or any holding of agricultural land within the urban area should not be denied the rate abatement applicable to land outside the urban areas and which will now be applicable to land which will be incorporated in urban areas in the future.</P>
    <P>Whatever argument may be put forward for the situation as it exists at present in urban areas where no extension of the boundary has ever taken place&mdash;I do not accept that any case can now be made for that position&mdash; no argument at all can be made in relation to agricultural holdings which have been incorporated into urban areas in the past.  I should like to cite a case in point by referring to Dundalk, which is in my own constituency. This town has at present within its boundary a considerable amount of agricultural land which is being used as agricultural land.  A certain amount of this land, because of its type, and because of its situation, is likely to be used always as agricultural land.  These agricultural holdings are not entitled to relief of rates which is generally applicable on agricultural land.  This is inequitable and there is no reason why these lands should not be included in the terms of the Bill.  Dundalk Urban Council, by showing its concern for the future of its citizens, decided at an earlier date to extend its boundary.  The owners of these holdings which are now included in the Dundalk urban area have lost their rate remission although a considerable portion of their land is being used for agricultural purposes.  In my view such people are being discriminated against in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is likely that the Minister, when replying, will ask me why the Fianna Fáil Government did not introduce a Bill such as this at the time of the town extension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must have a crystal ball.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="162" />
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that at that time the argument put forward for not doing so could be regarded as a valid one because prices of land within town boundaries at that time were higher than prices of land in rural areas.  The fact that they were included in an urban area, and had the prospect of being serviced, increased the value of the land.  However, this differential has gone and the price of land is high everywhere. Changing times and circumstances have made the arguments that existed then no longer valid.  The position is that those holding land within town boundaries have little advantage over those who hold land outside the town boundary.  Therefore, it is only right that we should give favourable consideration to allowing them the same advantages as regards rates relief as those who are to be incorporated in the future inside town boundaries and as those who are outside town boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By making the change proposed in the Bill the Minister is accepting that the transfer of land from outside an urban area to within an urban area constitutes a considerable liability in so far as the holder of such land is concerned.  He is making provision accordingly.  In making this provision I doubt if a reasonable argument can be put forward by the Minister to back up a continuation of the extra rate load which is borne by those whose holdings are within the urban boundaries and are used for agricultural purposes.  We should also recognise that even with this Bill to ensure that the rates relief which a holding had available to it while outside the urban boundary there is still a further liability on those whose land comes within the boundary.  Generally speaking, the rate in the £ within the urban boundary is higher than that in the county area.  For that reason even where the rates relief is granted to the holder of agricultural land within the boundary, nevertheless the financial outgoing as far as the farmer is concerned will be much greater after the farm is brought within the boundary of a town.  In these circumstances we should give further consideration to granting this rate relief <Col N="163" /> to all agricultural land within the urban boundaries.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, the provision the Minister is making is welcome, but it is creating an anomalous situation.  We will now have one group of farmers within an urban area having the right to a rates remission, and another group of farmers within the same urban area will not have it. It is not any argument to say that what the Minister is doing is simply ensuring that those who already had this rates remission will continue to have it.  The Minister having gone so far, I suggest that it might be possible for him to consider granting this rates remission to those who are using the land for purely agricultural purposes within city and town boundaries.</P>
    <P>This Bill also gives us an apportunity to discuss the employment allowance of £17 which the Minister has decided should no longer be available.  This allowance was given in respect of each adult workman who was employed continuously on a holding over the prescribed period of 12 months.  If one is to judge by the amount of money paid out by each local authority, fairly considerable use was made of this allowance.  It is now ridiculously low.  In recent times it did very little to fulfil the objective it was supposed to fulfil.  To give some idea of the change in the value of money since that allowance was first introduced, it is worth noting that when it was introduced it was sufficient to pay the insurance stamp of the employee for a year.  Now it would not pay it for three weeks.</P>
    <P>The principal objective of the Government must be to keep as many people as possible in employment and to increase employment where possible. Rather than removing the allowance of £17, I am convinced the Government should have increased it to a realistic level.  There is no point in saying that, because the allowance was so low as to be of little value, the proper thing to do was to abolish it altogether as the Minister has done. It should have been increased to a realistic level to fulfil the purpose for which it was originally intended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> When the employment incentive scheme of £12 a week for each extra employee taken into employment was being introduced, we pressed the Minister for Labour to include agricultural workers.  The Minister agreed but it has not proved successful in that area.  What is very urgently needed is financial assistance to ensure that more jobs will not be lost in the agricultural sector.  Recent statistics showed that the greatest loss of employment was in the building area and the building industry.  This was followed very closely by a loss of employment in the agricultural sector. When one notes that, one must accept the need to provide the necessary assistance to encourage farmers to keep workers in employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it was doubtful if the allowance ever succeeded in promoting any additional employment on the land.  He went on to say that, over the 30 year period since the initiation of this allowance, there was a steady decline in the numbers employed in agriculture.  The fact is that this decline was common to all developing countries.  People tended to move off the land into towns and into industrial employment.  The question we should ask ourselves is not whether there was a decline in the number of agricultural workers but whether the allowance, when it was of some value, might have slowed down that decline.  I have no doubt that when the £17 employment allowance per workman was available it did something to hold people on the land. The most vital thing we have to do is to try to increase employment and to hold people in employment.</P>
    <P>The IDA are spending quite a considerable amount of money, and rightly so, to try to hold people in employment in industry, and to try to increase the numbers employed in industry.  If we take the capital sum which is necessary to put one person into employment, and consider the annual cost of this capital sum, we must accept that even quite a considerable increase in the allowance would cost less than the cost of the capital sum.  Therefore, it is necessary that we should view the continuation of people in employment of any sort, <Col N="165" /> and particularly in the agricultural industry, as a top priority.  We should do everything possible to encourage farmers to keep their workers in employment. I believe a worth-while increase in the allowance would achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>The agricultural industry could do with many more workers if it is to reach anything like its full potential. Because of the Government's policy, in many instances farmers are now working below capacity.  Many of them feel they can get by on a lesser income.  This entails a lot less work and trouble for them.  The danger is that we will see a greater percentage fall in the number employed in agriculture in the future.  Therefore, it is vital that every encouragement should be given to at least ensure the safety of the jobs available at present.</P>
    <P>As I said, the IDA are spending very large sums of money for the purpose of consolidating the numbers employed in individual factories.  It is only right that the same assistance should be given to ensure continued employment in our major industry.  The agricultural worker is as important to the economy as any other worker.  I have no doubt the Minister will agree with that.</P>

      <P>Because I know the Minister has a sympathetic attitude in this matter I have not the slightest doubt that he will be sympathetic towards an amendment we will be putting down.  Now that the Minister has brought in his Bill, in regard to those whose land is being brought within the scope of boroughs and urban district councils, will he ensure the land brought in will not lose the rates relief?  I hope he will take some cognisance of what I have said in regard to those who are using the land for agricultural purposes.  Let me also express the hope that now that he is removing some of the objections of those who will be brought within town boundaries he might agree to allow the Drogheda Corporation to extend to a much greater extent into Meath.</P>

      <P>It is only a matter of giving the permission.  I would be glad if the Minister would consider the two main points I have raised in regard to land within town boundaries used for agricultural purposes at the moment which was taken in in the extension of town boundaries. I would be glad, too, if he would consider increasing the employment allowance to a realistic figure to ensure that those who are employed in agriculture will be retained in that employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope people will not lose the benefit from an agricultural point of view as a result of any extension of town boundaries.  At the moment land adjacent to a town is no longer a benefit to the farmer. Years ago farmers in such a position provided fresh milk and vegetables. Most milk now is bottled and delivered by large dairy units situated in far distant towns.  The same situation exists where vegetables are concerned. The bulk of these is now grown in North County Dublin.  From that point of view it is imperative that the Minister should examine Deputy <Col N="168" /> Faulkner's suggestion that existing farms inside the town boundary should be included and not lose the benefits.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of the £17 employment allowance.  In the year 1953-1954 the total grant was £27.8 million. Last year it fell to £1.65 million.  It must be remembered that rates relief on agricultural land at that time was comparatively small.  Following on the war there was increased agricultural production, even if it was only in the line of seed potatoes for export.  The industrial boom in the 1950s and 1960s led to people leaving agricultural employment for industrial employment. That situation has changed over the last number of years and one now thinks in terms of agriculture and agriculture-based industries and these are bound to take on a new significance. While the £17 rate relief was very small&mdash;it was minimal&mdash;it was of some benefit.  I suppose the total payment for the whole country would be around about £500,000 but that is £500,000 taken from the farming scene.  Recently, I believe, the general council of the county committees of agriculture had a motion asking that the employment allowance be increased substantially.  The matter was discussed and it was indicated that the employment allowance should take over.  That is not so because the very terms of that scheme, whereby a person had to be employed for nine months before the farmer could be reimbursed from the Department, were not helpful in creating employment. This scheme should be re-examined with a view to reducing the nine-months' period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An indication of the problem of industries compared with agriculture was the statement yesterday by the Confederation of Irish Industry, commenting on the reduction in the bank rate, that it would not be beneficial due to the small number of opportunities for creating new industries.  Therefore, we should do all in our power to divert as many people as possible and give as many incentives as possible to agriculture and agriculture-based industries. We have reached the stage when anything that can be grown agriculturally <Col N="169" /> will have to be completely processed in this country if we are to make any dent in the large number unemployed at present.</P>
    <P>While the £17 was a very small allowance it was welcome, and the Minister should have a word with the Minister for Labour to see if anything could be done to broaden the terms of that scheme and make it more acceptable from a farming point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, when I heard the Minister interjecting during Deputy Faulkner's contribution about putting Meath into Louth or <i>vice versa</i>, I thought he was revising the constituencies once again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I think it was town boundaries that were being discussed. I would welcome any assistance to county councils to enable them to give abatement of rates to occupiers of agricultural land.  As we all know in county councils, particularly in the west, there has been a very large increase in rates and I hoped there would have been extra remission for those with holdings between £20 and £33 valuation.</P>
      <P>I was also hoping before the budget that there would be an increase in the allowance of £17.  The Minister seems a little unsure of himself, because in the brief statement he made he has statements like &ldquo;I gather the allowance was to encourage the employment of workers in agriculture&rdquo;.  He goes on to say: &ldquo;It is doubtful if the allowance ever succeeded&rdquo; and, &ldquo;I think it will be generally agreed that the allowance did not succeed even in this modest objective.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this year with so many people unemployed we should be doing everything possible to keep people working in agriculture.  There is nothing we can do about it now because the budget has been brought in and the allowance has been discontinued. In the budget of last June, encouragement was given on all sides of the <Col N="170" /> House to the employment premium, and the same encouragement should be given to people who employ people working on the land.  I can only protest at the discontinuance of this allowance.  I was hoping it would be increased to a realistic level, and perhaps the Minister at some stage will find it possible to revoke this decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">

      <P>The two main items of this Bill are, first the discontinuance of the £17 allowance to employers on agricultural land on which the valuation is £20 and, second, the extension of the boundaries and the abatement of rates entitlement under section 2.  I do not wish to detain the House very long on this because the points that can be made were very ably put by Deputy Faulkner, and I would like to support what he has said.</P>
      <P>I am very sorry to see the £17 allowance being withdrawn, because even though it was a small amount, those who were getting it appreciated it.  It was a retrograde step to discontinue it; in fact the case has been made down through the years that this allowance should be increased substantially.  Indeed, some time ago I pressed the Minister for Local Government to have this extended to female workers.  There are quite a number of women who are managing their farms efficiently.  I saw no reason why they should not qualify for the £17 abatement the same as male employees would, but unfortunately I got no hearing at that time.  Now the Government and everybody else are talking about equal rights for women, and maybe the Minister would reconsider this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure he would not have to be waiting to be told by Brussels to do it.  Every effort should be made to keep as many people as possible on the land, and the fact that the number of people employed in agriculture is declining is no reason why we should withdraw this £17 grant.  It is up to us to make the best possible use of our land, and if we <Col N="171" /> see any opportunity of creating employment on it, surely the withdrawal of this £500,000 that it was costing is not a step in the right direction. We have a great asset in our land.  In the past few years we have seen industrialists get into difficulties and all the State agencies, the IDA, Fóir Teoranta and so on, have come to their assistance to help to maintain their employees.  Yet when agriculture is in trouble, when the farmer is finding it difficult to maintain his workers, there is no fuss at all about it.  He can let them go if he likes but this is very bad.  Instead of withdrawing the £17, in my view it should have been increased substantially.  It would be an incentive and would help to reduce the numbers on the dole queues.</P>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner dealt very ably with section 2.  It is very bad that rates reliefs are not granted to people within town boundaries who are using their land for agricultural purposes. Under this Bill those people are not entitled to the relief.  This is very wrong.  Agricultural land outside town boundaries is worth as much as agricultural land within town boundaries. Within the town boundaries they may have such facilities as water and sewerage.  Most people living in rural areas know that rural land in the last couple of years has been almost as expensive as the land within town boundaries.  I cannot see why urban farmers should not be entitled to rates reliefs.  I will have an opportunity later of putting down amendments and I hope they will be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's Second Reading speech is a typical example of the stop-go attitude adopted by this Government.  When the Bill was introduced recently, provision was made for the continuation of the payment of the employment allowance of £17. I deplore the discontinuation of this allowance which the Minister dismissed as being of very little significance. It costs over £500,000 and is not to be dismissed lightly.  This change will mean that the £500,000 will have to be made up by the ratepayers. In my own county alone this <Col N="172" /> allowance amounted to some £13,500. This is a considerable amount of money which will now have to be paid by farmers many of whom employ their own sons.  The Minister might reconsider the position before he brings in the proposed amendment on Committee Stage.  The Bill should be left as it stands.  If the Minister decided not to bring in his proposed amendment, he would have the full support of this House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the continuation of the extension of the rate abatements and support the statement made by Deputy Kitt that some relief should be given to small farmers in the £20 to £33 valuation bracket.  These farmers need rate relief.  I believe the present position where they must pay the full rate in the £ is very difficult for them.  I had hoped some provision would be made by the Minister to extend rates relief in this area.  As I said, I welcome the provisions in the Bill except where it is proposed to abolish the employment allowance. The Minister should reconsider this matter and leave the Bill, as introduced, stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. I had a question down on this employment allowance of £17.  As Deputy Daly said, by abolishing it we are taking £500,000 out of the farmers' pockets.  We, in the county committees of agriculture, over the years got the impression that this allowance should be substantially increased.  I agree with the Minister that it is a miserable sum.  It might not do much to encourage a farmer to employ an outsider on the land, but it would help to keep the son at home.  A man must be on the land a whole year before he can draw it.  A person cannot get employment in the county council for two or three weeks and be insured or he will be automatically out of the scheme.  This will probably result in more people being on the dole and will be a disincentive to farmers to keep their sons on the land.  As I said, we have been looking for a substantial increase in this employment allowance.  To dismiss it as being of no use is ridiculous.  A sum of £500,000 is involved here.  This is <Col N="173" /> another disadvantage the farmer is faced with as a result of the budget.  I am very disappointed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner spoke of the relief to farmers who will be included in an expanded urban area.  I have always felt&mdash;and I have been talking about this for years&mdash;it is grossly unfair that because the urban farmer is not a ratepayer, he cannot avail of the services of the agricultural advisers. Portion of the advisers' salaries is paid by the ratepayers and so the advisers are not at the disposal of the urban farmers, except as an obligement. They are not supposed to go out to plan a farm in urban areas.  That is a big disadvantage to urban farmers. Some of these people do not even qualify for building grants and so on. Some of these farmers pay very high rates.  I am not a convert to this view. I have always fought the case of the man in the urban districts because he is at a disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the £17 allowance has been taken away because, in my view, that is a retrograde step. Urban farmers should be included. They are at a disadvantage because the services of the agricultural advisers are not at their disposal.  The budget and this Bill are definitely anti-farmer. This year everybody is leaning on the farmer.  As I said, when we were discussing the budget, our only hope of survival is to increase our agricultural exports.  This is of vital importance but everything we do is determental in that regard.  I am disappointed with the Bill.  I regret that the £17 provision is being withdrawn and also that all farmers, whether urban or rural, are not included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to detain the House for very long but there are a few points I should like to make.  Section 2 provides that in respect of future extensions to county borough or urban boundaries farmers whose land may be encompassed by revised boundaries will not lose the benefit of the rate relief afforded by the agricultural grant.  In dealing with legislation here our aim should be to get rid of anomalies and, above all, not to create disparities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> If this Bill goes through in its present form it is bound to lead to disparties. I am pleased, though, to find that future extensions will not mean that farmers concerned will lose the allowance.  This is of much importance to me since, as a county councillor, it will be for me to recommend or, perhaps not to recommend, an extension in so far as the Bray urban area is concerned.  The Bray area is completely landlocked and application has been made to Wicklow County Council for an extension into the county area.  As I was concerned in regard to this situation, I am glad to note now that the farming community, although they may be small in number, will be catered for.</P>
    <P>I consider many provisions of this Bill to be negative.  We note that the scale of allowances gives relief of 100 per cent of the general rate in the case of land or holdings which do not exceed £20 in value.  I wonder whether the Minister gave any thought to improving these scales&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a 120 per cent relief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;especially in the lower valuation figures, in other words, where the valuation does not exceed £20.  Did the Minister not consider raising that figure to, perhaps, £28?  Did he seek statistics which would indicate how much would be involved financially in this?  The Minister had an opportunity to indicate to us the numbers involved.  One would expect that he would have considered this legislation in detail.  Did he not endeavour to ascertain what would be the implications of increasing the £20 lower limit to a more realistic figure?  I trust he will dispel any doubts we have in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for the continuance of the employment allowance of £17 per workman per year.  However, the imposts of the budget will nullify this.  It is reckoned that there are approximately 30,000 men involved.  I would have thought that the Minister, in conjuction with the Minister for Labour, would have taken the opportunity to do something general here and, perhaps, to offer a subsidy in the <Col N="175" /> region of £2 per week per man in the hope that other people might be employed. This would not involve more than £3 million but it might be a worthwhile step towards creating further employment.  It would appear that the Minister's attitude is that this is a short Bill and that all he is interested in is continuing the rate relief allowance.</P>
    <P>I welcome wholeheartedly the continuance of this scheme but the Minister could have been more positive in his approach.  We can only hope that the Minister will introduce some amendments designed to prevent the creation of disparities.  I regret that £500,000 is being removed from agriculture, an industry which we should be endeavouring in every way possible to promote.  I look forward to the Minister's reply on the various points that have been raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the Deputies who have contributed to the debate spoke from their knowledge of agriculture in rural Ireland.  While I did not agree with most of the opinions expressed I am glad that we can have such a debate here.  Deputy Murphy was the exception because he showed his lack of knowledge in this whole area.  Unfortunately, from time to time we find somebody going in where angels fear to tread.  The Deputy must have embarrassed his colleagues because, wittingly or otherwise, he was indicating that they did not know what they were talking about whereas each of them spoke from knowledge of the situation. They let us know what they thought should be done.  Of course, it is easy to do that when one is in opposition. I did for many years.  While in opposition I had solutions for practically every problem and I had no hesitation in putting forward my views, sometimes with tongue-in-cheek.  It was ironic that Deputy Faulkner and others spoke of increasing the £17 allowance. That figure has been in existence for 20 years, during 17 of which Fianna Fáil were in office.  They did not increase the figure and they had a good reason for not doing so : it was not achieving what it was intended to achieve&mdash;maintaining <Col N="176" /> people in employment.  If for no other reason than the £17 allowance there is any farmer who is prepared to employ somebody for 52 weeks in the year, or if there is a farmer's son who is foolish enough to stay on the farm for the same reason maybe he would just pass the information along to me because that person is unique in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He would be in severe trouble but he is not doing it.  Nobody seriously suggests that anybody is staying on the farm for £17 a year.  Even when £17 was a good deal of money people were not doing it.  They are not doing it now either.  When Fianna Fáil were on these benches Deputies on the backbenches expressed the same views as I am expressing now. We should not attempt to prove that we are keeping people on the land by paying £17 a year to their employers.  If there was a case for increasing the amount substantially that case should have arisen when there was an average of 12,000 farm workers leaving the land per year over most of the last period Fianna Fáil were in office.  The Fianna Fáil Government were right not to increase the allowance then.  They realised it was not doing anything for what it was set up to do and they did not increase the allowance.  Anybody who suggests that we should now (a) retain it or (b) increase it substantially is either having a try on or does not understand it. Two Deputies referred to the loss of the £½ million.  Is it not understood that the Government are this year giving the farmers on rates remission alone an extra £6.5 million approximately with the £½ million taken off?  Is that not going through loud and clear?</P>
      <P>The grant is being increased by about £6.5 million and if this was on it would be £7 million, from £30 million to £36.5 million.  Let us be fair about it.  We are all in the profession of politics here and we are all making the best case we can for ourselves.  I appeal to Deputies to be reasonable in their approach to those things because nobody will cod me and I will not cod the Deputies either.</P>

I challenge anyone to try to dispute that.  For goodness sake do not let us go back to that corny old chestnut because it just does not wash.  When I started considering this first I was very much inclined to agree with Deputy Faulkner's case that there could be a charge made of discriminating against the people who were already farmers within urban areas by doing what we are doing now. I think it was Deputy Callanan who said that he talked about this for years when he was on this side of the House. I heard him talking about it.  I am not talking about it.  I am doing it.  This Government are doing it.  That is the difference which some people do not seem to understand.  We are doing it for new extensions.</P>

      <P>Let us not make a mistake about it.  This is where it shows that people like Deputy Murphy do not understand what is happening. Urban districts have already two-fifths of the rates.  Those already in urban districts are relieved of two-fifths of urban rates and that applies to Dundalk and all urban districts; boroughs, except Dun Laoghaire, a quarter of the rates; Dublin County Borough half of the rates; Limerick County Borough two-fifths of the rates; Waterford County Borough three-tenths of the rates, and Cork County Borough half of the rates.  Deputy Murphy asked me why do I not make them all the same.  Why did Fianna Fáil not make them all the same?  Why did they make that pot of stirabout of the rates all over the country?  I assure Deputy Murphy of one thing.  If I have my way next year I will have the same thing applied to them all because I believe it should apply.  I am not doing anything which is unfair.  I am trying to go one step further to help.  I believe that has been done in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Farmers in the urban areas of Dundalk are only liable for 60 per cent of the town rates.  I am attempting to prevent a loss of relief to those who at present enjoy agricultural grant relief because they live in a county health district and because if they are moved in they will not lose as a result.  I know the arguments against this.  People do not want to move from one county to another.  If they are born and reared in one county they like to stay there. That is one of the arguments. Another is this loss of the rates relief.  I believe by doing this I am doing a lot to smooth out the further extensions of borough boundaries where people will not lose heavily financially by changing over.  I do not provide in the Bill for any deterioration in the position of occupiers of agricultural land which at present lies within urban boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner said that the grant should be increased to boost employment on the land.  As I said, it is doubtful if it ever had an effect.  The employment premium, unfortunately, was not taken up by the farmers. Maybe they were not encouraged. Maybe they did not see the way it was intended to be shown to them.  A lot of extra employment could have been given by farmers if they had taken up men for whom they could have received £12 a week for a period and £6 per week for a further period. A very small number of them, about 22, is all who inquired about it.  This is ridiculous in an agricultural country. I want to say to the Deputies opposite, who are so fond of talking about private enterprise, that the last <Col N="179" /> big bastion of private enterprise in the country is, of course, the farming community.  The farmer is a very independent man normally.  I do not think he would want it to go out, as some people tried to represent here and indeed as some people who are supposed to be speaking for farmers organisations try to put across in the newspapers, that every day the farmer is at the gate waiting to see if there is a grant or a handout from somebody coming to him.  I believe I know more farmers than anybody in the House even those who have been in farming all their lives.  I worked as a farm worker and I represented farm workers as secretary of a trade union for 26 years.  I dealt with farmers all over the country.  I found them very decent men.  We often had to agree to disagree.  The idea which has been given now by people who claim to represent farmers and, indeed, by people in the House that farmers are always looking for a handout is wrong.  It is being rightly resented by the farmers.</P>

I never heard the Deputy say it and I would not think he would be fool enough to do it.  It is being done and it is wrong that it should be done either here or anywhere else. Private enterprise is what the farmer believes in.  If he does believe in it he stands on his own two feet and should do so.  He is doing very well at present.  Deputy Faulkner also said that we should try to hold as many as possible in agriculture.  A sum of £17 will not hold anybody in agriculture or anywhere else.</P>

      <P>Deputy Faulkner would first have to go back and talk to his leader who spoke about cutting down substantially on State expenditure. <Col N="180" /> Nobody can come into the House and propose a massive increase in State expenditure and then at a public function say you must cut down public expenditure very substantially by hundreds of millions of pounds.

The gross rates on lands was £43.519 million and the <Col N="181" /> agricultural grant last year was £13.220 million.  This year it is £36.5 million.  In 1976 the grant will relieve farmers of rates to the extent of £16 million and I am sure the Deputy will agree that the farmers are doing quite well.  Deputy Kitt should also remember that 84 per cent of all holdings in County Galway are derated.  He asked that something be done for those with valuations between £20 and £33.  I should like to inform him that they represent about 11 per cent of land holders in Galway.  He should also remember that they get 100 per cent relief on the first £20 valuation. I do not see what the Deputy was getting at.  It is possible that he felt there were bigger farmers who were discriminated against but that is not the usual language I hear.</P>

      <P>The small amount they would have to pay in rates would not be worth their while.  A valuation of £33 in Clare is a fairly sizeable farm. The argument is being made that people have stayed on the land and have not signed on the dole or sought work because their father was getting £17 but I have still to be persuaded that that is so.  I do not think it is so and I do not think anybody would, in fairness, put it across that it is so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy described many of the provisions of the Bill as being negative.  The figure of £36.5 million is not very negative and it is an increase of about £6.5 million over the 1975 figure.  I should like to tell the Deputy that 77 per cent of the holdings in Wicklow are under £20 valuation and are, therefore, completely derated.  A further 8 per cent are between £20 and £33 valuation and they do not pay rates on the first £20. No matter what way one looks at the position one will find that the Bill is doing something which had been talked about&mdash;as Deputy Callanan said&mdash;for a long time.</P>
      <P>The idea of allowing farmers who are moved against their will&mdash;they have very little choice in the matter&mdash; into an urban area to continue to get the full benefit is something which should have been done years ago.  I am glad I was the instrument in having it included in the Bill and that should be accepted generally.</P>

      <P>I tried to point out earlier that not alone was nothing done for the people who were always inside but nothing was done for those who were being put in until this Government did it.  It is a little negative for Deputy Callanan to say that as we had done one bit we should do the <Col N="183" /> whole lot.  I am grateful to Deputy Murphy who gave as his reason that the one thing should apply to all the farmers within the urban area.  At present all farmers in urban areas who are working their land, that is land which is used as arable, meadow or pasture ground or as woodlands, market gardens or nursery grounds, would qualify.  Sports grounds would not qualify.  In urban districts they only pay three-fifths of the rates.  In boroughs, except Dún Laoghaire, they pay three-quarters of the rates.  In Dún Laoghaire Borough, they pay half of the rates and in Dublin County Borough they pay half of the rates. In Limerick County Borough they pay three-fifths of the rates; Waterford County Borough, seven-tenths of the rates and Cork County Borough, half of the rates.  Deputy Murphy, speaking for the party who were responsible for doing that, asks me to be consistent and have them all the same.  I am sure he will realise that if he had a look at the Bill and the ones that went before it that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 arises out of Committee Stage proceedings and is consequential on amendment No. 49.  Amendments Nos. 16 and 49 form a composite proposal.  Amendments Nos. 1, 3, 4, 16, 17, 18, 21, 49 and 50 are related and may be discussed together.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;company&rdquo; except in section 35 (4)*, means a company within the meaning of section 2 of the Companies Act, 1963, or a company incorporated outside the State;.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Rules of the House require that these nine amendments be discussed together.  Accordingly, I will attempt to explain the background to them and the relationship between the individual amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, three new sections were inserted in the Bill to deal with the conflicts of interests which can arise when elected members of local authorities are dealing with planning and land acquisition and disposal matters.  The first of these&mdash;now section 33&mdash;required that members of planning authorities should make declarations of certain interests and keep them up to date. The second&mdash;section 34&mdash;was designed to prevent members of planning <Col N="185" /> authorities and committees from voting on, or otherwise influencing, a decision on a planning or land acquisition matter where they have a pecuniary or other beneficial interest in, or which is material to the matter. The third&mdash;section 35&mdash;contained supplemental provisions.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, Deputy Molloy moved amendments which proposed to apply somewhat similar provisions to board members and their employees and to the staffs of planning authorities.  My initial reaction was to oppose this, on the grounds that it would be preferable to wait for general legislation when all aspects of the matter could be dealt with.  However, I was pressed strongly in the matter and, as a result, I indicated that I had no objection, in principle, to the application to board members and their employees, and planning authorities' staffs of provisions along the lines of those proposed for local councillors.  I undertook, therefore, to put down a Report Stage amendment, which would apply provisions, similar in their principles, to these additional categories.  Amendment No. 49 achieves this.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 4 standing in my name are consequential on amendment No. 49.  They provide for the inclusion in section 1 of definitions of &ldquo;company&rdquo;, &ldquo;manager&rdquo; and &ldquo;shares&rdquo;, respectively.  These definitions are necessary for the purposes of the revised sections being inserted by amendment No. 49.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 16 which has also been put down by me, proposes to delete the existing section 10 which deals with board members' interests. This is also consequential on amendment No. 49 which deals comprehensively with those interests.  Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 which have been put down by Deputy Faulkner, Deputy Molloy and Deputy Haughey, propose certain amendments in the existing section 10.  As I have indicated, it is proposed in amendment No. 16 to delete this section.  Moreover, the points at issue in amendments Nos. 17 and 18 are covered by the comprehensive provisions proposed in my amendment No. 49.  I <Col N="186" /> assume, therefore, that amendments Nos. 17 and 18 will not be moved. Amendments Nos. 21 and 50, which have also been put down by Deputy Faulkner, Deputy Molloy and Deputy Haughey, relate to the interests of employees of the board and of planning authorities, respectively.  Since both categories are covered by the provisions of amendment No. 49, I take it that amendments Nos. 21 and 50 will not be moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that we are on Report Stage and consequently there will be one contribution from each speaker except the proposer of the amendments who has the right to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We appreciate that the Minister has come quite a considerable distance to meet the amendments originally proposed by members of this party.  The arguments put forward were cogent, particularly in relation to the same standards being applied to the board and to officials of the board as were being applied to members of local authorities.  The Minister said he would have preferred to leave over the matter in relation to the board to a later date.  He will remember that we, on this side of the House, would have preferred to leave over the whole question relating to the local authorities to a later stage, when a general Bill could be introduced to deal with such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Minister introduced amendments on Committee Stage in which he included members of local authorities.  We felt this tended to single out the local authorities who were dealing with planning matters and that it was only right in such circumstances that all of those who were involved should be covered by the Bill.  The Minister will agree that, at the time he introduced these amendments, he was probably motivated by the fact that considerable publicity had been given to charges made against Members of the Oireachtas relating to planning matters.  Perhaps it is as well to mention that these matters were fully <Col N="187" /> and thoroughly investigated by the Garda and it was clearly shown that the people concerned were not involved in any illegal activities.  Perhaps this should get as wide publicity as the publicity originally given to the charges made.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 18, I should like to know from the Minister how this aspect of what we had been proposing is dealt with in his amendments. We made a case in relation to the definition of &ldquo;beneficial interest&rdquo; to include membership of voluntary bodies and institutions.  We pointed out on Committee Stage that these are people who are so involved in voluntary organisations that the organisation's interests very often took precedence even over their business interests.  Such a person could be, and indeed often is, swayed more in his decisions by his membership of such an organisation than he would be in regard to his own personal interest. For example, some members of golf clubs are very dedicated and the interests of the club to which they belong might override any other consideration in their minds.  If they were in a position to decide on a planning matter related to such a club it might be likely that they would be swayed by such membership.  We need to ensure, as I said, that whatever the planning may be those who may be swayed by any interest should have to declare such an interest and it was for that purpose we put down this amendment.  The Minister has told us that amendments Nos. 17 and 18 were covered by amendment No. 49 tabled in his name.  I should like to know how these amendments are covered.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other amendments relating to amendment No. 49, I believe the amendment put forward by the Minister in amendments Nos. 49 and 50 covers to a considerable extent what we have in mind and has improved the Bill considerably and, for that reason, we appreciate the action of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Committee Stage debate I pressed this matter very strongly.  The debate was, <Col N="188" /> indeed, rather prolonged.  The Minister gave an assurance towards the end of the debate that he would introduce an amendment along the lines suggested and it would be less than gracious on my part were I not now to express my appreciation of the Minister's bringing forward this amendment.  As it was, the amendment was somewhat lopsided and it would have saved a great deal of debate had the Minister withdrawn his amendment at that stage and introduced instead this comprehensive amendment.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Faulkner and Deputy Molloy for their comments.  At the start of the debate I pointed out that the Bill belonged to the whole House and the whole House should take part in framing it. I also said any reasonable amendments suggested would be considered. There were some things with which I could not agree but in the main the work done on Committee Stage was useful and has resulted in an improved Bill.  I believe that by the time we finish with it this afternoon we will have done a very good job.  Devoting time to the Bill is, I believe, a good thing.  It is the better way of dealing with the Bill and that must be appreciated by the Opposition.  A great deal of work was involved and there was no point in my bringing in half-baked amendments.  When I hold on to something on the advice of my officials I am criticised.  When I take the other way I am also criticised.  I am glad the Opposition have taken the line they have on amendment No. 49 which covers the points raised by them.  It deals with membership of a company or any other body which has a beneficial interest.  This is an attempt to cover the type of case referred to and I do not think there was anything more we could have done to tighten things up.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 18 seeks to define beneficial interest to include membership of voluntary bodies or institutions.  That is the point referred to by Deputy Faulkner. Perhaps the Minister could identify precisely where in amendment No. 49 that particular aspect is dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> The second point is in relation to somebody who would be unseated from a local authority under the provisions in amendment No. 49.  Would the vacancy be filled by co-option in the normal way?  I presume it would.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> On Committee Stage, Deputy Haughey argued that section 4 should provide for consultation with the President of the High Court before a serving judge is nominated as chairman of the board.  Such consultation would be in line with normal practice and would take place in any case but, to meet the Deputy's point, it is being specifically provided for by an addition to section 4 (1) (a) under amendment No. 5.  That amendment also inserts the word &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; in subsection (1) (a) to exclude the possibility of a serving President of the High Court being nominated, and thereby obviating the necessity for making consequential provision for the carrying out of his functions.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 is related to amendment No. 5.  As subsection (3) stands, a judge of the High Court who is chairman of the board would not automatically cease to be chairman if he became President of the High Court. This could give rise to difficulties in relation to the exercise of the functions of the President of the High Court. Accordingly, the amendment provides that a judge of the High Court who is chairman of the board will cease to be chairman on ceasing to be an ordinary judge of that court.</P>

      <P>(b)  the said section 1 (1) shall have effect accordingly.</P>

Section 1 (1) of the Courts Act, 1973, limits the number of ordinary judges of the High Court to seven.  The effect of these amendments is to enable a judge who is acting as chairman to be disregarded in reckoning the seven and thus, in effect, to allow another person to be appointed as a judge to fill the vacancy in the court.  The proposed provisions are broadly similar to section 14 of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 16, after &ldquo;planning authorities and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;bodies which are prescribed by regulations made by the Minister for the purposes of this section and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a considerable amount of discussion on this matter on Committee Stage and the Minister said at the time that he felt there was some merit in the objections raised by the Opposition to the subsection as it stood.  He agreed to bring in an amendment on Report Stage, even going so far as to suggest the format of the amendment, and it is that <Col N="194" /> format I have used in putting down the amendment.  It is almost word for word as the Minister detailed it in his comments during the debate on the subsection.  Deputy Molloy then withdrew his amendment in view of the Minister's offer to introduce an amendment which would satisfactorily cover the case being made by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I will very briefly deal with the case for the amendment.  As the matter stands at the moment, the board are bound to keep themselves aware of and informed about the policies and objectives of the Minister, the planning authorities and any other body which is a public authority whose functions, in the opinion of the board, have a bearing on proper planning and development.  We believe that this was too restrictive, that there are many individuals who take a special interest in proper planning and development.  They may not always agree with the official attitude or approach to planning and development in specific areas.  Because they are especially interested they very often have much to contribute to proper planning and could act in some cases as a balancing factor to the official approach, and I think I might lump together those designated in the subsection as official.  This balance of approach would be of considerable value to the board.</P>
    <P>There are several groups who are very interested in the environment. Many of them have taken upon themselves the onerous task of making appeals on a number of occasions. Some of them might be regarded as nuisances on occasion by the official side, but I think few would deny they have a contribution to make and, in my view, the acceptance of the amendment could help to broaden the whole outlook of the board.</P>
    <P>The Minister will note that we are putting down a proposal that the board would keep themselves informed of policies of bodies which are prescribed by regulation made by the Minister, and therefore the door is not left wide open.  Only bodies prescribed by regulation by the Minister could be involved. <Col N="195" /> I think it would be worthwhile if the board were to keep themselves informed of the ideas these bodies have.</P>
    <P>We should remember that nobody, the Minister for Finance included, can dictate to the board.  What we are asking is simply that the board in deciding on their own policy will have a knowledge of the various policies of groups who are involved in the whole matter of planning and development. That the board should keep themselves informed of such policies is not the same thing as, for example, that the groups interested in environment should put forward individual suggestions. The bodies outside the statutory bodies have general policies which can be related to particular cases, and as I say, the board should keep themselves informed of these policies.  This would help the board to evolve a broadly based policy which perhaps would be more acceptable to the public generally.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree that so far as planning generally is concerned, the public, and particularly those bodies which are not statutory bodies, feel divorced from it.  They feel that the official attitude is what counts. They will not feel involved in future under a board unless the policy adopted by some of the non-statutory bodies of which anybody interested can be a member, can have some bearing on the general policy of the board.</P>
    <P>Again we are not suggesting that the board should have to concern themselves with the policies of any small group who might be interested in the environment generally, but that it will apply only to bodies which are designated by the Minister, and the Minister would be the person who would decide on what bodies should be designated. It is essential that we have as much involvement of the public as possible in relation to the general policy of the board.</P>
    <P>People tend to regard the whole question of planning development as something that is reserved to the official side and they have no great part in it, except in so far as they feel somewhat inhibited when trying to get planning permission because they <Col N="196" /> have to face up to the official side which, at times, is difficult enough to convince, of the efficacy of their proposals.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give further thought to this in order to ensure that the board can ultimately evolve a policy which will not only take into consideration the desires of the Minister and the official side, but also of those who, while I accept have created problems and difficulties on occasion, nevertheless are deeply concerned about employment and have something worthwhile to contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support my colleague in regard to this amendment.  I find myself a little puzzled at the Minister's non-acceptance of the idea we put forward in this regard on Committee Stage.  Section 5 is very important.  Many of us had doubts about this whole concept of a board, as I explained to the Minister on Committee Stage.  In my view, planning is a social and, therefore, a political matter.  I am very sorry to see it departing from the political ambience of the Minister who is responsible to this House.  That decision has been taken and we are now to have a board.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House are concerned that this board should not operate in an ivory tower.  It will not be answerable to the Dáil but we would like to think that, to the greatest possible extent, in its operations it would have regard to all sorts of social and public welfare considerations. Section 5 is designed to help in that regard.  It says that &ldquo;the Board shall&rdquo;&mdash;it is important to notice the word here is &ldquo;shall&rdquo;</P>
      <P>so far as may in the opinion of the Board be necessary for the performance of its functions, keep itself informed of the policies and objectives for the time being of the Minister, planning authorities and any other body which is a public authority whose functions have, or may have, a bearing on the proper planning and development ... of cities, towns or other areas whether urban or rural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We regard it as important that the <Col N="197" /> board must inform itself.  We are laying down a mandatory principle here. We are not saying the board must even take these opinions into account. All we are asking under section 5 is that it should inform itself of the policies and objectives of these different bodies.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes a fairly long way in section 5.  He stipulates that the board must inform itself of the opinions and the objectives of other Ministers, the Commissioners of Public Works, the Irish Land Commission, a harbour authority and any other body established by or under statute which is declared by him, by regulation to be a public authority. He is going a fair distance in ensuring that the board will fully inform itself of the opinions of these public bodies but it should be noted that they are all public bodies, in so far as he gives himself power to include other bodies by regulations, they must be established by or under statute.  As the section is framed at the moment, it is wide so far as public bodies are concerned. Under the section the Minister has power to make sure the board fully informs itself of the objectives and policies of any public authority.  In effect, that is the meaning of section 5.  We are not asking the Minister to go much further than that.</P>
    <P>We are trying to direct his attention to the fact that outside the public sphere, outside the establishment bodies, there are very useful organisations which have a contribution to make in this area.  We have already mentioned bodies like An Taisce, the different academies, the Royal Dublin Society, bodies which do not come within the ambit of section 5 as framed at the moment.  In our view it is important that in certain instances the Minister would stipulate by regulation that the board should inform itself of the outlook, policies and objectives of such valuable organisations, institutions and bodies which have a very important contribution to make to the development of our community in different ways.  As my colleague, <Col N="198" /> Deputy Faulkner, pointed out, we are not asking the Minister to throw the whole matter wide open.  All we are asking is that he give himself power to prescribe by regulation bodies which he thinks should come within the provisions of section 5.</P>
    <P>It is not difficult for any of us to think of a number of important bodies and institutions which should be included and about whose policies and objectives this new board should be informed.  I am puzzled and surprised the Minister has not brought forward an amendment along these lines in his own name.  We are not asking for a great deal or making any great extension of principle.  We are merely asking the Minister to bring in bodies which are valuable and useful but just happen to be outside the establishment umbrella.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We debated this matter very fully on Committee Stage and gave the reasons why we sought the change.  The bodies we were anxious to have included under the umbrella and whose opinions would be available to the board were mentioned by Deputy Faulkner and Deputy Haughey. On Committee Stage the Minister said at column 157 of the Official Report of 26th November, 1974:</P>
      <P>For Report Stage I would be prepared to consider having a look at subsection (1), line 37 and, perhaps, after &ldquo;planning authorities&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and any other person or body which is prescribed by regulations made by the Minister....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later he said:</P>
      <P>...In an effort to meet the Opposition I suggest this change.  It will have to be dressed up, perhaps, for Report Stage.  I shall repeat it slowly:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 37, after &ldquo;planning authorities&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and any other person or body which is prescribed (by regulations made by the Minister) for the purposes of this section&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated that that was acceptable to the Fianna Fáil Party and would <Col N="199" /> withdraw the amendment which stood in my name in view of the Minister's offer to introduce an amendment which would satisfactory cover the point we had been making.</P>
    <P>I know we can only speak once in this debate but we have not had any explanations why the Minister was not able to go ahead with this.  It is disappointing he did not do it, because, in my view, it will weaken the Bill.  Planning up to now has been operated under a system whereby appeals were made to a political figure.  Taking into account the report of the inspector which is presented to him on an appeal and bearing in mind the proper planning and development of the area in question when dealing with an appeal, the Minister can take various other aspects into consideration before arriving at a decision.  But we are establishing a board that will operate strictly within the terms of this Bill and we are directing that board to take into account only the policies of public authorities.  We consider this to be far too rigid a provision for the board.  It will mean that they will not have the flexible approach that the Minister has been able to exercise up to now.  They will operate very much according to the letter of the law under which they are appointed.  Such rigidity in relation to planning appeal procedures and decision making will act to the general detriment of public acceptance of planning, a public acceptance which, after a struggle, has been quite good.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister expressed the view that it might be possible for him to meet the case we were making but since he did not do so we went so far as to suggest a formula which we tabled in the form of an amendment for this Stage.  It is a pity that the Minister cannot accept our amendment now but I ask him to consider this whole point fully again for the various Stages of the Bill in the Seanad because we are hopeful that the Bill will be improved further before it is passed.  We are not in a position now to debate this matter in any great detail.  We are confined to one contribution and have no wish to <Col N="200" /> go back over the ground we covered earlier on Committee Stage.  Perhaps the Minister has good and valid reasons for not accepting the amendment but to leave the matter as it is will make more strict the procedure in relation to planning and this will not be helpful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>After the contributions from Deputies Haughey, Faulkner and Molloy there is not much more one can say on this amendment except to remind the Minister again that planning today must be based on the widest concept possible and must take account of the wishes of all the people concerned because these are the people who must live with the results of whatever decision is reached.  Also, it is a very good exercise in civics to encourage people to take an intelligent interest in planning matters.  The amendment is reasonable and, if adopted, would make the Bill that much better.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey mentioned several bodies that might be included.  All of us could mention many bodies which would have something to contribute to better planning.  We should tell all these people that their views are welcome. This board will not be accountable to the House.  Consequently, before it is established we should ensure that it is based on the broadest concept possible.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Since reference has been made to what I said in this regard on Committee Stage I shall quote those remarks as reported at column 157 of the Official Report for 26th November, 1974:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey suggested that perhaps we might be able to overcome this problem.  That would be my suggestion also, because the whole idea of discussing the Bill is to try to improve it.  For Report Stage I would be prepared to consider having a look at subsection (1), line 37 and, perhaps, after &ldquo;planning authorities&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and any other person or body which is prescribed by regulations made by the Minister...&rdquo;.  This is <Col N="201" /> something like what Deputy Haughey suggested earlier and might meet requirements.  I am not trying to make it too narrow but neither am I making it a mile wide so that every crank in the country can create some little group and say, according to the Act, he is entitled with his association to have a say in the matter.  If that happened there would be no planning. In an effort to meet the Opposition I suggest this change.  It will have to be dressed up, perhaps, for Report Stage....</P>
    <P>I am not denying that what I said could have been interpreted as a promise.  I said that I would be prepared to have another look at the matter and I am not trying to pull a fast one on anyone.  However, having looked at it, there appear to be a number of complications which will have to be considered.  For instance, Deputy Haughey mentioned a couple of organisations but there are in this city up to 30 or 40 organisations all of which claim to be protecting the environment and all of which will create a great fuss if we make this amendment and they are not included.  I have included public bodies but I would be afraid that to include these other bodies would lead to a situation where, not only during the hearing of an appeal but all the time, the board did not appear to be taking account of the policy of any such organisation, they could take their case to court and hold up the whole procedure for a long time on the grounds that they were satisfied that their opinions were not being taken into consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely only reputable national organisations would be included in the regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would be amazed at the type of organisation that would consider itself to have that right.  Deputy Haughey was not correct when he said that in the future the public will not be able to participate in the way they can participate now.  The public will participate and the case of the Dublin Bay oil refinery is a typical example of what can happen when people become involved in <Col N="202" /> something like this.  The right to be heard on any issue will remain but what will not continue will be the right of any organisation to claim that their view has not been taken into consideration. Any organisation will be free to go to the board at any time and put forward their views but to put that in the Bill as a statutory right is an entirely different matter.  I would be afraid that to do so would result in something which none of us here would desire.</P>
      <P>I thought that section 5 would deal with the matter.  In providing for the setting up of an independent body there is an obligation on us to set some guidance for them as to policy and conditions for approaching their task.  A voluntary body is not responsible for planning policy in relation to planning and development and it would be wrong to put such bodies on a par with local authorities who are charged in law with that responsibility.</P>

      <P>What is extraordinary in regard to planning is that we can get about a 50-50 breakdown in regard to any decision.  It is said that one cannot win them all but we have reached the stage that we cannot win any of them, because no matter what decision is given there is always a large section of the community who will be prepared to say that it is wrong.  If the opposite decision were taken somebody else would say it was wrong.  However, I am anxious to help, and if the Deputies opposite would be happier I would agree to have another look at this for the Seanad, but I am not promising to bring in an amendment on this because I am not quite happy about the effect it might have.</P>

    <P>Deputy Haughey's Committee Stage amendment No. 18 proposed the deletion of the words &ldquo;such and&rdquo; from subsection (1).  He argued that the present wording gave the Minister power to approve or not to approve of particular persons a board wishes to appoint as employees.</P>
    <P>While the form of words used in the existing subsection has been used in other enactments, and while there was never any intention that the provision should operate in the manner suggested by Deputy Haughey, it may be no harm to clarify the matter.  The present amendment, therefore, puts the matter beyond doubt that the Minister's power to approve extends only to the number of employees and their kinds, grades and classes and so on, and not to individual appointments. The words, &ldquo;number and kind&rdquo; are used in section 11 of the Local Government Act, 1941, the basic provision about employment of local authority staff.</P>

    <P>The Bill, as introduced, did not contain any specific provision enabling the Board to engage consultants or advisers.  However, in order to put the matter beyond doubt, I introduced an amendment on Committee Stage which was agreed and now appears as section 14 of the Bill.  Deputy Molloy was anxious that some provision should be made to ensure that suitably qualified consultants who were prepared to offer their services to the board would be considered and that the names of persons engaged would be published.  This amendment covers the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy also suggested that there should be disclosure of fees and I pointed out the difficulties which might arise in obtaining consultants from abroad.  I have considered the matter and while appreciating its purpose, I consider it would probably be invidious to discriminate against Irish consultants in this way.</P>

      <P>17.&mdash;(1)  Except where a direction is given by the Minister under this section, the Board shall have an absolute discretion to hold an oral hearing of any reference or appeal to the Board.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where the Board is requested to hold an oral hearing of a reference or appeal and decides to determine the reference or appeal without an oral hearing, the Board&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> (b)  shall not proceed to determine the reference or appeal until after the expiration of the period mentioned in subsection (3) of this section.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any person on whom a notice is served under subsection (2) of this section, other than a person on whom there has also been served a notice under section 19 of this Act relating to the relevant reference or appeal, may, at any time before the expiration of fourteen days beginning on the day on which the notice under the said subsection (2) is served, apply in writing to the Minister for a direction under this section as regards the relevant reference or appeal.</P>
    <P>(4)  In case an application is made under subsection (3) of this section to the Minister, unless the Board decides to hold an oral hearing of the relevant reference or appeal, it shall not determine such reference or appeal pending the decision of the Minister on the application.</P>
    <P>(5)  The Minister may direct the Board to hold an oral hearing of any reference or appeal to the Board and any such direction shall be complied with by the Board.</P>
    <P>The existing section 17 gives the board an absolute discretion to hold an oral hearing of a reference or appeal.  On Committee Stage Deputies expressed opposition to the idea of leaving it entirely to the board to decide whether an oral hearing should take place.  I pointed out that not only is the number of appeals rising, but also the proportion of cases where an oral hearing is requested.  I made it clear that it is no longer practicable to ensure that every appellant who demands an oral hearing will get one unless we are prepared to accept very extensive delays.  My sole objective to including section 17 in the Bill is to help to reduce delays and this I feel sure is an objective we all share. However, in deference to the views expressed by Deputies, I am now proposing an alternative provision under which the board will still have discretion as to whether or not an oral hearing should be held except in a <Col N="210" /> case where the Minister directs that there should be such a hearing.  It will be open to a person who is aggrieved by a decision of the board to refuse an oral hearing to apply to the Minister to give the board a direction in the matter.</P>

      <P>We put down the amendment simply to ensure that the serving of a notice by the board does not preclude the party concerned, within the stated time after the serving of the notice, from making a submission which must then be considered by the board before coming to any decision.  We feel that the section as it stands could be interpreted as meaning that if a party or parties concerned have not already made the submission before the notice is served they could be precluded from so doing after the notice is served. As we pointed out on Committee Stage there could be many and varied reasons why the people concerned did not make a submission before the time at which the notice was served and, therefore, we want to ensure that the serving of the notice will not preclude them from making further submissions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the same as the Committee Stage amendment put down by Deputy Haughey and withdrawn after discussion.  The Official Report for 22nd January, Volume 277, No. 5, columns 848 to 850 has the record.  As it stands, section 19 enables the board to make a decision at any time after the period allowed by the notice issued under subsection (1).  It does not enable the board to make that decision without considering any submission received from a party either before the notice was issued or before expiry of the time allowed in the notice and it does not even exclude the possibility that if a submission was received from a party after that time the board would still consider it if they had not already made a decision.  Subsection (2) is permissive and not mandatory.  While there is no fundamental objection to the amendment the fact that it is mandatory in its terms might preclude, or at least discourage, consideration <Col N="212" /> of a submission which arrived a few days after the relevant period but before a decision was made.  In all the circumstances it seems preferable to leave the section as it stands.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 30, to delete &ldquo;Where&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Subject to subsection (2) of this section, where&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 20 was debated at length on Committee Stage but no definite conclusion was reached.  Some reservations were expressed about nearly all the suggestions put forward for its amendment.  In the end, it was left to me to review the matter before Report Stage although I made it clear that I did not see that much could be done by way of amendment.  As I said before, the section is largely a re-enactment of section 18 of the 1963 Act which was intended primarily to encourage reasonable decisions by planning authorities and to discourage abuse of the appeals machinery.  In fact, that section has not been used to any great extent and although the provision is now being widened to bring in third parties not included before, my experience is that the percentage of cases where the section might apply would still be very small.  That does not mean that it is not necessary to have the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> It is extremely difficult to define precisely the circumstances in which the section might be applied so it is unavoidable that we must rely on the discretion and the good sense of the board.  However, I want to put it on the record of the House that there is no general intention that an appellant exercising his right of appeal in a <i>bona fide</i> way should be directed to make any contribution to expenses even if his appeal proves unsuccessful.  I do not believe there is any need to fear that where a person's property is affected and he is genuinely aggrieved by a decision of the planning authority, or the appeal of a body concerned with environmental matters is reasonably grounded and reflects that concern, the board would direct such person or body to pay expenses merely because they availed of their statutory rights but were unsuccessful in their appeal.  In order to clarify subsection (1) (b) (ii) and remove fears that excessive costs or costs not related to an appeal, will be rewarded, I am proposing amendments Nos. 30 and 31 which will remove the reference to costs and will require the board to consult with the Minister before directing payment by any party to an appeal of a sum exceeding £50. Amendment No. 29 is a consequential drafting change.</P>

      <P>It is a drafting amendment. It includes in the Bill a specific new provision for the making of regulations about the procedure in relation to appeals and references to the board.  As a consequence, section 82 of the 1963 Act is being redrafted. Amendment No. 58 is consequential. This also is a drafting amendment designed to clarify the position in relation to appeals procedures.  Specific provision has already been made by amendment No. 32 for the making of regulations about procedure in the case of appeals and references to the board.  As a consequence, this amendment redrafts section 82 (1) and (2) of the 1963 Act so as to confine them to those appeals (under building regulations) remaining with the Minister for decision and oral hearings in relation to the closure of rights-of-way.  The other amendments being made in section 82 are necessary to take account of the provision in section 43 (1) of the Bill under which oral hearings, rather than public inquiries, will in future be held in cases where closure of public rights-of-way is proposed.</P>

If the Minister could clarify for us what his proposals will be in relation to the period immediately after the Act comes into operation, we might withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Further to what Deputy Molloy has raised, I should like the Minister to advert to this whole question of the transitional arrangements.  Thinking about it, I am not certain in my own mind where a matter is being processed under the existing procedures, where it is before the Minister and being considered by him, whether it is entirely valid and suitable to transfer that matter half way through its consideration to this new board.</P>
      <P>It is something about which I would have some doubt.  It seems to me it could be argued that, where a matter is before the Minister under the existing legal provisions, and where all the arguments have been submitted to the Minister as the appropriate deciding person, the whole case could be lifted out of the existing provisions and transferred to the board for decision. As Deputy Molloy asked, what precisely will happen?  Will the whole matter have to start off <i>ab initio</i>? Will all the case have to be argued again?  Will the appellants have to repeat any trouble and expense they have already been put to?  A matter of some consequence arises here.</P>
      <P>One thinks immediately of the current case of the Dublin Bay Oil Refinery.  Presumably if the Minister acts expeditiously with the remaining Stages of this legislation, that would be a case which would come under the provisions of section 22.  Is it envisaged that the inspectors who sat on the Dublin Bay Oil Refinery case would make a report to the Minister and the Minister would transfer that report and the whole matter to the new board?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the report was made to me, I would make my decision.  If I had made my decision, it would stay <Col N="219" /> with me.  If a decision has not been made, it goes to the new board.  There is no question of more people being involved.  The same report will be going on to someone else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important from the public interest point of view to clarify what precisely will happen.  At the moment the inquiry has concluded. The inspectors are now presumably drafting their report.  That report will be submitted to the Minister. If the board has been established when the Minister receives that report, will it then be transferred to the new board for a decision?  If so, will the new board feel confident to decide it simply on the basis of the inquiry which has been held and the report which has been submitted, or will it consider it necessary to reopen the whole matter and conduct its own inquiry?  This is a consideration which involves my asking the Minister if it is not preferable in cases which are under way, transitional cases, to have them finished out by the Minister and not transferred half way through to this new board.  I wonder would the Minister like to give us his views on what will happen in regard to the more important of these issues.</P>

      <P>The Deputy would not ask me to make a decision without going fully into the evidence.  If a report comes in, even if it means reading the whole thing, which is necessary in many cases, the decision will be made in a matter of hours, or days at the most.  At that stage an appeal does not hang around.  If it were a question of an appeal dragging along for several weeks, I could understand why Deputy Haughey should wonder what would happen.  Normally <Col N="220" /> it would be dealt with within a matter of days at the most.  It would be a question of reading through the material, consulting certain people, checking on the conditions, and so on. Normally appeals which were investigated and for which reports were prepared but which had not come to me physically would be transferred to the new board who would deal with them as I would deal with them if I had got them.  The evidence would be available and there would be no necessity to go into the question of another inquiry or anything else.  It would be the same as if there were a change of Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Policy in relation to the various marine activities has been the responsibility of a number of separate Departments.  Recent developments in economics and technology have suggested that a unified policy, proceeding from a coordinated approach might be desirable. As a first step, the National Science Council, in co-operation with the OECD, have produced a survey of marine science policy which may provide a unified base from which to approach the question of marine development policy generally.  Followup studies to the work of the NSC and OECD will be necessary before general policy can be determined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say first of all that I share the Deputy's concern and I know of his concern in this area.  Secondly it is one I have been very glad to be active in promoting because I think there is enormous economic potential in our sea. Thirdly, the OECD report which became available to us in final form in October, 1975, has been actively pursued under its various headings, and in this year's National Science Council's budgets a number of the things they gave top priority to are being very actively pursued.  It is fair to say that &mdash; and I think it was indicated in my answer &mdash; one could not affirm that a fully evolved and coherent policy in regard to marine development exists, but it is also fair to say that in the last two years, since the committee of experts was appointed at my instigation in 1974, there has been a very real and detailed study.  That study is one that the National Science Council is pursuing and its successor will pursue as a major priority of both scientific and economic effort for Ireland.</P>

I will happily co-operate in elucidating details for the Deputy but, in general, let me say we already have, particularly in Galway but also in other universities, quite strong faculties in <Col N="225" /> some of the marine areas.  We have very reasonable marine biology in all of our universities.  In the naval architecture area Verolme had a connection with Dutch naval architects, who, in the matter of training, are admitted to have great expertise in world terms.  The important thing is that in relation to the licensing for the Continental Shelf &mdash; I have not got the details in front of me &mdash; we have extracted a substantial amount of money which will be ploughed back into research and training in the development of all aspects of marine science.  That is an important source of funding and it was an important consideration with us in negotiating the agreements with the oil companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the total percentage increase in motor car insurance premiums since June, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The total cumulative increase in basic motor insurance premium rates since June, 1974 was 73.6 per cent, but against this reductions in loadings equivalent to 10 per cent of overall income were made in conjunction with the 1974 increases in basic rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not seem from the very large increase which the Minister has indicated that the insurance companies are dictating terms and rates and the unfortunate motorist has to suffer as he has had to suffer in the recent budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the period referred to in the Deputy's question is, as I have indicated in my reply, 73.6 per cent, but I think it is fair to put the increase in motor insurance premiums into a longer time frame.  If one takes the period from 1970 to 1975, over a five-year span, the consumer price index increased in that time by 93.09 per cent, whereas the motor insurance premium increased by 90.96 per cent, in other words a lesser increase for motor insurance premiums than for the consumer price index over that period.  If you take the period <Col N="226" /> 1962 to 1975, a longer period still, we find that the consumer price index went up by 190 per cent, whereas motor insurance premiums went up by 147 per cent.  Therefore, taken over a 12 year period, the increase in premiums has been slower than the increase in the consumer price index, though it was particularly dramatic over the period&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true also to say that in taking the period from 1962 the rise would be far more exaggerated on a percentage basis than in taking 1974?  The 1974 prices were high but the 73 per cent increase on that would be far greater than on the 1962 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making was that if you compare the increase in the consumer price index with the increase in insurance premiums since June, 1974, then motor insurance premiums have gone up much more rapidly, but if you take it over a 12-year period, they have gone up less rapidly than the consumer price index.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>In regard to the latter part of the question, I cannot give a <Col N="228" /> factual answer without prior notice.  I shall certainly get the information for the Deputy if he puts a question down or if he communicates with me.  In regard to the availability of insurance, I cannot say I am satisfied with the position, but I know it is vastly better than it was 18 months or two years ago when the return on motor insurance was so small that it was very difficult for people to get new policies, and some major insurers were threatening to withdraw from our market entirely.  The position is not entirely satisfactory but it is a good deal better than it was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will explain the recent massive price increases in motor insurance in view of the fact that the company (name supplied) which spearheaded the demand for the increases made a net profit of over £400,000 for 1974 according to their own audited accounts and substantial profits in 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent increases which I sanctioned following on advice given to me by the Motor Premiums Advisory Committee and the National Prices Commission were designed to give the companies a chance of breaking even by the end of 1976.  The reasons for the increase &mdash;principally, the need to provide for inflation &mdash; are set out in the published report of the committee to which I refer the Deputy.  The profit made by a particular company in 1974 could be no guide to the company's probable results in 1976, principally because of inflation but also because the 1974 results reflected a very heavy call on the company's re-insurers which inevitably will result in much increased re-insurance charges in subsequent years.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that it would be a good idea if a person who wished to renew insurance on his car could be given a firm, not a variable, quotation, depending on which official he happens to see in the insurance company? Does the Minister not realise that when a motorist wishes to renew <Col N="229" /> his insurance, he can get anything from £50 to £100 of a difference in the same office, or by going from one rural office to another, of the same company?  That is an absurd and unfair situation.</P>

      <P>In the instances where it occurs it is an absurd and unfair situation.  The Deputy is right to suggest that such instances do occur, but I am satisfied that they are few.  I am not telling the House that the situation in regard to motor insurance is entirely satisfactory because I do not think it is.  We are having it very thoroughly investigated. In the meantime, I will certainly follow up anomalies of the type the Deputy describes when anyone in the House brings them to my attention because they are unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated in my written reply to the Deputy's previous question relating to barristers' fees that my Department had drawn the attention of the Bar Council to the legal requirements in relation to increases in charges for rendering professional services and that I expected barristers who proposed to increase their fees to give me advance notice as required by the order.  To date, I have received no notification of a proposed increase in barristers' fees nor have I received evidence of any increase in fees by individual barristers.</P>
      <P>If it appears that a barrister has implemented an increase in fees, my Department should be notified immediately and the matter will be investigated. I do not consider that it would be either practicable or desirable to detail the action that would be taken in any particular case to enforce the order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the fact that Moroccan rock phosphate is to be reduced in price this year by 25 per cent, he will indicate the steps he will take to ensure that this reduction is passed on to Irish farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present arrangements in relation to fertiliser prices were introduced by <Col N="232" /> me in December, 1973, on the recommendation of the National Prices Commission. The commission had concluded that it was not possible to devise for price control purposes a formula that would relate the prices of end products to those of the materials used in their production.  Accordingly, the price control arrangements for the fertiliser industry as set out in the commission's November, 1973, report were formulated.  However, I am expecting a report from the Prices Advisory Body on fertiliser prices and when this is available I will be in a better position to assess the adequacy of these arrangements in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reduction in the price of Moroccan rock phosphate, my Department have requested the three main fertiliser manufacturers to submit details showing the effect of this cost reduction on their prices.  I should point out that increases in other costs may have the effect of counterbalancing the reduction in the price of this particular material.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it from the Minister's reply that even though phosphate is reduced by 25 per cent, the manufacturers can say that other components have increased and that there is no way this increase can be passed to the consumer?  Can they balance one thing with the other? What powers have the Department over that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>At present the mechanism relied on is the mechanism of price competition which since December, 1973, in a competitive situation, has been, in my view, the most effective method of price control. When you have a fixed price, that becomes the price.  The fixed price is useful when prices are rising rapidly.  When there is sharp competition and prices are steady or eroding, then the competitive mechanism is best.  We changed over to the encouragement of the competitive mechanism in December, 1973.  If we now find that that is not giving the consumer &mdash; the farmer &mdash; the best service, we can change that.  In regard to balancing a rise against a fall, if there have been genuine rises in other components <Col N="233" /> of the finished fertiliser, then it is just that the manufacturers should be able to recompense themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to a report but it is an inquiry that has gone out simply requiring an answer as to what component of their final price is represented by rock phosphate and also what was the amount of the reduction so it is on the basis of a reply to that inquiry that there will be an examination of whether a change is necessary in our current policy.  In general, we have been served very well in recent times by the price competition mechanism.  I would remind Deputies concerned with farmers' interests that when we went to the competition mechanism in regard to animal feedingstuffs we were criticised bitterly.  The result of our doing that has been that the margins are very narrow and that Irish farmers are getting animal feedingstuffs at very competitive prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider it reasonable that manufacturers and merchants who, in anticipation of big increases in fertiliser prices, were in a position to stockpile and make big profits should be prepared to pass on any reduction to their customers in the same way as they <Col N="234" /> were prepared a short time ago to accept the profit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is reasonable. This is an area where there is a real temptation to speculate and stock up.  Sometimes people come badly out of such speculation.

Those notices were not implemented as arrangements were made to retain the workers in question in their employment for a further period.  However, the museum's planned programme of excavation on this site is approaching its conclusion and, in view of the progressive diminution of the area to be investigated, it has now become necessary to dismiss some of the workers.  The employment of some of the workmen in question was terminated on 6th February, 1976, and the number employed will be further reduced gradually over the next few months.</P>

      <P>The training unit has been completed and the machinery required for the industrial training programmes that will be followed there has already been installed.  As soon as the specialist staff have been recruited and a difficulty in relation to electric power supply overcome, the programme will get fully under way. This should be within the next few months.</P>
      <P>The programmes are ones recommended by AnCO and they equip those who complete them successfully for semi-skilled jobs in industry and they are recognised as such by the relevant trade unions.  It is envisaged that juveniles from St. Patrick's will be among those taking the courses in the training unit.</P>
      <P>The criteria for the selection of persons for the courses will include suitability, aptitude, job interest, length of sentence and availability of places.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the role of the prison social welfare officer in the after-care of prisoners; if there is any method of monitoring the record of ex-prisoners for a period after their release to assess the success of the prison system; and the rate of recidivism in adult and juvenile prisoners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the written reply which I gave to Question No. 120 on yesterday's Order Paper.</P>
      <P>It would be an infringement on the liberty of an individual and an intrusion into his privacy for the welfare service to keep a watch on him after expiry of his sentence but where a person on release is in need of advice or of help in regard to personal problems or employment or accommodation the welfare service of my Department are available to assist at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A table showing the numbers of persons in prison who have served a period or periods of imprisonment on other occasions is given in the annual reports on prisons.  It is hoped to have the reports for 1973 and 1974 published <Col N="252" /> very shortly.  Similar figures are not kept in respect of juveniles sentenced to detention and, in any case, it would be inappropriate to classify a juvenile as a recidivist unless he persists in a life of crime beyond the point of maturity, at which point statistics regarding his recidivism become reflected in the adult figures.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an implication in the question that the success or failure of a prison system can somehow be measured in terms of recidivism. This, however, is an invalid assumption since, for one thing, we cannot know what a person's conduct would be had he not been imprisoned.  Another implication is that recidivism is capable of being drastically reduced, if not eliminated, by changes in the prison system.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, international experience and research do not bear out any such assumption.  It is increasingly coming to be realised even&mdash;or perhaps especially&mdash;in those countries which some groups here hold out as having what they term progressive penal systems that the best efforts at rehabilitation have little effect in very many cases.  This in no way means that plans and programmes to improve facilities in prisons should or will be put aside or that there is any doubt about the need to do what we can.  It is simply to bring a note of realism into the question of what can or cannot be hoped for in this area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the general educational facilities that are available to adult prisoners; the number of personnel available for the provision of such facilities in (i) general education and (ii) remedial education; the qualifications of these teachers and the standard up to which they teach; and whether prisoners are helped in preparing for public examinations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>An education service is provided in the prisons by the appropriate vocational education committees. In Cork, however, the prison is being radically reconstructed and the work has not progressed sufficiently to enable the service to commence.  Security requirements at Portlaoise preclude at present the operation of an educational service there.</P>
      <P>When introducing the estimates for my Department for 1973-74 I outlined plans for the further expansion of the education services provided in the prisons and referred to the appointment of a co-ordinator of education. The co-ordinator has since been appointed and the programme of expansion has continued.</P>
      <P>The programmes of education are designed to cater as far as possible for the individual needs of prisoners and include remedial education and general education.  Serious difficulties arise because of the shortness of the average period of imprisonment and the constantly changing prison population.  I have not heard it suggested, however, that the courts should impose longer sentences so as to enable people to be educated in prison.  Despite the difficulties, it is possible to prepare some prisoners for public examinations, including the leaving certificate.  Correspondence courses are made available in suitable cases and recorded language courses are also provided.</P>
      <P>The teaching staff consists of teachers employed by the local vocational education committees and have qualifications acceptable to those bodies.  A total of 15 teachers are employed in the prisons, 11 of these are engaged in general education and four are providing remedial education. These provide a service equivalent to nine whole-time teaching units and it is hoped to increase that to 13 whole-time units this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that the educational service for juveniles, which is provided by 20 teachers&mdash;equivalent to 17½ whole-time units&mdash;in St. Patrick's, Shanganagh Castle and Loughan House, is even more comprehensive than that provided for adult prisoners and that, as indicated in my reply to another question on today's Order <Col N="254" /> Paper, in addition to the education programmes, comprehensive programmes for industrial training are about to be implemented for both adults and juveniles.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) If at any time while the provisions of this section are in operation normal postal deliveries have been disrupted for any reason the references in the foregoing subsections to the third day shall be construed as referring to such period of disruption.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> This is a matter which was discussed at quite considerable length during the Committee Stage.  We believe it is of considerable importance.  It relates to the problems which could possibly arise through the disruption of the postal services.  There may be reasons why a person is unable to send an appeal until the final date permitted for such purposes.  Even one day's disruption of the postal services could mean that the appeal would not even be considered.  If the post disruption continued over a period this could have serious repercussions on those who desired to appeal.  It is reasonable that we should request the Minister in these circumstances to ensure that a person who is entitled to appeal should have the opportunity of doing so and should not be prevented from doing so if something over which he had no control intervened.</P>
    <P>It should be obvious that where a matter of great importance is involved, something which can have an effect on the future of an individual, we should ensure that wherever we have the power to control the situation we should do so.  I feel that in those circumstances the appeal we are making again to the Minister in relating to this matter is reasonable. Nobody can be certain when a disruption in the postal service will take place.  When it does it can seriously interfere with the individual's rights in the sense that if he does not send his appeal until the last day&mdash;many circumstances may enter into the situation which will prevent him doing so &mdash;then because this disruption took place it can mean that his case will not be considered at all by the board. We, therefore, appeal to the Minister to reconsider his position on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a repeat of a Committee Stage amendment put down by Deputy Haughey and withdrawn after considerable discussion. The Official Report of 7th May, 1975, Volume 280, No. 8, columns 1396-1408, carries the debate.  The amendment proposes to add to section 23 a provision under which the period for receipt of an appeal would be <Col N="270" /> extended for any period during which &ldquo;normal postal deliveries have been disrupted for any reason&rdquo;.  The amendment does not specify who is to determine when &ldquo;normal deliveries&rdquo; are disrupted, or how this is to be done, and it does not say whether the disruption must apply in the whole country or only in a part of it before the proposed provision would apply.</P>
      <P>The amendment would frustrate the whole purpose of section 23 which aims at providing some certainty as to the latest date for acceptance of an appeal sent by post.  This is necessary to protect the board against litigation and to prevent situations arising where expenditure or commitments entered into&mdash;on foot of what is believed to be a valid permission&mdash;are rendered abortive.  We are all anxious not to hold up development but we must accept that a period of two months for a decision on a planning application and a further month before the issue of a permission is a considerable delay, however unavoidable.</P>
      <P>If the period for acceptance of an appeal is extended, we must also extend the period before a permission issues.</P>
      <P>Unless that is done, a permission which has been issued <i>bona fide</i> and which appears to be valid, may be invalidated by an appeal received later. The purpose of the section is to remove such doubts and not to have a position of uncertainty which must add to the delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the amendment, which attempts to provide for exceptional circumstances, would be to cause even greater delay.  There are ways of making an appeal other than transmission by post&mdash;telegram, personal delivery &mdash;and the considerations underlying the amendment do not outweigh the more general implications.  Besides, the real test is whether our 11 years' experience of the operation of planning control has demonstrated a need for a provision to cover abnormal circumstances. I think the answer to this is very definitely &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;even though we have had strikes of one kind or another at national or local level, floods, storms, blizzards, mail robberies, <Col N="271" /> and so on during that 11 year period.  In all the circumstances, I must ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I can understand that no matter what period we give there are bound to be people who will be late.  There will be people who will say, even after 30 days, or 60 days, they intended lodging the appeal the next day if they had had the time.  The period allowed is reasonable.  On Committee Stage I was asked to consider what would happen in the case of the islands off our coast but I believe the people on those islands will find the period laid down as reasonable.  I understood the amendment was withdrawn on the last occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage we were arguing for an extension in the number of days as well as this amendment.  We decided to repeat this amendment because we felt it was reasonable.  Since we put down the amendment we have experienced serious disruption in postal deliveries. We have since had practical experience of the disruptive effect of any industrial action within the postal delivery services.  It is reasonable that we should ensure in legislation that innocent parties are not detrimentally affected by the industrial action of others who have no intention of interfering with the ordinary day-to-day business of the person we are making a case for.</P>
      <P>Any type of example would illustrate this clearly.  If some industrial action is taken within the postal services or there is some mechanical breakdown within that service resulting in the non delivery of an appeal letter within three days of the specified period, it is a severe penalty on the person making that appeal to deny him the right to have his appeal heard. The legislation is weakened that much in not making provision whereby the Minister or the board could determine such matters so that justice would be done and be seen to be done.</P>
      <P>Our amendment reads:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" />&ldquo;( ) If at any time while the provisions of this section are in operation normal postal deliveries have been disrupted for any reason the references in the foregoing subsections to the third day shall be construed as referring to such period of disruption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister's argument is a civil service answer, that it is right to try to tie everything down exactly.  We are dealing with persons and we should make the legislation as humane as possible. I do not think anybody would deny that a person who was inconvenienced by way of a disruption in the postal service and lost his right to appeal was suffering a serious hardship and, possibly, great additional expense. The Minister had indicated that up to now he was not prepared to accept such an amendment and if there is no possibility of his changing that attitude we can only express our disappointment. Our amendment is reasonable and if the Minister believes that our wording is not suitable from the point of view of the parliamentary draftsman or any other sections, we are open to any suggested changes in the wording provided provision is made to meet our situation.  The Minister must bring this Bill to the Seanad and he may have second thoughts in the meantime on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be fair to give any hope that I would change this. If everything else fails, a person has the right to apply again and while it would mean a slight delay it would be better than leaving it wide open as it would be if I accepted the amendment.  I will have to stand firm on this issue.</P>

      <P>Section 25 was inserted by an official amendment on Committee Stage to enable the planning authority to look outside their boundary and, where they thought fit, to have regard to the effects of their decisions on places outside their area.  It also extended the provisions of the board in relation to any relevant appeals.  Deputy Molloy proposed a Committee Stage amendment which would, in effect, have made this a mandatory provision rather than a flexible power.  This I felt bound to oppose for the reason that it would have imposed an obligation in relation to many cases where it would be quite inappropriate.  The Deputy's amendment was withdrawn without my undertaking to look at it again but I have since done so.  In my view amendments Nos. 38 and 39 now proposed may help to make the position clearer.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to the serving of notice.  I was wondering in what circumstances we could visualise a situation where all or any of the conditions were fulfilled and where the planning authority would decide not to serve the notice.  In other words, in what circumstances would they decide to take a chance.  I believe it is essential that notice should be served on the owner of the land.  I do not think there is anything to be lost by it.  In fact, quite the contrary.  A great deal might be lost by not serving the notice.  It is important that notice should be served on people who might be concerned with the matters to which the notice relates.  Whereas the owner would know if he intended to try to circumvent the law, other people might find themselves in difficulties in relation to the same matter if they did not clearly understand their position. I can see nothing being lost by serving the notice.  I do not think it would add much of a strain on the clerical situation of any planning authority or of the board.  On that basis, I should like the Minister to consider the amendment favourably.</P>

      <P>From time to time in this House we have all referred to unnecessary sections or words being put into Bills.  They become Acts of Parliament and down through the years people wonder why they were put in.  This is a case where we might do what Deputy Faulkner has suggested, but I do not think it is necessary. This amendment is a repeat of a <Col N="275" /> Committee Stage amendment put down by Deputy Haughey and moved by Deputy Molloy, as reported at columns 1250 to 1252, Volume 282 of the Official Report of 19th June, 1975. I opposed that amendment and, when I had given my reasons for so doing, the amendment was withdrawn.  I see no good reason for its reintroduction. This is one of the things which is holding up the Bill unnecessarily.  We already debated it.  The reason I gave was accepted and the amendment was withdrawn.  Yet it appears here again.</P>
      <P>As I already stated on Committee Stage, the amendment would make it mandatory on a planning authority to serve a warning notice in every case where it appears to them that land is being or is about to be developed without permission.  If the intention of the Deputies is to increase the penalties for all unauthorised development, whether the development itself is seriously objectionable or not, the more appropriate way to do this would be to amend section 24 of the 1963 Act.  Apart from this, it is obviously not desirable to introduce such an inflexible provision as is now proposed in the amendment.</P>
      <P>Section 27 of the Bill has been provided in response to requests from planning authorities for power to serve a notice to stop a developer from commencing or continuing unauthorised development.  Where unauthorised development takes place, and there is no serious objection to it, the position can usually be regularised by an application for permission.  To ensure this is done, it is necessary that some penalty should be provided for and this is achieved by section 24 of the 1963 Act.  However, planning authorities have hesitated to use the enforcement powers available under the 1963 Act to deal with unauthorised development which is seriously objectionable and would prefer in such cases to be able at an early stage to discourage the persons responsible from proceeding by serving a notice which would impose a liabilty for increased penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment would be to impose the same liability for <Col N="276" /> penalties in respect of all unauthorised development and this is hardly desirable. Even if it were, it could be better done by amendment of section 24 of the 1963 Act.  Accordingly, the amendment should be withdrawn. This amendment was debated at length before, and it was withdrawn. I feel we are, perhaps, wasting time in this case.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey felt strongly about this point.  He is not here at the moment.  The amendment gave the Minister an opportunity to reconsider the matter.  I know he gave his arguments on Committee Stage. I do not think we have been delaying the Bill unnecessarily on Report Stage.  If the Minister has not found any reason to change his mind, the amendment can be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>This is another amendment which was debated on Committee Stage. Where we reconsider the situation between Committee Stage and Report Stage, I am sure the Minister will agree we are entitled to raise the matter again if we so wish.  In relation to an amendment to which he had apparently agreed, the Minister decided to change his mind which he was also entitled to do.</P>

      <P>The only point I am making is that, if between Committee Stage and Report Stage we consider that it might be desirable to resubmit an amendment, I think the Minister would agree we are entitled to do that.  I have already spoken on amendment No. 42 which the Minister decided not to accept, and we have withdrawn it.  I would have felt that, in the circumstances, if he had accepted it, the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; would not have been necessary. It would be obvious that anyone who was served with notice, if he <Col N="277" /> contravened the law, would do so knowingly because he would have been informed through the serving of the notice.</P>
      <P>One of the problems about this word is that I can foresee quite a considerable amount of legal wrangling over it to try to prove whether a person knowingly failed to comply with requirements.  There could be instances where people did considerable damage by contravening the section and they would be able to avoid retribution by apparently proving they did not knowingly break the law. This would be a ridiculous situation. The inclusion of this word tends to weaken the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>I am not objecting to the right of the Opposition to put down amendments.  They are entitled to do that even though they were put down before on Committee Stage and withdrawn.  Having discussed them at length, and having heard the case made for them, in any case where I thought they could be accepted I said so.  In several cases here we have the same amendment put down again. Deputy Faulkner has made his case. The position is that the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; would affect people who got the notice but there could be somebody who would not get the notice and would be affected.  He would not knowingly commit an offence.</P>
      <P>This is a repeat of a Committee Stage amendment put down by Deputy Haughey and moved by Deputy Faulkner.  I opposed the amendment and indicated that the reason for including the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; was that if the person being prosecuted was not aware of the existence of the warning notice, he should not be liable for non-compliance with it.  The amendment was withdrawn.  I see no good reason for its reintroduction, but the Opposition have the right to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated on Committee Stage, a warning notice will be served on the owner of the land and the planning authority may give copies of it to any other person they think may be concerned.  It is always possible that some further person might be unaware of the notice and contravene <Col N="278" /> it in some way.  That is why the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is a precondition to an offence.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment may be to remove the difficulty in proving that a contravention was carried out &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;.  This difficulty is not likely to arise in regard to construction works or continuance of unauthorised use since the owner of the land, and others concerned, will have been served with a notice.  It could arise, however, where the preservation of a tree or other feature or thing is required.  This problem is dealt with in subsection (7) by shifting the onus of proof to the defendent subject to the provisions of the subsection.  That is as far as one can reasonably go.  I think the amendment should be withdrawn. The provision is a protection for people who could, unknown to themselves, be involved in something which is fairly serious.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, I undertook to introduce Report Stage amendments providing for increases in the penalties for the more serious offences under the Act and the Bill.  Amendment No. 51 provides for a maximum penalty of £250 for the more serious offences under the 1963 Act while this amendment provides for a similar maximum penalty in relation to the offence under section 27 (4) of the Bill of non-compliance with a warning notice.  The fines for offences under section 33 of failing to give a declaration of certain interests and the offence under section 34 of non-compliance with the requirements in relation to declarations of interests are being increased by amendment No. 49.  The penalties for continuing offences under section 27 (5) of the Bill are not affected by the present amendment.  They will remain £100 <Col N="279" /> or six months' imprisonment or both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>

      <P>Enforcement notices under the 1963 Act are required to be entered in the register which, under section 8 of the 1963 Act, is kept at the offices of the planning authority and is open for inspection.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Again this is a matter which was debated on Committee Stage and which we think should be given a further airing.  We have already made provision for dealing with vexatious appeals. While we are anxious that the rights of citizens should be upheld, we are equally anxious to protect the citizen in the event of somebody else wishing to prevent his getting his rights, for example, through malice.  I know the Minister can say to me that the citizen who is denied his rights in that way can go to the High Court, but a High Court case can be a costly affair. There are, however, two types who might possibly decide to go to the High Court, those who are wealthy <Col N="280" /> enough to do so and those who would be unable to pay the costs in any case. Losing the case would not deter either of them from taking the case to court. Seeing that the <i>bona fides</i> of a person taking a case to the High Court so as to have certain development declared unauthorised or examined or investigated in no way inhibits the person who has a genuine case, I think it is reasonable to add the words we have asked to be added that is, to &ldquo;show reasonable cause&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a misunderstanding here somewhere.  Deputy Faulkner talks about somebody having to go to the High Court.  This, in effect, is dealing with a case which is in the High Court.  It is a repeat of a Committee Stage amendment put down by Deputy Haughey and moved by Deputy Faulkner.  I opposed the amendment; we discussed it, and it was withdrawn. My reasons for opposing the amendment still hold good.  The amendment could be said to pre-empt the function of the court by confining &ldquo;any other person&rdquo; to one who can show reasonable cause.  The court will surely not make an order unless the applicant can show reasonable cause. On the contrary, one would expect that, if reasonable cause is not shown, the application would be dismissed and costs awarded against the applicant. I thought the amendment was based on the idea that the High Court was likely to act in a frivolous or unreasonable manner, but apparently there is a misunderstanding that this was dealing with other than a High Court case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>The point I am concerned with is that a case could be taken to the High Court by a person who could not pay the costs or was wealthy enough to pay the costs, for example, to have certain developments declared unauthorised.  I could not understand what harm would be done by having such a matter investigated and having the position considered in relation to whether the person involved could show reasonable cause as to why he did it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>While I can see Deputy Faulkner's point of view, how would <Col N="281" /> it be decided whether reasonable cause could be shown or not?  Would it mean there would have to be a court case taken to decide that?  Would it not make the matter even more complicated? The people who want to do so have the right to go to the High Court, and the High Court, we assume, will deal with it appropriately.  If the case is brought for a frivolous cause they will deal with it very quickly, and I do not see any reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>(a)  summary proceedings pursuant to section 27 of this Act or in respect of a contravention of section 24 (2) of the Principal Act and which are instituted by the planning authority in whose area the offence is alleged to have been committed,</P>
    <P>(b)  summary proceedings pursuant to section 33 or 34 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment arises from a point made by Deputy Haughey on Committee Stage.  He argued that it was wrong that, under section 31 (1) (b), proceedings could be taken many years after the alleged offence was committed, and that any person, without qualification could avail of the certificate procedure in the existing subsection (2).  I accepted that some <Col N="283" /> limit on the period for initiating proceedings was desirable and indicated that I would put down a Report Stage amendment to provide for this.  A five-year limit is now being provided for. In addition, the right to prosecute outside the normal six months' period and to avail of the certificate procedure is being severely restricted under the new subsection (5): it will apply only to planning authorities, the Director of Public Prosecutions, or a person prosecuting with the consent of the director.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;39.&mdash;(1)  The maximum fine which may be imposed in respect of an offence under a section of the Principal Act which is mentioned in subsection (3) (a) of this section (other than an offence which is either a further offence under such a section or a continuing offence) is hereby increased to two hundred and fifty pounds, and accordingly&mdash;</P>

    <P>On Committee Stage, I undertook to introduce Report Stage amendments providing for increases in the penalties for the more serious offences under the Bill and the 1963 Act.  The main effect of this amendment is to increase to £250 the maximum penalty for offences under the Act which now attract fines of £100 and £200.  The legal advice available is that £250 is the maximum penalty which can be prescribed while retaining the offences with the category of &ldquo;minor offences&rdquo; which can be dealt with by the courts in a summary manner.  Amendment No. 44 provides for a corresponding increase in the penalty for the offence under section 27 of the Bill while amendment No. 49 provides for increased penalties under sections 33 and 34 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The penalties for further or continuing offences related to the main offences are being increased <i>pro rata</i>, that is, from £20 to £50.  The attached Schedule sets out the offences under the 1963 Act for which penalties are being increased:</P>

Would the Minister not consult with his colleagues to see if they would agree to changes in the other legislation?  I am still of the opinion that £250 is not an adequate fine for some of the breaches in the Planning Act which have come to light in recent years.

      <P>&ldquo;(c) the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (3) of section 26:</P>
      <P>`(3) (a) In a case in which the development concerned would contravene materially the development plan or any special amenity area order, a planning authority may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, decide to grant permission under this section, provided that the following requirements are complied with before the decision is made, namely,</P>
      <P>(i)  notice in the prescribed form of the intention of the planning authority to consider deciding to grant the permission shall be published in at least one daily newspaper circulating in their area,</P>
      <P>(ii)  copies of the notice shall be given to the applicant and to any person who has submitted an objection in writing to the development to which the application relates,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii)  any objection or representation as regards the making of a decision to grant permission and which is received by the <Col N="298" /> planning authority not later than 21 days after the first publication of the notice shall be duly considered by the authority, and</P>
    <P>(iv)  a resolution shall be passed by the authority requiring that a decision to grant permission be made.</P>
    <P>(b) It shall be necessary for the passing of a resolution referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection that the number of the members of the planning authority voting in favour of the resolution exceeds one-third of the total number of the members of the planning authority, and the requirement of this paragraph is in addition to and not in substitution for any other requirement applying in relation to such a resolution.</P>
    <P>(c) Where notice is given pursuant to section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, of intention to propose a resolution which, if passed, would require the manager to decide to grant a permission under this section, then if the manager is of opinion that the development concerned would contravene materially the development plan of any special amenity area order, he shall within seven days of the receipt by him of the notice make an order (a copy of which shall be furnished by him to each of the signatories to the notice) requiring that the provisions of subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be complied with in the particular case and the order, when made, shall operate to cause the relevant notice given pursuant to the said section 4 to be of no further effect.</P>
    <P>(d) If a resolution referred to in paragraph (a) (iv) of this subsection is duly passed, the manager shall decide to grant the relevant permission.';&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, an amendment providing that a planning authority, by exercising their powers under section 4 <Col N="299" /> of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, could decide to grant a permission or approval even if the proposed development contravened materially the development plan or any special amenity area order relating to the area of the planning authority, was debated at some length. I indicated that I was not opposed to the principle of the amendment, that I would consider substituting a new procedure for section 26 (3) of the Act and, if this were possible, I would bring in an amendment on Report Stage.  The new section 26 (3) proposed by amendment No. 53 provides that a decision to grant permission for a development which would contravene materially a development plan or a special amenity area order shall, in effect, rest with the elected members, since it is their function to make a plan or any variation. The consent of the Minister will no longer be required.  Provision is being made for public notice so that objections and representations can be made and considered before the decision is made.</P>
    <P>Where a section 4 resolution is put down in relation to an application for a permission which would materially contravene the plan, the new subsection provides that the manager shall automatically initiate the relevant procedure and that if, after considering any objections or representations, the council pass the resolution, the manager shall decide to grant the relevant permission.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 54 is consequential. It provides that the appropriate period for deciding a planning application to which the new procedure applies shall be calculated from the day the notice required under the new section 26 (3) is first published.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Minister for having brought forward this amendment.  He accepted the point I was making on Committee Stage and his amendment fully meets the situation I had been speaking about.  At that time I was referring to a device which was being operated by county managers to circumvent the authority vested in the local authority members under section 4 of the City and County Management Act whereby, <Col N="300" /> despite the fact that the majority of members may pass a section 4 directing that a planning permission be granted, subsequently the manager had been deeming the granting of such a permission in contravention of the council's development plans and under the Act he was, therefore, obliged to submit it to the Minister for a decision. This device was being used regularly in the Galway County Council planning meetings whenever section 4 was brought forward.  I was very concerned because this was a way of dissipating the authority of local authority members.</P>
      <P>This Bill is very important.  The principal provision in it is the establishment of a new board.  There are other important amendments to the original Bill contained in this.  But since the Bill was published, of all the amendments which have come forward, this is probably the most significant. It proves the validity of Report Stage debate and the facility for Deputies and Minister to bring forward amendments even at this late stage.  I consider this a major change in planning legislation.  I consider this amendment of very great significance in as much as it increases substantially the power of elected members on local authorities.  This is a very good step and I am grateful to the Minister for bringing it forward.  The procedures he laid down for its operation seem reasonable.  I cannot at this time see any great difficulty in operating it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is finally placing the proper authority in the hands of elected members. They were always told they had this authority.  Since the Planning Act was passed in 1964 they were told they were the planning authority but when it came to the practical application, they discovered they had no authority whatsoever.  The manager could overrule them on every issue if he wanted. He can no longer do that.  I would like the Minister to give us an assurance that once the section 4 motion is placed and the Minister's procedure complied with, if the council vote in favour of granting a permission, this section will deem that it is now a permission.  I know it is open to any member of the public, or the applicant to lodge an appeal against it, but <Col N="301" /> I would like an assurance from the Minister for Local Government that managers will not adopt a technique of acting in their capacity as private citizens and lodging an appeal themselves and so find another loophole to frustrate the intentions behind this amendment and to frustrate the powers of elected local authority members.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will say that he cannot speak for managers in their private capacity and maybe I am being over-suspicious in regard to some of them but where elected members come together at a properly-constituted local authority meeting and make a decision, no manager should attempt to frustrate that decision by lodging an appeal against it.  This is the only loophole left and I would ask the Minister to ensure that in whatever circular is sent out explaining the Bill there is reference to the importance of placing the full authority in the hands of the elected members.  The amendment is first class and I am very pleased about it.  It will remove a lot of the frustration that was experienced in some local authority areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy's Committee Stage amendment referred only to section 4 cases.  What is now proposed covers these cases but goes even further.  Under the new subsections (3) (a) and (b) a planning authority will, in future, as a reserved function, be empowered to authorise material contraventions.  Accordingly, there will no longer be any need to obtain the consent of the Minister.  Subsection (3) (c) deals with the section 4 situation.  If the manager is given notice of a section 4 resolution, he must apply the new procedure if he thinks a material contravention is involved but the decision on the application will rest with the council and the manager will have to abide by that decision.  If the manager does not apply the new procedure and a section 4 resolution is passed, it will not be open to him at that stage to raise the question of material contravention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a private individual he can do anything he wishes: engineers have done so in the past and, no doubt, will continue to do so but as manager, <Col N="302" /> he will not be entitled to do so.  This meets the point fully.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 55:</P>
      <P>In page 25, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  The insertion of the following new section before section 42:</P>
      <P>41 A.&mdash;(1)  In the performance of their functions under this Act it shall be the duty of each planning authority to protect and preserve the natural environment and in this regard the Minister shall have power to issue from time to time to a planning authority such directives as he considers necessary and the planning authority shall comply with such directives.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will recall that on Committee Stage I put down an amendment which sought that statutory responsibility for the protection of our natural environment be placed firmly on the Minister for Local Government. For some reason the Minister refused to accept the amendment, to accept that responsibility. This was a very serious and fundamental mistake on his behalf.  Views differ on the current situation in regard to the relationship of mankind to his environment.  There are <Col N="303" /> some very able scientific people who say that the current situation is critical if not catastrophic while there are others who regard conservationists as cranks who constitute themselves into irresponsible lobbies and who have nothing more than a nuisance value.  For my part I do not come down on either extreme but everybody must agree that in modern society and modern communities, environmental matters are becoming increasingly important.  Some people see the industrial societies of the western world in a state of crisis and believe that the development of modern industrial technology will ultimately make for a world that will be a lot less pleasant to live in than anyone would desire.</P>
    <P>It is clear that to an increasing extent governments will have to devote more attention to the protection of the natural environment. There arises an immediate conflict between what are regarded as the interests of industrial development and the need to preserve some sort of tolerable living environment for the ordinary citizen.  We have not even begun to tackle this problem.  A couple of recent instances illustrate clearly that we have no guidelines, no basic concepts and no developed thinking in this area.  We have had the much-publicised attempt to locate an oil refinery in Dublin Bay and there was another instance in Tipperary which involved the question of siting a new industry but which incurred great local opposition on environmental grounds.  Both these instances as well as many others seemed to find us totally unprepared.</P>
    <P>We have no guidelines, no ground rules against which a project of this sort could be tested immediately so that the matter would be simply one of deciding whether it conformed with the guidelines.  If a project of this sort has to be examined in isolation and on its own merits it is obvious that there is no pattern of thinking, no structure nor rules into which it can be fitted.</P>
    <P>We cannot continue like this because our natural environment is <Col N="304" /> much too important to all of us to be treated in this haphazard, casual, <i>ad hoc</i> fashion.  We must tackle the problem of laying down guidelines which will enable us to move ahead, to reconcile the needs of economic development with the needs of environmental protection.  Perhaps that is what planning should be all about.  I have said here on a number of occasions that I am no great believer in the sort of planning we practice.  When it is all added up I am not so sure that the planning of local authorities and the Minister's Department&mdash;I do not mean just this Minister, I mean former Ministers&mdash; ultimately really contributes to the welfare of the community.</P>
    <P>If European Architectural Heritage Year illustrated anything in particular, it showed clearly that some of the most important, beautiful and valuable things that have been handed down to us from our forebears were unplanned&mdash;they were the unplanned villages and unplanned cities.  The fact that they were unplanned and grew in a certain way gave them this marvellous attraction. I do not want to throw all planning out the window but, at its very best, it is relatively superficial and it can only tinker with the surface of the situation.</P>
    <P>The central issue today is to try to ensure that economic development can take place without fundamentally damaging our natural environment. That is what real, meaningful planning must be concerned with today. The rest of this structure that we are creating in this and in previous pieces of legislation perhaps is useful and valuable as some form of control but until we grasp the central issue of the protection of the environment from the ravages of industrial development, I do not think we can consider ourselves as planning our community, our living conditions and our future.</P>
    <P>There are conflicting views about this matter.  The best view to take is that the situation is critical but, in the interests of employment, economic development and the urgent need to provide these things, we are forced from time to time to do things <Col N="305" /> or to permit things to be done that we should not.  This is because we have not straightened out the matter in our own minds and we have not come to grips with it philosophically or intellectually.  Because we have not done this, we have not laid down the proper guidelines.  I want to be quite clear that in this regard I am criticising myself, my party and anyone else just as much as I might appear to be criticising the Minister, his Department and local authorities. This is a current community problem that faces all of us.</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister would accept my proposal on Committee Stage to assume responsibility as a central statutory authority for environmental matters.  In asking him to assume that responsibility, I was not so much concerned with the immediate practical conservation of protection of the environment; I was more concerned with seeing that there was some central person or institution that would have responsibility for studying the whole situation, for investigating it, for seeing the extent of the problem and trying to discern along what lines solutions might evolve.  That is the real need today, to try to study how this basic conflict in a modern community can be reconciled, to see the implications of different courses of action and to try to propound some philosophy or approach out of which planning procedures and structures could emerge.  I do not think that as yet we have done the fundamental basic thinking that is necessary in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister refused to accept that responsibility and I think he has done himself a disservice by that refusal.  I was not at all impressed by any of the arguments he put forward.  He based his case mainly on the fact that other Ministers in other Departments had a responsibility in this area and, therefore, he could not be expected to assume overall responsibility.  In other countries this overall responsibility has been delegated to certain Ministers.  The very fact that many Departments are involved is in itself an argument in favour of making one Minister and one Department responsible for some overall authority and <Col N="306" /> co-ordination.  I am particularly concerned that nobody is doing the basic thinking that needs to be done at this stage.</P>
    <P>Having failed to get the Minister to accept my amendment on Committee Stage, I have returned to the fray with this amendment.  If it were adopted it would not by any means be as satisfactory as my Committee Stage amendment but it would be something. In this amendment I am asking that each planning authority have a duty to protect and preserve the natural environment in their own area, that the Minister should have power from time to time to issue through a planning authority such directives as he considers necessary in the context of the protection of the environment and that the planning authority would have to comply with the directives. This amendment is second best but at least it would be something.  It would place a solemn obligation by statute on each planning authority in each area to protect the natural environment in their jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have many pressures to contend with and many conflicting demands are made on them. They are pressed to provide different amenities and services in the interests of the community.  In the light of all these pressures on local authorities, unless we take a firm grip on the situation now the protection of the natural environment will be left very much in a non-priority situation.  It is necessary that it should be spelled out by statute, that planning authorities must have this responsibility placed on them.</P>
    <P>There was a time when the general view of Ireland <i>vis-à-vis</i> Great Britain was that the latter had all the advantages of the wealth and prosperity that flowed from the industrial revolution but she had also all the disadvantages of it.  We here had not an industrial revolution.  We had not reaped any of the advantages of it but, on the other hand, we had beautiful scenery and a perfect natural environment. I am afraid that concept is being turned upside down.  In Britain they are setting positively and diligently to restore the damage done by the industrial revolution, whereas here we <Col N="307" /> are steadily and surely going in the opposite direction.  The situation in regard to pollution and the desecration of our natural environment is getting worse daily.</P>
    <P>This amendment makes some favourable gesture towards arresting that process.  We will have to content ourselves with this limited objective for the time being until we have had an opportunity to do something more fundamental about the situation and I would hope the Minister would accept this proposal even at this late stage. I cannot see what objection he has to it.  I would expect that in theory, at least, he would agree with me that the natural environment needs protection and that the obvious people in each area to protect it are the local planning authorities.</P>
    <P>In any event, I would hope that by putting down the amendment I will direct attention to what is an urgent, critical situation.  I do not go to either extreme in regard to environmental matters.  I do not accept completely the well-argued case of some persons interested in this area that things have probably gone too far and that the industrialised world is facing catastrophe and disaster.  That is an extreme view I do not go along with but, on the other hand, I do not accept that all is well and that there is no particular need for anyone to worry unduly about the situation&mdash; that the various agencies are there and that they are taking reasonable steps.  To an increasing extent we must devote more administrative and legislative attention to this area and I had hoped that the amendment, though not very significant, would commend itself to the Minister.</P>

      <P>This amendment is very similar to one put down by Deputy Haughey on Committee Stage and defeated on a vote last July.  The only real difference is that the earlier amendment would have imposed the duty to protect and preserve the natural environment on the Minister, whereas this amendment proposes to impose the duty on planning authorities.  I bow to the ruling of the Chair that the <Col N="308" /> amendment is in order but it appears to me that Deputy Haughey is getting in the back door what was thrown out of the front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an idea that was so.  In his comments Deputy Haughey referred to a number of things I would have preferred him not to refer to, including the Dublin Bay proposal in regard to a refinery.  There has been an inquiry and that is an argument against what he has been saying because no matter who has responsibility the situation is that a person or persons will be entitled to apply for permission to erect a refinery and people will be entitled to object and an appeal can be heard.  Eventually it will land on my table and I will make a decision after I have had the best expert advice.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether this amendment is using a sledge hammer to kill a midge but I would point out that an awful lot of effort has been made in this area.  I do not know what the decision will be, but it proves that the planning laws which were introduced by my predecessors in Fianna Fáil were very useful and did a lot of good down through the years. Things may have been done which were wrong, but that is beside the point.  A lot of good was done and they allowed public airing of views on important issues.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Bay issue is important and in the Tipperary matter an appeal was granted and an unholy row was kicked up by people who objected when those concerned proposed to go ahead to set up an industry which would give massive employment. When those people left, those who were objecting decided they had no objections any longer.  I have been around the country a lot and I suggest it all depends on which side people look at things from.  Deputy Haughey's view and that of a man waiting to have an industry established to give him a job would be quite different.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In his amendment the Deputy is asking for that but in his contribution he said there is a lot of damage being done by people whose purpose is to create industry and he said some people held it has already gone too far.  He was perfectly entitled to make those comments and I am entitled to put the other side.  I believe the environment must be protected but that onus is not entirely on the Minister for Local Government but is shared by everybody in the country. There are clashes of interest between job promotion and what might be minor damage to the environment and one cannot blame people who are seeking employment if they come down on the side of job creation.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out here that the advice the Minister will get will be the most expert advice available and I should hate to think anybody would feel it was because of lack of expertise that things were done which appeared to some people to be wrong.  I do not think anybody will be able to injure the reputation of those people who do a good job well.  Whether by me or by my predecessors, the decisions in this field have been taken on the best available advice.</P>
      <P>The amendment is not acceptable. The Bill is one to amend the law in relation to physical planning which is, of course, an important means of protecting the natural environment, but the Minister and the planning authorities have no monopoly of responsibility in this regard.  Others concerned include the Minister for Lands in relation to forestry and wildlife, whose functions will be considerably widened by the Wildlife Bill now before the Dáil.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has responsibility for preservation of fishery resources. Other Ministers and agencies are responsible for development programmes which call for various environmental constraints in their execution.  It would, therefore, be inappropriate to impose a general duty, such as is proposed, on planning authorities without regard to all the implications and to attempt to do this in the present Planning Bill would be quite wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, the terms of the <Col N="310" /> amendment are unduly restrictive.  If the duty to protect and preserve the natural environment were imposed without qualifications this would leave very little discretion.  It could preclude permission being given for a wide range of desirable and even essential developments, for example, power stations and transmission lines, mining operations, factories and, in certain areas, even roads and houses could not be provided.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment in Britain have been referred to but the extraordinary situation there is that what they have got is a Department of Local Government only they call it the Department of the Environment.  In addition to the environment the Minister is also responsible for roads, housing and a whole variety of things which the Minister for Local Government in this country is responsible for and changing a name will not solve the problem at all.  It is only fair to refer to another aspect of this, that is the question of water pollution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I am.  The evidence I have is that as a result of the modern techniques used in sewage disposal a number of the rivers and the lakes already are coming back and we will have fish in lakes which for years were considered to be almost dead. This is an example of the fact that people care and are taking whatever steps they can under the existing legislation. Under this legislation the position will be immeasurably stronger. The amendment suggested by Deputy Haughey would not work.  I know it was put down with the best intention in the world, as I accepted the fact that his Committee Stage amendment <Col N="311" /> was also put down in good faith, but I do not think he can sustain the amendment.  I am sorry but I would not be prepared to accept it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 56:</P>
      <P>In page 25, between lines 50 and 51, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  the insertion of the following new section before section 43:</P>
      <P>42. A.&mdash;(1)  If it appears to a planning authority, after consultation with the prescribed authorities, that it is expedient to make provisions for the prevention of the pollution of any coastal waters, estuary, river, lake or inland waterway, they may make an order prohibiting (subject to any exemptions for which provisions may be made by the order) the pollution of such coastal waters, estuary, river, lake or inland waterway.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every order made by a planning authority under this section may make provision as respects all, or as respects any one or more, causes of pollution in any special area.</P>
      <P>(3)  Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing a planning authority shall, in particular, have responsibility for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the control of discharge to and abstractions from coastal waters, estuaries, rivers, lakes and inland waterways in or adjoining their areas;</P>
      <P>(b)  the monitoring of such discharge and abstractions; and</P>
      <P>(c) the regular and systematic sampling of the water in all such coastal waters, estuaries, rivers, lakes and inland waterways.</P>
      <P>(4)  Any person who&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) fails to comply with the provisions of an order under subsection (1), or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  knowingly assists or permits another person in the non-compliance of such an order, <Col N="312" /> shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100.</P>
    <P>(5) Where a person is convicted of an offence under this section and there is a continuation by him of the offence after conviction he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of not more than £100 for each day on which the offence is so continued or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is very closely related to my previous amendment.  In it I seek to have something done about the situation in regard to prevention of pollution in our coastal waters, estuaries, rivers, lakes, inland waterways and so on.  I put down an amendment along those lines on Committee Stage but the Minister did not see fit to accept it.  He assured me that his Bill on water pollution was on the way.  I accepted that from the Minister and withdrew my amendment on Committee Stage.  I am returning to it here because I was doubtful about the possibility of that Bill coming before us in the near future.  Whatever we may say about the Government we have at the moment, whatever disasters and catastrophies they have brought on us&mdash;they are many&mdash;we would all agree on this side of the House that the Minister for Local Government, above any of his colleagues, has been assiduous in bringing forward legislation but recently the Parliamentary programme has got into complete disarray. Quite frankly, we have no certainty what are the possibilities with regard to any piece of legislation.  For that reason I felt compelled to return to this matter in this amendment.</P>
    <P>Everything I said on the previous amendment applies here except more so.  The situation in regard to our waterways is steadily deteriorating.  I am very upset to hear that the Minister can be optimistic about this situation and to say that certain rivers are improving and coming back.  That certainty is not my experience.  I do not believe that anybody who is interested <Col N="313" /> in this subject, either at local or national level, would agree with the Minister.  There is a constant and continuous deteriorating of the situation. I have had personal experience of a small river, a stream and a lake, which I sought to have cleaned up and cleared of pollution but failed because the legislative structure at the moment is not adequate.  It is not appropriate for dealing with this sort of situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he knew of rivers which had been improved in recent times.  I was certain he would refer to the River Thames because that is the most dramatic improvement that has been carried out in this whole area of conservation in the last 20 to 30 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no planes going to Mullingar but the Deputy might look at the lake the next time he goes there.  It might not be as dramatic as the Thames.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us talk about this very seriously.  It is a fact, whether we like to admit it or not, that the British authorities have done a marvellous job in certain areas and in particular the Thames, which is a striking example of what can be done in this area.  There are now forms of bird life back on the River Thames that have not been there for 200 years.  I am not sure if this is correct but it has been said that a salmon has been caught opposite the House of Commons.  If that can be done with the River Thames I suggest it puts this country to shame.  I regret to say that the Minister seems to be taking this subject flippantly.  I do not believe he can say the same about the Liffey. If we take those two rivers and contrast them with each other the River Liffey has steadily deteriorated in recent years to the extent that now it is not much more than an open sewer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the EEC Committee we had occasion to draw attention to the condition of some of the bathing places around Dublin.  I do not believe there is any cause for complacency in that area either.  All in all our waterways, whether estuaries, coastal waters, lakes or rivers, present a pretty <Col N="314" /> dismal and depressing picture at the moment.  That is bad enough but I believe that situation can be very quickly restored. One of the encouraging things in this area is the capacity of nature to restore itself very quickly with the slightest effort.  In my experience, either in regard to wildlife or any form of conservation, I have found that if one engages in the slightest efforts the rewards are abundant. Once one starts to make any effort nature is very quick to respond.  Even though the situation in regard to many of our rivers and lakes is depressing and unsatisfactory they can be restored to a satisfactory condition very quickly if we make the effort.</P>
    <P>We must start to make the effort. In the amendment I was placing the responsibility on planning authorities to do something about the situation. I would not wish to press this amendment too strenuously or too seriously if the Minister gives an assurance that this Bill is on the way; that it will come before us very soon, either though the Seanad or through the Dáil.  If that is so, I would welcome that news.  I know the Minister has the need for this legislation very much in mind and I am sure he is anxious to proceed with it.  If we can be certain that the overall comprehensive legislation to deal with this problem will be introduced quickly, I will not press this amendment.  A popular ballad at present tells us that only our rivers run free.  Let the Minister set himself the target that our rivers will run free of pollution in his time.</P>

      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that the Water Pollution Bill will be moved by me in the Seanad on 25th February, the next sitting day.  I hope it will get through the Seanad quickly and, if there is not too much obstruction in this House, we may get it through before the Summer Recess.</P>

      <P>Having experienced what has been happening here in recent times&mdash;it has been lovely here <Col N="315" /> today and we have got through things in a reasonable way&mdash;I am not too optimistic.  I was surprised Deputy Haughey picked on the River Liffey. I am aware of his regard for a river that flows very close to him and aware that somebody, unfortunately, threw milk or something into it on one occasion and made a mess of it. I am also aware that he has been endeavouring to preserve the wildlife in the area and it was too bad that that should have happened to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year we spent £4 million on an ongoing project and this year about £5 million will be spent on taking the sewage out of the capital and the south side in order to prevent the Liffey being polluted.  If we were as rich as the British, I am sure we could do it with every river in the country but we are not.  We are making a major effort and expending a lot of money in order to make the Liffey pollution free.</P>
      <P>We all know that the two major pollutants here are the local authorities and agriculture.  The reason why local authorities are major pollutants is that nobody seemed to realise the seriousness of allowing raw sewage flow into rivers until recently. Even if somebody two miles down the river was pumping water from the river for the use of the town it seemed to be all right to let raw sewage into it.  I do not say we are solving that problem overnight because it cannot be solved in a short time but any money I can get from the Government to solve that problem will be spent on it.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the most the Deputy's party could turn out was less than £7 million and that it is now more than £22 million we are not doing too bad.  I could spend £100 million if I had it on this problem and I would only be on the verge of it.  This is a big problem and I hope everybody accepts that.</P>
      <P>In regard to agricultural pollution, I believe our farmers are beginning to realise that it was not a paying proposition to pollute waters in their area.  It is stopping.  The lake at Mullingar was always dead because the sewerage system for the town was not satisfactory.  A new system has been introduced there and it has improved the position immeasurably.  It is not perfect but I would like to see this happening all over the place.  However, it is wrong to say that we are not making an effort to deal with pollution. The Water Pollution Bill will prevent people who are deliberately polluting our rivers.  There are people who are deliberately polluting water and this Bill will prevent them doing that.  Such people are selfish and they believe that no interest should be considered except theirs.  If they were intelligent enough they would realise that they are not serving their own interest by doing this.  We may see Deputy Haughey catching a salmon off O'Connell Bridge in a year or so if he keeps going and we can forget about the one that was caught at Westminster.</P>

      <P>It would be more accurate for the Minister to have <Col N="317" /> stated that most public sewerage schemes put into operation since the war, and possibly earlier, are treated where it is deemed necessary.  The main cause of all our difficulties in relation to sewerage schemes arises from the fact that the old schemes were constructed to discharge raw. However, in the past 25 to 30 years treatment works have been provided where they were considered necessary. The Minister will find that this can be confirmed by his Department.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Liffey I believe both sides of the House will agree that the Liffey is in a poor state. Both sides will also agree that the Coalition Parties, while in opposition, did not seem to concede the point that it was impossible to remove the level of pollution in the Liffey satisfactorily until such time as a new sewerage scheme was provided for Dublin.  The old sewerage system in the city was constructed in such a way that the overflow was designed to flow directly into the Liffey.  There was raw discharge and there was no capacity within the old system to take overflow of that kind.  That type of discharge over a number of years has been the principal cause of the serious pollution of the stretch of the river that flows through the city.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil were concerned to bring the Liffey back to a clean water state and recognised that the only way was through a massive capital provision for a huge sewerage scheme to accommodate all the additional capacity coming on stream annually.  The old system was unable to take that and it was discharging raw into the Liffey. That scheme was started in our time. It has been under way for a number of years.  As the Minister knows, it is a very costly scheme and it will be some time before it will be completed.  The citizens of Dublin, and the citizens of Ireland who are proud of their capital city, will see a remarkable change in that stretch of the Liffey which flows through the city when this new sewerage scheme comes into operation.  Until that day we cannot expect to make any major headway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of industries are also contributing very seriously to the pollution <Col N="318" /> of the lower Liffey, industries which of their very nature discharge very ugly effluent.  The River Camac is taking quite a substantial load of this and it is in a dreadful condition and has been so for a number of years. New legislation was needed to deal with that type of discharge, industrial effluent causing pollution.  I trust that the Water Pollution Bill will provide adequate power to the local authorities to deal with industrial effluent.  The only way to deal with the local authority sewage effluent is the provision of new sewerage systems.  That is under way in Dublin for some years past. The Minister may be able to give a date for the completion of that scheme.  It would be interesting to get it.  It is costing many millions of pounds, involving the provision of a tunnel, and very costly work.  I take it that both sides of the House support it.  We are pleased to see the progress which has been made since it started.</P>

      <P>There is a vast other area of legislative powers and things which can be done simply by restrictions and limitations on persons, and institutions, and companies, if we have the right laws to govern the situation.  It is with that area that my amendment is principally concerned.  Perhaps more important, in both of my amendments I was trying to get the local authorities and the planning authorities environmentally-minded.  I was trying to get them to take environment matters from the bottom and put them right up there in the front of their priorities.  That is what I was concerned about in both these amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has had a long and tedious passage through this House. The National Coalition's 14-point programme contained a pledge to set up independent machinery to deal with planning appeals.  Accordingly, the present Bill was one of the first introduced in this House after the Government took office in March, 1973. Drafting, naturally, took some considerable time but the Bill was ready for circulation early in 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> This is history, I suppose, but when I spoke on the Second Stage of the Bill in March, 1974, I gave an assurance that I would be prepared to give full and objective consideration to any reasonable amendments which Deputies might wish to put forward on Committee Stage.  In fact, arising from the Second Stage debate, I myself took the initiative and put down a considerable number of Committee Stage amendments to meet points which had been raised by Deputies.  Other Members of the House on both sides also put down numerous amendments with the result that, when Committee Stage began in November, 1974, we were faced with a total of about 140 amendments.</P>
    <P>The Committee Stage debate took 11 days and was completed last July. I readily concede that some useful work was done during that debate but I must say that the tactics adopted by some Deputies opposite did not help. A number of very reasonable people sat in all the time but there were some people who did not help at all. May be I would call it a bit of filibustering.</P>
    <P>For Report Stage, I again put down a considerable number of amendments designed to meet points raised by Deputies at the earlier Stage.  I think I can say, therefore, without fear of contradiction, that my attitude towards the views expressed by Deputies on all sides has been reasonable and that I have fully lived up to the pledge I gave on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>The primary importance of the Bill itself is, of course, the new machinery it will provide for the determination of planning appeals.  The provisions in this regard are widely known and have received a fairly general welcome not only in this House, but from various individuals and interested groups.  What may not be so widely appreciated is the fact that the Bill contains a very large number of other amendments of the 1963 Act.  This is a complex Act which has worked reasonably well&mdash;I would not say very well&mdash;but, naturally, experience of its operation has shown <Col N="324" /> a need for improvement in various respects.</P>
    <P>Many such improvements are provided for in this Bill.  There are, for example, the new and stronger provisions for enforcement such as the warning notice procedure, the provision for High Court intervention and the higher penalties.  There are also important provisions designed to limit the life of planning permissions and to facilitate the variation of development plans and the making of new plans.  There are a number of changes designed to assist in control of air and water pollution.  Of course, there are the very important and desirable provisions about conflicts of interests.  This is by no means an exhaustive list of the Bill's provisions &mdash;or even of its main provisions&mdash; but it is, I think, sufficient to demonstrate the importance of the Bill and, if implemented effectively, the contribution it can make to better planning in our cities, towns and rural areas will be great.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Deputies opposite for their approval to the Bill.  We have not agreed on all matters but today's debate particularly showed how matters can be discussed in a calm and reasonable way and how the points of view of both sides can be taken into consideration. Again in the main, on Committee Stage a lot of very useful work was done.  I freely admit that suggestions made from the Opposition did improve the Bill.  I believe that is the object of discussing Bills in Parliament, and if it gets the same consideration in the other House we will have an excellent measure when it is finally enacted.</P>
    <P>The sooner this Bill becomes law the better.  The responsibility for planning appeals is not something which any of us wants to have for a long time.  It causes a great deal of criticism outside, ill-informed in most cases.  People do not seem to understand that Ministers do not take decisions out of cussedness.  Very detailed reports are made available to them and it is on the basis of those reports that they take their decisions. They have to take criticism, and I <Col N="325" /> suppose that is one of the things associated with being Minister for Local Government.  However, the responsibility will now pass on to a new planning board.  I hope the decisions of the planning board will be accepted by people outside in a rather more gracious way than some of the decisions which had to be taken by me and by my predecessors over the years.  Again I thank the Deputies for the manner in which they have dealt with the various Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, this Bill has taken a considerable time to pass through the Dáil. Our complaint was never that the discussion on the Bill was too long but rather that it might have come more regularly before the House since it was first introduced.  Exceptionally long periods of time elapsed between the one period of discussion and the next.  I would refer specially to the fact that the Bill did not appear in the session before Christmas.  I had thought we could have finished the various readings of the Bill before the summer recess.  I regret that that was not possible.</P>
      <P>There had been criticism that there was too much debate and discussion, particularly on Committee Stage, but I do not agree with this criticism.  This is a very important Bill.  It affects the lives of all of our people in one way or another in that it helps to shape the environment in which we live and endeavours to ensure that we will be able to live a full life in a world which has been transformed by technological developments.  On the one hand, these technological developments have added much to life, but these vast and worth-while improvements carry with them grave dangers in their effect on the environment. The situation the human race faces today is on a par with the moral which can be found in the short story &ldquo;The Monkey's Paw&rdquo; by W.W. Jacobs, in which each wish granted carried with it an equally severe penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, which has as its object the handing over of the Minister's power relating to appeals to a board and the orderly development and protection <Col N="326" /> of our amenities, is one which could not be rushed through the House by limiting debate on it.  The very fact that the Minister has accepted so many of our amendments is proof in itself of the need for careful examination of the Bill.  I would like to take this opportunity of expressing our appreciation of the fact that the Minister has accepted so many of our amendments either in their original form or as resubmitted by himself.  He has met us very fairly on many points.  There are, of course, other points which we would like to have had accepted, and perhaps the Minister would reconsider some of them in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>All in all, therefore, I feel the Bill as it now stands is a very much improved and worth-while one which will be appreciated by the people.  The Bill provides for a basic change relating to appeals, and when it becomes law the Minister's power will pass to a board, and planning appeals will in a sense pass out of the political arena.  I am glad that because of some sections of the Bill it will still be possible to question the Minister in this House particularly in relation to policy.</P>
    <P>What is important in regard to the Bill is that the discussion yielded results, and this has proved that legislation is not just a matter for Departments, drafting and such like but is moulded and brought to fruition by the contributions of the Members of the House who have a practical knowledge of the problems and who are the people's representatives.  We can all commend the Bill, and again I would like to express my appreciation of the Minister's attitude towards the amendments we put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Bill leaves the House, could I add my few words as well?  I spent a long time in the House in dealing with the Bill since it was first introduced by the Minister and I think that any criticisms of the number of days that were spent debating it are certainly not valid and cannot fairly be made by any person who is aware of the facts.  The Minister stated we were 11 days on Committee Stage.  That is not a lot of time to spend on the Bill out of a period of <Col N="327" /> sixty weeks between November 1974 and now.  The justification for the length of time we spent on the debate can be seen in the final product that is leaving this House now and going to the Seanad.  The Bill leaving the House is substantially changed from the one that was originally introduced by the Minister, and it has benefited greatly from the contributions made by both sides of the House during the course of the debate and the amendments which the Minister has accepted on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
      <P>The Minister in thanking us for our contribution, which we acknowledge, was a little unfair in not giving some recognition to the fact that much of the work done in preparing this Bill had been done before the Minister moved into the Department of Local Government by the previous administration. He should have given recognition to the fact that we had committed ourselves to the establishment of a board completely removed from the political sphere.  The Minister made his contribution to the Bill, most of which we welcome and accept here. The House has made its contribution and none of us will be sad to say farewell to this measure now as it leaves this House.  With it we hope will go whatever political influence there had been in the whole planning structure with the involvement of the Minister, under the previous Act, as the person who was charged with deciding appeals.  One can argue for and against it.  I think we have made a wise decision.  I hope that practice will prove that that is so.  We look forward with interest to the time when the Bill is in operation.</P>

      <P>Lest I be considered ungracious, I want to add my voice to those of my colleagues, Deputy Faulkner and Deputy Molloy, in commending the Minister for his attitude to the House and the Bill. This has been a first-class exercise in parliamentary debate, and while I would claim that on this side of the House we put a great deal of work into the Bill and its provisions, had it not been for the open and co-operative way in which the Minister <Col N="328" /> met the Opposition in regard to our comments and proposals, our work would have been in vain.  It is very satisfactory when one puts a lot of work into legislation of this sort to receive from the Government the sort of co-operation which we received on this occasion from the Minister, and I want to compliment him on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there would be any doubt about whether I objected to the long debate, let me say I did not object to it.  Long discussions did contribute to making a better Bill of it.  The reason I gave the dates was to show that it had, in fact, been a lengthy debate, and that was as it should be.  One of the things which I prevented from happening was the Bill being brought in for breaks which could have brought us in and out of the House over a lengthy period.  I did not believe this was the proper way to deal with it.  I insisted that we get a fairly lengthy continuous period as we did today, in order to deal with it properly. Possibly if we had dealt with the Committee Stage in a different way, we might have dealt with it more easily.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy said that he was sorry to see it leaving this House.  I am not sorry to see it go, possibly for a different reason.  I have very sad memories of the Committee Stage debate which I would not like to have before me again.  It is true a Bill was partly prepared before my time.  Work was put into it by my two predecessors.  Mr. Boland prepared the original amending Bill.  It was changed by his successor and changed subsequently by me.  The bones of the Bill were there from that time, and it is only fair that I should say so.  When we took office I was instructed by the Government to change this Bill and I endeavoured to do that with the full co-operation of the Opposition.  As I said at the start, I am satisfied that this is the way legislation should be dealt with in this House.  Reasonable people who are prepared to discuss the matter in a reasonable way can achieve great things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> When I was in Opposition I always felt that previous Minister, whether Coalition or Fianna Fáil, often felt they were the fountains of all knowledge. That is a great mistake and because of that I said at the beginning that I was prepared to accept any reasonable amendment at any time. I thank the three Deputies for their comments.</P>

      <P>Yes, but in an indirect way.  I would be interested to know whether it could be claimed that when money is made available in an indirect way it could be claimed that the money for this purpose came from the rates themselves.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment places me in a quandary because if I object to the amendment it means I am objecting to the Bill being passed, and if I agree to it I am accepting that there should be no employment allowance under section 7.  I would like to say a few words on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we had proposed was that the £17 employment allowance be increased to £200.  The Minister's argument today referred constantly to the £17, and the query he posed was whether it would be likely that anyone would remain working on a farm for the sake of £17.  I agree fully with him that nobody could be expected to continue to work on a farm because the £17 employment allowance was available. My feeling was rather than removing the £17 allowance it should have been increased to a point where it would be attractive and likely to ensure that the farmer could retain an agricultural worker.  I am very concerned about the very high level of unemployment which persists at present. Statistics recently issued showed that <Col N="331" /> the fall in the agricultural sector was only second to that in the building sector.  It is encumbent upon us to do everything we can to ensure that those who are presently working on the land are retained.</P>
    <P>The employment premium allowance of £12 a week was applied by the Minister for Labour at our request to the agricultural sector.  The possibility of a farmer employing extra workers is not very good because farmers employ relatively small numbers.  To employ an extra man would mean a very considerable increase in his percentage quota, whereas to employ one extra in an industry where hundreds are already employed would be a much lower percentage.  We must tackle this question of farm employment in a different way.  We must ensure that something of an attractive nature is made available to ensure that the farmer will continue to employ the number he is presently employing, so that there will not be a further deterioration in the employment situation.</P>
    <P>I pointed out earlier that very considerable and worth-while efforts are being made by the IDA to ensure that industrial employment is held at the present level, even if it is not possible in present circumstances to increase the numbers employed.  Every farm worker who loses his employment must of necessity try to get employment elsewhere. If it were possible to absorb him into industrial employment, it would cost much more in capital outlay than it would to increase the £17 allowance to a reasonable level.  This could possibly ensure that the farm worker would be retained on the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the £17 allowance did not stem the tide in relation to a reduction in employment on farms down through the years.  This type of statement is not relevant because in every developed country there has been a movement away from the land and into the towns and cities and, consequently, to industrial employment. Such movement took place in Britain more than 100 years ago but it was only during the thirties and forties that it began here on any noticeable <Col N="332" /> scale.  Unfortunately, because the urban areas of Britain were developed to a greater extent and had better employment prospects than was the case here, the movement so far as we were concerned was out of the country in many instances.  During the past number of years, though, that movement has been stemmed.  The case made by the Minister in that respect, therefore, is not relevant.  There would be that sort of fall in any case but it does not prove that the £17 allowance&mdash;I am talking of times when £17 was a worth-while sum of money&mdash;had not the effect in those early stages of at least slowing down that movement.  Today when it is virtually impossible for anybody who loses his employment to find alternative employment it is a matter of the utmost importance that we should endeavour in whatever way possible to maintain our people in the employment they are in.  In this instance we were suggesting, by way of the amendment which has not been allowed, to have sufficient money made available which would make it attractive for a farmer to decide to retain a worker whom he might be contemplating laying off.</P>
    <P>The agricultural worker is a skilled person.  He is very important in the context of our economic development. His skills are equal to those of someone in any other employment but there is the danger that this skill will be lost to him.  We must endeavour to consolidate our employment as it is and then, to expand it. For that reason I regret that, having listened to what I had to say today, the Minister does not appear to be willing to accept the proposal I was putting forward and that, rather, he is persisting in removing the allowance. I would have thought that this allowance could have been used for the specific purpose I have mentioned. While it is useful to have the employment premium in so far as agriculture is concerned it is available only when the farmer employs extra help, help in addition to those employed already. Our aim is to endeavour to hold existing employment for the present.  There is no opportunity for the Minister to meet the amendment because it has been ruled out of order but perhaps <Col N="333" /> he would consider the question at some other date so as to ascertain what might be done in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Faulkner on this.  In the area I come from there are not many farmers who can employ agricultural workers but there are a number of farmers' sons still at home.  The point is that a person who had four children and whose valuation was between £25 and £35 could, up to 1st March, draw social welfare of £7 or £8 but now, beyond the £30 valuation, and even with five children, he will not qualify for this benefit.  A farmer who had a son at home and whose valuation was more than £30 qualified for this £17 allowance. The Minister misunderstood me when he said that this remission did not have the effect of keeping anyone at home.  I did not say that but I am saying that a person who qualified for the £17 relief could not compete in an open competition for a public position with one who was employed in a sector other than agriculture because he could not take employment, be insured and continue to get the relief.</P>

While £17 was of some value in past years, it is of little worth today. If the amount of relief were to be increased substantially to, say, £100, together with the employment premium it could result in more employment, especially on larger farms.  However, I am referring to the smaller farmer because there are not many big farmers in my area.  The Minister was talking of big farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum of £200 is mentioned in amendment No. 2.  Deputy <Col N="336" /> Callanan has said he was not talking about the big farmers, that he was talking about the farmer's son who was kept at home on a farm of £25 valuation.  No matter how high we increased the allowance it would not be worth much to such people because the rates they would be paying would be somewhere around the £17 mark. No matter how high we went we could not encourage the farmer to keep the son at home because he could not get any more.  It would be no use to him because he would not be paying that kind of rates.</P>
      <P>When talking about increasing the amount in order to encourage farmers to keep men on the farm, we must consider what kind of farmers we are discussing.  I said earlier, and I repeat it now, that I worked as a farm worker; for 26 years I worked as a trade union official dealing with farmers and their workers.  I found the farmers tough but decent men; they did not then, and still do not, want people to get the impression that they want something for nothing.</P>
      <P>There are some people even in this House and there are those outside it who are always talking about &ldquo;handouts&rdquo; for the farmers.  The farmers do not want handouts.  The £17 we have been talking about is no good. Nobody will convince me that any young man will stay on his father's farm because his father is getting £17 off his rates each year.  It is ridiculous to suggest that is so.  Last year Deputy Callanan said the amount was ridiculous and when I was on the Opposition benches I had the same opinion. For the last 19 years it remained at £17; during 16 of those 19 years Fianna Fáil were in power but they did nothing about it.  They were right to do nothing about it.  They could have wiped it out; in fact, about ten years ago one of my predecessors said that we had reached the time where it was not significant in so far as keeping people in employment was concerned. He said it might be as well to do away with it but he did not take that step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year we are stopping the £17 but it does not matter very much to anyone.  It is saving the Exchequer <Col N="337" /> £500,000 but we are giving an extra £6,500,000 in rates relief to farmers as a direct payment.  This is irrespective of items such as health and housing which cost approximately £4 in the £. The £500,000 we are taking represents about 30p a week and nobody can convince me that a person stays in a job because his father or relative is getting 30p a week.  This matter should have been dealt with long ago.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, increasing the amount would not have made any difference because the people who would benefit would get very little, unless they got a direct subsidy or a handout and this they do not want.  They would get a very small amount because they would not be paying enough rates. If the amount were increased it would affect the bigger farmer.  He would have more money but I do not think it is our job to help him because we would have to tax someone else to get that money.  It would be a mistake to increase income tax or to impose other taxation in order to give money to the only people who could benefit by a higher payment for the employment allowance.  Continuing the existing allowance at £20 was right, but it was time to stop the £17 allowance. In 1976 it was a bit of a joke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out yesterday evening that only a few short years ago the group certificate, the two years' course, was the highest course available in the technical schools.  During that short time we introduced the intermediate and leaving certificates and made them available to students in technical schools.  We provided the regional technical colleges and the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick for third level education on the non-university side.  In that way we upgraded the whole technical side of education.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce would now have us throw over all that we have built up through long and arduous work over the years by granting to a traditional university, which can have little affinity or understanding with the type of education available in the NIHE, the right to award degrees there. This is coming down on the academic side with a vengeance and is completely at variance with the words of the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday where he would have us believe that he was anxious to have equality of respect and esteem <Col N="340" /> for technical and technological education.</P>
      <P>We say with regard to third level education that we want a situation to develop where we will ultimately get a unified system by evolving processes rather than by forced action on the part of the Government.  We want to ensure that technical and technological education will grow and develop until it can combine on equal terms with the academic structure. We want to see students at third level awarded qualifications to degree level by the NCEA following examinations set on courses laid down by the NCEA.</P>
      <P>How can this be possible?  How can it be possible to lay down a workable arrangement between the body, which is responsible for approving courses of study all through the system, and then have the results assessed for degree purposes by another body which cannot have the expertise to deal with them and as well will not have the intimate association with the students which is necessary if a proper assessment is to be carried out? I said on a previous occasion in this House, and I say it again, that the proposals which emanated from the Cabinet subcommittee in relation to higher education are unworkable. They are unacceptable.  This is agreed by quite a considerable number of the institutions involved and by the student body.  The proposals cut across the decisions being arrived at for third level education in Ireland resulting from long and arduous discussions over a number of years with all the interests involved.  Four or five Ministers at a few, of necessity, short meetings decided that they knew more about third level education here than the accumulated wisdom of all the individuals and groups which were moving towards a solution which was generally acceptable when I left office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already had to go back on the decision he originally made to disband the NCEA altogether. He soon found that the decision to abolish the NCEA was a disaster and he quickly reversed it.  We have been promised green papers and white <Col N="341" /> papers on higher education by the Minister.  We were offered what purported to be proposals by the Minister which were later said by him to be decisions.  The NCEA, as I said before, was abolished by the Minister and later reconstituted.  We have neither got a green paper nor a white paper and nobody is certain any longer what the word &ldquo;decision&rdquo; means in the context of higher education.</P>
    <P>Let us once again remember that the Institute for Higher Education was not established for the sole purpose of making available another traditional university in Limerick.  There was very much more involved.  Here we have an institution geared towards technology and the type of education which filled a long needed want in Ireland.  The students pointed out that they had the opportunity of relating theory to practice.  We have an institution which has the unique opportunity so far as this country is concerned of pursuing its objectives, very much in the national interest, in its own way.  In my view, if the Minister insists on having the degrees awarded to this institute by a university, then the ultimate effect will be to drag the institute into providing the type of education traditional to universities.  While I have the greatest regard for our universities, I simply wish to state clearly that this was not the purpose for which the NIHE was founded.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever in my mind that the effect of giving a university the right to award the degrees will have a seriously detrimental effect on the development of technology in the NIHE.  The NCEA is a national body and has gained acceptability in the public mind.  I am completely at a loss to know why the Minister should even think for one moment of allowing an outside institute award degrees when there is such a fine instrument to hand.</P>
    <P>I must admit that I got considerable pleasure from the fact that the students in the National Institute for Higher Education, opened by Deputy Jack Lynch, then Taoiseach, during my time in office as Minister for Education, should now be demanding that <Col N="342" /> degrees be awarded by the NCEA set up by me on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  It is worth remembering in this context that students have never shown great eagerness to accept proposals emanating from Ministers or Departments. Therefore, in the matter under discussion I feel that they should be listened to.  The situation here is somewhat on a par with the success of the community schools for which I was responsible and about which at the time I had considerable difficulty in convincing the people of their value.  It is my pleasure to note now that in many areas there is a demand for them.</P>
    <P>I underline the fact that much thought went into framing the proposals for the institute and the NCEA. The advantage we had was that we knew exactly what we wanted and we proceeded along the lines which would enable us to achieve our objectives. We had to withstand considerable pressures but knowing where one is going and believing, after due consideration, that one is on the right path is a tremendous asset.  The Cabinet sub-committee have placed the Minister in an almost impossible position and I have some sympathy for him in his dilemma.  He must exercise his authority and move back from the edge of the precipice.  If he does not and persists in the view expressed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce last night, it will be to the detriment of technological and technical education.</P>
    <P>We established the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick with the intention of developing third level technological education to the highest possible degree.  I am convinced that if it is forced to accept qualifications from another institution which has a different tradition it will not be to the advantage of education. We are concerned about having a unified system of education but I am convinced that it is not possible to have a forced union.  In fact, a forced union will have the effect of damaging the weaker section because it is not long in existence&mdash;I am speaking about the technological side.  I appeal to the Minister to re-consider this position and to grant the right to the <Col N="343" /> National Council for Educational Awards to award the degrees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He may have but one can only speculate.  I did not anticipate I would be at this disadvantage because Ministers of the Government are not normally reluctant to make their voices heard.  It is strange&mdash;perhaps not too strange&mdash; that this Minister does not seem anxious to say anything any sooner than he can avoid saying it, that is if we have any guarantee he will speak during the debate at all.  Unlike everybody else who has spoken on this matter, I am no expert on educational matters but I represent the East Limerick constituency in which the National Institute for Higher Education is situated.  I am aware of the serious disquiet among all the students, and their parents, about that institute and at the rather extraordinary actions of the Government in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than 12 months ago we had an announcement of the Government's intentions in relation to third level education.  They were originally described as intentions and principles but a few days later they were described as decisions which would not be changed.  Subsequently we were told that they were available for discussion. Nobody knows what the situation will be because, notwithstanding the passage of more than 12 months, the Minister for Education and the Government <Col N="344" /> have made no decision regarding the award of a degree to the students who will graduate this year. I understand that there are 80 students in their fourth year and they expect to graduate in June, 1976.  They entered the institute on its foundation in 1972.  They are still in the position, as are the other students, that they do not know who, if anybody, will award their degrees and under what conditions.</P>
    <P>The Students Union, in the course of a letter sent to me, and other Deputies, dated 29th January, described the position well when they said:</P>
    <P>The NIHE was set up 4 years ago as an innovative force in Irish third-level education.  Its purpose was to provide graduates, educated to contribute to the growing needs of the Irish economy, particularly in the Mid-West Region.  As such, we feel it is vital that the basic educational philosophy of the college is maintained.</P>
    <P>Because of the urgency involved, we now feel it necessary to initiate a degree campaign and we are asking the support of those who, we feel, are in a position to speed up a decision.</P>
    <P>They have initiated that campaign and given details of their problem to the Press.  This has been given wide publicity at national and local level.  Unfortunately, as yet, they have not yet succeeded in getting a decision.  They are, therefore, placed in an appalling predicament.</P>
    <P>I can best illustrate the difficulty that is common to all these students and their parents by quoting from a letter I received last week from a constituent of mine whose son is a fourth year student at the institute. That person states:</P>
    <P>Having a son about to graduate from NIHE I am more than concerned at the uncertainty in regard to the award of degrees.</P>
    <P>The Minister's suggestion that degrees should be awarded by UCC has been rejected by the Governing Body, the staff and the student body of NIHE.  UCC have questioned <Col N="345" /> their competence to act without making a major change in NIHE's system of assessment.</P>
    <P>I sent a top grade student to NIHE.  He had offers of scholarships from TCD and UCD.  He got a top grade education in NIHE and deserves a top grade degree.  His cumulative grading over all subjects is in excess of 80 per cent and he has glowing references from co-op employers in Ireland, Germany and Finland.  How do you think he and his contemporaries feel about the threat to subordinate and stifle all that is new in NIHE under the old and tired weight of NUI or UCC?  How do you think they feel about the Ministerial messing on the question of their degrees?</P>
    <P>That letter sums up adequately the predicament the students and the parents find themselves in.  This has not arisen overnight; it has been going on for more than 12 months.  Every day that passes makes the difficulty and the apprehension greater.  It makes the situation of the students less secure and more worrying.</P>
    <P>Why the Minister cannot make a decision is beyond me.  Perhaps because of his reluctance to speak tonight in this debate until the last possible moment, he may be going to make some announcement.  I do not know.  I would certainly like to hope so.  On the other hand, we have no guarantee whatever that he will. Will the announcement he is going to make be on the lines he suggested when he made this statement on higher education on 16th December, 1974, and when the future of NIHE in Limerick was laid down in one terse paragraph which reads that the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, shall be a recognised college of the National University of Ireland with the capacity to evolve into a constituent college of the NUI or to become an autonomous degree awarding institution?</P>
    <P>If the decision he might or might not announce tonight&mdash;we have not got the advantage of knowing that, and the Minister is not helping the debate by deliberately keeping out of it until <Col N="346" /> the last possible moment, if he intends to speak at all&mdash;is on the lines of what is set out there, I would almost think no decision would be better than that.  If he is endeavouring to force the NIHE in under UCC or to force UCC, who in fairness to them are equally unwilling to become involved, in over the NIHE, that will not work. We have available to us the comments of the committee set up by University College, Cork to consider the Minister's proposals that the NIHE in Limerick should be a recognised college of the National University and that it should be subservient to UCC.  They are not very keen on it.  They set out their comments which are published today in <i>The Irish Independent</i> by the educational correspondent, Mr. Walshe. I do not want to quote the full report but the earlier part of it is very relevant indeed.  It says:</P>
    <P>A shock is in store for the Limerick students who are awaiting the outcome of an application for degree recognition from the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>For the UCC team which probed the application has written a startling and in many ways very critical report of the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick.</P>
    <P>If it is accepted the Cork Committee's report could mean that only some of the 70 students due to graduate from the Limerick Institute this summer will be able to get degrees immediately.</P>
    <P>Others may have to study for an extra term while a number may even have to take another year's study before their course is brought up to degree standard.</P>
    <P>It goes on to detail at some length the things it finds wrong with the National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick.  It questions very seriously the qualifications of the teaching staff.  It questions the contents and the nature of the courses, and so on. It is probably fair to summarise the criticisms it makes on the basis that UCC or the UCC committee are looking at NIHE as if they were of the opinion that the NIHE or any other <Col N="347" /> third level educational institution should reflect exactly the nature of a traditional academic university in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The NIHE are very different from UCC or UCD or TCD or any other traditional academic university.  They make no apology for being different and I would seek to make no apology on their behalf.  They were established in an effort to provide third level education and that it is above all different from the traditional kind we have in this country.  It is very different.  I would question the suitability of the UCC committee&mdash;all of whom no doubt are very competent men in their own fields&mdash;to judge the suitability or otherwise of the teaching staff and courses and standards reached by students in fields which are totally foreign to that of the traditional university.</P>
    <P>The NIHE would be just as entitled to set up a committee to look into the affairs of UCC if so directed by the Minister and come up with answers which would be as critical of UCC as UCC have been of the NIHE.  It was quite inappropriate that this responsibility should have been foisted on UCC at all.  I do not believe UCC want it and certainly the NIHE staff and students do not want it.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate result of this report is that, in the eyes of many people who do not understand the position, the NIHE may now be looked on as in some way some sort of inferior institution, which I assert most positively it is not.  If that allegation were to be made as a result of UCC's report, there is no one to blame in the long run for that situation except the Minister who by his so-called decision of 16th December, 1974, which was never implemented, sought to force the NIHE in against their will as a recognised college of the National University.  In fact they are not even a constituent college.  I do not think they should be a constituent college. It totally misses the point in relation to the value of the NIHE, not just to Limerick or the mid-west region but to the nation as a whole, that there should be an attempt by the <Col N="348" /> Minister, or by the traditional universities, or anyone else, to apply the values of the traditional academic universities to what is essentially a new institution with completely different objectives and completely different methods from those which are common to our existing universities.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to go back briefly to the time when there was a campaign in Limerick and the mid-west region for the establishment of what at that time was described as a university for Limerick.  It went on over quite a long number of years.  It went on probably for eight or ten years. The decision was finally made in about 1969 or 1970 to establish a third level institution which became the National Institute of Higher Education.  At the time the campaign&mdash;unfortunately it was a campaign which I think those who took part in it then will now fully realise was misguided&mdash;was for an exact replica, in so far as they could achieve it in Limerick, of the kind of university which already existed in Dublin, Cork and Galway.</P>
    <P>I remember attending meetings at which one had to listen at great length to people expounding the necessity for having a faculty of medicine in Limerick and how beneficial the existence of a faculty of law in Limerick would be.  They said it was very important that a faculty of arts in the traditional sense should be provided in Limerick so that people could get BAs and H.Dips.  A great many people who sought to achieve a university in the Limerick region at that time genuinely believed in those terms.  I am happy to say that at the time the Government thought quite otherwise, and that that clearly would not be the solution.</P>
    <P>About 1968 the then Minister for Education indicated in broad terms that the Government felt the need for a third level institution which would have primarily a technological bias. This concept was derided in Limerick at that time by many people.  I remember when I stood in a by-election in May, 1968, in east Limerick, I was very strongly opposed on the grounds that I was not prepared to pledge myself and the Fianna Fáil <Col N="349" /> Party to the establishment of a university in Limerick which would contain full faculties of medicine, law, the arts and other academic or traditional subjects.  I said I was not prepared to do that because I did not think it was right.  That view has since been well vindicated, because in many cases the very people who advocated in the early days of that campaign that type of traditional university realise fully now that, in the NIHE and the other colleges that are associated with it in Limerick at third level, we have something unique and very valuable.  The real value of the NIHE is that it is separate from our existing universities, or has been up to now.  The Fianna Fáil Government in the late sixties and in the early seventies came to a realisation of something that is now very widely accepted, that right down through the years there was an extraordinary academic bias in our education and that this had enormous effects throughout various spheres of activity in life, not the least in the whole question of employment.</P>
    <P>For decades we produced a large number of very intelligent and well-educated young people who graduated in the classics or perhaps modern languages or mathematics and so on. We produced a very small number of graduates from our third level institutions who had a high degree of technological competence.  As our industrial drive really got into its stride in the late fifties and early sixties we began very rapidly to come to a realisation that a great deal of money had been invested in education which was, from the national point of view and perhaps in many cases from the point of view of the individual students and graduates themselves, badly invested, that as a nation we got a poor return for our investment, and that other countries who proportionately may have been spending even less than we were were getting far better value for their money in terms of the skills and adaptability of skills of their graduates and other people who left third-level educational institutions.</P>
    <P>It was as a result of that thinking gradually building up in the country <Col N="350" /> that the Government came to the decision that an independent institute of this kind would have to be established, that Limerick was the most suitable site for it, not having a major third level institution of any kind at that time, and that the basic bias, as it were, in the content of the courses of that institute should be technological. That was not to say that the academic or traditional&mdash;if I may call them that&mdash;subjects should be totally ignored&mdash;they were not and are not ignored&mdash;but that the fundamental emphasis in the institution should be one of technology and that it should be tied in ultimately with the whole question of employment and the usefulness of the graduates to industry which at the time was beginning to develop pretty widely in the western region and elsewhere in the country.</P>
    <P>It followed naturally enough as a consequence of that, that an institute of that kind could scarcely be expected to confer its own degrees, diplomas and certificates itself in its earlier years and that clearly the appropriate body to award these degrees and diplomas was the National Council for Educational Awards, and that was so announced at the time of the establishment of the institute.  That is what the first students who came in in 1972 were told, and that is what those students, who hope to graduate in four months' time, were entitled to believe would remain the position throughout the four-year period of their course; that if any fundamental change was going to be made in relation to the award of degrees that it would not apply to any existing students in the institute, or if it did apply to any existing students it would not apply to any other than perhaps those who were in their first year.</P>
    <P>However, in the middle of their third year a group of 80 students were told there was going to be a fundamental change, and now that they have reached beyond the middle of their fourth year there, into the very last four months of their whole academic career at third level, they still cannot get from the Minister for Education any decision as to what is <Col N="351" /> going to happen.  If this was a normal Minister and this was a normal Government, one would assume that if they announced a certain thing on 16th December, 1974, that was going to be that.  Unfortunately we are not dealing with a normal situation or people, and the fact that this announcement was made on 16th December, 1974, that we were told it was an irrevocable decision and all the rest of it, does not seem to mean very much, because quite clearly it is not an irrevocable decision.  I hope it is not an irrevocable decision because I believe it is a wrong view and a wrong principle.  The students certainly do not take it as an irrevocable decision because their view and the view of many of the staff also is that the original proposal of Deputy Faulkner as Minister for Education that the National Council for Eductional Awards should award these degrees and diplomas, is the correct one, and should remain the position.</P>
    <P>I cannot see what good can be done for Limerick by this proposal of the Minister, if it is a proposal.  I cannot see anything but harm being done to Limerick.  You have only to read the report in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>, to which I referred earlier, of the UCC committee set up to examine into Limerick to see the terrible harm that will be done not just to the NIHE in Limerick but to the whole concept of non-traditional, non-academic education at third level.  These men in UCC&mdash;and I do not want to seek to quarrel with them because I do not&mdash; apply their own standards and their own standards are different.  Those standards are suitable for UCC and possibly for UCG or UCD; they are not suitable for Limerick.  That committee are seeking now to impose a totally different discipline and tradition on something that is new, that is fresh and exciting and that has excited the students that have had the privilege of being the first to go through the NIHE at Limerick.  You can imagine their depression when they read what is reported in today's newspaper and the views and principles that are set out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> One of the distinctive aspects of the NIHE at Limerick is that it runs what is called the co-operative education system, which is becoming very popular in the United States.  It is quite different from our tradition in universities in that there are no examinations at the end of each year and there are no major examinations at the end of the three or four years for the purpose of obtaining a degree or diploma. Each student is assessed every week in that institute and the quality of the degree he gets, if he does get a degree, is related to every bit of work he did during every week that he was in that institute over the four-year period. That is a far superior system.  All of us who went to a traditional university know what it is like to do your final. It was terrible.  Unfortunately we hear every year of people of 21 or 22 years getting nervous breakdowns and ending up in mental hospitals and so on, their health being shattered as a result of the terrible pressures that are inflicted for short periods at the end of each academic year by this traditional system.</P>
    <P>I do not blame UCC for this report. One would have expected it.  Before I read that report at all in today's papers I would have said UCC would say: &ldquo;We will have to have a big examination at the end of the year.  We cannot judge whether these people are good or bad unless we have a very thorough written examination, going through all the subjects and courses.&rdquo; That is more or less what they said.  That is totally unsuitable to Limerick.  And not only will you destroy that institution and its value to the nation, but if the Minister insists on that type of thing, he will do enormous long term damage to third level technological or non-academic education in this country for years to come.  Every year that passes the need for institutions such as Limerick, the need for expansion and intensification grows all the greater.</P>
    <P>Since I became spokesman for Industry and Commerce I have become very well aware of the shortcomings of our graduates so far as industry and the development of industry and employment are concerned, through no fault of theirs.  Teaching in this institute in <Col N="353" /> Limerick are men who are highly qualified in their particular fields but because in some cases they do not have purely academic qualifications, but frequently have first class practical qualifications, they are criticised by UCC who are judging them simply and solely as if they were another college of the national or any other university.  In my view that is wrong.</P>
    <P>I am glad we have had the opportunity of seeing this report before this debate ended because, unfortunately, it confirms my worse fears, and those of the students, about the Minister's proposal. It is exactly what they pointed out in their letters to me, to the Minister, Deputy Wilson and everyone else over the past few months.  I appeal to the Minister to put these 80 students and their parents, friends and relatives out of their agony.  Put the position back to what it was when those students entered that institute and allow the NCEA to award degrees to these students this year and in years to come.  We should also ensure that the distinctive character of the NIHE in Limerick as a non-academic third level institution of very high quality will be preserved.</P>

      <P>I have listened with great interest to what Deputy Wilson and his colleagues on the Opposition benches have had to say about higher education.  Let me say at the outset that I am fascinated, if not altogether amazed, by this strange and inexplicable inability of theirs to see or discuss higher education except in terms of university and non-university. This has been emphasised very clearly this evening in the contribution we have just heard.  It was encapsulated for me yesterday evening in an exchange which took place between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Deputy Wilson.  I quote from the verbatim report:</P>
      <P>Mr. Keating: But the Deputy wants a binary system?</P>
      <P>Mr. Wilson: I do not want a binary system.</P>
      <P>Mr. Keating: Words lose their meaning.</P>

      <P>I am afraid if this is the level of the debate, I am apprehensive about the possibility of getting through to the Opposition in regard to any of the positive aspects which underlie our proposals on higher education, but we must always try.  Perhaps this proclivity to compartmentalise along traditional lines is not so inexplicable after all.  It may well be the sad consequence of a preoccupation with old, outmoded divisions, the price of a wholehearted preference for a rigid binary system made all the more serious by a lack of awareness or an unwillingness to appreciate that in higher education as in other important matters things have changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me repeat in this connection something which I have already stated. This Government of which I am a member were conscious from the moment on which they embarked upon an examination of higher education&mdash;on which let me remind the <Col N="356" /> House decisions had been awaited in vain for the best part of a decade&mdash; that it must be approached as a unit and decisions relating to it taken as such.  Admittedly the landscape had changed in the course of a decade and it would be churlish of me not to pay tribute to those whose vision and endeavours helped to change the scheme. If we look back from this vantage point at the scene as the Commission on Higher Education saw it, we read at volume I, chapter 14, page 382, paragraph 6, as follows:</P>
    <P>Only a small number of vocational education committees provide courses of higher education and these courses are not the major part of their activity.</P>
    <P>Further on in the same paragraph we read:</P>
    <P>The two principal committees providing courses of higher education are those of the City of Dublin and the City of Cork...</P>
    <P>Within a few years however the scene had changed fundamentally with the rapid establishment and development of a whole range of new third level educational institutions which were planned to respond at once to local, regional and national needs.  It was in these changed circumstances that I said in the House on 11th February, 1975, during a discussion of another motion by Deputy Wilson:</P>
    <P>...after exhaustive examination of the situation...reached the decision which I announced, in December, 1974.</P>
    <P>Later on in the same discussion I said:</P>
    <P>Our decisions have been inspired by a desire to effect rationalisation of the system of higher education in its entirity, and to guarantee maximum interaction between institutions to the benefit of our students and of the quality of the education which must be provided for them.  To this end we decided to initiate the establishment of the structures necessary to secure a comprehensive system of third level education in the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and <Col N="357" /> Commerce put on the record of the House last evening a quotation from a publication of the OECD, &ldquo;Recurrent Education: Trends and Issues&rdquo;, pages 24 and 25, as follows:</P>
    <P>As far as the relationship between the non-traditional and the traditional sectors of education is concerned Governments have so far responded in one of three ways:</P>
    <P>(1) By creating what in the United Kingdom has been called a `binary system', treating the traditional and non-traditional sectors as separate entities;</P>
    <P>(2) by regarding post secondary education as a totality and creating an integrated but diversified system embodying all its institutional manifestations and co-ordinating them as much as possible; and&mdash;</P>
    <P>this in effect would be the description of the Government's proposals&mdash;</P>
    <P>(3) by treating the two sectors as inter-dependent, for example, Norway, emphasising the development of a new network of regional colleges and a partial reform of universities, with close links between the two.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to mention France, some states of the USA and provinces of Canada.</P>
    <P>If one wants to get a convenient title for the Government's decision it is an endeavour to bring about an interdependent system of higher education as a step on the road to greater comprehensive integration.</P>
    <P>We gave very careful consideration to all the different options open to us.  We did not reach our decisions lightly but only after full examination of the options available, having weighed the possible consequence of each.  If easy acceptance of our decision by the greatest number of interests or some measure of short-lived acclaim had been our aim, we might have chosen to permit the accelerated growth of a finely-drawn, sharply-divided binary system of higher education, the nucleus of which existed already without reference to the manifold implications of such a development.  Consideration of the more obvious consequences <Col N="358" /> of the perpetuation of a rigid binary system, where the possibility of initiating an alternative system still remained to us, given courage and initiative and a modicum of good will on the part of the protagonists of demarcation between old and new institutions led to our decision. We chose to lay the foundations of the road that would lead away from the binary towards an overall comprehensive system.  It was a positive decision taken in full knowledge and understanding of the educational scene in this country and in the light of the experience of other countries.</P>
    <P>I need hardly remind the House that our decision drew criticism from some quarters.  I found the criticism referred to in an article by W. G. Scaife in the <i>Education Times</i> of October 23, 1975 where, referring to the proposed link between a Dublin University and a college of technology there appeared &ldquo;the Dublin connection&rdquo;.  In a reference to the reaction, this article said and I quote:</P>
    <P>...A great deal of the comment was adverse and once again this was not unexpected, because the Universities had had to reject so many proposals in the past.</P>
    <P>Such reflex response was not adequate, however, because this set of proposals contains a novel ingredient &mdash;a proposal for a University-NIHE link.  There is no simple precedent for this and the consequent lack of rigid constraints makes it a potentially very fertile area for development. Doctrinaire judgements on the matter have been shallow and have failed to grasp the possibilities presented.</P>
    <P>If Advantage is to be taken of the situation it is important that the various contributors to a future solution&mdash;politicians, academics and students&mdash;should have a picture of what might be possible.</P>
    <P>The writer goes on to give his own view of what should be done.  In retrospect, I believe that much of that criticism was due to misunderstanding and misinterpretation of our purpose and intentions.  In the time that has elapsed since I detailed these <Col N="359" /> intentions to the House a little more than 12 months ago the governing bodies of Limerick and Dublin NIHEs have been established.  On the occasion of their first meeting on June 19th last, I left the governing bodies in no doubt about the role which the Government envisaged for the institutes in higher education.</P>
    <P>I stressed and I avail of this opportunity to stress again that the role of the NIHEs is such that the closest liaison must exist between the two governing bodies in their work.  This is important not only to ensure maximum co-ordination between the two main institutes in the sector but also to guarantee that the RTCs can play a full and fruitful role in our overall educational provision.  In reference to the composition of these two governing bodies I should like to point out that they include among their members seven of the principals of the eight RTCs.  The principal of the eight RTC has been appointed to membership of the Higher Education Authority by the Government, on my recommendation.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention also to the fact that in accordance with their terms of reference, based on the Government's decision of December, 1974, the two governing bodies elected from among their members two-thirds of the members of the reconstituted NCEA and these included the principals of six of the RTCs&mdash;Cork, Sligo, Carlow, Dundalk, Letterkenny and Waterford.  This strong representation of the RTCs on the NIHE governing bodies and, in turn, on the reconstituted NCEA speaks for itself.  It ensures a strong voice for RTC interest in the work both of the NIHEs and the NCEA which in accordance with their terms of reference, have with the Higher Education Authority a very important planning and co-ordinating role.</P>
    <P>In my address to the first meeting of the reconstituted NCEA on Wednesday last I said:</P>
    <P>Mobility and transfer between institutions in the interest of <Col N="360" /> students are prime objectives in our overall plan.  These objectives would be defeated if the NIHE Limerick and the NIHE Dublin were to develop independently of each other's activities or to the needs of the RTCs.  The programmes of the NIHEs must be complementary and must at the same time be so structured that transfer between the RTCs and the NIHEs can be effected by students with the minimum of difficulty.  At the same time the possibility of transfer between RTCs must be assured...</P>
    <P>We must ensure the co-ordination of inter-institutional policies and plans and not permit some parts of the system to work at cross purposes with others, either designedly or accidentally.  The benefit of those who attend our institutions must be our prime concern.  Our objective is to create a carefully planned and fully co-ordinated framework of inter-linked and inter-related institutions which will enable a student to progress upwards through the various levels of qualification according to his own capacity, ambition and preference. We wish to make it possible for a student to advance via his home college, by way of certificate level programme, to another college where that college happens to be the centre for diploma level studies under our co-ordinated plan and on in due course, perhaps, to an NIHE if he so wishes and has reached the appropriate level in his studies up to that point.  As I said in my address to the NCEA:</P>
    <P>We cannot allow artificial barriers to thwart the hopes, ambitions and endeavours of students who have attained the appropriate standard at one level and have the capacity and motivation to proceed to a higher level.</P>
    <P>We make no apology for asking pertinent questions.  One pertinent question I would ask is&mdash;are we getting or, rather, are our students getting the best value out of the large investment which the taxpayer must make in higher education?  The plan on which we have embarked and <Col N="361" /> which I have elucidated already, is guaranteed to keep wastage of talent, which is the greatest resource this country possesses and wastage of resources at a minimum.  May I point out another virtue of the genuine and real mobility of students that follows from our policy?  It is this.  The student who successfully completes his programme at a particular level after two or three years and who does not wish to proceed further has a worthwhile acceptable qualification to show as a reward for his endeavours. After two or three years he does not find himself in the hapless position of a student who, as happened all too frequently in the past, was led by the system to overreach himself and then, to use emotive words, &ldquo;dropped out&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem of lack of mobility has been with us for a long time and there are those who would argue strenuously that it must remain with us.  But the fact that a problem may appear intractable is no valid excuse for not tackling it or for not endeavouring to find a solution to it.  We have tackled it.  It is a matter which requires planning and co-ordination and in the NCEA and the HEA, with their planning and co-ordinating functions, we have the means of achieving our objectives.</P>
      <P>Let me return for a brief moment to something I said in the House on the 11th February, 1975, in the course of a discussion on another motion by Deputy Wilson.  I said:</P>
      <P>It is the Government's expressed intention to devolve authority where appropriate and feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In aiming at this we are not motivated by a desire to abdicate responsibility on our part.  We do so because of a firm belief in the value of devolution.  In that connection let me say that I believe some of the frustration which people have felt in the past, both those who are engaged in the day-to-day work of education, students, staff and principals in the colleges and institutes, and those others who are more removed from <Col N="362" /> the lecture rooms and laboratories but who are anxious to make a contribution to educational development, derives from a lack of opportunity to exercise creative influence in the direction of change.  I suggest that planning is very much concerned with controlling and influencing the direction of change.  Our policy in relation to the composition of the governing bodies of the NIHE and the NCEA and the broad ambit of the terms of reference given to the three bodies must go a long way towards reducing, if not altogether removing, the sense of frustration which arises from a lack of opportunity to participate in the making and implementation of policy which influences all aspects of life at local, regional and national levels.</P>
    <P>It is a departure which issues a firm challenge to a wide cross-section of interests to make that positive contribution to policy formulation and its implementation which a more centralised system of direction and decision-making has hitherto denied them.  It is a challenge which I hope will be met with enthusiasm and issue in a new dynamic not only in higher education but throughout all sectors of Irish life.  Local, regional and national needs have been kept in mind in the establishment of the governing bodies of the NIHEs and the NCEA and in the formulation of their terms of reference.  We have given scope to a wide range of interests through persons of the highest calibre for the exercise of their expertise at institutional, local, regional and national levels.</P>
    <P>I spoke to the NCEA about the glamour of graduate studies&mdash;an expensive glamour I might add if what we really need is well-qualified personnel at other levels.  Our decision that degree awards should be made by the universities has been much criticised and indeed misrepresented, largely I think because of misunderstanding of our intentions.  For example, we have been charged with submerging the identity of the NIHEs by merging them with the traditional universities.  There is no intention of submerging the identity of any institution <Col N="363" /> within the system, and when I use the word &ldquo;system&rdquo; here I am referring to the entire area of higher education, encompassing long-established institutions and more modern establishments.</P>
    <P>Academic escalation is a natural temptation, but our deliberate policy of planning and co-ordination of courses through the NCEA and the HEA is calculated to afford resistance to whatever temptation there may arise for institutions to set their sights on degree-level programmes to the detriment of other worthwhile and very necessary work.  We have not left the assurance against undesirable escalation to chance; rather have we created the necessary structures to ensure proper provision at all levels.  I think that our neighbouring island presents us with a salutory lesson in the need for careful planning and co-ordination such as we are undertaking.  There, flourishing colleges of technology became colleges of advanced technology &mdash;they are called CATs&mdash;and the CATs have, in turn become universities. The voids left by this process have, in turn, had to be filled by the creation of new colleges and polytechnics at a great cost to limited resources.</P>
    <P>Our universities have been accused of engaging in a &ldquo;carve-up&rdquo; of the technological sector.  There is no need for me to defend the universities against such allegations.  Suffice it to say that the universities over the past year have shown new eagerness to play a creative and constructive role in the context of the Government's decisions in relation to degree level courses in institutions which have hitherto been outside the university area of validation. This change is to be welcomed because, and I feel confident that the universities would agree with me in this, for the universities to continue to remain in isolation from the rest of the system of higher education would be damaging to the system as a whole and indeed to the universities themselves.  Each institution in higher education has its own individual identity or ethos.  The best possible return, qualitatively and quantitatively, is the <Col N="364" /> target to be aimed at and this does not mean that each institution must do everything.</P>
    <P>With reference to degrees, I should emphasise that in general terms one must advert to the entitlement of students who aspire to be graduates. We hear a lot nowadays about who will award a degree to one group of students or another but we hear little or nothing about the responsibility of the prospective graduate in the matter. For instance, we hear no reference to the successful completion of an adequate course by the students or to their meeting examination requirements deemed necessary by those who are competent to assess whether their performance measures up to a standard that is acceptable, not alone nationally but internationally as well.</P>
    <P>Degrees awarded in Ireland have long been accepted throughout the world, because the people whose responsibility it has been to guard their own standards have fulfilled faithfully the responsibility entrusted to them, and they have been alive to the very serious repercussions that would follow from any doubt that might be cast on the reliability of their awards.</P>
    <P>The worth and acceptability of a degree awarded in Ireland, irrespective of the source of that degree, must be guaranteed throughout the world.  We must guard against any deviation from acceptable standards that would devalue, or even risk devaluation of, our degrees.  That must be one of our guiding principles.</P>
    <P>Even if we were not duty bound to do all we can to maintain the high place which our awards have in the world, it would be unfair to our students, to say the least, to speak as if our aim were to give a degree to every student who completed a degree level course as if he had an absolute right to such an award.  A graduate must have a degree that is worth having.  To give him or her a degree that would carry with it the slightest suspicion of inadequacy would be tantamount to playing a confidence trick on the graduate to whom it has been awarded.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley, in common with those who referred to the article in <Col N="365" /> today's paper, seems to assume without any question that what is reported in the article reflects fully what might be the thinking of UCC. Surely this is totally unfair and irresponsible.  Apart from saying that, I think it would be inappropriate for me as Minister to make any further comment on a matter that is still coming through the internal procedures of the NUI.</P>
    <P>May I ask Deputy O'Malley this question?  Why should he be so concerned about the degree awarding power of the NCEA with regard to the needs of the NIHE in Limerick? The fact is that the institution submitted only one degree course to the NCEA in July, 1974&mdash;Materials and Industrial Engineering.  It rings rather hollowly at this stage to give the impression that on this basis there could have been an intention to have all degree courses ready to be crowned by an NCEA award in 1976.</P>
    <P>May I refer also to what I regard as the lack of logic in Deputy Faulkner's approach?  How could he write off our universities by saying they have not the expertise to deal with courses in the RTCs and technological colleges?  If that were so where would we get the expertise for the NCEA for the same courses&mdash; engineering, architecture, business studies and so on?  Deputy O'Malley incorrectly suggested that something was foisted on UCC.  The fact is that the NIHE submitted their courses to the NUI.</P>
    <P>I wish to say in conclusion that when my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, said yesterday evening, and I quote him, &ldquo;I propose to try to raise a fundamental debate on this subject,&rdquo; he expressed disappointment when he failed to raise a fundamental debate.  Nothing I have heard since has gone to the root of this problem.  The Opposition are continuing to support a rigid binary system and this Government have decided to move away from that to an interdependent system as a step on the road to more comprehensive provisions.  I must put it on record that contrary to the references made to my personal position, I am fully <Col N="366" /> and totally in accord with the Government and any suggestion to the contrary is unworthy of the Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wilson for letting me have a few moments to speak on the motion.  I do so principally because of the uncertainty in third level non-university education. The Minister carries responsibility for this uncertainty and today he gave us no evidence of support for the Government's proposals in this matter.  I do not think anything we heard tonight from the Minister removed that uncertainty.  I am speaking of the uncertainty of the students in the NIHE in Limerick and the College of Physical Education there.</P>
      <P>We want that uncertainty removed. Secondly, there is the critical area in the Government proposals in regard to the relationship between the technological sector and the universities. As speakers have said, there is a real fear that the technological sector will be swamped by the universities.  The proposals would give the kiss of death to third level non-university students.  In the technological sector we are speaking of relatively new colleges which should be given a chance to develop and to stand on their own feet.  They have not the tradition behind them that the universities have got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not saying we want rigid structures in education.  The Minister will have to agree that we in Fianna Fáil have shown innovation and initiative in second level education.  We now have comprehensive schools established and I strongly protest at the accusation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that Fianna Fáil have been conservative in their approach to education.  One cannot talk about a comprehensive system or a binary system unless you have realistic proposals, proposals that are workable.  The Minister's proposals are not realistic.  They will only succeed in stunting the growth of third level non-university education and we must ensure that this sector is given an opportunity to develop.  We know now that Irish employers are looking more for technically qualified <Col N="367" /> persons with special skills than academics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I made notes of the main points made by the Minister who went to the OECD Report to get a word to describe what he said the Government are trying to do in third level education&mdash;trying to make the sectors interdependent.  His next point was that mobility was very important. I am going over these quickly to show that the Minister did not face up to what we asked him to do&mdash;to establish the NCEA statutorily as a certificate, diploma and degree awarding agency.</P>
      <P>He spoke about the importance of getting value for investment in education. He spoke about the devaluation of degrees.  How it can be done if you maintain international standards I do not know.  Nobody is advocating any diminution in the value or prestige of any degree.  The Minister deplored Deputy O'Malley's quotation from the <i>Irish Independent</i> article.  That showed the confusion the country is in with regard to this very important institute in Limerick and the Deputy was entitled to quote it.  Admittedly, it seems to have come out prematurely but it shows precisely the point we have been making&mdash;that the universities will do the judging before awarding the degrees, and this is the only measure of interdependence either the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Education said the proposals would bring about.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education went on to say it was not fair of Deputy Faulkner to state that the expertise was not available in our universities to assess some of the courses.  Would the Minister like to tell me which university would assess the course leading to a degree in hotel management? Where do you go in the university for someone to assess the qualifications of a chef, for example, on his way up in the system of RTC involvement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is completely crazy about this idea of two cultures.  He quoted C. P. Snow on the last occasion and again yesterday.  It is a distinction I do <Col N="368" /> not accept.  It is a false distinction throught up by Snow when he was talking about two aspects of the same culture.  I do not see that the universities have a prescriptive right to the Humanities.  I do not see why Kevin Street or Bolton Street could not have sufficient conceptual content in their courses to keep them in the same kind of philosophic field, as far as it is necessary for them in their courses, as the universities.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the importance of technology, on the need for rational development at third level, that rigid separate-forever structures are not desirable, but I disagree that the proposals and decisions of the Government are bringing about any degree of comprehensivisation or rationalisation, and I think the NCEA should be utilised to the full extent to unify the non-university system and that time and study should be given to how the non-university system will relate to the universities.</P>
    <P>I said last night the Minister's image is not good going around to universities trying to get them to validate degrees in the third level section. He was rejected last year and obviously there is trouble now.  It is not good for the NCEA.  It is downgrading for the national institutes to read these things about themselves.  All this fixation about the two cultures of the old days: it is as important to know the second law of thermodynamics as it is to know &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo;.  That was interesting, perhaps, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was an undergraduate, but I think it got fixed in his mind and he comes up quite regularly with it in this type of debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce appealed to the students to think and think deeply, about this whole matter.  He called the proposals revolutionary.  He described the Minister for Education as a revolutionary in the education scene.</P>

      <P>I have the quotation <Col N="369" /> here but I do not want to delay because I was challenged yesterday about a quotation I gave and I want to put this on the record.  I said the Minister for Industry and Commerce arrogated to himself all responsibility for the technological end of things in the Government.  This is what the Minister said at column 1922 of Volume 276 on 13th December, 1974&mdash;Friday 13th:</P>
      <P>I must emphasise, however, that as Minister responsible for national policy in science and technology, all the science and technology and all scientific and technological activities will be my concern.</P>
      <P>That is the quotation to which I referred yesterday.  I do not want to delay because time is limited.  This side of the House has not indulged in university bashing.  It is, in fact, saying that taking the pitch cap, as I call it, off the degree and putting it down on the head of the third level, non-university system is not merely going to harm the head but it will harm the body right down to the first year in the National Institute of Higher Education, the one that exists and the one that will be brought into being in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I repeat my own thesis.  There need not be a lack of what the universities shape students for in the technological institute.  The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is as good as Harvard in its own way and carries this kind of tone and it is because it does it is so good.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce went through the history of the development of technology.  It was all very interesting but it was irrelevant. He talked of the two disparate traditions&mdash;the university one, and he indulged in a little bit of university bashing, and the technological one. But what he is doing is taking what he himself says is the crowning academic award in a disparate institution and inserting it into the other system without any preparation, or logic or any <i>rationale.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, the NCEA should be given the full powers we ask for in our motion.  How the third level, non-university institutions will relate to the universities is a matter that requires study and care and it is ridiculous for <Col N="370" /> the Minister for Education to go to the OECD report and say you can have a binary system, you can have a unified system or an interdependent system when all the means is he is going to ask the universities to confer the degrees in the technological institutions. That is the full measure of interdependence and comprehensiveness and rationalisation.  There is no other.</P>
    <P>Our proposals will not hinder either vertical mobility or horizontal mobility.  Does the Minister for Education claim that his decisions will make it possible for somebody to leave second year in UCD and go to Limerick to second year and pick up in Limerick?  Is that what the Minister is saying because, if he is not saying that, is all he means mobility within the third level non-university sector?  There is no comprehensiveness and no interdependence at all if it does not mean mobility between the university and the non-university sector.  There is no substance in it.  I suggest to the Minister that he should come in here with a Bill, and let us have a debate on it, to establish the NCEA with full powers, certificate and diploma, as the Minister envisages. But I go further: give it degree awarding powers so that the university element will not be brought in to influence the structure right down to the bottom as it influences the content of the leaving certificate and, before that, of the intermediate certificate and, before that, even the first year in the ordinary secondary or vocational school.  I am appealing to the Minister to do that for the sake of the national institutes of higher education, the two of them, for the sake of the National College of Art and Design, which should have a structured degree course and should have that degree awarded by the NCEA, for the sake of the RTCs to which, as I said, in special areas they should be entitled to, and I instanced yesterday where international standards were reached by a particular section of a particular RTC and where the students got in competition with prestigious technological institutes in Britain awards and prizes. For all their sakes I am asking the Minister to do what the motion says <Col N="371" /> he should do because all he has done is made a transplant, to use one metaphor, which the technological sector will reject obviously from what we read in today's paper and, to use another metaphor still, the university degree is the cuckoo's egg in the <Col N="372" /> technology sector and, when the cuckoo is hatched, he will shuffle around in the nest and what will happen is what the Minister says happened in Britain, until he throws all the technicians out and the Minister will have to start all over again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 17 which appeared on the Order Paper for 11th February, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt obliged to raise this matter on the Adjournment in view of the unsatisfactory nature of the reply given to me by the Minister for Justice.  I believe that this is a blatant case of obvious injustice where a prison officer, who was severely depressed, on an impulse, handed in his resignation.  When he asked an hour later for it to be withdrawn his request was ignored.  Instead, the Department of Justice were telephoned from Cork immediately on receipt of this resignation.  They wrote the same day and accepted the resignation.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this case in the light of the information I will now give him.</P>
      <P>It appears that this man, who has ten years, satisfactory service as a prison officer, had legitimate sick leave, which in the Minister's view might have been considerable.  The man suffered severe depression and while he was on duty went to his superior officer and reported it.  He was advised to see a psychiatrist.  He was severely reprimanded on this particular day for reporting back for duty three to four minutes late.  In a fit of temper the prison officer tendered his resignation.  Within half an hour he realised the decision he had taken was a very foolish one.  He knew he was throwing away ten years service.  He felt he had acted irrationally in writing out his resignation.  He sought out the officer concerned and asked if he could withdraw it.  We know that people have tendered their resignation several times in jobs and have been able to withdraw it.</P>
      <P>Normally one would expect the governor of the prison to advise the man to wait a while, consider the matter and come back to him again when things were more placid.  One would expect the governor to advise the man that he was doing something foolish but in this case no such advice was given.  One would also expect the governor to withhold the resignation for even a day.  I have reason to believe that the governor immediately acted on the written resignation and he telephoned the Department on 9th July, 1975 and was told to submit the resignation. When the governor submits a resignations by post to the Department of Justice one expects it to take two days before a decision is given.  In this case it appears that the letter was sent to the Department of Justice on 9th July and the return letter dated 9th July from Dublin said: &ldquo;We accept the resignation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is something wrong about that.  Any mischievous person could make a telephone call and say: &ldquo;I am accepting the resignation&rdquo;.  The Department had no reason to believe, until they saw it in writing, that this man decided to resign.  I question the action of the officials of the Minister's Department because I think there is something more sinister in this than this man's resignation and the refusal to reconsider the matter as stated by the Minister in reply to the Dáil question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How could the letter of 9th July have been received in the Department on 9th July and replied to on the same day unless it came by special messenger by car from Dublin?  I begin to think that, perhaps, there are <Col N="375" /> officials in the Department of Justice who are antagnostic to this poor man and decided they would run him out of the service without rhyme or reason. I do not want to take up too much time because I hope there are some other friends of this man who will speak up for him.  I am alarmed that the Minister may adopt an intransigent attitude in this matter.  I ask him to be objective about it despite what he may say about evidence in his Department to prove that this man has a bad record.  He has had an exemplary record as an official.  He has got brothers in the Garda and in the prison service.  The family record is one of dedicated service to the State. The Secretary of the Prison Officers Association has claimed that this man is entitled to be considered for reinstatement in the service.  The Minister says he may reapply.  Because this man is above the upper age limit of 30 years he will lose his ten years service and cannot reapply to join the service.  One hour after he resigned he saw a social welfare officer of the Department of Justice at his home in Cork and informed that officer that he would like to return to the service. This fact was communicated to the prison but it appears that the governor ignored it and decided instead that the man must leave.</P>
    <P>Three hours later the man went to a doctor and that doctor said that in his opinion the man needed treatment. That doctor thought the man needed treatment and the consultant psychiatrist, who is a brother of the Minister, thought the man was suffering from a reactive depression, was irrational in his attitude, in his approach and in the decision he took. There is independent medical evidence, from a consultant psychiatrist in Cork, that this prison officer has been undergoing a severe form of stress over the past 12 to 18 months &mdash;12 to 18 months prior to the day he tendered his resignation.  That consultant psychiatrist was of the opinion that the stress and strain was of a personal and confidential nature but it was responsible for his reactive depression and would account for his <Col N="376" /> aberrant behaviour during the period in which he tendered his resignation.</P>
    <P>Many people suffer from depression, and from reactive depression. It is a common enough condition but it can be cured; it responds to treatment.  This man was attending the prison doctor who advised psychiatric treatment, as is the proper treatment.  The man committed a foolish act by tendering his resignation before he received proper treatment for his condition.  In a situation like this we must look to see if justice was done but I believe that an injustice was done in this case, and I am speaking as a medical doctor.  The man acted irrationally and there is proof that he was severely depressed, that he needed treatment and that the reactive depression resulted from a particularly confidential condition. I appeal to the Minister not to adopt an intransigent attitude on this and have another look at the case.  I ask him to reconsider it in the light of the information I have given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not repeat any of the facts put forward by Deputy O'Connell.  The facts are as stated by him.  My intervention in the debate is to guard against the possibility of an injustice being done and I believe the Minister will accept that every responsible Member has a responsibility at all times to see to it that justice is done. For some reason or other something has gone wrong in this case.  If anybody looking at the facts is not happy, further consideration should be given to it.  I understand that this gentleman, in his ten years service to the State, gave good service.  I have a letter from a Dr. Thomas A. Moynihan which states:</P>
      <P>To whom it may concern: I have found Anthony C. Lang a conscientious prison officer, alert and intelligent during the nine years I had dealings with him in St. Patrick's Institution, 1966-1975.  I consider him to be a good prison officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the person concerned was a good prison officer and gave good <Col N="377" /> service we are in a strong position to make a case for him.</P>
    <P>It appears that the man in question had some words with an officer in the prison over a simple thing; he was four minutes late and he was being reprimanded for this.  We have all been late and many of us have been more than four minutes late.  I gather that this simple fault&mdash;if one could call it that&mdash;blew up so much that hot words were used and this unfortunate gentleman tendered his resignation.  Instead of a cooling off period there was a further blow up in that a letter was issued by the personnel officer of the Department of Justice accepting the resignation.  I know we are fast, and I am not saying this with the intention of scoring political points, but even the whiz-kiddery in the Government could not deal that quickly with a normal situation.</P>
    <P>In fairness, it appears that this young man was suffering from depression.  I have not the benefit of the medical knowledge or experience of Deputy O'Connell but I know that it is medically recognised that anyone suffering from depression should not be asked to make serious or important decisions. I believe this young man was suffering from depression at the time, perhaps it was reactionary depression but there was a primary reason for it.  I am convinced that he reached his decision during a fit of depression and, for that reason, everything must be done to try to help him.  We all know that he was involved in a serious crash in which a life was lost about 12 months before this.  I have nothing but extreme sympathy for anyone involved in a car crash where life is lost, it has a depressing effect on people.  In my view this coloured this man's decision.</P>
    <P>Dr. Moynihan stated that he has given a good account of himself in the service.  If the Minister can in any way that is open to him&mdash;I realise that there are very few ways open to him&mdash; take this man back into the employment of the prison service we would all be grateful.  His record in the public service is a good one.  The Minister has already told us that the only way open for this man to get back into the service is through the normal civil <Col N="378" /> service channels but, because of his age, he cannot re-enter in the ordinary way.  I ask the Minister, on humane grounds, to do his best for this man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people come to me with complaints similar to this man.  From what I have heard from Deputies O'Connell and Collins this man was ill and because of this he should have been given a certificate of his illness and advised to rest for some time.  Apparently, there was a mix-up between a number of doctors and this young man in that he did not seek what he was normally entitled to, treatment for the illness he had.  He resigned in the heat of the moment, something which fits in with his illness.  The Minister should consider this matter seriously.  In my view there was a mix-up between the doctors this man saw.  He should have got a certificate. He should have been declared ill for some time, that is, if his record is as good as I understand from Deputy O'Connell, that he was exemplary and that he was never subjected to disciplinary action.  We should give more humane consideration to a situation such as that and there should be less application of what is known as red tape.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the case of this young man, knowing his family history and his own history, as I have heard it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>The person referred to was born in my constituency. I know the family history very well.  They have given a life time of honourable service to the Department of Justice.  I have been very much involved in this case over a period of months.  I raised it privately with the Minister but I was not successful.  I have nothing to add to what has already been said.  Even at this late stage, if it is at all possible, I would ask the Minister to have another look at it.  If it is not possible to reinstate him in the position he formerly held, would it be possible to find a place for him somewhere in the service of the Department of Justice?  After all, he has spent ten years there.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister has to get time to reply but I just want to express the feelings in the constituency for the family of this man and to appeal to the Minister even at this late stage to find some way to restore him to his job. There is no point in repeating what has been said by other speakers.  This is one of the few times an occasion such as this has arisen in the Dáil where the representatives are totally united in their request to the Minister to have this man restored to his employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt that there is a precedent for a matter such as this.  I want to assure the House that this matter was fully considered by me.  I have had representations on the widest scale from a number of Deputies, apart from those who have spoken here this evening. I have had representations from the Minister for Defence, the Attorney General, Deputy Jack Lynch and Deputy Byrne.  All these representations have ensured that I have had an opportunity, not once but several times, of considering most carefully this man's position.  I want to assure the House that the decision which was taken was my decision.  I must say that I object very strenuously and strongly to Deputy O'Connell's suggestion that some officials are ill-disposed towards this man.  Any actions taken by the the Department of Justice are taken for me, and on my behalf, and with my full support.  This decision in law and, in fact, is my decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This decision was taken by me with full knowledge of all the facts relating to the incident in question and in relation to this man's service.  Those full facts are not available to anybody who spoke here this evening.  I do not propose to reveal those full facts to the House.  I do not think it would be proper for me to do so.  I have to assure the House that, as the responsible <Col N="380" /> Minister concerned and in full knowledge of the seriousness of the matter, I took all the facts into consideration. All the facts were taken into consideration and were properly weighed by me in coming to my decision.  I am not at all impressed by <i>post factum</i> medical evidence.</P>
    <P>I will just indicate briefly the immedicate facts surrounding the resignation without going into the full history of this particular person.  I will just deal with the immediate surrounding circumstances.  This officer is a member of the prison service.  The prison service is a demanding career.  It demands standards of self-discipline.  It demands standards of discipline within the service in addition to self-discipline.  It demands standards so that the prisons can be run efficiently.  A prison is a difficult place to run and it can only be run efficiently provided the staff observe the highest standards in all their activities.  One area of activity where this is particularly important, where you have a 24 hour continuous basis, where a prison works on a 24 hour cycle day in day out, one area in which the highest standards are necessary, is that of punctuality.</P>
    <P>On 1st July, 1975, this man was warned about late arrival on duty on six occasions in the month of June. On 8th July, after being warned, he was late again.  He was given a final warning and was told that a further lapse would result in the withdrawal of the privilege of living out.  Notwithstanding all these warnings, he was late again on 9th July and was told that the privilege of living out was withdrawn.  That was all.  He had all these warnings, all this patience shown by his superior officer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The man was sick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;over that time on a matter which is critical to the efficient running of a prison.  His reaction to the final warning when the privilege was withdrawn was that he asked for a sheet of paper so that he could resign.  He wrote out his resignation and his resignation was accepted.  There was nothing about his comportment, nothing about his demeanour, to suggest that the man <Col N="381" /> was ill or not in full possession of all his faculties and all his senses.  I have not the slightest doubt that the man was not ill.  If he was, he had sufficient experience in the past of consulting doctors to know where to have gone.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Post factum</i> evidence has been produced. I am afraid it is not acceptable to me.  Nor do I accept, as was suggested, that the man resigned in a temper.  There was no suggestion of that.  It was a calm and deliberate act. In the context in which it was tendered, it was a perfectly rational and, I suppose one might almost say, a logical reaction.  He was not prepared to take the burden of prison discipline and, consequently, when he was told that the privilege of living out was withdrawn&mdash;nothing more than that; he was not threatened with dismissal; he was not threatened with any more severe disciplinary penalties; he was merely told that this privilege was withdrawn&mdash;his reaction was to calmly offer his resignation from the prison service.  His resignation was accepted.  It was conveyed to me.</P>

      <P>The results of the survey on strokes, undertaken by the Medico-Social Research Board, are not expected to be available for publication until late this year.  An interim report on the survey has been published in the annual report of the board for 1974.</P>
      <P>A report of a study into multiple sclerosis, which was undertaken in 1972 with the aid of a grant from the Medical Research Council, was published in 1973 in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry (1973) Volume 36, Number 4, Pages 668-673.  A study into the prevalence and distribution of the disease in this country which would enable a comparison to be made with the situation in other countries is being undertaken by the Medico-Social Research Board.  This study is not yet completed. A description of the study has been published in the board's report for 1974.</P>
