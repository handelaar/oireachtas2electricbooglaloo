      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government have now considered the Tindemans Report on European Union; and if he will state the Government's attitude in particular to the two tier proposal in the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals contained in the Tindemans Report are both extensive and complex and are currently the subject of detailed study.</P>
      <P>I have already expressed my general reaction to the report in a Press statement on 7th January, a copy of which I am having sent to the Deputy.  For the present I do not wish to add to what I said then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach said, the proposals are both detailed and complex.  I presume the Taoiseach will arrange that the House will have an opportunity of considering and debating the report as soon as possible, possibly on the annual debate on the progress in the European Community.  I think the Taoiseach will acknowledge that the Tindemans Report was basically an analysis of the present condition within the Community and on that basis made certain proposals.  If such is the case, on that assumption, so far as it was an analysis of the present condition and the rate of progress <Col N="952" /> towards economic and monetary union, and towards political union, will the Taoiseach not accept, in so far as there is this proposal for a two tier development within Europe, as it has been called, this implies at least, if not factually acknowledges, that Ireland as a member of the Community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has referred to a number of matters in his supplementary.  Certainly I do not see any difficulty in discussing the report when the report on the European Community is being considered by the Dáil.  A number of proposals will be considered at the European Council meeting in April.  The actual details of the different aspects will be considered by the Departments concerned. Specifically on the two tier proposal, if adopted in its present form it might well relegate the position of this country to a position similar to that of some other countries which are only associated with the Community.  That would require much fuller and further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as my question relates specifically to the two tier proposal, could I ask the Taoiseach if there is any evidence that the Government have made strong representations or criticisms to the European Community on the failure of the Community, if such is the case in the Government's view, to implement the proposals of the Community itself, for instance in the area of regional development and social policy, to enable us to play a full part?  If the Government have not made any such proposals, could I ask the Taoiseach why they have not done so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our views are being clearly expressed at all meetings of the <Col N="953" /> Community.  As the Deputy is aware, the Community proceeds by agreement. It is not possible for one member to get views accepted unless the others are prepared to agree to those views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will acknowledge that it is possible for the Government to make their position clear particularly when that position is in line with the stated principles of the Community itself, namely, the elimination of regional imbalances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach is it not possible for the Government to make their position clear when that position is based on the Community's own proposals.  If such is the case, have the Government not failed to rely on the principles of the Community in ensuring that the regional imbalances are eliminated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we cannot debate it today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any evidence that the Government have complained to the Community of the Community's failure, if that is the Government's view, to reduce the regional imbalances so that the original proposals on economic and monetary union could be implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension if he thinks complaining to the Community is the way to get things done.  The Community is a body of nine member states of which we are one.  It proceeds by agreement. In exceptional circumstances member <Col N="954" /> states have the right to use the veto.  So far this country has not exercised that right, and I think it would be contrary to its interests to do so except in a very specific case or for a very specific purpose.  Proceeding by agreement is the way to get action and not by making complaints to the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from complaints, is there any public evidence of proposals from our Government obliging the European Community to act on its own principles and enable us to meet our obligations as a member of the Community?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All these measures will fall to be discussed at the April meeting if agreement is reached to discuss them but nothing will be decided until that meeting.  I imagine that the discussion then will very likely not lead to any conclusions.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the steps he proposes to take to advise the family farmer, milking under 40 cows, to stay in milk, even though the EEC recommends paying him to get out of milk production for five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>It may be taken that all members of the Council of Ministers, myself included, will be straining every effort to have the present Commission proposals for the milk sector for 1976 modified along the lines which seem best to each of us.  Further meetings of the Council will, of course, be necessary before any final package can be agreed upon.</P>
      <P>As regards the proposed premium scheme for the non-marketing of milk, I think it is well understood that I am not in favour of this proposal in its present form.  It is possible, however, that such a scheme if adopted in other member countries could be beneficial to the Community as a whole and even to Irish dairy interests in the long run, but I have no intention of advising any Irish milk producer who wants to remain in milk to get out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that if this proposal were implemented it would mean the end of the road for many small milk producers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not mean that all the producers up to the level mentioned would automatically have to get out of milk.  The option would be there for them to do so and be compensated for it.  I would hate to see such an inducement coming here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>What efforts are being made by the Department to advise people not to get out of milk?  The people who are gearing themselves to increase their number of cows are worried at the moment, and I have told them it is the Minister's policy to tell them to stay in milk.  I want the Department to say loudly and clearly that <Col N="957" /> we want the small producers to stay in milk.  Pigs and poultry are gone, and if milk goes it is the end of the road for the small farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been saying that as loudly and clearly as possible over the past three years and I will continue saying that regardless of what is said in the EEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>We at our end are doing our best to advise people to stay in milk, but since the statement was made in the Dáil I have not heard a word from the Minister or the Department. I know the Minister said &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; to me when I was commenting on it, but I would like a pronouncement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Single dressing of seed is primarily a protection against some seed-borne fungus diseases.  Double dressing provides additional protection against wireworm attacks.  While double dressings give a greater measure of protection against bird attacks they can adversely affect germination and plant vigour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>A number of schemes designed to help the sheep industry are already in operation.  These include the mountain lamb subsidy scheme, the hogget ewe subsidy scheme, the extension to the mountain lamb subsidy scheme and the export guarantee scheme for carcase mutton and lamb.  Expenditure under these schemes in 1975 amounted to almost £3 million.  In addition in the context of the handicapped areas scheme, I intend to introduce soon a special scheme for the provision of assistance for joint projects undertaken by groups of farmers for increasing fodder production in hill areas and for the improvement of hill grazing land farmed jointly.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="959" /> Applications for assistance for the establishment of co-operative lamb-fattening stations from properly constituted co-operative societies will be open to consideration within the terms of the farm modernisation scheme.  No separate information is available as to the relative trend of costs and incomes of sheep-owners in the west Wicklow area.</P>
    <P>Sheep numbers in County Wicklow increased from 284,000 in 1972 to 288,000 in 1973 but declined slightly to 287,000 in 1974.  The indications are that there may have been a further small decline in 1975 but detailed county statistics will not be available for some time.</P>

      <P>In view of the Minister's statement that the sheep population and the income of sheep farmers are declining, would he not agree that the solution to the problem is for the Minister in the Council of Ministers to ask the Community to extend the common agricultural policy to sheep so as to give the sheep farmers a fixed income all the year round and not have this stop-go situation which means that when the French market closes we cannot sell sheep and the price of sheepmeat goes down?</P>

There is no way in which the sheepmen there can maintain their lambs; they must let them go when the prices are at their worst.  Would he not think a special case could be made for a co-operative lamb fattening station at west Wicklow?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsidy was not paid to some sheep-owners in the Carlow area under the mountain lamb subsidy scheme because they did not comply with the requirements of the scheme in regard to mountain grazing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know what way the regulations have been changed because since the scheme was introduced by Deputy Haughey, when he was Minister for Agriculture, farmers who produced this type of lamb received this subsidy.  Why have some farmers been refused this subsidy? Is the reason that the Department have not a penny, as the Minister said before?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that these farmers did not receive this subsidy on all occasions.  In 1974 they received it in error.  What those farmers told the local official who was investigating this was accepted by that official but following investigations in 1975 it was shown beyond all doubt that they did not comply.  I sent an official to investigate this and, following that investigation, I am satisfied that they did not qualify under the terms of the scheme.  The subsidy scheme on mountain lamb was introduced in 1966 and under this scheme a subsidy is not payable unless the flock owner has grazing rights on mountain lands and has grazed all his lambs on such lands.  Where appropriate, <Col N="963" /> he is required to furnish a declaration and evidence to this effect. When the people concerned were asked for this evidence they could not produce it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1974 my Department received advances totalling £69.77 million from Central Funds in connection with intervention activities.  Beef was the only product purchased into intervention during that year and, while the intervention arrangements provided a considerable measure of support for cattle prices at the time, the full benefits of those arrangements did not accrue to producers, especially those who were not engaged in the finishing of cattle.  Accordingly, in March last I set up a review body to examine the operation of the beef intervention and cattle slaughter premium systems.  I hope that the final report of that body will be available shortly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that in present circumstances producers will get the full benefit.  One of the things that has happened to alter the position that existed then is that the slaughtering capacity of the various <Col N="965" /> processing factories has increased substantially, to the tune of being able to take another 500,000 cattle.  In 1974 they were not able to take anything like 1,000,000 cattle and last year they took in excess of 1,300,000 cattle without any trouble.  As long as they have the capacity there will be competition for cattle.  We should also remember that there has been considerable competition in the live trade. In these circumstances there is no difficulty and the present price of calves and young stores is indicative of that.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain why there are such irregularities in the manner in which payments are made to farmers?  In a situation where five herds are inspected, one farmer gets paid but the other four are left out for some reason.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true, as I know from the volume of correspondence I am getting.  I am not a bit happy that payments are not being made more rapidly.  The explanation I have is that this is a temporary scheme, it takes a few months and it is done by temporary staff.  When temporary people are employed it takes some time to train them and they may not be as fast at the job as they would be if it were a permanent scheme.  I am putting on all the pressure I can to get payments made as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I have seen the statement in question but I do not accept that it describes accurately the condition of the fishing industry at least in this country.  While the industry throughout the world was affected by depressed markets in the past year there has been a marked improvement in prices in recent months and I am hopeful that this trend will continue. The recent increases in EEC withdrawal and reference prices and the fact that we now have an organisation to operate the Community's market intervention arrangements for fish are additional safeguards for the industry. I am hopeful too that the outcome of the Law of the Sea Conference and of current Community discussions on the future of the fishing industry will be advantageous to this country.</P>

      <P>The decline in the herring catch is giving cause for concern and the Department are fully alive to that fact.  With regard to the industry generally, the position for 1975 <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other western European countries was quite good in the circumstances.  We agree that the decline in the catches of herring at Dunmore East and at other centres is a cause of some worry but there has been an improvement with regard to shellfish. In addition, salmon has brought up the incomes of fishermen generally.</P>

Instead of the £3,000 originally provided for the survey of this work, which is undoubtedly essential and important, it was decided to extend the survey and also to extend the cost to the Exchequer up to £7,500.  I can assure the Deputy that we have had a number of representations so far as the development work at Skerries is concerned and there is no undue delay in this <Col N="971" /> matter.

      <P>The position is that an original estimate of £8,500 was provided to carry out works that were deemed essential and which measured up to the requirements of the Department and the Dublin County Council.  We approved that money in April, 1974, but subsequent to that approval the county council considered the scheme should be changed.  They were not satisfied and changed their minds and as a result we did not go ahead with the proposals for which the money was provided. The subsequent suggestions of Dublin County Council are under consideration and I asked for a report as quickly as possible.  We got a report last month and the estimated cost of the new proposals is in the region of £22,000.  I assume the Department would be prepared to make a grant of £11,000 available for this work which would mean that the county council would also find £11,000.  It is true that the grant for the original work was 100 per cent from the State but the circumstances there were quite special, as the Deputy appreciates.  It is not proposed to extend a grant of more than 50 per cent but a decision has not been made yet.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary reconsider the possibility of giving the full 100 per cent grant to Skerries Harbour for this matter because it has such tremendous tourist potential with the world yachting championship coming along, an event which will greatly benefit Aer Lingus and other operators, such as the hoteliers?</P>

We appreciate their value but it is hard to segregate sporting events, such as yachting, from fishery development. We are examining this report, which is costing £22,000.  There is no special reason why Dublin County Council should get more than 50 per cent for this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report in question.  Historically Irish fish prices, with the exception of those for plaice, have been lower than prices in those countries which are now our partners in the EEC.  This has been due mainly to our geographical position with resultant heavy transport costs to export markets and the limited home market for fish.  Our landing prices however have increased substantially in recent years and since our accession to the EEC the differential between our average prices and those in the rest of the Community has been gradually reducing for most varieties of fish, largely because of the Government's policy of grant-aiding fish processing facilities and the work of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in developing market outlets.  I am confident that the recent setting up of the Irish Fish Producers' Organisation to operate the Community's market intervention arrangements for fish will help to improve further the returns to fishermen.  I might add that in general prices received by fishermen in the west of Ireland compare favourably with those obtaining in the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>This Bill is part of the programme of tax reform and is designed to bring the company tax code into line with modern requirements without either endangering tax revenue or infringing the basic principle of spreading taxation fairly over the community.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the ground for the reform of the structure of company taxation has been well ploughed in the in-depth studies which led to the publication of the 1972 and 1974 White Papers on the subject.  The purpose of the present Bill is to give legislative effect to the proposals for a corporation tax contained in the 1974 White Paper. Accordingly, the Bill mainly provides for changes in the form of the existing system of company taxation but not in the substance or in the general incidence of tax.  The Bill also provides for some concessional arrangements which have been sought by the business community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill is rather technical and is accompanied by a lengthy and detailed explanatory memorandum, I do not propose to delay the House by going into each of the provisions of the Bill at this stage.  That, I feel, would be appropriate in Committee. However, for the convenience of the <Col N="988" /> House, I will outline briefly the principal features of the provisions proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>From the end of the current year of assessment in each case the trading and other profits of resident companies and those of most nonresident companies operating here will be subject to a single tax structure instead of the present triple structure comprising income tax, corporation profits tax and capital gains tax.  The corporation profits tax code, which dates from 1920, will be abolished but the general rules and principles of the income tax and capital gains tax codes will apply for the purposes of the new corporation tax.  Subject to special relief for certain categories of companies and profits, which is being provided mainly in Parts III and VII of the Bill, the ordinary rate of corporation tax on company profits is being fixed in the Bill at 50 per cent, which is the equivalent of the maximum combined rate of the existing income tax and corporation profits tax, but an effective tax charge of 26 per cent will continue to apply to companies' chargeable capital gains.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear at once that the generous scheme of capital allowances provided under the existing income tax code and the special taxation reliefs to encourage industrial development are being incorporated in the new corporation tax system so that there will be continuity in the basis and value of those allowances and reliefs.</P>
    <P>Where a distribution of profits is made by a company on or after 6th April, 1976, part of the new corporation tax&mdash;corresponding to income tax at the standard rate of 35 per cent on the aggregate of the distribution and the tax credit in respect of it&mdash;will be imputed to shareholders in respect of that distribution.  Accordingly, the shareholder will in effect be left in the same position under the new system as under the existing system.</P>
    <P>Parts I and II of the Bill provide for the introduction of corporation tax, the general structure of the tax, the computation of income and chargeable <Col N="989" /> gains and the granting of allowances and reliefs.</P>
    <P>Parts III and VII deal with the position of special classes of companies and with certain special exemptions. The special classes of companies are small companies, those carrying on mutual business or not carrying on any business, industrial and provident societies, building societies, companies involved in partnerships and life assurance companies.  As regards small companies, provision is being made for a reduced rate of corporation tax of 40 per cent on a company's income where their total profits for an accounting period of 12 months do not exceed £5,000 and for marginal relief where the profits exceed £5,000 but do not exceed £10,000.  As regards the other special classes of companies, the provisions being made broadly match those being applied under the existing system of company taxation.</P>
    <P>I might perhaps mention one or two points which may be of special interest.  A new relief is being provided by section 31 under which the actual amount of dividends or interest paid or credited to an individual by a building society will be available to cover charges, for example, annuities payable by him.  Section 46 ensures that, pending the renegotiation of agreements with other countries for the avoidance of double taxation, an overseas life assurance company investing in an Irish company will be provided with a tax credit in respect of the distributions they receive from that company.  This relief will help to maintain the attractiveness of investing in Irish companies.</P>
    <P>As regards the special exemptions &mdash;in Part VII&mdash;to which I have referred, these are in relation to the Agricultural Credit Corporation Limited, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, certain public utilities, the income of a company precluded from distributing any part of their profits to their members and certain income of companies established for charitable purposes.</P>
    <P>Parts IV, V, VI and VIII contain new provisions, suitably framed for the purposes of corporation tax, to replace <Col N="990" /> corresponding provisions in existing tax legislation governing export sales relief and relief for certain profits from trading operations carried on at Shannon Airport and those dealing with distributions out of exempted mining profits.</P>
    <P>Part IX establishes a special Schedule, Schedule F, under which all company distributions covered by the Bill will be charged to income tax and lays down rules for the giving of a tax credit in respect of those distributions.</P>
    <P>Part X deals with closely controlled companies and contains a wide range of measures to counter tax avoidance by them.  Parts XI and XII indicate how special situations involving groups of companies will be treated for corporation tax purposes and I will return to these provisions in a moment.  Parts XIII to XVI, inclusive, deal with the application and adaptation of specific income tax and capital gains tax provisions, the administration of the new corporation tax system set out in the Bill and the supplemental and transitional arrangements necessary to provide for the smooth changeover from the present system of company taxation.</P>
    <P>The most significant innovations now being provided in our system of company taxation are those which concern groups of companies and I am confident that the group relief being provided will adequately meet the needs of the corporate sector which has pressed for such relief.</P>
    <P>Part XI of the Bill specifies the conditions under which trading losses, unused capital allowances and unrelieved expenses of management and charges on income of one member of a group of companies will be allowed against the profits of another member of that group.  A similar form of relief will be available to companies which are members of a consortium.  Provisions are incorporated to prevent abuse of these reliefs.</P>
    <P>As Deputies may be aware, it was not feasible in the past to frame legislation to give group relief because of the different basis of assessment for income tax and corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" /> Likewise, it would be even less feasible to frame legislative provisions to provide group relief for accounting periods, or parts of accounting periods, falling before 6th April, 1976, since income tax and corporation profits tax as well as corporation tax would have to be comprehended.  Nevertheless, I can tell the House that the Revenue Commissioners have assured me that they will consider sympathetically any particular cases which might be put to them for the grant of group relief in respect of accounting periods, or parts of accounting periods, falling before 6th April, 1976.  Such an administrative solution would not, of course, mean a departure from what is set out in Part XI of the Bill as regards either qualification for group relief or the nature of the relief allowable. Obviously, it would be necessary to have any such claims supported by all the relevant facts in relation to the companies concerned.</P>
    <P>As I promised on the Committee Stage of the Capital Gains Tax Bill, 1974, in this House on 29th January, 1975, the Bill makes provision&mdash;in Part XII&mdash;for the treatment of chargeable gains and allowable losses in special situations involving groups of companies, for example as regards certain transfers of assets in connection with company reconstruction or amalgamation, or between members of a group of companies or between members of the group and outsiders. In such circumstances, the charge to tax in respect of the capital gain will be deferred until the asset leaves the reconstructed or amalgamated company or the group.  Similarly, the provision in the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, for &ldquo;roll-over relief,&rdquo; that is, deferment of tax on capital gains realised from the sale of business assets if the proceeds are used to acquire new assets for exclusive use in the business, will be applied to a group of companies as if all trades carried on by its members were a single trade.  Provisions are incorporated to prevent abuse of these reliefs. Furthermore, it is necessary to secure the tax which does arise for payment in such complex cases and the Bill accordingly provides for the <Col N="992" /> recovery by the Revenue of unpaid tax in respect of capital gains arising to any company in the group from the group as a whole or from specified members or associates thereof by reference to their interest in the asset involved.  The person so assessed will, of course, have the right to pursue the defaulting company.  The Bill's provisions in relation to companies' capital gains are a logical counterpart to its provisions for the treatment of groups of companies where losses, and so on, in normal trading are shared among the members of the group.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, the Bill is designed to bring our system of company taxation into line with modern requirements, particularly by providing special favourable tax treatment for company rationalisation and restructuring so as to improve competitiveness in an ever difficult market situation.  I am hopeful that the simplification of our company tax system will in time reduce compliance costs for companies, mainly because of the fact that, in future, only one computation of profits and one tax return will be required for any accounting period for corporation tax purposes, instead of at least two for the purposes of income tax and corporation profits tax as at present.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputies will agree with the view that, while it is vital to ensure that the tax code be brought into line with modern requirements and be continually reviewed so as to provide encouragement for continued industrial expansion, it is equally necessary to safeguard tax revenue to ensure that scarce resources are channelled into the most worthy avenues.  That is why it is necessary to make specific provision in the Bill, as was intimated in the 1974 White Paper, to prevent abuse of the very valuable reliefs being provided for companies.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains additional provisions designed to counter tax avoidance devices in other areas also, such as the extraction of income from companies in a form which in the hands of the recipient is not assessable to income tax under existing law and the non-distribution <Col N="993" /> of income by closely controlled companies so as to avoid the income tax at the appropriate personal tax rate which would apply if the income had been distributed to the shareholders in the normal way.  The undistributed after corporation tax trading income of closely controlled companies will not, however, be affected by these anti-avoidance provisions.  Deputies can rest assured of my determination to ensure that this relieving Bill will not be abused in its application.</P>
    <P>There remain two important and related matters, arising in connection with our adoption of the imputation system of company taxation outlined in the present Bill, which call for mention at this juncture, namely, the need to renegotiate all our existing agreements with other countries for the avoidance of double taxation and recent EEC proposals for company tax harmonisation.</P>
    <P>The imputation system of company taxation&mdash;which imputes, or credits, an appropriate proportion of the company tax to the shareholders&mdash;has been adopted by many countries, including three EEC member states, namely, Belgium, France and Britain, and is favoured by the EEC Commission as the basis for harmonising company tax systems in the EEC.  A draft directive on company tax harmonisation was sent by the EEC Commission to the Council in August last and is at present before the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Council.  I understand that the draft directive has also been the subject of consideration by our committee on EEC secondary legislation.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the draft directive are complex and far-reaching and, accordingly, very careful examination will be required to ensure that the Irish position on them will be fully enunciated in the appropriate fora in due course.  That is all I wish to say about it at the moment.</P>
    <P>It may be mentioned that, in the negotiation of double taxation agreements with some countries in the past, some difficulty has been encountered because of our dual system involving income tax and corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="994" /> Our adoption of the proposed system of a single corporation tax should help in this matter by clearly separating the taxation of companies from the taxation of their shareholders.  This improvement may strengthen the Irish position in seeking to secure acceptable new double taxation arrangements which would be not less favourable in relation to Irish tax incentive reliefs than the existing arrangements.  Those new agreements will come before the House for approval in due course.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should make clear that the principle of this Bill is quite acceptable to this side of the House. Indeed, work has been going on for some years on the preparation of a measure which would modernise our company taxation system and would accordingly introduce certain changes such as the imputation system.  I think a White Paper was issued in November, 1972 when I was Minister for Finance and arising out of representations received on foot of it a further White Paper was issued by the present Minister for Finance and this Bill, which is a very formidable measure even to look at, is the result of that work over many years and of representations from various quarters.</P>
      <P>I think that the change to the imputation system is not only in accord with EEC thinking and will not alone be a positive step on the road to harmonisation which is necessary I believe within the Community but will also have a number of practical advantages&mdash;perhaps some disadvantages&mdash;but by and large a number of practical advantages so far as our taxpayers are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of this matter is that it is intended as an anti-avoidance measure and some of the provisions in that direction are quite welcome and satisfactory but there are some reservations that we have in regard to certain provisions.  It is clear from a brief perusal of the Bill that it is largely a Committee Stage measure and informal agreement has been reached between both sides to refer the Bill to a special committee for the Committee Stage discussion.  The bulk <Col N="995" /> of the discussion will be on that Stage but there are some matters to which I think I should refer now.  Broadly speaking, the reservations I have in regard to the Bill relate to what I consider to be the excessive breadth of some of its provisions, the administrative difficulties which I think will arise and the actual drafting of the Bill itself which I think leaves something to be desired.</P>
    <P>As regards the breadth of the Bill as drafted, it seems to be much too blunt an instrument for the purpose of the objective it sets out to achieve&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large, it seems the provisions of the Bill run very much against the taxpayer and give what appear to be excessive powers to the Revenue Commissioners. One of the features of the Bill is the imposition of a surcharge on the earnings of service companies as defined in the Bill.  The object of the surcharge appears to be to impose personal rates of tax in such cases so that somebody who can so manage his affairs as to have them conducted through the medium of a service company will not thereby escape liability for tax.  That objective is laudable and has our support but I think that in achieving it, it is necessary to take into account the distinction between retentions and distributions, the extent of working progress and the recovering of debt.  We can and will go into these matters in greater detail on Committee Stage but I think I should advert to them now if only to give notice to the Minister and his advisers of the matters with which we are concerned in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill appears to provide that the secretary of a company is the person who is primarily liable and to exclude <Col N="996" /> the directors.  I think that provision needs further justification by the Minister. The provisions whereby unrealised profits may be taxed also need further justification.  This kind of provision, especially at a time of inflation, can produce considerable hardship. There is a general difficulty in relation to all taxation measures and we have adverted to it on both sides of the House in dealing with recent taxation and that is the extent to which discretion should be given to the Revenue Commissioners and one is also faced with it in this Bill.  I do not want to go back over all that ground again. I am aware, as also is the Minister, that there are arguments both ways in this regard.  Nevertheless it has to be borne in mind that tax legislation will and must be interpreted strictly by the courts and, therefore, to give too wide a discretion to the Revenue Commissioners could not alone have the effect of making the particular provision less clear in its meaning but also, in effect, of transferring the interpretation of that provision from this House and the other House of the Oireachtas to the Revenue Commissioners, unless the matter is brought to Court, in which event if the provision is particularly wide and if very great discretion is given to the Revenue Commissioners, the courts may find themselves unable, in fact, to act in that matter because of the particular wording.  There is danger of this in some of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wishes in particular cases to give discretion to the Revenue Commissioners because he sees it is the only practicable way of dealing with a particular problem, I do not object to that in principle but in such a case I want to see that the legislation should make it clear that that is what is happening, that the Minister should say so here and that the intention should be clearly expressed and endorsed in this House, that in those particular circumstances that is what would happen and that the matter would not be intended to be decided on the interpretation applied by the courts.  The difficulty is that, ostensibly, every provision of this Bill is open to interpretation by the courts.  In practice some aspects of it may not be <Col N="997" /> open to interpretation by the courts, but if that is the intention and if it is the intention that in such cases the interpretation would be a matter for the Revenue Commissioners one can make a case for such a situation in certain circumstances.  If that is what is to happen, I would wish to ensure that such a case would be made.  However, if on the other hand, it is intended that all the provisions of the Bill should be a matter for interpretation by the courts, some of the drafting is not appropriate because it is too wide in its scope.</P>
    <P>We must remember that in matters of this kind individual rights are concerned. There is a temptation, particularly for a Minister for Finance but for other Deputies also, in dealing with the question of tax liability to think in terms of the public interest, of the safety of the revenue as being the predominant matter, so predominant as to override virtually all other requirements. This is understandable, but it is dangerous.  The rights of the individual should not be ridden over roughshod in such circumstances.  I suggest there is a danger of that in so far as some of the provisions of the Bill are concerned.  I suggest also that some of the Bill's provisions may not be intended to be operated and are included simply <i>in terrorem</i> or for the purpose of frightening taxpayers who are either potential evaders or avoiders. It is difficult to justify legislation that is drafted on the basis of being simply <i>in terrorem.</i></P>
    <P>In keeping with the criticism I have made of the Bill being a blunt instrument for achieving the purposes it is designed to achieve, it would appear that an example of that&mdash;small but, perhaps, significant&mdash;is the approach in the matter of penalties, where similar penalties appear to be laid down to apply to dissimilar offences&mdash;for instance, the failure to report the date of the commencement of business seems to carry the same penalty as the furnishing to the Revenue Commissioners of inaccurate information.  On the face of it, these offences do not appear to be of equal gravity.  Furthermore there does not appear to be any <Col N="998" /> statute bar to claims by the Revenue Commissioners against the taxpayer.  I understand that in other countries the approach is different.  For example, in Germany the approach is to provide a period of five years plus ten more if there is what is described as criminal evasion; in France it is four years plus six more in the case of fraud; in the US it is three years plus six more in the case of fraud and in Britain, it is six years plus six more in the case of fraud or of wilful neglect.  Unless such provisions are incorporated in this Bill by implication or by reference, a somewhat similar approach should be adopted.  Even if they are incorporated by reference, consideration should be given to their incorporation specifically. If they are not incorporated either specifically or by reference there would be a serious defect in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that one of the purposes of the Bill is the simplifying of the tax system.  Unfortunately it would appear that some of the administrative aspects of the Bill may involve greater complexity than that which is involved now.  One of the administrative problems that will arise is in connection with the phasing in of the legislation, that is, the requirement to make reports of payments which are deemed distributions before six months after the end of an accounting period.  In the light of present auditing practice I understand that this period is too short and may well involve some virtually intolerable pressure not only on taxpayers and their professional advisers but on the Revenue Commissioners also.</P>
    <P>We had an example of this kind of intolerable pressure in relation to the wealth tax in December, 1975.  Therefore, further thought should be given to the implications of this kind of time limit.  In March, 1974, explanatory and practical notes in relation to these provisions were produced and were issued subsequently in relation to the superannuation provisions for the benefit of insurance companies and insurance brokers.  To the best of my knowledge nothing was issued in relation to the other provisions and sections of the Bill.  This Bill was published only relatively recently but my <Col N="999" /> information is that it was printed approximately six months before it was published.  The point I am making is that there was time for the preparation of the explanatory and practical notes that were produced.  I draw attention to the non-furnishing of these notes and I urge the Minister to ensure that they are furnished as soon as possible to all those concerned.</P>
    <P>There are certain extra statutory concessions granted by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister referred to one aspect of this matter in introducing this Stage of the Bill.  I suggest there is a strong case for the publication of details of extra statutory concessions granted by the Revenue Commissioners.  I am not aware of any valid argument against doing so but I am aware of a number of valid arguments as to why this should be done.</P>
    <P>One aspect of this Bill seems to be quite peculiar, although no doubt there is some rational explanation.  It is the omission of definitions of the various technical terms used.  The Minister will be aware that major tax legislation enacted in the past, such as the 1918 Consolidated Tax Act and the 1967 Income Tax Act, contained very detailed and wide-ranging definitions, in one case at the beginning of the Act and in the other at the end.  This Bill does not seem to contain any.  The existing definitions can be imported, but, having regard not only to the size of the Bill&mdash;I think the Minister would agree on reflection that, if only from the point of view of practical working&mdash;these interpretations and definitions should be contained in the Bill as it stands.  I think that the absence of such definitions hampers the operation of this Bill as to its workability and usefulness as a consolidation measure.  The Minister did not refer to it as a consolidation measure, because in the technical sense it is not.  However in the practical sense, in so far as it deals with taxation of companies it is fair enough to call it a consolidation measure.</P>
    <P>There are various aspects of the <Col N="1000" /> drafting of the Bill which I will endeavour to deal with on Committee Stage.  I have received representations on one matter to which I would like to refer.  This is the surcharge provision and the fact that this surcharge is to be applied to undistributed profit.  The point made is that for example in the case of an investment company where there is a liability for wealth tax, it would appear that the surcharge is being applied to the retained or undistributed income which, of course, has to include the provision for wealth tax. As far as the provision for payment of wealth tax is concerned, this is not something which is being retained.  In the ordinarily understood sense it is something for which provision must be made and that relief should be given in respect of the income retained for payment of wealth tax.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, there is provision in the Bill for the application of capital gains tax to companies.  At this stage I do not wish to go back over the arguments that we had in this House in regard to the capital gains tax provision.  However, I think it is necessary that I should once again put on record the objection we on this side of the House have to the principle on which capital gains tax is being levied under the existing legislation and is now being incorporated in this Bill.  That is the principle whereby the same rate of capital gains tax is applied to a gain, whether it consists of a &ldquo;quick killing&rdquo; or results from years of hard work and skill in building up a business.</P>
    <P>We made alternative proposals in this House.  They were rejected by the Government but, nevertheless, I want to make it clear again that as far as this side of the House is concerned we object to the principle whereby the same rate of capital gains tax is applied to a &ldquo;quick killing&rdquo; on the one hand or a gain built up over many long years of hard work.  That provision of the same rate is being imported now in this Bill to the taxation of companies.  As we objected to it under the capital gains tax legislation we object to it under this legislation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the grouping provisions, <Col N="1001" /> provisions relating to groups of companies, it would appear that corporation tax can be chargeable before the grouping relief proposed in the Bill comes into play.  If that is so, it is going to lead to difficulties, anomalies and unfairness.  I hope that the Minister will be able to show us that that interpretation of the provisions is wrong.</P>
    <P>It would also appear that interest payable to a person who is not resident in the State will not be allowable for the purpose of relief against the liability for the tax.  If that is so, I hope that the Minister will be able to justify that provision.  It seems on the face of it to be one that is going to produce inequities also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is also a change proposed in the way that fee depreciation is to be given and it seems that the change can involve a severe cash flow problem for some companies. I assume that the Minister's attitude in this regard is that he would not wish the introduction of this Bill to create new cash flow problems for companies and that if we can demonstrate to him that this is so he will be prepared to amend the provisions of the Bill to avoid such a result.</P>
      <P>Another matter arises in regard to the surcharge provision on the income of non-trading companies.  It seems that if the net non-trading income of a closed company is later distributed, no credit will be given in respect of the surcharge which has already been borne.  If that is so, it would seem that it can give rise to a tax rate of something like 86 per cent in certain cases. Again, I assume that that is not the result the Minister is aiming at, and that he will be prepared to amend the provisions of the Bill to avoid such a manifestly unjust result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I do not wish to go into too much detail on this Bill which is largely a Committee Stage Bill.  I have simply outlined some of the areas in which I have reservations on the provisions of the Bill as I read <Col N="1002" /> them at present.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that, so far as the principle of the Bill is concerned, we not alone have no objection to it but we support it, arising as it does from work carried out under previous Fianna Fáil Governments over a long number of years, and in pursuance of the major changes outlined in the White Paper we issued on this matter in 1972.  We have no objection to this Stage of the Bill.  We are not opposing it.  We intend to concentrate our main discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Colley said, this is a rather frightening Bill running to 257 pages and five Schedules.  The explanatory memorandum runs to 35 pages.  Although I have gone through as much of the Bill as I could, so far I have not been able to find what I wanted to find to relieve any anxiety I might have.</P>
      <P>The idea of introducing a single tax to take the place of income tax and corporation tax, the rates of both of which have tended to fluctuate over the years, is to be commended.  As Deputy Colley said, the Bill calls for really intensive Committee Stage debate. I am glad the two sides of the House have agreed to take it in committee. Deputy Colley remarked on the capital gains aspect.  I agree with the comments he made.  When the Capital Gains Tax Bill was before the House, we expressed our belief that there is an in-built injustice in applying the same rate to a capital gain irrespective of whether it was made by an individual or a company who engaged in that kind of activity for the sake of making a quick kill, or a gain made by a large number of companies and individuals who devoted a lifetime to creating wealth and providing employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to this aspect. I take it from what he said that there is no question that, if a firm transfers its site and its factory premises, unless the cost of the sale of the assets exceeds the new cost, there will not be any capital charge.  That is the sensible thing to do.  I have not been able to find reference to&mdash;and I should like to hear from the Minister <Col N="1003" />&mdash;what the effect of this tax will be on the fairly large number of foreign registered companies here.  Heretofore foreign registered companies were subject to ordinary corporation tax and not to ordinary income tax.  I understand from inquiries I made some years ago that there are very good reasons for this.  I should like to know from the Minister how such companies will be affected.  Will the full rate of corporation tax now be applied to them, or will the preference they have had of being registered abroad still stand for such companies?</P>
    <P>I should also be interested to hear from the Minister how the tax-free incentives on exports which apply to a number of public companies established in the past 20 years will be dealt with in the matter of dividends to investors.  That seems to me to be an aspect which will be affected by this comprehensive legislation.  Like Deputy Colley, I welcome the up-dating of the taxable provisions on companies and the provision of a simpler system which will be easier to grasp by business people and people in industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. I was glad to note the constructive approach of the two Opposition speakers.  I want to deal with one matter to which the Minister referred very carefully, that is, the harmonisation of corporation tax with company taxation in the EEC.  The Minister quite rightly said that the proposed draft directive has been before the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EEC.  I am a member of that committee.  It was part of our function to consider draft regulations. I am glad this Corporation Tax Bill provides for an exemption in relation to export reliefs and also to the Shannon free area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of that committee and as a Member of this House I am not at all happy with the proposed draft directive in view of the fact that, although verbal assurances were given by some officials of the EEC, they did not spell out specifically what our position is in relation to these two areas of relief which are so vitally important <Col N="1004" /> for native Irish industry.  We must bear in mind the fact that we have a sort of chronic shortage of capital here.  We have this as a result of foreign occupation over the years.  It has been a hard job to build up native industry.  That is not the end of the story.</P>
    <P>If we are a partner in the EEC I would imagine that, if there is to be a harmonisation of taxation, it must be harmonisation in the sense that it is relative to companies standing on an equal footing, or in an equal environment and in equal economic circumstances. I cannot see that being the case so far as this country is concerned at the moment in relation to its development, its wealth, and particularly its capital wealth, and in relation to its corporate life so far as companies are concerned.  This has been added to and aggravated by the failure of our partners in the EEC to realise the real necessity for proper regional fund allocations to this country.  I understood, and I think every Member of the House understands the case to be that the regional fund was for the purpose of improving the infrastructure of this country to bring us up to some comparability with our EEC partners. Any talk of a harmonisation of corporation tax in relation to our EEC partners and ourselves must make allowance for this very great disparity in relation to our wealth when compared with that of our partners in the EEC.  We can be compared on an area basis or on a <i>per capita</i> basis, and on both bases it is obvious that we lack the necessary wealth to bring us within the category where any harmonisation of corporation tax could have any real relevance or, for that matter, justice.</P>
    <P>This is important because it will affect our employment position and our immediate economic future.  If we have to bear unreal burdens which we have not got the wealth to bear, then the matter becomes serious.  But at least I am heartened on this aspect of the matter, that before that directive can become effective and before harmonisation can be applied to this country under Rule 100 of the Treaty of Rome, there has to be unanimity.  Therefore I am very pleased to see that the Minister has these reliefs for our native <Col N="1005" /> industry and particularly for our exporting industries incorporated for and provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters which I would like to refer to here but, as the two previous speakers have quite rightly said, this is principally a Committee Stage Bill.  I understand there will be a special committee to deal with this matter and there will be a lot of technicalities to be dealt with.  I just want to put on record a point in respect of Deputy Colley's reference to definitions.  Deputy Colley is a lawyer like myself, and I hate definitions if ordinary language can be given its meaning.  In Part XV of the Bill there are quite a number of definitions dealing with technical phraseology giving a special meaning, and I think they also appear in other parts of the Bill where they are necessary.  It may appear necessary on Committee Stage to provide these definitions.</P>
    <P>Let me, however, put the clock back a little.  In old legislation&mdash;I am talking about Acts at the beginning of the century&mdash;the habit of draftsmen used to be to put the definitions at the end of the Bill instead of in the front of the Bill.  Where you are dealing with a technical Bill like this it might be a good idea to bear that in mind in case we do run into any difficulties on Committee Stage.  They are likely to arise on a technical Bill of this sort, although it is virtually the reorganisation of existing taxes to be brought under the same umbrella both as to imposition and as to time and date of accounting and imposition, which will be a considerable help to the commercial world instead of dealing with, in some cases, three or four computation dates for the one year, which companies had to struggle with so far.  At least we will get that out of the way and it will be of some assistance to the accountancy profession and to those responsible for business in this country.</P>
    <P>Another matter Deputy Colley referred to is the statute of limitations. I think ten years is the period on that; I am not certain, as I have not got verse and scripture with me.  Of course there is one exception; for <Col N="1006" /> anything that is fraud, there is no statute running in those circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the manner in which the House accepted the recommendation that the Second Stage of this Bill pass.  As has very properly been recognised, it is primarily a Committee Stage Bill.  Indeed, I suspect that were I to endeavour to answer expansively the several questions put to me, the explanations might be even more confusing than the text of the Bill and the explanatory memorandum that went with it. If we are able to handle specific queries at the special committee, I believe far more progress will be made and the explanations will be more intelligible. However, I would like to deal with a few general issues.</P>
      <P>This Bill was circulated on 27th November and since that date very few representations have been received. That is significant when one bears in mind that the people who are primarily concerned with this Bill are professional lawyers and accountants. The fact that there have been so few representations, is, I think, the direct result of the very full discussions which took place, the very full examination which was made of all the issues involved since 1971 or so, and the consultations going over a period of years with the professional and business organisations concerned.  Because of the fewness of the representations made since the publication of the Bill, it may be not unreasonably assumed that there is a substantial body of opinion in support of the Bill, and any particular issues which may be raised by way of representations or by Deputies themselves will, of course, receive our very earnest consideration, because our anxiety is to produce a Bill which will stand up without amendment, if possible, for a long time to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the point which has been made that we have had a considerable body of taxation legislation in recent times which increases the burden on the people who are obliged to operate the system both in the private and public sectors.  It is our anxiety to reduce <Col N="1007" /> the workload involved in the operation of taxation measures.  This Bill is certainly frightening in its dimensions.  As Deputy Brugha said, it has 188 sections, 257 pages, five Schedules, and refers to no fewer than 42 statutes which are already on the books.  But to the practitioner it is not so frightening because a great deal of what is referred to is already well known to them.  The reason why the Bill has not got such extensive definition sections as the legislation to which Deputy Colley referred is that there is no need for many of the definitions that are included in other legislation because they are carried automatically into this Bill without having to be specifically referred to. However, where identification is required, such identification is specifically given.  I would refer in particular to section 1 (5) and to section 115 itself which deals very extensively with over three pages of interpretations. The other provisions relating to income tax, law and capital gains will apply without having to be introduced word by word into this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde was correct in saying that the ordinary provisions in relation to the collection of arrears mean that the Revenue Commissioners may go back ten years, except in cases of fraud, where there is no limitation other than the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>I am not going to pursue this theological question of the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners, the manner in which they exercise it and the appropriateness of their being invested with this discretion.  I always greatly appreciate the contributions made by Deputy de Valera, but I was glad he was not here today lest the utterances of Deputy Colley might have set him off on an oration which, while it would certainly contribute to our thinking, would not help the expeditious passing of this legislation, and it is important to have this legislation through.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, we circulated the Bill on 27th November, but in order to afford every Member of the House and the public in general an adequate <Col N="1008" /> opportunity of studying the Bill before the debate began, we did not seek to have a debate on it before now.  There has been that nine to ten weeks since the publication of the Bill for people to study it and reflect upon it.  I am looking forward to the co-operation of the Members of the House in getting the Bill through the special committee, and the later Stages through this House, as soon as possible.  It has to be in operation before the commencement of the next tax year.  This urgency, I should like to emphasise, is in response to public demand.  There has been a certain expression of regret about the fact that the legislation has not already been finalised because people are anxious to have available to them the relief measures which are being provided in this legislation.  There is also a general welcome for the reform which the Bill contains.</P>
    <P>In addition, as the House will appreciate, a great deal of the financial and commercial operations which operate here are affected by British legislation and by the double taxation agreements between Ireland and Great Britain.  The present arrangements are due to expire on 5th April of this year and it is most desirable, therefore, that we should not create a vacuum between the termination of existing arrangements and the introduction of new ones.  There will be a need for alterations in the legislative provisions in Britain and it is, therefore, highly desirable that our own intentions would be declared before the preparation of the British Finance Bill, which will, subject to agreement, contain the necessary sections to reflect what we are doing.</P>
    <P>This is something that is much desired by the business community and I am sure the House will be at one with me in being anxious to ensure that there is a smooth operation in the introduction of this new legislation and the special arrangements which have traditionally existed between ourselves and our nearest neighbour.  Needless to say, I am not suggesting that we should treat this Bill casually and not give it a thorough examination.  I am sure Members will endeavour to apply their own expertise, and the advice which may be given to them by others, <Col N="1009" /> to a study of this Bill and to its improvement. I assure the House that everything I can do to accommodate Members in any request they may make regarding the improvement of the Bill will be done.  The urgency of the matter is obvious because of the short time between now and the commencement of the next financial year.  Not only have we to get it through this House but we also desire that we would benefit by the good advice of our brethren in the other House.</P>
    <P>I doubt very much if some of the anxieties expressed about cash flow problems will arise.  To some extent the Bill is neutral in its impact.  It is not making very material changes in the overall impact of tax; it is simply providing a better way for its collection. Deputy Colley expressed some reservations about making secretaries of companies primarily liable for the payment of tax and for rendering the necessary accounts.  We have had this debate in relation to the capital taxation measures but there cannot be any serious argument against making the secretary of a company primarily liable. That is not to say that he has not got his rights over against other people who may have a liability but it will clearly create an unworkable system if we were to omit to make the chief officer of a company the person primarily responsible for the furnishing of information, the payment of the tax and the discharge of such legal obligations as apply to corporations.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Esmonde on the point he made regarding our acceptance of EEC obligations.  This obligation which the EEC are proposing to impose on all countries, to adopt a common system of company taxation, like many other proposals of the Commission, imposes on the Community an obligation to facilitate countries like us that are less well off when compared with many of our neighbours. It imposes an obligation to assist us financially in the manner in which we were led to believe we would be assisted when we joined the Community. Deputy Esmonde is correct in expressing his disappointment at the failure of the Community to discharge that obligation towards the less <Col N="1010" /> favoured members of the Community. If the obligations which the Community are seeking to impose are to be equal there is a clear obligation on the Community to provide equal means whereby those obligations can be discharged. We are strengthened in our determination to bring this about, as far as the Government are concerned, by the unanimity of opinion in this House, as is so frequently expressed, and by the unanimity in the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities which do very valuable work for the House and the country in studying the various draft directives which the Commission put before the Council from time to time.  I suggest that the House pass this Stage and refer the Bill to a special committee.  Subject to a discussion between the Whips we propose to bring forward immediately the necessary resolution which will fix the date of the first meeting of the special committee.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now giving the impression that he has made up his mind and that nothing we say will change it, even to the extent of the time limit proposed by Deputy O'Connell of the Labour Party.  That amendment made provision for the operation of the legislation for one year but it was not acceptable to the Government.  To their shame they voted against a proposal that the operative provisions of the Bill would be subject to the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, even if it meant they would be without the support of some of their Coalition colleagues when the vote came to be taken.  The Minister suggested that it was an unnecessary amendment because our own Constitution provided equal if not better guarantees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed these amendments and disposed of them.  We are now on the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but they have an important bearing on the section.  The Minister conceded that the principle of extra-territorial jurisdiction covering a wide range of offences is possibly unprecedented in common law countries.  Probably the only reason the Minister made that grudging admission was because of the fact that these views were expressed by the Law Commission.  His sole argument to justify the Bill breaching <Col N="1012" /> this unprecedented principle was the needs of the time.</P>
      <P>Sir Leslie Scarman, one of England's most distinguished judges, and author of the Scarman Report on disturbances in Northern Ireland, when delivering the Hamlyn lectures in 1974, foresaw as one of the great problems in the immediate future in England the absence of a Bill of Rights.  Speaking of the position in England he said:</P>
      <P>The legal system must now ensure that the law of the land would itself meet the exacting standards of Human Rights, declared by international instruments, to which the United Kingdom is a party, as inviolable.  This calls for entrenched or fundamental laws protected by a Bill of Rights, a Constitutional Law which is the duty of the courts to protect, even against the power of Parliament. In other words, there must be a Constitutional Restraint placed upon the legislative power, which is designed to protect the individual citizen from instant legislation conceived in prejudice and enacted in breach of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>We have a position far in advance of England in that we have our Constitution which can, and does, prevail over these Houses.  However, it is no great tribute to us as legislators that we can enact legislation such as this and seek to rely, as the Minister has already expressed an interest in relying, on the Supreme Court to determine its constitutionality, especially where two members of that court have sat on the Law Commission and, as such, may have to debar themselves from sitting on a case.  As a Parliament we should be in the forefront of refusing to enact, in the words of Scarman, &ldquo;instant legislation conceived in fear or prejudice and enacted in breach of human rights&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister claims that this instant legislation is not in breach of human rights, as enacted and clarified by way of international treaty or commentary, why the fear on the part of the Government?  Why their refusal to accept amendments that would have made the Bill subject to <Col N="1013" /> the provisions of the European Convention? The sole answer the Minister would give to that query was that at best it was tautologous in a Bill, the language of which itself is tautologous in the extreme.  This is a poor answer to give to one of a small number of amendments put down on Committee Stage.  If our amendments are correct, as I believe they are, they would have substantially safeguarded fundamental human rights that should be in the forefront of our mind.  If the Minister is correct in his views regarding our amendments&mdash;I do not accept that he is&mdash;they would not in any way have detracted from the Bill.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights become doubly important when we remember that there is reciprocal legislation in the United Kingdom to coincide with the provisions of this Bill.  We cannot pass this legislation without being conscious of the fact that the reciprocal legislation on the other side will be enacted and operated by a country with no written Constitution, with no Bill of Rights and with proven scant respect for human rights in Northern Ireland where ultimately the only protection of the citizens there is the European Convention.</P>
    <P>This point was taken up by Scarman in the same lectures I mentioned earlier.  Having claimed that when times were normal English law protected the individual, he said:</P>
    <P>When times are abnormally alive with fear and prejudices the common law is at a disadvantage; it cannot resist the will, however frightened or prejudiced it may be of Parliament.</P>
    <P>Scarman gave as an illustration the case of Liversidge v. Anderson which dealt with the detention of persons in England during the Second World War and where, under the pressure of that war, judges accepted an interpretation of statutory words which Lord Atkin dubbed as &ldquo;fantastic&rdquo; and as an argument which the judge thought would have been addressed acceptably to the Court of King's Bench in the time of Charles I.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> I do not think the times in this jurisdiction are abnormally alive with fear or prejudice.  I do not believe that in this jurisdiction fear is stalking the land.  I believe the Minister and the Government would like to have the public believe that fear is stalking the land.  It reminds me of something I read regarding the declining days of the Roman Empire.  The emperors offered the citizens bread and circuses to take the citizens' minds off the economic chaos that was about to submerge the empire.  This Government are so bankrupt that they cannot offer the people bread and circuses.  Instead, to take the people's minds off our economic chaos they offer fear and the threat of war.  This is the reality behind the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 3, the Minister said that we should not go overboard in recalling that many people were tortured by the security forces in Northern Ireland.  He appeared to justify not going overboard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a most serious statement to make without giving the exact quotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister appeared to justify what he said about not going overboard on the basis that this had happened five years ago and also that compensation had been paid to a great many people. This, if I am correct, totally ignores any concept of human dignity and is totally contrary to the spirit and intention of the European Convention on Human Rights.  This convention would allow, if the Minister had his way, for the servants of the State brutally to ill-treat people and so long as compensation was paid for that ill-treatment nobody should then go overboard about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also said that internment has now departed the scene in Northern Ireland and that section 3 will not apply to persons escaping or persons assisting a person to escape <Col N="1018" /> from internment or imprisonment.  I believe this is an extremely facile point of view and begs a great number of questions.  Many people who are now serving sentences in Northern Ireland, as distinct from internment, would be affected by the provisions of section 3. They are serving sentences in Northern Ireland only because of possible perjured evidence in the courts there.</P>
    <P>The Minister can ask any of his colleagues in the legal profession in Northern Ireland who appeared before the advisory committee on detention in Long Kesh, about this.  I gather they might not have much difficulty in assuring him that much of the evidence given by Special Branch officers and the like was utterly false.  The bulk of the offences with which a person might have been convicted, and for which he might be now serving a sentence in such circumstances that section 3 of this Bill would apply, would consist of what are known as terrorist offences.</P>
    <P>Of its nature, the evidence given in such cases tends to be confined to members of the security forces, be they RUC or British Army.  In the last analysis, the creation of those offences in this jurisdiction and their punishment here under section 3 is dependent on the validity of the persons convicting in Northern Ireland.  This validity should not be based on the fact that a person is convicted in a court in Northern Ireland rather than merely interned there but on the fact that in the great majority of these cases the validity will have depended on whether certain members of the security forces in Northern Ireland were honest and truthful or dishonest persons wilfully perjuring themselves to obtain a conviction.</P>
    <P>This is something over which our courts will have no jurisdiction because it will be no defence in our courts that the person's detention was unlawful or that his conviction was improperly obtained.  In that context, on existing law in this State, where a person is accused, say, of escaping from Mountjoy, it would be a good defence that his detention was unlawful, but such a defence seems to be excluded by the Minister and his advisers in respect of a person detained in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> Paragraphs (b) and (c) deal with this and it is in this context that the Northern Ireland security forces come into sharp relief, because no matter what the Minister says, neither the prosecuting authority here nor the judges before whom the accused person might appear will have any authority to inquire into the manner of the person's conviction in Northern Ireland.  I believe that when the Minister spoke on this section last week he said that the proper thing to do in such circumstances would be to assume the <i>bona fides</i> on the part of the security forces in Northern Ireland.  The history of the RUC, the Special Branch and, indeed, the British Army in Northern Ireland cannot lend credence to any such belief.  If anything, in dealing with the security forces in Northern Ireland the proper thing for the Minister to do is to presume <i>mala fides.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with certain persons and in section 3 we will be depending on their veracity not merely in relation to proceedings where a person is charged with an offence under the section but more importantly in relation to the basic conviction which first put him into custody in Northern Ireland.  We are dealing with persons who during the very week that the whitewashing Compton Commission were sitting in Belfast and when these people were giving what many believed to be perjured evidence, denying that interrogation in depth had occurred, were at that very time continuing in another part of Northern Ireland that same interrogation in depth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister complains, as he seems to, that these are matters now best overlooked because they happened five years ago and that those people were compensated because they were mentally or physically handicapped for the rest of their lives.  I suggest to him that he should try to remember the more recent example last year in Dungannon.  At that time a complainant in a criminal prosecution in the <Col N="1020" /> Northern Ireland courts said he had been viciously assaulted in a police station.  The case was fully reported at the time and my recollection is that four or five members of the RUC stood accused of the assault in the dock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would give us the name of the case we might be able to check it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the definite name of the case.  I am speaking from memory, but I will make every effort to trace it.  It happened about a year ago, I believe in Dungannon. The Minister's advisers should not have much difficulty in tracing it because it was fairly well reported at the time.  Four or five members of the RUC stood in the dock accused of ill-treating the complainant, and practically everybody, including the judge, accepted that the complainant had been viciously ill-treated. It was further accepted, from the defence counsel to the judge, that this had taken place while the person was in a particular Northern Ireland police station.</P>
      <P>One by one, each of the accused denied he was one of the persons who had ill-treated the complainant.  Of course, the full complement of the RUC and the Special Branch were not in the dock and there was always some fall guy for the accused to blame.  To make doubly sure, because the complainant was able to give physical descriptions of the persons who assaulted him, and because some of the descriptions tallied with some of the accused, it became necessary for them to get themselves out of danger and a great number of policemen, in a dramatic charade, stood in the back of the court made up so as to look nearly identical with the policemen in the dock so that when the complainant was asked to identify the accused there were four or five policemen in the body of the court who seemed identical in all physical characteristics with the accused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That did not happen five years ago but less than a year ago and when the Minister says we should not go overboard about matters such as this because it happened five years ago and compensation was paid, it would <Col N="1021" /> be well for the Minister to remember that this example happened very recently and that it is not compensation that is vital but more importantly that the persons guilty of acts such as these should be brought before the law of the country of which they are the police force.  What happened in that court in Dungannon was a charade and a mockery of justice, and they are the persons whose <i>bona fides</i> the Minister is willing to accept, on whose <i>bona fides</i> the Minister must rely if section 3 is to be operated.  It was on the <i>bona fides</i> of such persons that reliance had to be placed in the first place when the original conviction took place in relation to which either the person himself escaped from custody or some person attempted to help him to escape from custody.  Over all of this area our prosecuting authorities and our judiciary will have no function whatsoever.  Our laws will be powerless to help such a person from being further convicted under section 3 in this jurisdiction.  For this reason we oppose this section.</P>
    <P>Over and above the legal arguments that can be made and have been made against this unprecedented use of extra-territorial power remains our reliance on the security forces in Northern Ireland for the operation of this measure.  Rely on them we must if this Bill is to operate.  Rely on them we must in circumstances in which our own legal and prosecuting authorities and our judiciary will have no control over such security forces.</P>
    <P>One small fact will indicate the problem inherent in such reliance. Between 1970 and 1974 2,617 complaints were lodged against the police and security forces in Northern Ireland.  About 417 of these were referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I understand that only 14 prosecutions ensued and there were only three convictions.  Not a single policeman was convicted of assault though, in that same period, nearly £500,000 was paid out in compensation to persons who sustained injuries. The British Government's attitude seems to be that the security forces in Northern Ireland can do what they like because the Government can <Col N="1022" /> always buy their way out of trouble afterwards.  When the Minister says we should not go overboard about this because compensation has been paid it would seem that the Minister is accepting the same view.</P>
    <P>I would like to give the Minister now an example of the <i>bona fides</i> of the persons on whom he will be relying if this Bill becomes law.  There are two possible approaches.  The first is that the law will be used as just another weapon in the Government's arsenal.  In that case it will become little more than a propaganda cover for the disposal of unwanted members of the public.  If this is to be done efficiently then the activities of the legal services will have to be tied into the war effort in as discreet a way as possible which means in effect that the member of the Government responsible for law either says <i>subpoena</i> counsel or takes his orders from the head administration.  The other alternative is that the court should remain impartial and administer the laws of the country without any direction from the Government.  It appears the Minister accepts the first of the two alternatives but, even if he does not, by this Bill he will bind himself hand and foot to accepting the <i>bona fides</i> of those who choose the first alternative, the alternative favoured by the author of the quotation I have given, and successfully carried out by his successors in office and their underlings, namely, those who followed Brigadier Frank Kitson and his views as expounded in low intensity operations. These are my views on this and I should like to hear the Minister reply to them.</P>

      <P>We have just had a Second Stage speech from Deputy Collins.  We are discussing sections 2 and 3.  Section 2 creates the extra-territoriality of the offences in the Schedule and section 3 provides that the offence of escaping from lawful custody will also be an extra-territorial offence.  We have now had a Second Stage debate on the merits of this whole legislation.  We had similar debates <i>ad nauseam</i> in the Seanad and we have had them here.  I do not intend to reply to the ultra green political <Col N="1023" /> arguments advanced by Deputy Collins. We cannot go overboard with regard to our attitude to Northern Ireland.  We have to observe a middle course and a certain balance.

      <P>It is a pity we cannot hear the merits of any of these sections commended to us by the Minister.  That is indicative of the position in which he finds himself. His only reply to Deputy Collins has been the contemptible one we have just heard.  I spoke at some length on these sections, section 2 in particular, and pointed out on the last occasion we debated this measure that they were extraordinarily complicated sections and I was told I was wrong and that was that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in debating this any longer.  There is apparently very little to be gained by continuing the debate.  Indeed, it is not a debate because the Minister has no contribution to make.  He does not contradict what the effects of these two sections will be.  The effects have been detailed by Deputy Collins and I believe Deputy Collins is correct in what he says the effects will be.  I made similar points on the last occasion and I was told, as Deputy Collins has been told, that this all happened five years ago and we should not bother about it now.  But the situation will be that under these sections people arrested in this jurisdiction will be under the direct control of the security forces in Northern Ireland.  It is well known now not alone on the part of British Commissions but also by the European Commission on Human Rights that these security forces have acted in flagrant violation of the European Charter of Human Rights.  Yet we are told that, if we complain, we are being ultra green.  That is not a proper manner in which to debate this measure.  Like Deputy Collins and all Members on this side of the House I regret very much that the effect of these two sections will be to place people arrested in this jurisdiction under the sole control of security forces whose activities have come in for such heavy adverse criticism not just in this country but also in Britain and before the European Commission on Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> This seems to be a matter that is of no consequence to the Minister so far as one can judge.  All I can do is register our strong dissent from the point of view expressed by the Minister on this.  We feel that the question of the activities of these forces is very relevant and is putting people, whom we must presume to be innocent until they are convicted, in grave danger of serious assault and injury, if not death in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 2 is to create a large new series of offences in this jurisdiction described in the Law Commission report as being &ldquo;unprecedented in common law countries&rdquo;.  There seems, to say the least of it, a very arguable case that the principle of trying to create extra-territorial legislation on such a broad scale as this, for people who are not citizens of this country, is open to doubt.</P>
    <P>The relevant quotation on page 6 of the judgement of Mr. Justice McMahon, to which I referred the last day, reads:</P>
    <P>Under Article 3 laws having a purely domestic import do not extend to Northern Ireland, but laws expressed to operate extra-territorially can bind those who are subjects of the State in regard to their conduct in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I take that sentence to mean what, on its face, it is apparently intended to mean.  The Minister takes it to mean something else.  He takes the words &ldquo;those who are subjects of the State&rdquo; to mean those who are resident in the State.  I ask the Minister and anyone who wants to look at the matter objectively, why should a judge not say &ldquo;those who are resident in the State&rdquo; if that is what he means?  Why does he say &ldquo;those who are subjects of the State&rdquo;?  The Minister feels the judge meant the former and, therefore, the rest of us must assume that that is the meaning of the sentence.  I cannot believe a judge would say one thing when he means another, but the Minister obviously believes he does.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not argued the principle of this point at all.  He has simply and solely said that because the judge meant something else, the <Col N="1026" /> point does not arise.  On the strength of that judgment, at the very least, it is likely that on this ground, as well as on many other grounds, the validity of this section will be challenged as soon as anybody is prosecuted under it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were prepared to enter into it, one could have a worthwhile and constructive Committee Stage debate on the various ins and outs and technicalities of the now complicated subsections of section 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>I agree entirely with the sentiments expressed by the previous two speakers.  The problem, as we see it, is the type of law enforcement agencies who will be cooperating under sections 2 and 3 of this Bill.  The Garda Síochána have <Col N="1027" /> been found to be an excellent security agency as far as the safety of this country is concerned.  In their dealings with the people they have the 100 per cent backing of the people. There is no suggestion that any section of the community down here does not support the Garda Síochána. Those two sections subscribe to the institutions of the State.  The vast majority of people here are subscribers to these institutions.  We are now being asked by the Minister to accept the fact that we should cooperate with the law enforcement agencies which have been found desperately wanting in their application of their duties and functions to a minority in the six north-eastern counties.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the Garda Síochána have never been found wanting so far as their loyalty to the country or their application to their duties were concerned.  The Garda Síochána are manned by people of integrity.  The Army are manned by people of patriotic intent and integrity. We have always upheld and supported these two law enforcement agencies.  On the one hand that is the situation as it exists in the Twenty-six Counties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the other hand we have a situation where over the years, as a matter of proven record, there have been incidents to such an extent that the Irish Government felt it necessary to bring a torture case against the United Kingdom to the Court of Human Rights.  This was brought on the basis of the application of the law by the British Army and the RUC in an unfair fashion in respect of certain sections of the community, particularly the minority there.  In this Bill the Minister is asking us to accept that the British Army and the RUC are now good boys and that nothing more untowards will happen, that we forget and forgive the past; we should not look to the past as regards errors we believe were made made in the past and which we believe will continue to be made in the future.  Hopefully, a torture case will <Col N="1028" /> be brought to the Court of Human Rights under the European Convention and the Minister has avoided the question as to whether that case is now being dealt with, whether it has been finalised within the commission and whether he has the decision of the commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Sections 2 and 3 are fundamental to the whole discussion on it and it is very important to recognise that the Minister has been sidestepping our call for some indication as to how this torture case has gone.

      <P>I assume that it is not because I am speaking that the Chair has decided to exercise what we consider to be a misinterpretation of the <i>sub judice</i> rule in regard to the case before the commission, but on the basis of what the Chair has just said, I would refer the Chair to the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Tuesday, January 27th, 1976, in which there is a heading: &ldquo;How will they settle the torture case?&rdquo;  I have no objection&mdash;how dare I? &mdash;to that heading but if the media can discuss the case before the commission is seems extraordinary that Dáil Éireann cannot discuss it.  There is a very succinct summary of the general machinery involved in the case and how it is dealt with.  I refer to the newspaper article I have mentioned, which says:</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to reflect on the Chair but it seems to have been rather selectively consistent &mdash;with no disrespect to the Chair.  I opened my submission on this Bill on this occasion by suggesting that if the law is not to be brought into disrepute it must be seen to be applied equally to everybody.  Our fear is based on the fact that the law enforcement agencies in the north-east of Ireland have been found wanting over the years and that the Minister is in some way satisfied <Col N="1030" /> that the law as it applies in the north-east of the country will be applied there in the same way as it has been applied here over the years. Our concern over sections 2 and 3 directly relates to misapplication of the law in the Six Counties over the years.</P>
      <P>We accept that those against whom this Bill is aimed are no doubt persons who do not accept the institutions of this country and are, in the main, people who, if given the opportunity, would destroy these institutions.  Nevertheless, to be found guilty of the offences as set out in the Schedule to this Bill they must go through what we would consider to be due and proper process of the law.</P>
      <P>However, so far as the due and proper process of the law is concerned, the north-eastern part of this island has been found wanting during the past 60 years and it is that situation that causes us such deep concern in relation to sections 2 and 3 of this Bill.  It has been said on a number of occasions that persons apprehended under this legislation may be those who would not give to others the opportunity of a trial, but if we subscribe to democratic principles of a proper legal system we must afford these people the right to be tried in a balanced manner.  The balance so far as this part of the country is concerned is correct, but there is an imbalance on the Northern side of the Border in regard to the proper and fair implication of the law.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention to try to override the ruling of the Chair but I would mention briefly that there is outstanding a very serious case against the UK, a case which must be of much concern to that country.</P>
      <P>As reported at column 385 of the Official Report for 27th January, 1976, the Minister said in referring to remarks made earlier by me:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me refer to what Deputy Andrews said on the amendment. The tenor of Deputy Andrews' remarks completely overlooks that fact that we in this country, and the people who will be affected by this Bill, do not look to the European Convention on Human Rights for <Col N="1031" /> the protection of our personal liberty. We look to our Constitution.  That is what gives us our rights and to a far greater degree than these admittedly minimum rights provided by the European Convention.  If this Bill is in breach of the European Convention it is also in breach of our Constitution.  I deny it is in breach of either.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise that we are subscribers to that convention and that the UK subscribes to it also.  Is it not extraordinary, then, that the case of a citizen of the UK, Dr. Cassidy, in which torture and other horrible crimes are alleged to have been perpetrated against her by Chile, should be taken outside Britain which, admittedly, has an unwritten Constitution, to a court which in its intent, aspirations and ideals is not dissimilar to the European Court?</P>
    <P>Of course our Constitution sets out certain guidelines and matters which are of fundamental importance to the public discharge of the rule of law. Unfortunately, however, it does not extend to the north-eastern part of the island.  Consequently, in the meantime and so far as this Bill is concerned, we must rely on the European Convention on Human Rights in regard to that part of the country.  We must recognise that the Bill cannot be regarded only in the light of our Constitution.  That is another good reason why Deputy Collins's reasonable amendment in relation to the insertion of certain guarantees enshrined in the Convention on Human Rights should have been accepted by the Minister.  While the Bill relates to our Constitution, there is an added ingredient and this is its relationship to the European Convention.</P>
    <P>Since both we and the UK have subscribed to that convention it must be the position that for as long as the UK administer the colony of the north-east of this country we must bring our case to the Convention on Human Rights in the event of any problem arising.  This is a very important point.  It must disabuse the Minister of his suggestion that in some way this Bill is referable in its <Col N="1032" /> entirety to our Constitution.  Nothing could be further from the facts.  Our party is the biggest political party on this island and down through the years we have subscribed to the rule of law.  We have never been found wanting in relation to the discharge of the functions of government.</P>

Our concern in relation to the sections under discussion is that the rule of law in terms of the operability of this legislation will be brought into disrepute because of the imbalance which exists in the north-eastern part of the country.</P>
      <P>Since the Committee Stage began this concern of ours has been articulated by the many speakers from this side who have contributed to the debate, whereas Government Members are leaving the whole burden of the Bill to the Minister for Justice.

      <P>You painfully sat through about ten minutes of the Seanad debate on Committee Stage. It had just opened when you made that statement.  The Minister must have a defensive attitude when he makes a statement of that nature, because no criminal law that we would introduce here, or elsewhere, could have any such intention. The Minister went on to say, and one would not wish to misinterpret him:</P>
      <P>The intention is to make sure that guilty people do not escape</P>
      <P>I want to come back to the point that we cannot decide here who guilty people are.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the courts who decides this, and I said on the last occasion here that this trend ran right through the Minister's opening speech, that guilty people will not escape.  This attitude is basic through his approach to this Bill.  The fact that the person is charged does not make him guilty.  The whole structure of our courts and the whole administration of our law depends entirely on the jurisdiction of our courts and the determination as to a person's guilt or innocence.  On what basis do our courts come to that conclusion?  On the basis of evidence presented to them by the police force, in this jurisdiction the Garda Síochána, a police force which <Col N="1035" /> operates and is controlled to a very considerable extent subject to the court rules as to matters of questioning and the whole rights which our courts have upheld as to an accused in custody.  In other words the whole range of protection which our courts have been very carefully and properly told to ensure will be effective.</P>
      <P>Now we come to the interesting point, where the courts are being involved in coming to decisions, and I am leaving out the question of what we regard as nothing short of a contradiction of criminal proceedings, that is the taking of evidence on commission in the possible absence of the accused. In section 2, for instance it states:</P>
      <P>Where a person does in Northern Ireland an act that, if done in the State, would constitute an offence specified in the Schedule, he shall be guilty of an offence and he shall be liable on conviction on indictment to the penalty to which he would have been liable if he had done the act in the State.</P>
      <P>Presumably the only evidence on which our courts or our Director of Public Prosecutions could move in the first instance would be evidence presented by the police in Northern Ireland that a person had done an act there which, had it been done here, would constitute an offence, and they would pass on this information, presumably to our police.  Our police in turn would do their investigations and eventually the Director of Public Prosecutions would decide whether to introduce proceedings.  Eventually our courts would be asked to determine the basis of this prosecution or its validity or otherwise.  All would depend initially on the information supplied by the police force in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two relevant aspects to this.  First of all, our courts, which are really the guarantors of this whole constitutional system, not only in relation to the police but also in relation to our activities here, are being asked to adjudicate on the guilt or innocence of a person on the basis of information supplied by a police force over whom they have no control.  That is new to any principle in our law and certainly <Col N="1036" /> something reprehensible.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of all purity being on this side of the Border and all wickedness or otherwise, particularly in relation to the police, being on the other side.  There is no question of global condemnations, far from it.  Nonetheless, the reality is that the history of the conduct of the police force in Northern Ireland has been such as to raise in our minds real doubts and apprehensions.  If we are now going to create as an offence here something which is established as an offence on evidence supplied by the police force in Northern Ireland over which we have no control, we are being a little less than realistic as to the circumstances and conduct of the police in Northern Ireland at present. On all sides of the House we would wish that that were not so.  I think it would be the dearest wish on all sides of this House that we could, all of us, in every part of this island, give our total support, as we give it here to our police force, to police forces on both sides.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the political representatives in the North who are concerned for peace and for community support for policemen&mdash;the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the UPNI and some elements within the Loyalist group&mdash;know it is vitally important that a police force must be acceptable to the community.  Many of them are anxious to give all the support they can to that police force. Nonetheless, in their heart of hearts they cannot at the moment see their way to giving publicly that support. The Minister knows this and we know it.  If they cannot do it how can we, who are not involved in any way, be asked to do this as the Minister asks us to do it in this Bill?  That is the major issue involved in this.</P>
    <P>It is not like transferring somebody from Tipperary or Dublin; it is not like matters of extradition which do not relate to questions of political effect.  We are dealing with accepting the basis of complaints and evidences, and so on of people against whom we have made the complaints.  That is No. 1. No. 2 is that it is an offence under this Bill for a person to escape <Col N="1037" /> from what is termed as lawful custody in Northern Ireland.  That is just fine. Normally we would go along with anything of that nature if we knew that, in all cases, there was no evidence to suggest that things had been prepetrated on people in custody which were the very negation of their fundamental rights.  That is our view.  The Fianna Fáil Government presented the complaint to the European Court on Human Rights on the basis that people were ill-treated in custody, inhumanly treated, degraded.  This Administration accepted the basis of that complaint, apparently, and followed it up.  I do not know if they had the same enthusiasm and conviction in doing so but we assume that, from the inquiries they made at the time, they were satisfied there was a <i>prima facie</i> basis for what the Fianna Fáil Government did.</P>
    <P>Does a man commit an offence if he escapes to protect his fundamental human rights, in other words, the right to his own person, the right to the integrity of his own person?  If a person is being manhandled or mistreated in custody, having regard to our constitutional position, do we say that man has committed an offence if he escapes from that custody?  Do we say, as this Bill says, that if a man omits doing something for the very authorities who manhandled him or mistreated him, he is guilty of an offence?  It may be that our complaints in Strasbourg are related to only 1 per cent, maybe 2 per cent, maybe 3 per cent.  That does not matter.  Even 5 per cent would represent 40 or 50 people or more.</P>
    <P>A person might escape from custody to safeguard his life or to protect his person.  The Minister will probably say if that is the case we certainly will not prosecute him.  How is he to prove that when he is being prosecuted down here?  He gives evidence that he was manhandled, mistreated or abused. Who will support his case?  Will the fact that he said so establish his innocence? The Minister may say the courts can consider that matter.  I do not think it is desirable that the only evidence before the courts would be the evidence of the person himself who said: &ldquo;I did escape.  I had to escape <Col N="1038" /> to protect myself.&rdquo;  The courts should be in a position to have more evidence than that.</P>
    <P>We come back to the basic problem to which this kind of legislation gives rise.  We are being asked to accept that everything done in a jurisdiction over which we have no control is being properly done as if it were being done in our jurisdiction over which we have control through this Legislature, and through our courts who, in my view, are the fundamental guarantors.  The more the Minister reflects on this, the more he must appreciate that we all have the same hopes and intentions. We share the intention behind this Bill but the way it is being effected in the Bill seems to fly in the face of all the principles of criminal procedure and criminal law.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would tell us how our courts can be expected to adjudicate on information which can only be supplied by the police in Northern Ireland.  Does he think he should write something into this Bill to ensure that a person who escapes from a custody in which he is being mistreated will not be charged under this legislation? What guarantees can we write into this legislation to ensure that what has happened in the past cannot happen in future to even one individual under this type of legislation?  The only way in which we can operate is with guarantees written into our law, and not informal guarantees given by the Minister.  I should like to hear his observations on these questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked three questions by Deputy O'Kennedy. Of course when you have the creation of an extra-territorial offence it can only be prosecuted on extra-territorial evidence, evidence obtained outside the jurisdiction.  That is an unavoidable consequence of creating an extra-territorial offence.  It is for our courts to assess that evidence in the normal way they assess evidence coming before them.  They listen to the examination and the cross-examination of the witnesses.  They observe their demeanour and attitudes and they then assess the evidence and its validity.  The Protection for our citizens lies in our courts <Col N="1039" /> which Deputy O'Kennedy has rightly praised.  I cannot see the reasoning in the suggestion that you should not operate a measure incorporating extra-territoriality merely because the evidence to support the charges comes from the outside.  You cannot have evidence from elsewhere by virtue of the extra-territorial nature of the crime.</P>
      <P>The second question he asked was what was the position of a person who escaped from lawful custody in Northern Ireland because he was being ill-treated. If the question of a prosecution arises, it is a prosecution within this jurisdiction for the extra-territorial crime of escaping from lawful custody in the other jurisdiction.  I would rely on our courts and on our law officers as to whether a case in such circumstances was a good case at all for prosecution.  If our law officers decide that <i>prima facie</i> an offence is committed &mdash; and they will have had the opportunity of examining the full files &mdash; it goes before the courts the same as any case has to go before the courts for final adjudication as to the merits of the parties' allegations.  It is a matter for the courts to determine the validity or otherwise of the charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because escaping from lawful custody is an offence.  In the unlikely situation of such a prosecution &mdash; and it is really straining for examples to adduce that as an example &mdash; and in the unlikely event of the courts having to record a technical conviction on a person in those cirstances, all it would be is a technical conviction.  No punishment would be imposed.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy asked what are the guarantees.  The guarantees are the same as in any legislation.  Sanctions are provided in the hope that they will render obedience to the law effective. The sanction is provided here.  That is the guarantee, the sanction being continued co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's defence of the indefensible is becoming <Col N="1040" /> weaker as we go along.  On the first point he said our courts can assess the evidence as they would in any case. This is very different from the manner in which they would assess the evidence in any other case.  In any other case the courts on which the Minister and I rely so much can ask questions directly.  They are not just sitting as observers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Deputy see any point of difference between my asking him a question directly and asking Deputy Collins to ask him a question and observing his answer?  As a practising counsel he must realise that the practice of excessive judicial questioning is not something that commends itself to advocates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be it from me or the Minister to tell judges how they should behave, but if he is suggesting that judges are in as good a position to determine the credibility of an accused person simply by sitting and observing him being questioned by someone else&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what they do every day of the week in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They do that and more, and the &ldquo;more&rdquo; is that they themselves, if they want to clear up some matters in their own mind, can engage in questioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided for here, that they may do so on commission as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They may not do so on commission.  At no stage have we heard the Minister suggest until now that our judges who will be sitting as observers on commission can actually question the witness directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I said they can ask questions through the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no use. Asking questions at third hand is very different from being able to pursue your own questions.  To suggest that this is not depriving our courts of a fundamental facility in the criminal procedure is ignoring the reality, and I am surprised that the Minister pretends that it is other than that.  It is not <Col N="1041" /> for the Minister or me to tell judges what are or are not effective aids in coming to their decisions.  The reality is that under this legislation they will not be able to do what they can do in every other criminal prosecution.  The Minister spoke about escape from custody and said we were straining the point a little.  He now has to acknowledge that no matter how the accused was being treated in that custody, the very fact that he has escaped obliges our courts, on that evidence alone, to convict him.  If he came in physically bruised&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same as if he escaped from prison here under the same circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>But we have made no complaints against our own police and I hope that we will never have occasion to do so.  We may be speaking about only a small minority of police in the North, but nonetheless that complaint has been made; the Government of which the Minister is a member have stood over it and have probably got at least a summary of the conclusions.  We are actually talking here about things that have happened in the last couple of years. We are not imagining things.  The Minister may be the one who is imagining things if he says that all that has happened will never happen again.  Our obligation is to protect the individual's rights.  If the Minister says in reply to point two that, of course, he would be guilty of a technical offence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As legislators we are not concerned with the good sense people might have in a given situation. We are concerned to see that could never happen in any situation. Otherwise we might as well say that there is no need for legislation in any event; we can rely on everybody's good sense.  Therefore, point two fails and fails very badly.  I do not want to be tempted to say that when liberals lose their liberal hue they really lose it.  I trust that what I am saying is not what is amusing the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, because I can imagine him fiercely defending this if he were on the other side.  Be that as it may, I have made three precise points and I have to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And what is more, if there is such a thing as an independent observer, if there was a judge sitting in judgement on this, I do not think the Minister would have satisfied him either.  In view of the Minister's response to even those queries, it is clear that he is determined to go ahead.  We are not determined to overstate our case.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section re-enacts sections 2 and 3 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1883.  Section 2 of that Act, as re-enacted, provides that it is an offence for a person in the State, or, being an Irish citizen, outside the State &mdash; anywhere in the world, to cause an explosion of a kind likely to have the effects set out in the section.  Section 3 as re-enacted, deals with the analogous situation of acts preliminary to the causing of an explosion.  It deals with doing an act with intent to cause, or conspiracy to cause, an explosion. Again, it covers persons who in the State, or being Irish citizens outside the State, conspire to cause explosions within the State or elsewhere or have in their possession or under their control explosive substances with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property in the State or elsewhere. These offences are then declared to be scheduled offences for the purposes of the Act.</P>
      <P>The opportunity was taken to restate the 1883 Act, because of course when it was passed there was only one parliament for these two islands.  Section 3 of the 1883 Act, relating to the doing of an act preparatory to the causing of an explosion, made it an offence for any person in the British dominions or a British subject outside those dominions to do any act with intent to cause an explosion of a kind likely to endanger life or damage property in the United Kingdom or to make or possess explosive substances for that purpose.  It was necessary to re-enact that section to take account of the present-day circumstances. The application of the section in British law was restricted by the British Nationality Act, 1948, so as to make the reference to British subjects apply only to citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies and the reference to the British dominions apply only to the United Kingdom and the colonies, but that did not affect the application of the law here.</P>
      <P>As I say, it is necessary to restate the law in modern terms having regard to the present constitutional position in these islands so that the offence will now affect persons who in the State, or being Irish citizens outside the State, conspire to cause an explosion in the State or elsewhere. It covers an Irish citizen abroad conspiring to cause an explosion outside the State in the same way that section 2, of the 1883 Act, as to be re-enacted, makes it an offence for a person in the State, or being an Irish citizen outside the State, to cause an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury to property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are serious offences and they are made scheduled offences, so that they become extra-territorial.  I am sure nobody will deny the need for tightening the law with regard to the use of explosives, the law with regard to conspiracy and the law with regard to possession of explosives in the context of these two islands.  It is important that we should be seen in this parliament to be prepared to make <Col N="1049" /> extra-territorial provisions to deal with bombers not merely in Northern Ireland but in England, because to describe those crimes as reprehensible is not to describe them adequately since they deny all the canons of civilisation. They do immense harm to the well-being of the Irish people. Consequently the sections as now drafted cover the case of explosions being caused in Great Britain as well as in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I wish to state that the phrase in the motion &ldquo;State and semi-State bodies&rdquo; has no precise legal meaning so far as I am aware.  The party sponsoring the motion have indicated to the Office that it is not intended that this motion should cover Departments of State and I have decided accordingly.  It has been necessary for me to take a decision on this matter in order to decide whether Deputy Dowling's claim to raise purchases made by the Department of Defence on the Adjournment this evening should be allowed.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to ensure the use of the purchasing power of State and semi-State bodies including the Irish Life Assurance Co. Ltd. to support Irish industry at this time of serious economic crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You, sir, are ruling that we are prohibited from discussing Government Departments.  If you look at the wording of the motion you will see it does not specifically mention semi-State bodies.  It also mentions the failure of the Government to ensure that the purchasing power of State and semi-State bodies would be used to support Irish industry.  Therefore, I am not sure why you are prohibiting this debate, if it should do so, from being expanded to cover semi-State bodies. Would you clarify that for me, because evidently it has a bearing on a <Col N="1050" /> question to be raised on the Adjournment at a later stage?  I cannot give any undertaking that we can confine ourselves strictly to semi-State bodies and it is important &mdash; I cannot give any undertaking for Members of my party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Deputy and his colleagues.  If the motion takes into account Departments of State as well as semi-State bodies, then Deputy Dowling's motion would be anticipatory and I could not allow it.

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> We have been endeavouring to get this matter raised in the House for some time and on each occasion we were ruled out of order, by you on one occasion and then by the <Col N="1051" /> Minister for Finance and the Government last Wednesday.  It is a matter of vital importance, of interest to people in all walks of life, particularly in the disastrous economic situation we find ourselves in.  We want to highlight the facts about manufacturing orders such as that of Irish Life.  In other semi-State bodies, and probably Government Departments, there has been failure of Ministers to ensure that the purchasing power of our organisations and Departments are not failing in the matter of the purchase of Irish manufactured goods.</P>
      <P>In the present economic situation our manufacturers are meeting strong competition in export markets abroad and now at home as well and it is of practical importance that if we are to recover from this economic recession every person in the country will make his and her contribution.  One of the most important ways of helping the nation is by purchasing Irish manufactured goods where at all possible.  We believe that in this situation there is a special obligation on State and semi-State bodies to ensure that the purchasing power of their organisations is channelled towards the purchase of Irish goods.</P>
      <P>State and semi-State bodies have a vital role to play in these difficult times.  We have heard of substantial orders which were placed abroad which should have been placed with Irish manufacturers and the Minister in charge of each Department must be held responsible for the purchases within his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I first highlighted the purchasing of furniture by Irish Life on 11th December last it was common knowledge among Irish furniture manufacturers that this order would be placed abroad.  What they did not know until the contract was practically signed was the name of the firm of contractors it was being placed with.  However, the majority of manufacturers here, as far back as September or October, as well as many trade union leaders, notified various Ministers that there was every likelihood this order would not be placed with an Irish manufacturer.  The <Col N="1052" /> majority of Irish manufacturers were very keen to obtain a substantial order such as this.</P>
    <P>We all knew that the offices of Irish Life would be one of the largest to be built in this country and that a substantial amount of furniture would be required.  Everybody was keenly interested that the contract would be laid here.  We saw a photograph in one of the newspapers of the Minister for Local Government laying the foundation stone, but the facts are that none of the manufacturing companies here succeeded in getting even a contract form.  We are aware that the architects for this office block, Robinson, Keefe and Devane, were the people charged with drawing the plans.  They in turn employed Organised Office Designs, an English company, on the purchasing requirements of the furniture.  When Irish manufacturers approached Irish Life very early they were informed that they would have to communicate with the London office of Organised Office Designs if they were interested in submitting tenders or even in getting specification forms.  My information is that several manufacturers in this city and in other parts of the country made continuous efforts to get a specification in order to find out what exactly was required so that they would know whether or not they were in a position to supply this furniture. Every effort proved abortive.  They could not get a specification form from the London office.  I know one or two eventually succeeded, but the majority failed.  I am told this was brought to the Minister's attention. It was certainly brought to the attention of the Minister for Local Government because a company in Navan, running as a co-operative, were keenly interested and were hoping to get at least part of the order. They approached the Minister for Local Government in October and the Minister informed them there would certainly be no problem about their getting a contract form.  That would at least put them in a position to tender.  What has aggrieved the majority of furniture manufacturers is the fact they were completely ignored.  They were given no opportunity <Col N="1053" /> of tendering.  That was brought to the attention of the Minister for Local Government and also to the attention of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I raised the matter here on 11th December last.  That was the first opportunity I got to inform the House that this contract was about to leave the country.  I had been told by the furniture manufacturers about a fortnight before that that the contract had certainly gone and it was a matter of trying to find out to what company it had gone.  At column 1449 of Volume 286 of the Official Report I said, speaking on the Industrial Development (No. 2) Bill:</P>
    <P>A number of office blocks are being built in this city and I sincerely hope Irish furniture will be put into them, particularly those under the control of the Minister for Finance.  I am not including the Board of Works because most of the furniture provided by them is made by Irish firms, but an insurance company are building massive offices in Abbey Street and the biggest part of the shareholding in that company is owned by the Minister for Finance.  I understand that only a small portion of the furniture is to be supplied by Irish firms.  That is a shame.  A foreign designer was appointed.  He went to a manufacturer whom I know who supplies the Board of Works and Dublin Castle and this man told this manufacturer that his stuff was not of the quality necessary for these Irish offices, the greater part of whose shares are held by the Minister for Finance.  I submit that 100 per cent of the furniture going into those offices should be Irish manufacture.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce intervened and said:</P>
    <P>Through the Chair, I can assure the Deputy that I have already made my recommendations but under the Accession Treaty I have no legal power and neither has the Minister for Finance to impose those conditions.</P>
    <P>I submit that neither the Minister for Finance nor the Minister for Industry and Commerce made any positive recommendations to Irish Life as to where this contract should be placed. <Col N="1054" /> The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that, under the Accession Treaty, he was prohibited.  My information is that a contract of this size does not come within the ambit of being tendered for in EEC countries. If it did then Irish Life would have broken EEC regulations.  This particular contract was not published.  It was not put out for public tender.  It never appeared in the daily Press.  I submit that on 11th December last the Minister should have known, and even before that, that this order was about to go outside the country.  The contract was signed on 18th December.  I cannot understand why the Minister in the intervening period, and in the light of the representations made months previously, did not take positive steps to ensure this order was placed with Irish manufacturers.  I doubt very much if the Minister ever informed Irish Life of his desire to have this contract placed with Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>On 11th December, the day on which I raised the matter here, the Minister wrote a letter to Irish Life. If the tone of the letter is that published in <i>The Irish Independent</i> it would not in my opinion carry very much weight.  The letter was written by his Private Secretary.  I have not seen the letter and the Minister has not disclosed the contents of any letters to the House.  Neither have I seen any letters from Irish Life. According to <i>The Irish Independent:</i></P>
    <P>... Mr. Ryan told the company there was growing concern that the contract for the new modern furniture might go out of the country. It would be helpful, he added, if he could be informed of the Irish Life discussions on the proposed contract.</P>
    <P>The letter added:</P>
    <P>While the Minister has no wish to become involved, he is likely to be criticised and expected to justify the company's decision should the business go outside the country.</P>
    <P>In the present sensitive situation, therefore, I trust you will agree on the desirability of keeping us fully briefed on developments.</P>
    <P>All that letter indicates is a fear on <Col N="1055" /> the part of the Minister that he might be criticised.  There is nothing about any loss suffered by Irish furniture manufacturers.  I am not personally concerned whether the Minister is or is not criticised or what his political status is, but alarm about criticism is the only indication that letter gives me.  The Minister should have said in that letter that he knew the contract was going outside the country and before the contract was signed he should have seen it.  The Minister put no proper directive into the letter to make Irish Life change their decision. Subsequently the Minister changed his mind about 5th December when the contract had gone.  That was too late.  Had he taken the advice given to him here on 11th November and wrote then the letter he wrote on 5th January the position would be different today.  It is quite obvious the Minister did not take the matter seriously initially.  It is unfortunate that this situation should have arisen at a time when we know furniture manufacturers and others are going through a most difficult period.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and semi-State bodies should buy Irish goods and by their example encourage the private citizen to buy Irish.  We expect a lead from the Minister and the semi-State bodies.  One of the mistakes made was the appointment of a foreign furniture designer.  A new look will have to be taken at the purchasing by semi-State organisations to see if they can be encouraged to buy Irish.</P>
    <P>The Design Workshop, under the control of the Office of Public Works, was set up a number of years ago to design furniture for Government Departments and semi-State companies. They are still in operation today, but not on a very large scale. The workshop should be expanded, designers employed and the entire requirements of both State and semi-State bodies should be channelled towards that workshop.  I do not mean that the furniture should be manufactured there, but the necessary designs should be sent through the workshop in Inchicore and the designs could <Col N="1056" /> then be submitted to various manufacturers throughout the country. They would know what type of design would be most suitable to Irish conditions.</P>
    <P>I am informed that it would be very difficult for Irish manufacturers to carry out many of the specifications mentioned on the contract form sent by Office Design.  Naturally Office Design are taking continental manufactures into consideration.  I wonder were the capabilities of Irish manufactures taken into consideration when the specification was drawn up? I understand that very little thought was given to the potential of Irish manufacturers and how they would be able to avail of that specification.</P>
    <P>If something is not done about this situation, it will happen again in other semi-State bodies.  Almost all the furniture used in this House and in Government offices and Departments was designed by the workshop.  But the workshop could be used to a far greater degree.  As I said, it should be expanded and the entire requirements of State and semi-State bodies could be channelled into this organisation. In turn, the workshop could send out contracts for the various Departments. This is one way of trying to help the furniture industry because if things continue as at present there is no doubt that 90 per cent of these industries will go to the wall.</P>
    <P>Forty or 50 per cent of the furniture purchased in this country is made by foreign manufacturers.  Semi-State bodies which have sent their orders abroad over the past number of years must realise that they have an obligation to our manufacturers.  They must also realise that these companies employ Irish people and operate with Irish finance.  They have an obligation to ensure that their orders are channelled into these companies.  I am not trying to defend bad workmanship.  I want to make that clear.  There are two sides to every story.  Quality, presentation and design are very important. An undertaking should be given that State and semi-State bodies will channel their orders to these companies. The Minister should take a look at this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> It is unfortunate that Irish Life were mishandled.  The Minister seemed to think that he was held responsible for the handling of this operation.  I believe he was fully responsible for the loss of this order.  I blame him and other Government Ministers for not taking positive steps in time.  Nobody in this country knew that this contract had gone abroad, except the Minister, who knew about it as far back as 18th December.  No public statement was made by his or any other Government Department. I made a statement to a newspaper on 9th January informing the people that the contract had gone abroad. In all fairness I must say that Senator Michael Mullen told the Minister about it earlier.  I must give him credit for that.  The one person I cannot give credit to is Senator Halligan.  He knew about it back in October but we did not hear anything from him until we made it public. If we had not made it public the Minister undoubtedly would have cloaked this operation again.  That is the type of hypocrisy we have had over the last two years from this Government.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister tried to justify his actions by saying it was a matter for Irish Life and that they were completely responsible.  The Minister made a statement that he was in close contact with the board of Irish Life long before this matter was raised in this House.  The board indicated that this was not so.  Both cannot be right. Either the Minister or the board is misleading this House.  I take the view that the board are right.  If the Minister can prove to this House that he had been in close consultation with Irish Life before this matter was raised, he is obliged to prove it to everybody's satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know the Minister prevented Irish Life from putting their case to the public.  They had advertising space purchased in the national daily papers.  They were told by the Minister not to make any statements on <Col N="1058" /> this matter.  Confusion has now arisen as to whether Irish Life or the Minister is telling the truth.  I say that the Minister had to apologise to Irish Life in regard to contradicting their statements.  I further say that the Minister rang Irish Life on 21st January apologising for this matter. If the Minister wants to contradict that, that is all right but I am standing over that statement.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I hope the Minister will mention the phone call he made on January 21st and let us know what he actually said on that day.  From that phone call we might see if it is Irish Life or the Minister for Finance who is right.  It is unfair that the Minister should try to transfer the entire blame for the whole operation to the board of Irish Life.  Several Ministers and some Senators, such as Senator Halligan, have been calling for the dismissal of the board.  If Senator Halligan calls for the dismissal of the board, obviously he should also call for the dismissal of the person responsible with the board, the Minister for Finance.  It is not good enough for the Minister to move away from his obligations in such a matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt now if this order will be placed with any Irish manufacturer <Col N="1059" /> and I should like to know when the Minister replies what decision.  Irish Life has made.  Will it be possible for these goods to be manufactured in this country?  Will Irish Life have to pay a penalty if this is so?  These factors are very relevant.  If we cannot save this particular order at least this debate will highlight the fact that we cannot continue to allow a large proportion of our requirements, especially in the case of State and semi-State bodies, to go outside the country. The Minister and Ministers of other Departments will have to ensure that their requirements are purchased in this country if at all possible.  I know certain goods are not manufactured in this country and it will be necessary to import them, but if we are to get out of this grave economic crisis in which we now find ourselves and create jobs for 120,000 people now unemployed we shall have to take positive steps.  Surely one of the most positive steps and one which various Ministers are in a position to take is to instruct Government Departments regarding the purchase of Irish goods. Has the Minister seen that proper directives have been given that Irish goods be purchased by all Government and semi-State bodies?</P>
    <P>The IDA were fully aware that this contract was going outside the country and this is a fact that I cannot understand.  They had discussions with Irish Life architects on the matter in October last.  They had consultations with office designers.  Córas Tráchtála were also aware there was every danger that this order would leave the country.  Is it that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance are so far removed from realities and from the running of their Departments that they are not aware of what is going on?  It has been publicly stated by IDA and it has been intimated by Córas Tráchtála that they were aware of these facts but the Minister who should be responsible did not have sufficient interest in the purchasing of these goods to know these facts.  It seems an intolerable situation.  The IDA have promoted Irish industry&mdash;<Col N="1060" /> a considerable amount of capital has been given to Irish manufacturers through IDA in an effort to help these industries &mdash; and it is very disturbing that the Minister could allow these things to happen and know nothing about them.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This debate will highlight the fact that semi-State bodies have obligations as to what they should do as regards contracts they are in a position to offer.  I believe that if the Minister had acted when we informed him of the situation in the House and had taken positive steps at that time, by giving the proper instructions to Irish Life, they would have abided by them.  But they were not aware that the Minister was keenly concerned because the Minister had failed to communicate with them in a proper way.  If he had sent a proper letter directing Irish Life that the contract should be placed with Irish manufacturers I believe Irish Life would have abided by that instruction, but the Minister failed to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with everything Deputy Fitzpatrick has said in regard to this matter.  I also agree that there is no point in blaming the board of Irish Life or in trying to put the blame on anybody else.  There was no point in telephoning the manager of Irish Life and telling him in simple language to shut up, not to make any statements to the Press and that the Minister was giving that order.  The Minister said this and on his shoulders and on the shoulders of the Government must rest the responsibility simply because the Government own 90 per cent of the shares of Irish Life. Since the State owns 90 per cent of the shares in Irish Life the Minister must accept responsibility for the affairs of that company.  Consequently, he must be held responsible for the loss of the amount of money involved &mdash;about £200,000&mdash;to Irish workers. We may take it that wages would have constituted about 60 per cent of that amount.  Is it any wonder that the Minister had such a deficit to cope <Col N="1061" /> with in his budget?  Because of the brutal increases in taxation imposed last week by the Minister about 60 per cent by way of income tax, VAT and all the other taxes would have gone back to the Exchequer from the estimated £120,000 which would have accrued to workers had this contract been given to an Irish firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to a telephone call made by the Minister to a director of Irish Life on January 21st.  The Minister had not the decency to write a letter of apology to the man.  He would not wish to have such a letter published under his name, whereas in relation to the telephone call he may, if he wishes, deny in the House that any such call was made by him.  As Minister for Finance, the Minister is responsible for the expenditure of all Departments of Government. Can he give us any explanation for allowing tenders for the supply of fibreglass roofs and aluminium window frames for community schools in Cork, Limerick and elsewhere to go to English firms?  In respect of the roofing the amount involved is in the region of £240,000.  A firm in Carlow contracted for this work but they were amazed to find that the design consultants concerned were from the UK and that not alone were these people appointed to design but also to select the tenders.  It is hardly surprising that the company they selected were from the UK also.  Of the seven Irish firms who submitted tenders two were regarded as suitable but they were not called in to be given a full explanation of the position as was the case in so far as the UK firms were concerned.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was reported in <i>The Nationalist and Leinster Times</i> a week ago as having said that because of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain the contract had to go to the English firm even allowing for the variation clause of 16 per cent. In this context I would remind Government Ministers that in 1966 the British Government imposed a 15 per cent levy on all imports into their country.  On hearing this the then Fianna Fáil Government informed the British that they were breaking the free trade area agreement but the <Col N="1062" /> reply was to the effect that this levy was to apply to all countries irrespective of any individual agreements which might be in existence.  The then Minister for Finance, Deputy J. Lynch, immediately supported the Irish exporters by granting them 15 per cent to compensate for the import tariff.  Therefore, since the British saw fit to break the agreement to help their country's economic difficulties there can hardly be any reason why we, with more than 117,000 unemployed, could not have accepted a tender from Irish contractors even if it was a little greater than the 16 per cent variation clause.</P>
    <P>The kind of replies trotted out by Ministers in regard to these matters would indicate that they have no regard for the intelligence of the Irish people.  The other day we read in the papers that the contract for an Irish-English dictionary is going to Hong Kong.  I trust the Minister will refer to this in his reply.  As Deputy Fitzgerald said on television the other evening more conduct of this kind will be brought to the notice of the Minister in the coming weeks.  There is not the opportunity tonight to go into details of all the cases that have come to our notice.  Suffice it for the moment to draw attention to the fibreglass industry.  My sympathy lies with the firm in Carlow who were one of the contractors for the work in the community schools.  Is the Minister for Education satisfied that the materials being supplied from the UK are equal to those produced by trusted Irish workers and management? We ask the Minister to bring all these matters to the attention of his colleagues in Government who appear to be living in cloud-cuckooland.</P>
    <P>During the budget debate Deputy J. Lynch asked rightly why the Taoiseach has not seen fit to sack three or four Ministers.  Why, for instance, has the Minister for Finance not been sacked or, alternatively, why has he not resigned in view of the mess he made of the Irish Life case?  Apart from that situation, there is the very serious matter of the mess he made of the economy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall endeavour to do that.  The motion deals with State and semi-State business.  I am concerned in particular about the matter of the firm in Carlow who are engaged in the production of fibreglass. This is a new industry and if they had got this contract they planned to extend, to build new industry on the Dublin Road from Carlow.  They had arrangements made to employ a further six people.  These people, married or single, are now and will be on the unemployment register. This is not their fault, but it is the fault of two Ministers of this Government, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education.  This is a terrible situation.  We have all the plans about &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; and yet the Government &mdash; the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach &mdash; are the people who are buying foreign goods and giving contracts to foreign firms at a time like this.  If the contract price from a UK or any firm was 20 per cent lower than that at which an Irish firm could do the job, then during this economic recession the Government have brought about, the Irish firm should get the contract. Apart from the jobs that are lost, money is going out of the country and this affects our balance of payment. We have £250,000 going one way and £250,000 going the other. The balance of payments situation alone should influence the Government to give these contracts to Irish firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were in Government and the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was Deputy Joe Brennan, there was a contract for the supply of material for something in the region of £200,000.  A contract received from an outside firm was lower than that of the nearest tender of an Irish firm.  When the officials of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs presented the then Minister with the contract document and he found that this contract was going to a foreign firm, he told his advisers, members of the civil service: &ldquo;Take that back; readvertise it, and I will <Col N="1064" /> have another look at it and see if we can get an Irish firm to do the job.&rdquo; An Irish firm did get the job.  That firm today is going very well and has 700 people employed.  That is the type of action we would expect from some of the Ministers of the present Government. I know it was queried by the Auditor-General, but when the position was explained it was easy to realise that when the Irish firm got the work the money remained in the country and people here were employed, and so the Exchequer gained by that.  The goods supplied were as good as, if not better than, anything that could come from abroad.  I have no hesitation in putting this on the record and Deputies can, if they wish, ask a parliamentary question about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education have now been taken to task over these contracts, the one for Irish Life being the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and the one for community schools in Cork, Limerick, Dublin, and elsewhere that of the Minister for Education. If they had given those contracts to Irish firms, even when they were 16 to 20 per cent over and above the amount of the contracts of firms in the UK and elsewhere, I do not think any Member of this House, or any person in this country would say anything except congratulate the Ministers, particularly because of the financial position of the country.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister for Finance standing up here tonight, or tomorrow, or any other time, and saying to this House: &ldquo;Right.  I am not responsible.&rdquo;  He is solely responsible for what happened in the Irish Life contract.  He must bear that responsibility, and if he is man enough he should resign because of the mistakes he made.  It is terrible to read where Irish Life had this advertisement ready to explain their position to the Irish public, and the Minister said: &ldquo;No, you do not.&rdquo;  This is like saying: &ldquo;Shut up.  I will deal with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How are the people in management in this country, particularly in the semi-State bodies, or even in State bodies or Departments, going to defend themselves when Ministers will <Col N="1065" /> not allow the people to make a statement? The Minister had not even the courtesy to write, instead of picking up a telephone and apologising.  As Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick and I said, he would not do that because somebody could slip a photostat out of the file of the letter received.</P>
    <P>In the short time I have left, I should like to put on the record that it has been said that because we are members of the EEC some people might believe that we could not give the contract to an Irish firm.  I presume that the Minister must know, because he was a member of the European Parliament before he became a Minister, that he need not even go to Brussels.  All he had to do was pick up a telephone.  Because of the present financial situation in this country, the Commission in Brussels or the Council of Ministers would give him permission to give this contract to an Irish firm.  There is no doubt about that.  That is written into the protocol of the Treaty of Accession and there is a copy in the Library for anyone to see.  I recall an incident where a person in Brussels said: &ldquo;You never saw a European inspector in Ireland yet, did you?&rdquo;  I believe they would not worry about the contract, particularly because of the inflation in this country at the moment.</P>
    <P>At the Carlow County Council meeting yesterday, where I was present, a resolution was passed condemning the Minister for Education for giving these contracts to firms outside the country when so many people here were unemployed. I want to compliment one of the Labour councillors who supported and voted for the proposition condemning the Minister.  I read in the <i>Carlow Nationalist</i> where another Labour county councillor made a statement that he was considering withdrawing support from the Government because of their complete failure in everything, not alone in this but also in regard to the budget and other things. Why do the Ministers not listen to the public?  Why have they gone up into the stars, smiling, snarling, aggressive and arrogant?  Why will they not listen to the county councils, the trade union movement, to management, to what has <Col N="1066" /> been said from the benches here, the front bench of Fianna Fáil for the past three years?  All this is leading up to a collapse far worse than the collapse of the Coalition Government of 1957.  We had the collapse of the first and second Coalition Government, but in view of what is now happening there is no doubt in my mind that the financial situation and the employment situation will be far worse than it was in 1957.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wondered for some time whether the Opposition were sincere in their protestations in relation to what occurred in respect of the Irish Life furniture contract.  Now I know.  Tonight they have displayed a total lack of concern for Irish exporters.  They have helped the campaign which is now fermenting in Britain suggesting that in Ireland there is an official policy to boycott British goods.  They are making it more difficult than ever for Irish exporters to sell in Britain and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The realities of the situation are entirely different from anything which has been suggested tonight by people whose utterances have shown that their only concern &mdash; I will not say their prior concern &mdash; is to damage the economic interests of this country hoping, as a consequence, that on the misery they help to generate they will get some political advantage.  I want to give the facts to the House, which may embarrass members of the Opposition and may also embarrass some of the people who quite clearly have been supplying them with false information.  The question will then arise as to the <i>bona fides</i> of certain suppliers of information to the Fianna Fáil Opposition, assuming that they are uttering correctly what has been passed on to them and that, in itself, may be in doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal first of all with the question which has been dealt with at length about the manner in which the State purchases goods.  The purchase of goods and equipment used by Government Departments is mainly the responsibility of three offices, the Post Office Stores, the Office of Public Works and the Stationery Office which are known as the central purchasing departments.  All purchasing by Government Departments <Col N="1067" /> is governed by rules of procedure which are laid down and supervised by the Government Contracts Committee.  The procedures are designed specifically to ensure that contracts are awarded in an equitable manner and that public money is spent in a way which will ensure that, taking all relevant factors into consideration, the purchasing departments will get the best available value for public money.</P>
    <P>There is no question whatever, as one Deputy who put his name to this motion must know, but that Government contract rules ensure full consideration for Irish manufacturers.  In fact, in the latest 12-month period the Stationery Office, for which I have responsibility, purchased 97 per cent of their requirements from Irish manufacturers. In that period the value of all contracts placed abroad by the central purchasing department, where an Irish tender was received, was less than 3 per cent of the value of all such contracts.  Even where Irish tenderers were not able to tender to the minimum specifications necessary, or where in the case of some high technology goods in the telecommunications field there was no Irish firm to tender, efforts are made to improve native capacity, and efforts in this direction have been highly successful, with the result that we have now generated very worthwhile jobs in this field.</P>
    <P>The situation in relation to Irish Life is not as it is described by the Rip Van Winkles of the Fianna Fáil Party whose contacts alerted them to a possibility on 11th December, on the admission of Deputy Fitzpatrick, that furniture might be brought from abroad to furnish the new Irish Life office.  On 20th October, Deputy P. J. Reynolds from Leitrim brought this matter to my notice.  Immediately my Department contacted the Irish Life Assurance Company and, following what the company said, they contacted the IDA and Fóir Teoranta.  We were informed at that time by the management of the Irish Life Assurance Company that the question of the purchase of furniture for the new office <Col N="1068" /> was &ldquo;by no means settled&rdquo;.  There were explanations about technical problems.  Accounts were given of inquiries which had been made in the Irish furniture industry.  Information was supplied about consultations with the IDA.  Following on that information, my Department engaged in detailed consultation with the State agencies, the IDA and Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>In November, further representations were made by my Department on my instructions to the Irish Life Assurance Company for the second time impressing upon them the concern of the Government and myself that Irish furniture manufacturers would be given the opportunity of supplying the furniture for the new head office.  This is confirmed by a letter dated 26th November and received on 2nd December from the Irish Life Assurance Company saying that the matter was still under consideration and no order had been placed.  It was not until 30th December, when we had received a letter from the company saying it had been decided to accept the recommendation of their building committee that, again on my instructions, my Department specifically asked the Irish Life Assurance Company to say what was the recommendation of this committee. It was then, and only then, that the Irish Life Assurance Company disclosed that, in fact, they had been less than frank with me in describing the full position in relation to the purchase of furniture for their new head office.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is the holder of 90 per cent of the shares in the Irish Life Assurance Company. That does not give him power to direct the company.  The management of the company is vested in the board of the company, and not in the Minister for Finance, and not in any of the shareholders.  The State's financial involvement in the Irish Life Assurance Company is minimal compared with the financial investment of the policy holders.  The State's investment is fractional compared with the £200 million or thereabouts of the policy holders' money.  The State's investment nominally is worth about £200,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> I just mention that because I hope that, even if we cannot expect objectivity from the Opposition, at least the people will understand that, unlike many other State-sponsored bodies, the Irish Life Assurance Company are a body in which the State holds a partial interest only.  There are other shareholders.  I think they are about 60 in number.  The Minister for Finance has not got the power to direct the board in a particular matter, or to interfere in their day-to-day operations.  Nevertheless, most people consider and rightly consider that when the Minister for Finance is the major shareholder in the company indicated, and makes representations that the public interest would be served by placing the order with Irish manufacturers of furniture, adequate weight should be given to his representation.  Most people must be perturbed that such weight was not given to his representations and, indeed, the Minister was not informed when he first made representations in response to an approach made to him by Deputy Reynolds that decisions had already been taken at that time to give the order where the order subsequently went&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On Tuesday, 14th October, 1975, the board of the company considered a memorandum from the building committee recommending that a particular firm be chosen for the new chief office complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

      <P>On the 14th October. The board expressed strong views to the effect that they would prefer to see Irish-manufactured furniture used if at all possible, while recognising that the Buerolandschaft concept applied to all categories of staff introduced new dimensions to the Irish scene.  The Buerolandschaft concept is a concept in relation to the designing and placing of furniture. The board on that date authorised the building committee to take a final decision in the light of its declared criteria.  The building committee made its decision at a meeting which was held on Tuesday, 21st October, and on the following day they notified the architects that the company had decided to accept the recommendation that the firm that ultimately got the contract be given it.</P>
      <P>It is not a pleasant thing &mdash; that is putting it very mildly &mdash; to have to reveal to the public that a body in which the Minister for Finance, as representative of the State interest, has a major shareholding, should have been less than frank in its communications after urgent representations were made to reflect the Government's concern that a particular contract should be placed in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions have been made that I, as Minister for Finance, gave a direction to the company to suppress a certain advertisement on the 21st January.  First of all, as I have already said, I have no power to direct; I have power to make representations. We still remain a free society.  I made representations in October which were not heeded.  I sought information and was not given that information.  But I expressed on behalf of the Irish people our annoyance that that should have been so.  As soon as that sorry situation came to light, it is not surprising that when I made representations <Col N="1071" /> on 21st January, those who had been found wanting in their disposition towards the Government of the country and had been publicly embarrassed because they were found so wanting, should have paid heed to the representations I made on that date. I saw the draft advertisement which was proposed to be published.  It was a serious and unjustified libel on the Irish furniture-manufacturing industry, and it would not have been conducive to a proper resolution of these difficulties had that advertisement appeared.  That was my opinion and I expressed it.  It is fortunate that at least belatedly my views were accepted and acted upon.</P>
    <P>While there is a natural annoyance at what has occurred in relation to this aspect of the affairs of Irish Life, it would be very wrong if the company were to be distracted or harmed by a witchhunt in respect of a mistaken decision that was made by the management of the organisation in question in relation to a very small part of the Abbey Street development. The Irish Life Assurance Company caters for over 50 per cent of the Irish life insurance industry.  Its annual premiums amount to about £32 million, and of that 10 per cent comes from abroad.  It would be wrong to be chauvinistic about the activities and the objectives of the Irish Life Assurance Company.  In common with other Irish concerns it has to face in these days growing competition because this country decided to enter the European Economic Community and, in so deciding, exposed Irish Life and other Irish enterprises to competition from abroad. The best way in which that competition can be faced is by going out and meeting it, and Irish Life have been doing that successfully.  It is significant that, notwithstanding all the political difficulties and sales difficulties arising out of the turbulence in Northern Ireland, Irish Life has been able to make a substantial inroad in the British insurance market, so that 10 per cent of its business now comes from abroad and most of it from Britain.</P>
    <P>In that situation it ill behoves anybody <Col N="1072" /> to be raising his voice here in such a way as to lead the popular press in Britain to present headlines and articles and views which suggest that there is in Ireland some anti-British campaign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The nonsense may be there but the publicity is real. Representations have been made to Córas Tráchtála, to the IDA, to individual Departments of State, to the Irish Life Assurance Company, pleading for an end to this most damaging public assault on the furniture decision of the Irish Life Assurance Company which is being interpreted abroad as a public demand in Ireland that there be a boycott of all goods from Britain.</P>
      <P>The British trade unions have taken note of the protests being made in this area.  British purchasers of Irish goods, including British purchasers of Irish furniture have taken note of what they regard as hostile chauvinistic attitudes.  I know that the complaints uttered here are not of that nature but we would be foolish indeed if we did not open our eyes to the possibility &mdash; it is more than a possibility &mdash; that other people might see criticism of the Irish Life decision in a somewhat different light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worthy of note also that the company chosen by the management of Irish Life for the production of furniture &mdash; I do not defend the decision of Irish Life &mdash; have themselves used a considerable amount of Irish produced materials and there are at least three Irish manufacturing firms who produce furnishing materials who have contracts with the firm in question.  Irish goods from the Irish furniture industry and allied trades are now featured in furniture manufactured by the firm in question. Furniture containing Irish materials is now being used by British State-owned concerns and public authorities <Col N="1073" /> like British Airways, British Rail, and London Underground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important in looking at this that we would consider why semi-State bodies were established at all.  They were established because Oireachtas Éireann considered it desirable to give certain independence to the bodies in question in pursuit of their day-to-day activities.  Deep resentment has been expressed on many occasions about ministerial interference with the autonomy of semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>We will have before us for consideration in the near future a motion to consider the establishment of a parliamentary committee to examine the operations of semi-State commercial bodies, but there is no proposal that examination of the operational results of companies should get down to empowering parliamentarians to direct companies to make their purchases in a particular place and nowhere else. I assume that Deputies opposite, and the critics, would not wish to have all semi-State bodies abolished.  Maybe I am wrong.  Perhaps they would like to see them all run by Ministers with the aid of the civil service.  Perhaps they feel that would be the cure which would avoid developments of the kind which recently occurred in Irish Life. But the cure could well be worse than the disease.  My principal objective ever since Deputy Reynolds brought this to my attention in October&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds did raise the matter.  Deputy MacSharry did not.  It is not a function of the Minister for Finance or any Minister to have day-to-day investigation of <Col N="1074" /> every activity of every company. If he tried to do that he would not be serving the nation's interests.  The Oireachtas created semi-State bodies with authority to manage their own affairs to attain certain objectives.  I am satisfied that the Irish Life Assurance Company by and large serve Irish public interests and serve them well, far better indeed than many assurance operators in Ireland.  More than 80 per cent of Irish Life's total resources are invested in Ireland, a record of which any company can be proud.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied also that the Irish Life Company are conscious of their obligations to the country from which they draw most of their revenue, and they have by and large discharged that obligation properly and generously over the years.  However, on this occasion in relation to the furniture contract, I believe they were lacking in sensitivity, and that is putting it mildly.  They were certainly lacking in that degree of frankness which ought to have existed on the part of a semi-State or quasi-State organisation towards a Minister when representations were made on a matter affecting the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern about all this sorry affair has been to try to bring about a situation in which maximum employment opportunities would be given to the Irish furniture manufacturing industry, and that is why, although I have known of the way in which vital information was withheld from me before now, I have not made a public issue of it because my anxiety has been to cool the situation so that the board and the management of the company and the people with whom a legal contract had been placed would have an opportunity to consider the widespread public indignation about the manner in which this whole thing was handled.  Because the motion by the Opposition tonight seeks to censure the Government and the Government alone, and because the Government's record was being put to the test, and because I believe in being frank with Dáil Éireann as I believe other people should be with Ministers of State when they have <Col N="1075" /> responsibility towards Ministers who represent the public good, I thought it necessary to reveal the failure to communicate by Irish Life which, to put it mildly, saddens me and disgusts me, and I am sure disgusts most people &mdash; that an organisation as responsible as the Irish Life Company should have failed adequately to communicate with the Minister what the true facts of the situation were.</P>
