    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of occasions since his appointment in March, 1973, that he visited Áras an Uachtaráin for the purposes of carrying out his duty under Article 28. 5.2 of the Constitution during the pesidencies of the late Éamon de Valera, the late Erskine H. Childers and Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Pursuant to Article 28. 5 2 of the Constitution, I visited President de Valera once, President Childers five times and President Ó Dálaigh four times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider that that rather scanty number of visits for that purpose suffices to comply with his duty under Article 28. 5. 2 of the Constitution in view of the fact that the period in question was approximately three years and eight months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, there is not any specific requirement in the Constitution obliging visits to the President.  The Article states that the Taoiseach shall keep the President generally informed of matters of domestic and international policy.  There is not any specific requirement that that has to be done by means of a visit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach tell the House if these visits were specifically for the purpose of complying <Col N="430" /> with his duty under Article 28. 5. 2 or were the visits at least partially for other purposes?  For example, were they for the purpose of accompanying judges on their appointment or accompanying ambassadors or for other such reasons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I excluded all other visits in the reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Were these visits specifically for this purpose alone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They were specifically excluding other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach please explain what that means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It means what it says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect to the Taoiseach, it scarcely seems to say anything at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have told the Deputy, there is no requirement that a visit should be made.  The Deputy has introduced visits for other purposes. In fact, on looking back through the visits of my predecessor in the 15 months from 1972 to the first quarter of 1973 he visited the then President on four occasions. There does not appear to be a great variation in the number of visits as distinct from attendance on other occasions such as the appointment of judges and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Where did the Taoiseach get that statistic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>From the records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I kept no records of my visits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the office did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not know of every occasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, I am giving consideration to this.  The House will appreciate that when this practice was initiated a long time ago the method of informing the President on public matters was very limited compared with what it is nowadays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> It is possible that the idea of visits in the original concept is somewhat out of date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach discuss international and domestic policy with the three Presidents on the occasions of these visits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to disclose what I discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not open to the House, therefore, to come to the conclusion that the Taoiseach did not carry out his duty under Article 28.5.2?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no obligation to disclose to the House what I discussed.  I am sure that the Deputy on reflection will appreciate that it would be quite wrong for the Taoiseach to give an <i>ex parte</i> version of what was discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach in general terms if he discussed, in the words of the Constitution, matters of domestic and international policy with the three Presidents concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In general terms I complied with the constitutional requirement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In very general terms indeed.</P>

      <P>I am calling Question No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider amending the Constitution to abolish the Presidency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of the nomination to be presented to the Commission, I am simply asking the Taoiseach if this will be decided by the Government or by the Taoiseach himself and if the Government have already had any discussion on the matter or have come to any preliminary conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the notoriety it has received because of the Taoiseach's silence, may I ask the Taoiseach how many applicants have submitted their names for consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Taoiseach indicated to the President-elect, Dr. Hillery, well in advance that he was not being reappointed, and as other commissioners have already beeen appointed by other countries, will the Taoiseach ensure that this appointment is made immediately to stop this continuing public indignity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misinformed about other commissioners. So far there have been no formal decisions, with the exception of one or two cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been appointments in one or two cases.  The Taoiseach will appreciate that the Irish commissionership ends on 2nd December, some weeks in advance of the termination of the other commissionerships and, consequently, the Irish position should be filled in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach was most categorical that there were no Fianna Fáil candidates.  Will he tell the House if there was a Labour applicant?  That is a very civil question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the need for increasing home production of cereals and other tillage crops.  I have already taken steps to improve the present situation by launching a campaign for increased tillage in 1977 at the National Tillage Conference held in Kill, County Kildare recently.  This will be followed up by local conferences organised by the agricultural advisory services in co-operation with my Department and An Foras Talúntais.  I am also arranging for appropriate press publicity between now and the sowing season and I will use every other means open to me to impress on farmers the desirability of increasing cereals production.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not think it far more effective for the Minister, rather than making pious statements, indicate to the producers that they would obtain a good price for home produced barley?  The price of this when harvested was £63 a ton and the current price is about 20 to 25 per cent over that.  If the primary producers were given protection in the sale of grain it would be a far better inducement to them to grow more grain than pious speeches made by the Minister.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, when improved prices obtained in the dairying sector of the industry farmers turned over to grazing land and the acreage under tillage declined.  Fortunately there is a movement back again and the wheel is turning the other way.  We are expecting a much greater acreage now than we had last year.  The growing of grain has shown a steady increase in acreage over the last few years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Many farmers heeded the advice given some years ago to devote more to grasslands and the production of milk, so consequently the grain acreage declined. The Deputy should be aware of that. The Minister is engaged in a campaign to encourage farmers to grow more grain.  He has adverted to this on a number of occasions.  We want to encourage farmers to grow more grain, particularly more barely, and so obviate having to import large quantities of grain to meet our requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is plenty of information coming to the Department from the advisory services and so on.  We have got our finger on the pulse of the farming industry all the time; we are continually looking for information about it.  The Deputy should not laugh at that statement because he ignored such facts when he was Minister for Agriculture.  We are aware that the acreage is increasing and we are satisfied with the position. It is up to the individual farmer to decide whether it is better for him to grow an acre of barley or keep an additional cow.  While we speak of the advisability of providing more acreage for barley we do not stop farmers getting an additional cow if he thinks it will be more beneficial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that talking to people will not mean an increase in tillage.  The reason for the decrease in tillage was that it did not pay the farmers.  That was why farmers sold their ploughs.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in order to return to tillage a great injection of money is needed to purchase machinery?  There is not much point in talking about it; action is needed.  I can recall when potatoes were thrown on the side of the road.</P>

      <P>In so far as I am concerned, I have made it clear at the EEC council meetings that while we have sympathy with the Commission's objective of restoring equilibrium in the milk sector by 1980 our milk industry is still developing and we could not tolerate any setback now to our plans for the continued expansion of Irish dairy production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether he considers that the failure to secure a realistic devaluation of the Irish green £ means in effect that Irish producers are being deprived of the real price for their animals and that they are subsidising consumer prices, whereas consumers in Great Britain are subsidised to the tune of £1.50 million per day by the EEC itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent adjustment in the Irish green £, which resulted in a reduction of ten percentage points in the Irish MCA, was the sixth such adjustment since October, 1974.  The cumulative effect of these reductions has been to increase farm support prices in Ireland by 38 per cent and to reduce our MCAs by 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the significant adjustments which we have obtained, the level of Irish MCA remains persistently high. For this, among other reasons, I am supporting recent Commission proposals to modify the MCA system <Col N="448" /> by establishing limits on MCAs and automatic adjustment mechanisms. These proposals are along the lines of suggestions that I have repeatedly made in the council.</P>
    <P>The existence of MCAs undoubtedly reduces the value of Irish agricultural exports.  The MCA system has, however, on the other hand, helped to preserve the common price and intervention system in the face of huge currency fluctuations.</P>
    <P>The MCA charges on Irish exports are, in common with the charges on exports from the other depreciated member states and the charges on import in the appreciated member states, paid into Community funds.  The MCA subsidies payable on import in the depreciated member states&mdash;in-cluding Ireland&mdash;are paid from Community funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the disproportion between the real value of Irish sterling at present and the green currency is in the region of 25 per cent?  Does he not also agree that the Irish MCA at present is £7.61p per cwt?  Does he not further agree that the export taxes on Irish exports of cattle to the Continent will be between £90 and £100 per beast, that this is direct taxation on the Irish producer; and that the failure of the Government to come to a realistic devaluation of the green currency in order to avoid a rise in the cost of living which could be compensated by food subsidies is keeping down the production of foodstuffs on which we depend?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary say that there must be a total withdrawal of MCAs before there is any realistic effect?</P>

      <P>I most certainly do not agree with any such contention. I have here figures for slaughtering in the three years, 1974, 1975 and 1976, to the end of the first week of November in each year.  In 1974 the slaughterings were 838,785; in 1975, 1,154,185; and in 1976, 802,753.  Therefore the figures for 1974 and 1976 more or less coincide.  Everybody knows that the processing plants were, to use a term that is now used in some quarters, overworked in 1975, and we had Deputy Crinion here telling us about all the profits they were making as a result of the surplus supply.  The position has now levelled off, and I cannot see any justification for the implications in Deputy Gibbons' supplementary question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 29, to delete &ldquo;that notice expires&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the termination takes effect&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="474" /> On the Second Stage of this Bill I said I believed this Bill would require a lot of examination and detailed investigation in Committee.  It affects the business life of the employer and employee.  We should try to improve and streamline this Bill to ensure that it is fair to all sides of our industrial society.  In addition, the terminology of it should be simplified as far as possible so that workers who will be affected by it can follow it easily.</P>
    <P>We did not oppose the Bill on Second Stage because no doubt there is a need for such a measure.  However, one must question the timing of any legislation that could aggravate our very bad unemployment situation. Out of concern for industry at the moment we must endeavour to create further jobs and continue existing jobs.  As we go through the Bill in detail we will go into some of the effects that I fear this legislation will have on both the employer and the employee.  This amendment is basically a tidying up operation, an operation we believe is necessary.  Hopefully we will be submitting an amendment at a later stage to shorten the six-month period within which a person may bring a case for unfair dismissal, because we believe it is six months too long.  I hope that the Minister will accept the good intentions behind this amendment.  The definition section refers to the date on which that notice expires.</P>
    <P>The reason for that is that a person could be given one month's notice and at the end of two weeks, by mutual agreement or otherwise, the employer might give him money <i>in lieu</i> of the two weeks' notice.  Rather than have the date at which the notice expires as the operative date, it would appear sensible to have the date on which the termination takes effect as the operative date.  A longer period of notice could be given, such as two months. Before the notice had expired the employer could decide to pay out money <i>in lieu</i> of notice.  Therefore, for the purpose of this Act it would be tidying it up by referring to the date at which the termination takes effect.  The legislation would be easier for everybody and a case of unfair dismissal could <Col N="475" /> be dealt with reasonably quickly. There could be two, three or four weeks of a lag between both dates. Two or three weeks lost at this stage would not be to the advantage of the employer or the employee.  It would be a dormant period within which the employee was not working with the employer.  He had taken the money <i>in lieu</i> of notice for part of the period of notice.  It would serve no useful purpose in that case that the date be the date on which the notice expired.</P>
    <P>Whether the notice was for a period of two, four or eight weeks it would mean that the termination would take effect from the date on which the notice expired.  In other words, it would coincide with what is contained in the Bill.  In good faith I have pointed out to the Minister that the amendment would have the effect of tidying the Act while it would not affect a person who worked during the entire period of notice.  It would prevent there being a dormant period of any number of weeks from the time that an employee may have served part of the period of notice and was then paid off by way of wages <i>in lieu.</i> This is a reasonable amendment and I ask the Minister to accept it in the light of it being an improvement to the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the Deputy but having considered the matter it is our opinion that the phrase &ldquo;that notice expires&rdquo; is more appropriate than that suggested in the amendment.  Also, there is the problem that acceptance of the amendment might lead to further problems of definition.  In our opinion the formula we have used is more beneficial to the employee in relation to the qualifying service as laid down in section 2.  However, the Deputy has been considering this question carefully so I could undertake to have another look at it before Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by the Minister and I am happy enough with the situation in which he indicates his preparedness to look at the matter between now and Report <Col N="476" /> Stage although I reserve the right to put down an amendment for that Stage, if necessary.  I am of the opinion that there might be time lag periods which are dormant and of no benefit to anybody whereas if the person continues to work during the full period of notice it will be a matter of indifference whether the terminology used is that contained in the section as drafted or as in the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 29, after &ldquo;employment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and an individual in the service of a local authority for the purposes of the Local Government Act, 1941, shall be deemed to be employed by the local authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What we have in mind here is the situation in which some doubt has been created by earlier legal decisions concerning the application of legislation to employees of local authorities. Representations have been made to me by unions organising such workers and in response to these I have tabled this amendment.  The provisions of section 1 will then mean that those classified as servants under the Local Government Act, 1941, will be covered.  As the House knows, officers are already covered under existing procedures but there was some doubt as to whether some categories of general workers in local authorities were covered.  This amendment seeks to ensure that they are covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the amendment which, in fact, goes a little of the way towards achieving what I had hoped to achieve in amendment No. 2.  As far as I can see, it covers only servants of local authorities and I take it that officers are excluded.  I should like the Minister to define the difference between servant and officer of a local authority.  It appears to me that section 2 of the Bill specifically excludes officers of local authorities.  That is one of the points I was trying to get over.  I thought a Bill such as this should set out basically to legislate for unfair dismissal whether in the private or the public sector, with certain reservations for the weaker sections where perhaps it may be too soon to do it or, in fact, it might be harmful to employment prospects.  Other than that, I should have thought the approach should have been a broad one directed at both public and private sectors.  Here we have a small group in the public sector being catered for. I agree with this.  But it only includes the servants of local authorities and it prompts the question: why should we <Col N="480" /> have a distinction between servants and officers?</P>
      <P>The Minister will say that there is other legislation, but I am not sure that there is any legislation catering for unfair dismissals.  This is a new concept and I believe it should be introduced in the beginning so as to cover both public and private sectors, not just a small section such as servants of the local authority as this amendment does, but the entire sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>These distinctions and categories are drawn from the relevant Local Authority Acts, notably the Act of 1941, which separates those working in local authorities into those two categories. Officers correspond to clerical, administrative and professional workers while those in the other category would be in the general worker class such as caretakers.  The second category of local authority workers are not covered by any procedures at present whereas the officers have the benefit of statutory procedures.  That is the main distinction as regards this legislation.  We feel it is important that this legislation should include the second category, general workers in local authorities.  One category is already covered in legislation while the other is not and we feel they should be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the inclusion of this section of workers, but surely in this Anti-Discrimination Bill the Minister must concede we are now discriminating between two groups or sections of people working in local authorities.  The Minister adds that statutory procedures are available to them.  In the case of any dismissal at any level the statutory procedures will always be available, but admittedly these may be difficult to use and it may be difficult to get recompense under them.  If a caretaker or a general foreman is dismissed he has redress under this Bill, but there are many people in local authorities who may be vulnerable.  We have had experience of people who have been dismissed and, perhaps, had not the necessary resources to avail of statutory procedures to claim against <Col N="481" /> the local authority concerned. Surely they deserve to be protected under this Bill also?  Would the Minister not consider extending it to cover them all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appreciates that they are covered under procedures that have been operating for some time, procedures which relate to codes of conduct leading to disciplinary action.  These already operate for the first category of local authority employees, the officer category. These procedures deal with the kind of inquiries to be initiated.  The general emphasis of all the codes that operate for these officers of local authorities for the most part depend on suspension for disciplinary reasons. On our reckoning very few dismissals, in fact, occur.  The thrust of this legislation is to protect those who have no protection, to introduce disciplinary criteria where none operated up to the present and in general to extend certain rules that will be known to both sides of the employment contract, rules which will have to be observed before an employer can take the final step in any disciplinary procedure&mdash; the employee's dismissal.  That is the general intention of this legislation, to bring this protection into an area where it does not at present operate or exist. My point is that such protection exists for this first category of employee under the Local Authority Acts.  To hold up this legislation for the inclusion of all categories whether protected or not at present would involve us in quite an extraordinary amount of amendments of other statutes.  I do not believe it would justify the delay involved when you take into account that the main necessity for this legislation is to protect those who are at present on their own in respect of disciplinary procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not get the Minister's point.  Statutory protection is available to officers under the ordinary laws but they do not have any protection against unfair dismissal as laid down in this Bill.  This is why I believe they should be included.  We will have the opportunity of discussing <Col N="482" /> the section later but because my second amendments has been deleted this amendment leaves the definition of employer very inadequate.  This is, of course, going away from the local authority part of it.  I would have felt that the correct procedure for the Minister in relation to section 1 would be to amend &ldquo;employee&rdquo; to include: &ldquo;An individual in the service of a local authority for the purposes of the Local Government Act, 1941 shall be deemed to be employed by the local authority&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Employer&rdquo; is amended but the definition of employer does not go far enough.  However, we will have an opportunity of discussing that under the section.</P>
      <P>The amendment, reading it closely, would appear to relate more to the type of employee covered.  In other words, it means an individual who has entered into or works under a contract of employment or an individual in the service of a local authority for the purposes of the Local Government Act, 1941 shall be deemed to be employed by the local authority. I think the wrong word in the definitions has been amended but I still do not understand why the Minister says that an officer of a local authority is statutorily protected.  There is to my mind no unfair dismissal legislation. Surely the officer deserves the same treatment as the servant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would return to the point that they do have these existing procedures under which they are covered and others in local authority employment do not have any such protection.  That is the main reason why I believe their inclusion would be helpful and why I am not convinced of the case that the others should be brought under the ambit of the legislation at this point.</P>

      <P>This is the definition section of the Bill.  We have already discussed an amendment in regard to the date of dismissal and I appreciate the Minister saying that he <Col N="483" /> will look at this between now and Report Stage.  Paragraph (c) states: &ldquo;Where a contract of employment for a fixed term expires without its being renewed under the same contract or, in the case of a contract for a specified purpose.&rdquo;  Does this refer to, for example, a building contractor who takes on a major contract of two, three, or possibly four years employing anything from 200 to 1,000 people?  Does this section protect this type of contract or does it define the date of dismissal as regards this type of contract?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1) (a), lines 3 to 5, to delete &ldquo;who, at the date of his dismissal, had less than one year's continuous service with the employer who dismissed him&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;whose contract of employment commenced less than one year prior to the date of his dismissal&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason for this amendment is that I fear there may be a loophole that could be used to the disadvantage of the individual.  Subsection 2 (1) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>an employee who is dismissed, who, at the date of his dismissal, had less than one year's continuous service with the employer who dismissed him...</P>
      <P>That is not tight enough to guard against the merger, the takeover, the change of employer or the change of the employment structure of the individual. For this reason I suggest that instead of the words used, we suggest &ldquo;whose contract of employment commenced less than one year prior to the date of his dismissal&rdquo;.  In other words, his contract of employment with the firm, or the people or the person, whether it changed as a result of a takeover, being purchased or anything else, under this subsection should be tied to the job rather than to any change in persons that may have taken place within a period of 12 months.</P>

      <P>My worry about this amendment is that it could be used as a means of evasion.  I appreciate that this is not the Deputy's intention.  The requirements of subsection (1) (a) are tied to the concept of continuous service as embodied in other forms of worker protective legislation.  I prefer to think that this is a better way of dealing with this problem from the employee's point of view.</P>

      <P>We seem to have the same complaint&mdash;the Minister about my amendment and I about the original subsection.  As I read this subsection if John Murphy, an employer, has 20 employees and sells his entire business to James Murphy, depite the fact that a man may have worked for John Murphy for 24 years, if the business is sold to James Murphy before this Bill becomes law, the chances are that this man may only have been employed by James Murphy for six months and James Murphy will not come under the terms of that subsection which says &ldquo;who, at the date of this dismissal, had less than one year's continuous service with the employer who dismissed him&rdquo;.  If we relate that subsection back to the definition section we will find the definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo;. There is a very wide loophole here that has to be closed.  I thought my amendment was most reasonable and would be prepared to accept the Minister having another look at it but I believe the subsection as it stands is not adequate to close that loophole.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is concerned about the change of employer and feels that a person who, through no fault of his own, finds himself in a changed employment situation, would not be covered under this section.  Subsection (4) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The First Schedule to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, as amended by section 19 of this Act, shall apply for the purpose of ascertaining for the purposes of this Act the period of service of an employee <Col N="488" /> and whether that service has been continuous.</P>
    <P>This ensures that continuity of employment is preserved.  Paragraph (7) of the First Schedule of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973 states:</P>
    <P>If a trade or business is transferred from one person to another (whether or not such transfer took place before or after the commencement of this Act) the continuous service of an employee in that trade or business at the time of the transfer shall be reckoned as continuous service with the transferee and the transfer shall not operate to break the continuity of the service of the employee.</P>

      <P>Perhaps ten or 12 years ago Deputy G. Fitzgerald's amendment would not have been necessary but in these days of mergers and counter-mergers, takeovers and counter-takeovers, an employee has a sense of insecurity and fears any mention of a possible takeover.  If accepted, Deputy G. Fitzgerald's amendment would give the worker some reassurance and remove from the industrial scene one of the biggest grievances of workers nowadays, which is that in almost every takeover of a large concern there is some trouble and employees are penalised in one way or another.  A new broom sweeps clean. Deputy G. Fitzgerald's amendment would fill a great void in our present legislation on industrial relations and I would urge the Minister to accept it.</P>

My form of words may <Col N="489" /> not be the ideal answer but the point should be spelled out here for the workers.  All Bills referring to rights of workers and unfair dismissals should be simplified as far as possible with as little cross reference as possible.</P>
      <P>The subsection needs far more tightening than it has at present.  Why not use a better form of words?  My amendment may leave the position open to abuse, too, but I can see little need to refer only to the employee's one year continuous service with the employer who dismissed him.  It must relate to that year's service being within the employment from which he was dismissed.  There is a certain difference.  There should be a reference to the job he holds down within a particular company and not just to one year's continuous service.  While section 7 covers this to a certain extent, I still fear there may be a loophole, and the section should be tightened.  By all means rely on other Acts, but for the guidance of the person trying to read this Bill the reference to unfair dismissal should be included.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), lines 14 to 17, to delete paragraph (c) and to substitute the following paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(c)  a person who is employed by his spouse, father, mother, <Col N="490" /> grandfather, grandmother, stepfather, step-mother, son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, step-son, step-daughter, brother, sister, half-brother or half-sister, is a member of his employer's household and whose place of employment is a private dwellinghouse or a farm in or on which both the employee and the employer reside,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This, again, is a drafting amendment which clarifies the intention&mdash;that this exclusion is intended to deal with problems raised in farming enterprises and private households.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the amendment but I cannot agree with the Minister that it is only a drafting amendment.  The extension itself is too narrow.  I realise the problems that would be created in having this Bill cover the type of person in the employer's household, relative or otherwise.  I also realise the problems it could create for the farmer and the employee.  Here, however, it is confined to a person residing with him. Perhaps the Minister should have gone further here.  It would appear to me to be impractical to have this Bill applying only to a farmer and his employee. It would be an employer and an employee situation.  In fact, it would be irrelevant if they resided within the one house.  The amendment should have gone that far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the section itself, I will have the opportunity of discussing the relationships because I would question in greater detail some of the relationships concerned.  The Minister will probably say that it is in line with other legislation. I think that it is not, for the most part, in line with anti-discrimination legislation which has been before the House.  It is a very broad group of relatives and while, of course, we must accept that we cannot legislate for the family unit, at the same time we must realise that discrimination takes place. Unfair dismissals could take place on a straight line basis, such as brothers and brothers or brothers and sisters, and these could be very unfair indeed. While it is probably not desirable to legislate in such manner as might set brother against brother, at the same time one must have some protection <Col N="491" /> for an individual who might be at the weaker end of a sort of partnership or employee-employer relationship.  I would ask the Minister to consider this aspect in the interests of the farming community.</P>

      <P>My anxiety was to meet the points made on the Second Stage that &ldquo;close relative&rdquo; was a little vague and might give rise to abuse.  The definition of relative adopted here is that used in the redundancy code and the minimum notice legislation.  Certain relationships are excluded.  I believe this amendment meets many of the viewpoints put forward on the Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is much more than a drafting amendment, as the Minister suggested initially.  The restriction relates to responsibility.  Obviously the Minister intends to limit the subsection to those whose place of employment is a private dwellinghouse or a farm.  I am concerned about the farm element.  There are occasions where a father and son or two brothers may work the farm but not actually reside on it.  One or other may reside in the nearest town or village.  He may be totally and utterly dependent on his employment on the farm.  There are many such cases and I am wondering why the Minister limits this to residence on the farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an area of infinite gradation in relationships. We have done our best to narrow the area to ensure the provision will apply as closely as possible.  Deputies appreciate it is not possible to cover all the variations in relationships where injustice might occur and where the provisions of this Bill should clearly apply. On the other hand, we have to ensure that in trying to encompass practical difficulties this legislation does not become an element in stepping up the possibility of family quarrels.  The residence qualification is clear.  It is possible that in certain instances someone might not reside on the actual farm but we have to draw the line somewhere.</P>

I doubt very much if the Minister or his advisers, even though the line must be drawn somewhere, would want to exclude people from the benefit of this protection.  The majority may live on the farm but there are cases in which a father or a son may live some distance from the actual farmhouse, for good social or family reasons, but will be totally dependent on his employment on the farm.  Why should such a person be in a different position from the person who actually lives on the farm?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), after line 17, to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( )  An employee in employment which employs less than five persons&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given a great deal of thought to problems that may be created by <Col N="493" /> this Bill.  I said earlier on Second Stage that it was important that the legislation should not in any way hinder or harm employment.  I appreciate fully that the Minister is trying to narrow the area of exclusions as much as possible.  I am anxious to see the public sector under this umbrella but I am also concerned about the employer who has a small number of employees, particularly in rural Ireland but also in most of our cities and towns.  While these may be small units of employment they add up to quite a sizeable number throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I want to see the continued existence of these small units and I want to ensure that we do not have what I might call a conacre-type of employment being introduced.  In such a situation an employer might be inclined to engage a person on an 11-month basis and then find he did not want the person concerned.  The employer might continue for six months without anybody and then he might take on another employee for 11 months.</P>
    <P>These small units of employment are most beneficial to the local area and we want to see them continue.  I could see them coming under this Bill if the undertaking in question had six employees.  The Bill leaves two options open to the employer.  First, that the employee be re-engaged on similar work or on work that is suitable.  In a small unit comprising perhaps only five persons it would be very difficult to re-employ a person on similar work; it would be much easier in a large company.  The second option if the employee is not re-engaged is the 104 week payment.  In the case of a small business in the country, I do not believe the owner will be capable of using that option.</P>
    <P>If human nature were perfect there would be no need to have legislation dealing with unfair dismissals but, human nature being what it is, we will never have an ideal situation and we must legislate accordingly.  I have made a few points to show why I think small units should not be included. First, it would be beneficial to the employment of the person in the short <Col N="494" /> term at least; secondly, I do not think the small business would be able to withstand the provisions of the Bill; and, thirdly, I would be afraid a ruthless employer might adopt a system of employing people on the basis of 11 months&mdash;what I previously referred to as the conacre type of employment.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that we should diligently follow British legislation&mdash; anything but that&mdash;but there is such an exclusion in some of their legislation which gives the impression that their legislators saw the need to protect employment within small units. There is also another consideration, though perhaps of lesser importance. Many people will not know that this legislation which affects them is going through the Dáil at the moment.  They may be engaged in any kind of scramble without knowing of the existence of the legislation.  There is also the possibility that when employers hear about this Bill they may be inclined to reduce their numbers.  None of us wants legislation that might inhibit employment in any way or that might be inclined to make people reluctant to create jobs.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's dilemma in the matter but perhaps he might consider adopting my suggestion even as a temporary measure.  I agree that this Bill should apply to business and industry as far as possible, but perhaps it would be advisable to see how it works in the larger industries and then extend it.  Initially there is a case to be made and to be listened to why the small units should be excluded.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of a small unit where two people are employed.  I do not want the Minister to get the impression that I am supporting the idea of unfair dismissal, but I would point out that at that level of employment one would find far less unfair dismissals than in other areas, simply because there is normally a local friendly relationship between employer and employee.  The employer has two options open to him.  There is the option of re-engagement, which may present problems for both parties.  On the other hand, most small employers would not be able to meet the 104 weeks pay-out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> There are quite a number of such small units throughout the country and I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to my amendment. It may be necessary to have a time limit put on it but I am convinced there is need for some protracted period to give us an opportunity of seeing how the legislation works.  It will also be necessary to let people know about this legislation and advise them on the problems that may be created.  I should like to see the small employment units expanding and thus coming under the control of the Bill. I have set out a number of reasons why I consider the amendment essential and I would ask the Minister to consider it seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>My main problem about this amendment is that I really wanted the Bill to apply to firms of all sizes.  We do not have any reason to think that the problems of unfair dismissal will apply less to small firms than to large firms.  The possibility of a person being unfairly treated exists in all employments irrespective of size.  One could not accept the idea that because a firm was a certain size the employer in that firm could, if he wished, act unfairly in relation to the dismissal of his employees. It is a matter of opinion whether or not relations in the small firm are better than in the large one. It cannot be maintained that the possibility of unfair dismissal does not exist in the small firm.  It exists in any firm irrespective of its size.  I would not agree that this Bill should not apply, that it should exclude firms of five employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dismissals can occur in an arbitrary fashion in small firms with little redress even now.  I could not see myself agreeing to accept this amendment. Deputy Fitzgerald said that employers could, to some extent, get around the provisions of this legislation by employing people for fewer than 12 months.  The Bill does not apply to any person unless he or she has been 12 months in continuous employment. Deputy Fitzgerald asked whether an employer who employed somebody for 11 months escapes the provisions of <Col N="496" /> this Bill?  It is possible for me to stop this type of abuse under the powers of amendment in section 16 (1) by resolution of the Oireachtas.  I will not hesitate to invoke that power if a small number of employers attempt to escape the provisions of this Bill by adopting such an approach.  I could not see my way to accepting an amendment which says that because a firm employs only five employees the employer in that firm should not be forced to accept the provisions of this legislation.  The Bill should apply to all firms irrespective of size.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not convinced me.  He said that this will be an all-embracing Bill.  I agree with the sentiments behind why it should be an all-embracing Bill.  I would not attempt to condone an unfair dismissal at that level.  I am very genuinely concerned about this matter. Concern has been expressed by all shades of industrial society, some, perhaps more publicly than others, that legislation of this nature at a time of high unemployment can be ill-timed.</P>
      <P>It is desirable for us to make progress in a reasoned sort of way.  We are now introducing an Unfair Dismissals Bill.  Should we now concentrate initially introducing that to cover most of the commercial and industrial business which we would do even by accepting my amendment? I do not want to push the Minister completely against his will but I ask him to consider this matter.  I am concerned that all the people in our constituencies, whether they employ one, two, three, four or five people, continue to employ those people and also more and that they are not encouraged by any legislation to use ways and means of getting around it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that he will look at this matter between now and Report Stage.  I believe he will find that there is a case for this particularly in rural Ireland.  I take the point he made about the danger of an unfair dismissal, which I absolutely condemn. In small businesses there is less danger that unfair dismissals will occur than in a large firm.  If it happens under this legislation it will be very difficult <Col N="497" /> for small employers to cope with the situation which will arise.</P>
    <P>I believe that lines of communication from Dáil Éireann to many of those people will break down here and there and they will not even know that we discussed this legislation. They will not know that this legislation has been passed.  In fact, they will not know anything about it until the problem arises.  I understand there was a limit of five in some of the legislation introduced by the Labour Government in Britain.  They must have some specific reason for doing this.  If this is accepted, we will have moved a certain distance.  It can be easily extended.  The Minister could write something into the Bill for that extension after a period.  The small unit should not come in on the first day of the introduction of the Bill. A period of six or 12 months should be allowed elapse.</P>

      <P>I would like to accommodate any Deputy, no matter what side of the House he sits on, in relation to any amendment that would improve things or incorporate a new suggestion if it adds up to assisting the main intention of the Bill.  I do not want to assure the Deputy that I will look at something that I am afraid I cannot see myself incorporating. If we agree to exclude firms with five employees on the general grounds that such employers should not be asked to accept the same obligations as employers of larger firms, there could be some schools excluded. It could happen that certain schools that have four teachers would be excluded from the provisions of this Bill.  I do not think any of the teachers' organisations would be too happy about seeing such exclusions accepted by us.  I am sure the Deputy would probably have as many reservations as I have about the exclusion of this kind of school from the provisions of the Bill.  This is the kind of problem which could arise if we were to change the Bill and bring in this criteria that if there are five employees in a firm the provision of the Bill should not apply to that firm. There is no rational basis on which one could incorporate such a provision <Col N="498" /> in legislation of this kind.  We are safer to say that the Bill should apply to all employments irrespective of size.</P>

      <P>However, the primary and secondary teachers are included.  Surely that creates an anomaly that is hard to understand. We have already had reference to the exclusion of the chairman of the Army Pensions Board.  This is continuing the divide between the private sector and public sector.  In the past cases have been taken through our courts by people dismissed by local authorities and State Departments and those employees can still avail of that machinery but surely legislation of this type should be introduced on the basis of it applying to as many people as possible.  It should give to all employees the right of going to the normal channels of the courts or a rights commissioner or the appeals tribunal.  If that facility is being given to the employees in the private sector, there is no reason why it should not be given to employees in the public sector.  I had hoped to discuss this matter on my amendment but as that has been ruled out of order I reserve the right to oppose some of the provisions in subsection (1).  I do not see why a Bill of this nature should be sectional in any way.</P>

      <P>The vocational teachers have their own statutory dismissal procedures under the Acts dealing with vocational education.  The general relationship of the civil service is determined by law under the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956. They are covered by the many existing procedures.  As I explained at the outset, it was my intention to ensure that this legislation primarily would protect those who are not covered at present.  That is why such categories have been excluded from the provisions of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear the Minister justify in principle the reasons for these exclusions, rather than simply say they are already covered in different Acts.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us his reasons and spell them out for us, as I think he is obliged to do.  If he is relying on the exclusions in those Acts, he should tell us precisely what safeguards there are which are as <Col N="501" /> adequate as the safeguards he is introducing in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald gave one of many examples, that is, the anomaly which will exist between the position of a primary teacher and a secondary teacher and that of a vocational teacher.  We are hoping to have some integration in the system of education. We understand that is the attitude of the Minister's party.  We want to ensure, to the maximum possible extent, free movement between the various sectors of education in so far as teachers are concerned.  If the protections in this Bill will be limited to primary teachers and secondary teachers, and will exclude vocational teachers, in my view that is wrong in principle.</P>
      <P>The Minister is talking in terms of vocational Acts and procedures rather than principles.  Procedures in themselves are not guarantees.  Principles are.  If the Minister can tell us that the vocational school teacher is as protected as his counterpart in primary and secondary schools will now be under this Bill, perhaps we can listen to him.  The Minister is producing this legislation on the basis that it is a necessary and desirable social amendment. Then the onus falls on him to justify the exclusion of people in similar positions.</P>
      <P>The same question arises in relation to employees and officers of local authorities and of the State.  Through the Minister the State is telling the people at large: &ldquo;These are the standards by which we believe you should be bound in your conduct in your employment.  These are the conditions we feel it is now necessary to introduce into the relationship between employers and employees.  These are the safeguards which we as the Government think must be introduced into your contractural relationships. While we feel these are appropriate safeguards to provide in the private sector, we have no such concern for the public sector.&rdquo;  Surely there is an anomaly there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that is precisely what the Minister feels.  I am saying if he stands over what he has introduced here he is giving effect to <Col N="502" /> that.  If he wants to tell us there are protections in the local authority Acts or the Acts dealing with the employment of civil servants, he should spell out what they are.  We have a list of Acts here which may have some relevance. Until we examine them in more detail I doubt that they relate to any thing more than procedures.  I am pretty confident they do not cover principles to the same extent as the principles we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister now telling employees and officers of local authorities &mdash;and that covers a fairly wide range &mdash;that they are to be in a different position from people in an executive capacity with firms, or people earning salaries or wages far in excess of their earnings?  Is he telling the staffs of the various offices of the State that they are to be excluded from this?  If so, why?  The Minister should tell us precisely the grounds on which he justifies this, and spell out exactly what protections apply to those people.</P>
    <P>Apprentices employed by An Comhairle Oiliúna are to be excluded.  It is a long-established principle of the law that apprentices are in a special position for a reason different from the reason envisaged here.  Under the existing law, misconduct in the discharge of one's office is a justification for dismissal and thereby renders it a justifiable dismissal.  Misconduct on the part of apprentices has been excluded, for very obvious reasons, as a justification for termination of the apprenticeship under the common law.  An apprentice is subject to other disciplines which do not apply to the servant or officer as the case might be.  Termination of his apprenticeship could be a very serious step for him. Under the existing law there are other sanctions which can be applied to apprentices which, perhaps, could not be applied to other people.</P>
    <P>One might say the Minister proposes to exclude the people who are most vulnerable.  I am not saying this would be the intention of An Comhairle Oiliúna, but we have to guard against any such eventuality.  Some of the categories the Minister proposes to exclude cannot be justifiably excluded.  I doubt that we would state as a principle <Col N="503" /> that officers and employees of the State or semi-State bodies are henceforth to be in a less protected position than officers and employees in the private sector.  That seems to me to be contrary to what most of us would stand for, and contrary to what the Minister's party present as being their stance.  It will introduce a new element into employment which could not be justified in principle. There are thousands of people in that position.  As the Minister acknowledged in reply to Deputy Fitzgerald's question about teachers, it gives rise to terrible anomalies.</P>
    <P>The Acts in this list go back as far as 1930, 1931, 1941, 1956 and 1959.  I presume that in 1976 there is social enlightenment on or awareness of the need to protect employment which, perhaps, did not exist in 1930. To rely on the provisions of a 1930 Act as corresponding to the safeguards in a 1976 Bill does not do justice to what the Minister intends to do.  If he relies on those Acts he should tell us what safeguards they provide and we can judge one against another and, on principle rather than on procedures, decide whether these exclusions are justified.  On the face of it, I cannot see how they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The general impulse for this legislation related to the number of disputes which had been caused in recent years as a result of disagreement on the disciplinary methods used in particular cases.  Disputes had arisen because an employee felt aggrieved, and his sense of grievance, in the existing lacuna in our legislation, meant he sought the assistance and support of fellow workers in his disagreement with the employer.  We had many strikes.  We reckon that one-fifth of man-days lost in the year before last arose from disputes relating to dismissals. Therefore, I just want to let Deputy O'Kennedy know that the impulse for this legislation arises from the observable phenonema of disputes in an area in which the law was silent.  It was to end that state of affairs that this legislation was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> The problem of dismissals leading to disputes.  I refer to have not been an occurrence in the public sector and that is the major reason why we have not entered this area.  The public sector is amply covered by existing procedures.  In the case of established civil servants, it requires a Cabinet decision to dismiss one.  One cannot imagine greater security than that.  The basic conditions of civil servants are provided for in the Civil Service (Regulation) Act, 1956, and any dismissal of a civil servant must take congnisance of the provisions of that Act, and, as I said, it takes a Government decision itself to dismiss an established civil servant.</P>
    <P>One must take note of the fact that, by and large, the Public Service is an area of good relations between employer and employee and that we have not had any instance of the disputes which I have mentioned and which have largely brought about the introduction of this legislation, namely, the actual situation of a number of disputes occurring because of conflict arising from the interpretation of rights and wrongs under dismissal procedures in private industry.  In the case of the Defence Forces, Garda Síochána and Prison Officers, Deputies will appreciate that these bodies have their own disciplinary codes designed in relation to their important security role, and it would be inappropriate to attempt to apply the provisions of general law in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the training authority itself in the matter of apprentices.  I would inform him that the training authority is not an employer in the normal sense. Normally, it is the private employer who takes on the apprentice.  This provision here is designed for a situation where the training authority might be forced to take on apprentices directly into its employment, but it is not an employment relationship; it is AnCO attempting to increase the volume of apprentice training.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to hear the Minister say that.  I do not know whether there are better standards in the Public Service, but if there are, I wonder to what extent it is due to the fact that the employer, if such you can describe him, the Minister, has not the same personal, financial involvement in what is being applied as the person has in the private sector.  Maybe when people do not care as much or are not affected as much they can claim better standards in general.  It may be that when we are doling out public money, as distinct from private money, we are not as conscientious or concerned.</P>
      <P>Whatever the reason is&mdash;and that is not the point I want to make&mdash;I do not think the Minister should rely on the fact that there is a higher standard applied in the Public Service than in industrial employment, or on the fact that because something has not happened up to the moment, it may never happen in future.  Certainly I do not think we should exclude local authority servants or officers from the protection that is being given here to people who may be in much more secure positions in outside employment. When the Minister introduces what he calls a necessary and desirable reform in the relationship that exists between the employer and employee in the ordinary course, I do not think it is right for him to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" />&ldquo;While I am doing this, I am excluding my colleagues and myself for the time being, whoever they may be, from this obligation that I am imposing on others.&rdquo;  Surely there is a certain element of blindness or inconsistency in that approach.</P>
    <P>If we are going to preach here in this House about standards to be applied to others, surely we should at least be ready to acknowledge that the same standards should be applied to us.  In my view this will cause the type of reaction against this legislation which I would hope would not arise in the private sector, that the employers will say in regard to the Government&mdash;I am not referring only to this Government but to any Government: &ldquo;There they are again preaching to us about our obligations, and when they are introducing legislation to protect employees they exclude themselves from the same obligations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know how that can be made to conform to any social ethic or social or political philosophy.  We hear a good deal about political philosophy from time to time, when people parade the concern they have, not least the Minister's party, under what they regard as their fundamental political philosophy that in their view makes them more concerned for universal social justice than others.  If such is the case, I ask the Minister under what principle of philosophy can he justify what he is asking us to do here, to exclude the people who happen to be employed in the State sector, the local authority sector or committees, as the case might be, in this instance, the vocational committees of local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is not right for us to assume that it will not happen in future.  If the economic stringencies of the day were to continue, who is to say that people might not be vulnerable to the exigencies of the Executive to have them removed from positions that the Executive are not able to support?  I have seen cases where temporary employment in the Board of Works has been terminated months in advance of the normal termination date because of financial stringencies.  If this trend were to continue, who is to <Col N="507" /> say that public sector employees would not be the victims of the economic axe of their superiors for the time being, be they county managers or Ministers? There is no justification for the Minister's decision.  We have asked for examples and have not been given any.  The Acts to which the Minister refers do not provide the safeguards in principle that this Bill intends to apply.  There are procedures but no principles.  This Bill is giving new statutory rights to the people concerned, rights which can be maintained and vindicated in our courts. The ones the Minister refers to are not covered by judicial protection but are ordinary administrative procedures, whether one talks in terms of local authority employees, gardaí, apprentices and so on.  Public sector employees are in secure positions in comparison with private sector employees. Because it is true at present does not make it true for all time and does not justify the principle which the Minister asked us to introduce&mdash; a principle which he lauded as recently as last Sunday, when he was addressing his own conference, as being a vindication of the social concern of his party. If he was genuine about the need to introduce it into the private sector, why is he excluding it at present? How can he be consistent in that connection? The question cannot be answered by saying that there are procedures.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's point in relation to AnCO.  I know that AnCO is not an employer within the meaning of the Act.  I cannot accept an exclusion which brings about the anomaly that Deputy Fitzgerald spoke about. Why should there be a difference between a teacher in a vocational school and a teacher in a secondary school? Why should there be a difference between an established clerk in a county council and a sales manager in a large firm?  Why should there be a difference between an administrative officer of a health board and a senior executive in private industry?  If there should not be a difference, the Minister should recognise that some of his exclusions are not appropriate to the intention of the measure.</P>

I have been informed that the Bill is too severe on the private sector and that they would be prepared to accept what the public sector would accept but the public sector are not included.  The Minister should tell us the reason for the exclusion of the public sector.  This Bill was introduced to protect employees from unfair dismissals.  It is not right to introduce a Bill which caters for only one section of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In replying to a point made by Deputy O'Kennedy, the Minister said that the Bill was introduced to eliminate the contributory factor of unfair dismissals in the industrial relations problem which had created the loss of one-fifth of the man days lost in 1974.  That is only partly correct.  In the opening paragraph of his Second Stage speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>This Bill sets out to correct a serious omission in our statute law in respect of the individual's right to fair treatment by his employer in circumstances where the employer either contemplates or has decided that he should be dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, we are talking about the rights of the individual in addition to the effort to curb the difficulties in industrial relations.  Surely there are rights for individuals in both the public and private sectors.  In view of the fact that the Minister introduced an amendment regarding the servant of a local authority, is a caretaker, for example, with the health board included or excluded in this Bill?  The reason for this question is fairly obvious.  An amendment was put down in relation to local authorities to ensure that servants of local authorities who were omitted are now included. It would appear to me that a caretaker of a health board in addition to an officer of a health board is excluded. I see absolutely no reason why paragraphs (h), the civil service, (j), the officers of a local authority and <Col N="509" /> (k), the officers of a health board, vocational educational committee or a committee of agriculture, should not be included.  They are the three paragraphs that I am opposing in subsection (1) of section 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has not the intention of eliminating disputes and grievances; its main objective is to assist in eliminating conflicts.  In the public service disputes have not been common.  Existing procedures cover the persons not included in this legislation.  Those who are excluded under this section do not lose any of the rights that this legislation was intended to confer on those who have not got them up to the introduction of this legislation.</P>
      <P>I have made it clear that the amendment brought in in relation to the local authorities was to cover people who were not already covered.  The officers are covered and they do not require the protection of this legislation, that is why they are not included. Officer categories in paragraphs (j) and (k) are already protected because a local authority may not remove an officer from office without obtaining the consent of the Minister for Local Government under the Local Government Act, 1941.  Before applying under that Act the authority must inform the officer concerned of their intention to apply, and must give reasons for applying.  The Minister must consider the representations of the officer and where an alternative post is proposed particulars of such post must be provided. All these provisions have existed for many years and demonstrate the kind of procedures which have existed in the public sector over the years and from which people in outside industry did not benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vocational teachers have protection under the Act that applies to them and secondary teachers are covered by the provisions of this legislation because they were not covered previously.  The main point that must be made is that in the public service we have procedures which work satisfactorily and a situation where security is the rule and has always been the rule, and the need for this legislation is arguable.  If one <Col N="510" /> were to delay badly needed legislation for the protection of categories of the population not previously protected until one had uniformity of procedures in relation to the public service it would mean that the incidence of disputes over unfair dismissals, which has been a so unfortunate and increasing tendency in industrial relations recently, would increase and an existing injustice would be allowed to continue.  For too long we have allowed the law to be silent in relation to the plight of the person who had no protection.  If this legislation passes both Houses the law will no longer be silent and that person will have some of the protection that other categories have had over the years. I do not rule out the possibility that when this legislation goes through, some of the bodies concerned in these procedures may consider that there should be changes in the legislation, but that is another day's work.  Our priority is to get legislation through to fill that gap in our present statute law.</P>

The Minister has said nothing to convince me or this side of the House as to why this Act should not extend to local authority officers, health board officers, vocational teachers, county committee of agriculture officers and civil servants.  For that reason we must oppose the paragraphs referred to. The Minister lauded and praised the 1941 Act.  That was an amazing change for the Minister.  It was an amazing change to hear the Minister praise so highly the 1941 Act which was introduced by Fianna Fáil.  That Act was ideal for its time but did not contain the redresses that are necessary now and which are being introduced in this Bill 35 years later.

      <P>I have been looking for copies of the various Acts referred to by the Minister but they are out of stock.  Consequently, we are stymied to some extent in considering this legislation.  I was not here while the Minister was speaking but I gather that in relation to the Local Government Act, 1941 there is protection by reason of the fact that in regard to dismissals there must be consultation with the Minister for Local Government.  This merely underlines what I have said already, that is, that the protections in Acts such as these are merely by way of setting out procedures.  Procedures in themselves are all right but as I am sure Deputy Esmonde will agree, any procedure can only go so far as the principle binding it will allow it to go.  One may talk about the provision for consultation but of itself that does not import the protection that the Minister sees fit to introduce here in relation generally to unfair dismissals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, for instance, the Minister were to say that the protection of section 6 in regard to unfair dismissals as well as the protection contained in section 7 are also in the various Statutes to which he has referred, we would give way but he cannot say that. Therefore, one cannot understand his asking us to agree to exclude from the legislation the categories we are talking about.  Whatever may be the position now in regard to disputes and the likelihood of disputes in the private sector as distinct from the public sector, we cannot say that the position will remain as it is.  We must not provide for making judgement in relation to a private employer in industry if we are not prepared to apply the same yardstick to ourselves. I am speaking generally here because, as the Minister will realise, what is involved goes much further than the Executive.  It extends to officers of local authorities and to health boards. With the extending functions of local authorities&mdash;for instance, in relation to the health boards' activities, to planning and to water pollution legislation&mdash;the likelihood is that as the State assumes further responsibility, and that would seem to be the policy of the Minister's party, more people <Col N="513" /> will be involved by way of employment within the public sector.  We are being asked in this legislation to exclude these workers from conditions that are considered proper and reasonable for the protection of workers in the private sector.  I see no logic in that.  Neither is there any justification for it.  I doubt if the Minister would have stood before his party's conference and tried to explain the proposal to exclude the public sector from this Bill.  At a time, too, when Ministers have been asking for a response to the national need it is difficult to understand why they should be excluding themselves from the obligations they are prepared to impose on others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

      <P>I would point out that the prime need for this legislation relates to the protection of those who up to now have been without protection. This area had been neglected for too long.  The Bill is intended to fill the gap in which the individual found himself without the protection of the law and to cope with a situation whereby in many instances in recent years the economy was the victim of disputes and when one-fifth of man days lost related to this very subject in industry.  In those circumstances it was fair that legislation of this kind would have to be introduced.</P>
      <P>I have indicated the procedures which exist in the public sector in relation to the guarantee of security of employment.  These procedures have existed for quite some time and, regardless of what may have been the main contributory factor, it remains that there have been very few disputes in the public sector.  It may be that in the years ahead we shall see greater uniformity in the whole area of the public sector, that changes may be made in this legislation at a later stage providing for uniformity in regard to a variety of procedures in relation to employment in the public sector.  However, that is not the pressing need for now.  Our aim is to ensure that the legislation is effective where it is required and that is the main interest in bringing the Bill before the House.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer <Col N="514" /> to a matter mentioned by Deputy O'Kennedy.  I have a good recollection of dealing many years ago with the same sort of situation in respect of a local authority official in Deputy O'Kennedy's constituency. The Deputy was concerned about whether such local authority officials are protected.  The county manager soon learned that the official in this case was well protected and, having purported to dismiss the employee, he had to bring him back again because he was well protected in existing legislation.  I just give that as a personal experience having known the case.  It did not require any legal ingenuity; there is very strong statutory machinery there to protect local authority officials.</P>

      <P>The State have a certain obligation at least to give good example.  If they want to establish a precedent they should do so.  As far as workers' rights and the whole question of good relations are concerned, the State have introduced proposals for worker participation on boards in the hope, I suppose, that eventually this will become a norm throughout the private sector generally.  I should like to see that hope fulfilled.  They give the example in that case and introduce that kind of development and, indeed, protection of good relations.</P>

      <P>First, I want to know from the Minister if he will explain subsection (2) (a) which deals with a dismissal where an employee is under contract of employment for a fixed term before 16th September, 1976.  In regard to subsection (3), I am not happy with the possible exclusion of some people who may well be excluded under this paragraph.  Could the Minister point out where these people are included?  I refer especially to the last paragraph in (a) where it says: &ldquo;in case the employer was a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons, had its principal place of business in the State during the term of the contract.&rdquo;  We are talking about an employment contract here.  What is the position about a body whose principal place of business is outside the State, especially multinationals? Is there a way in which they can get around this legislation in specific contracts for specific periods?</P>
      <P>Going back to paragraph (a) (ii) may I question the use of the word &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo;?  Is it the appropriate word?  There are a number of legal men present who could deal with that word in all its implications far better than I could.  In a situation when in the European context we can have people domiciled in the State and working elsewhere I should like the Minister to elaborate on the use of the word &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo; and also to deal with the last paragraph referring to a body with its principal place of business in the State.  What about the multi-national company whose headquarters may well be outside the State?</P>

      <P>In relation to the section, the exclusion relates to people resident outside and not domiciled in the State.  What is the position of a person whose contract was obviously made in the State, as in most cases it would be if the person is engaged in employment with an employer here whether multi-national, national or small-time, to do work for that company outside the State?  This section excludes such a person who might be dismissed on unfair grounds from <Col N="518" /> bringing proceedings here to have the rights of this Bill applied to him.  Perhaps I am wrong.  If the Minister could tell me no, such a person is protected, I would be happy.  I raise this query because subsection (3) as it stands appears to exclude such a person who, for instance, could be a sales representative abroad and for that reason almost by definition would be both resident and domiciled outside the State but, in fact, he was discharging his functions in relation to a contract which he made with an employer within the State.  Is the Minister saying that such a person should be excluded from the protection of the Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Minister has not justified the Bill.  Deputy Esmonde could tell us, in any event, that you can sue on a contract in the place where the contract is made. The Minister's studies of the law will have brought that home to him.</P>
      <P>If a person is engaged by any of the major companies here to do work which of necessity involves him spending almost all of his time outside the State, is the Minister saying that he should be prevented from the protection of this section?  He is saying that of course it is residence we are talking about in the section.  I can recognise that for myself, but is he saying that a person engaged under contract of service or employment made here if he has to work abroad to do the job for the employer should be excluded?</P>

      <P>Employment abroad is not covered.  Employees in the State are covered wherever the headquarters of the company they work for may be based.  The Deputy knows that we could have a very interesting afternoon or night on a discussion on the exact meaning of domicile and, perhaps, on Report Stage we could have a full discussion on it.  The main intention of the <Col N="519" /> legislation is to ensure that the Bill will protect employees in this country, when they are working and resident in this country.  To a limited extent we cover those who work outside the State, provided they live here or can claim domicile in the State.

Somebody is going to look at this when it is an Act and see whether this protection will apply to the type of people we are referring.  We are engaged in winning and promoting markets abroad and many of our companies will be so engaged.  People will as a condition of their employment be sometimes possibly obliged to live abroad so that they can do their job more effectively.  I point out to the Minister that those people who will have such a contract of employment entered into in this country will have no protection under this Bill.  He has not justified this.  If he does not wish to do so, that is his own business. It is a very important point and one that in future may be highlighted.</P>

We believe there is no reason why civil servants, including members of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or officers of a local authority for the purpose of the Local Government Act, 1941, or officers of a health board, a vocational educational committee, vocational teachers and officers of a committee of agriculture should not be included.

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="523" /> SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing the section for a number of reasons.  The first is that a probationer comes under its terms if the contract of employment is in writing and the duration of the probation or training is two years or less and is specified in the contract.  It seems strange that that should apply under this section and not under section 2, where the period is one year.  I submit the difference is an unjustified restriction in relation to probationers.  If there is to be a restriction, the same term of one year should apply as in the case of section 2.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that a probationer or trainee can be exempted from the application of this Act, under the provisions of this section, for two years rather than one.  It seems that during a training period of three or four years this Act will not apply to dismissal after a period of two years, whereas in the previous section the period mentioned is one year.  Is this not unjust discrimination?  In the latter case, the period of one year is taken and if his or her employment is regarded as satisfactory then the section applies.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that there will have to be a distinction between the qualifying period and the subsequent period but should the period not be confined to one year's exemption&mdash;that those concerned, if they had one year of satisfactory progress in their training or probation, would come within the control of the Act in the same way as those mentioned in section 2?  For instance, nurses go through a training period of three or four years before they are fully trained.  I appreciate that at the end of that period we cannot insist that the hospitals in which they have been trained must take them on, because there might not be sufficient vacancies and if they continued to employ their trainees year after year, eventually they would have more nurses than patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here, however, there is a distinction and our aim is that all should be treated equally.  Already, by division, <Col N="524" /> we have decided to exclude the public sector.  Having done that&mdash;we still do not agree with it&mdash;we must insist that once a person has completed satisfactorily a probationery or training period of one year he is entitled to the protection of the Bill.  If a trainee's competence or capability is not found wanting in the first year, it would be a reflection on those responsible for the training to come in in the second year.</P>
    <P>Obviously there is a grammatical error in subsection (1) which the Minister will have to amend.  Paragraph (a) states:</P>
    <P>if his contract of employment is in writing, the duration of the probation or training is 2 years or less and is specified in the contract, or</P>
    <P>I presume the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; should be inserted after &ldquo;writing&rdquo; and before &ldquo;the duration&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is primarily aimed at protecting people who are qualified and in employment, and the purpose of this section is to deal with somebody who is learning the job.  I do not think it would be any simplification of the position if we accepted Deputy Fitzgerald's submission.  We know of numerous cases where students or trainees do one year all right but do not in the second year. The purpose of training is to bring people up to a standard where they can be employed, having obtained proper qualifications, and one must accept that the person responsible for training should not be placed in the same position as an employer.  Having said that, I want to make a distinction.  I have been asked to mention the position of probationary secondary teachers. These do their theoretical work and then go into the field to gain practical experience.  I can conceive a situation arising in which institutions run by private people might abuse the situation by taking on probationers, getting rid of them at the end of the probationary period, and taking on more probationers&mdash;using probationary secondary teachers to do the work of fully qualified teachers.  It must be made clear that this will not be allowed.  This situation will not arise in the case of primary school teachers. <Col N="525" /> Perhaps the Minister will have a look at this between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to enable arrangements to be made for probationary training periods at the commencement of employment. Certain restrictions are imposed and I am seeking in this section to get a reasonably balanced provision which will take into account the interests of both sides.  Many arguments can be advanced and views offered to suggest that some of the provisions of this Bill should apply in the probationary period.  We must accept the principle of probation.  In subsection (2) there is reference to different categories, such as para-medicals, nurses and so on.  The Act will not apply in relation to the dismissal of the categories set out during the training period.  The courses are very rigorous and the standards required are very high and we must be concerned to ensure that the highest standards are maintained.  One must have regard here to the impact on the kind of training involved and I am reasonably satisfied that the absence of an exclusion provision could have serious consequences for institutions, such as teaching hospitals and so on.  However, I will have another look at this before the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a welcome indication from the Minister and it will temper our attitude.  When talking about probation or training the question of conduct or misconduct naturally arises.  Paragraph (c) of section 6 refers to the conduct of the employee. Such would justify the non-application of the protection of the Act.  If that is the case it would not tie the hands of the authority if it were found that the misconduct of the trainee was such as to oblige those in authority to terminate the contract of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I would go a little further than misconduct when the person is training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to what is in the Bill.  Normally the balance is the other way.  Most of the people here will be under 21 and, <Col N="526" /> from that point of view, there is an argument at least that special treatment for them should be strengthened, if anything, certainly maintained, and nothing should be done to exclude them from a protection now being applied under a new statutory obligation. Such exclusion would not be consistent with the special protection given to infants under the law.  The Minister should take this into consideration.</P>
      <P>The persons designated in subsection (2) are nurses, pharmacists, health inspectors, medical laboratory technicians and so on.  In most of these cases we are talking in terms of three- or four-year courses.  Trainees have a reasonable expectation that at the end of such courses they will have the right to proceed to permanent employment.  Take the case of a nurse who in her third year is dismissed.  We are not talking about anything other than unfair dismissal.  We are not restricting the right of a training authority in a hospital or elsewhere to tell a person he or she is not suitable for training for certain reasons which do not amount to unfair dismissal.  We are saying that young people because of their youth and the time they have spent in training, perhaps up to three years, should be protected against unfair dismissal which would undermine their whole future&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of these people are going through some form of educational establishment or college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Probation is another matter.  Not all of the people concerned are going to college; some of them are being paid while they are working.  Let us take the case of a girl who for personality reasons might fall foul of the matron.  That young person might have spent three years training, she might be ready for her final examination before qualifying but then she is suddenly unfairly dismissed.  I am sure all of us would be concerned to see that such a person should not be thrown out without any redress.  We want to ensure that the young person's confidence is not undermined in this way and that if her capacity, character and conduct are suitable that she be allowed to <Col N="527" /> continue training without wasting all those years.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he will consider the matter between now and Report Stage but I do not know precisely what that means.  On Report Stage we will not be able to tease out these matters to the same extent as on Committee Stage.  We can get a better idea of what is in the Minister's mind at this point in the debate.  I should like him to give us an indication why he sees the need to exclude people of the type we have referred to from the protection given in the Bill, having regard to the fact that we are talking about unfair dismissals and of the consequences of such dismissals on those involved.  I should like to know the Minister's justification for this at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke of the importance of probation and training.  We recognise that and we also recognise the discretion and the authority of the training body.  However, we also recognise that that discretion or authority must not be applied unfairly and, therefore, we would like to know why they should be excluded.  At any time it is a serious matter to lose a job but to be dismissed at that stage in a person's life can be much more serious and can have a very bad effect on the individual concerned.  For that reason, we should not lightly exclude those people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very real problem here.  If a training authority have to defend a dismissal by reference to any of the criteria that exist in relation to section 6 (4)&mdash; grounds of misconduct and so on&mdash; we will then be setting up the employment tribunal as a judge of the competence of the training authority in the nursing area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is competence of the character of the person being dismissed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>A health authority would maintain that it is difficult to separate the training aspect.  They would claim that it is an integral part. My difficulty here is that I have to <Col N="528" /> listen to the relevant authorities who have experience in this area.  It is only fair that I should advise the House of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have reservations about this matter.  Initially I was prepared to consider the Minister's suggestion that he would look at it before Report Stage but now I want certain assurances from him.  As Deputy O'Kennedy pointed out, we are confined in our discussions on Report Stage.  In addition, we will have to wait for the Minister to submit amendments. I think the section badly needs amendment.</P>
      <P>I do not go along with Deputy Esmonde or with the Minister regarding their approach to probation and training.  The point made by Deputy O'Kennedy was the most significant one.  We are talking here about unfair dismissals, not about fair dismissals. There is a vast difference.  The Minister mentioned health boards but for the majority of the people concerned their work starts as soon as they commence training.  Probably the first year in training is one of the most difficult years in a nurse's life.  If the training authority have not decided in 12 months whether a person is a suitable candidate, then there is a weakness in the training authority.  I accept that there must be some safeguards. I realise that where a hospital is training a group of the people we mentioned there must be some provision, possibly like the apprenticeship provision in section 4, to safeguard the hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem here is the competent authorities.  For example, the religious superiors managing the secondary schools have asked me for a meeting.  They are very strong in their view that the two-year probationary period is a necessary and essential element in this legislation. They would disagree with Deputies here who say that the provisions of the legislation should apply to the probationary period.  I must listen to the views of the managers who are in charge of secondary education and to the health authorities.  I wish Deputies would appreciate that I have <Col N="529" /> to listen to these people when framing legislation of this kind.  The religious superiors claim they need this two-year period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for its failure to deal effectively with the breakdown in law and order.</P>
      <P>I move this motion on behalf of my party.  I would like, at this early stage in the debate, to have a look at the amendment to my motion by the Minister for Justice.  I have no objection to parts of the amendment. I have no argument with the part of it which states: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann notes with concern an increase in the incidence of certain types of crime as revealed in the latest reports of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo; This is the situation as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that Dáil Éireann expresses its full confidence in the security forces of the State.  There is no question whatsoever of a lack of confidence in the security forces of the <Col N="530" /> State.  There is no question whatsoever of any lack of confidence in the Garda force or any intimation of such in my motion.  I have every confidence in our Garda force.  I have every confidence in their loyalty to the State and its people.  I have every confidence in their desire effectively to do their work in an efficient and proper way. I have not confidence, however, that everything possible is being done to protect old and young people and their property.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the part of the Minister's amendment which says: &ldquo;expresses satisfaction at the continued maintenance of the rule of law&rdquo;.  The rule of law has a twofold connotation.  It means that accused people are dealt with speedily, effectively and fairly.  It also means that the rule of the gangster and the vandal does not prevail.  Can we be confident that either part of that concept is in a healthy state?</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner, in his report for 1975, says that there has been an increase of 8,291 indictable crimes for 1975 over the number for 1974.  Surely the Minister can see how the wording of his amendment is contradicted here by the Garda Commissioner in his report?  The increase in indictable crimes I have just mentioned is an increase of approximately 21 per cent over 1974 and is most marked in the offences against property with violence crime group.  It is unfortunate that the percentage detection rate for 1975 is down by about 5 per cent on that for 1974.  It is very disturbing that approximately 27,337 crimes went undetected for the year in question.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate I will welcome a statement by the Minister on this because this is a very disturbing aspect in the Commissioner's report.  It is frightening to learn that well over half the crimes recorded, 26,807, happened in the Dublin area.  I was unable to find the percentage of this number of crimes that were detected.  I hope the Minister will be able to get this figure and make it available to the House and the public.  The increase in this particular type of crime in the Dublin <Col N="531" /> area is unfortunately an increase of 20 per cent over the figure for 1974. This being so, how can the Minister say that he is satisfied with this situation? How can he honestly ask that Dáil Éireann expresses its satisfaction at the continued maintenance of the rule of law?</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister can see in the offences against the property with violence group that there has been an increase of approximately 3,500 crimes, which represents a staggering increase of nearly 27 per cent, of which almost 54 per cent occurred in Dublin.  The breaking and entering offences have increased considerably and are naturally a very great worry and a source of great concern to all of us.  I am sorry that I cannot share the Minister's view of the situation as I see it outlined in his amendment.  I am sorry that I cannot express my satisfaction at the situation.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that larcenies, frauds and related crimes show a sharp increase.  It is very regrettable that in this area, while we have had for 1975, 29,365 such offences approximately 18,000 of those offences remain undetected. The situation, as far as armed robberies and attempted armed robberies are concerned, is that we had 153 cases for 1975 and, regrettably in 99 cases out of that total no people were charged.  Instead of expressing satisfaction at the continued maintenance of law and order, as the Minister does and wants Dáil Éireann to do, I find that the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána says: &ldquo;that the overall crime picture can only be described as disturbing&rdquo;.  I am sure the Commissioner is a very modest man and certainly a man who could never be accused of exaggerating the situation. From the facts given to us by the Garda Commissioner the situation to me is much worse than just disturbing. It is horrible.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner of the Garda Síochána says that criminals are becoming more vicious and mean.  He says that attacks on old and disabled people in their homes are now on the increase.  This crime was unknown until very recently.  This, in my view, is <Col N="532" /> not just disturbing and certainly not something with which to express satisfaction. It is horrible.  I respectfully request the Minister for Justice to make known, during his contribution to this debate, in an open and straightforward way what his views are on the situation, what his proposals are and what the proposals of the Government are to make sure that everything possible will be done to assist our Garda force in their efforts to combat crime.</P>
    <P>I would like to express my satisfaction at the decrease in other offences, particularly indecent assaults on women, young and old.  I gather there was a decrease of approximately 30 per cent in those crimes.  I am also glad that the publication of the Commissioner's report for 1975 coincides with this debate this evening because it gives Members an opportunity to air their views on very certain and most important matters.  I am sure that now, because of the publicity of the facts contained in the Commissioner's report, many people outside the House are confirmed in their views and are worried about the situation. I have had numerous incidents reported to me by people who were extremely dissatisfied and gravely upset and worried with the law and order situation at present.  I ask the Minister to accept that this concern being expressed is a genuine concern.  It is so genuine that something must be done about it immediately.</P>
    <P>The ordinary lay person reading the report of the Commissioner for 1975 will, naturally, have important questions to ask.  One purpose this debate will serve is that we may get answers to some of the questions from the Minister for Justice.  One question I should like to ask is: Why are we losing the battle slowly but surely against crime?  Are we reaching the situation where we may have to acknowledge that crime after all does pay?  Why are crimes on the increase and the rate of detection on the decrease when more money than ever before is being made available to our police force?  A question must be asked as to what the future holds for our people, not alone for those living in our cities but those living in rural areas also.  Are those who believe that <Col N="533" /> people are no longer safe in their homes to be confirmed in their belief by what can be seen in the report of the Commissioner?  Must they fear for their lives at every hour of the day and night?  The question that is always being asked is: What protection is available to them if they need help?</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, many of those people in trouble when looking for help and protection were not able to get it when it was most required.  It is a fact&mdash;the Minister knows this better than I&mdash; that help often arrived to some of these people many hours after it was sought and, in some cases, days after it was sought.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister, the House, and the public, that I get no pleasure in saying that I am convinced that ordinary people are genuinely terrified in their homes.  It is unfortunate that there is nothing in the report of the Commissioner that will give such people any relief or any indication that they will have a safer future.  The last time I had an opportunity of speaking on this subject was last May on an Adjournment Debate arising out of a parliamentary question to the Minister for Justice.  On that occasion the Chair did not think it proper to allow me propose a Private Members' Motion. During the course of his contribution the Minister for Justice&mdash;it was only a 30-minute debate and, in fairness to the Minister, he had only ten minutes to say what he wanted to say&mdash;went to great pains to ensure that nothing was left unchallenged on the record which, as he said, might bring undue alarm and unease or might give the impression here, or further afield, that law and order had broken down.  The Minister said then that nothing could be further from the truth.  Since then we have had a declaration of a state of emergency and the introduction of an Emergency Powers Bill resulting in steps which necessitated derogation from the European Convention of Human Rights.  On the occasion of that debate last May the Minister said, as reported at column 778 of the Official Report of that date:</P>
    <P>There was an unfortunate rash of robberies some weeks ago but I am precluded, happily, from commenting <Col N="534" /> on them because the vast majority are <i>sub judice.</i> They are <i>sub judice</i> because we have an active, intelligent, dedicated, loyal police force whose morale is of the highest.  If the position were as Deputy Collins wants to present it to the House, of a dispirited force with no morale, the position which prevents us debating these matters would not have arisen.</P>
    <P>At that time there was nothing to prevent the Minister from speaking about the 99 armed or attempted armed robberies during 1975 for which no person has still been charged.  Surely the Minister knew last May that the rash of armed robberies he spoke of did not begin a few weeks prior to that debate or did not begin with the number of robberies from unarmed and unprotected trains about that time? Surely the Minister does not want the House to believe that he knew nothing about the 153 armed robberies of 1975 and the number of these cases for which nobody was charged?  The Minister must be aware of the situation as it is.</P>
    <P>During the course of his reply the Minister might tell us what the situation is for the 11 months of 1976 in relation to armed robberies or attempted armed robberies.  It may be too early for the Minister to give the number of these cases for which persons were charged but if we go back to January we will find that in the Dublin area alone we had seven armed robberies.  In February there were ten armed robberies in that city and 20 armed robberies in March. Four or five years ago if we had an armed robbery it occurred only once every six months and was given banner headlines in our national newspapers but they are happening with such regularity nowadays that one must look to the bottom of pages three, four or five to find a mention of them.</P>
    <P>The whole question of security, and what is meant by security, must come under scrutiny.  Any decision by the Government which resulted in the removing of gardaí from mail trains carrying large sums of money must come under scrutiny.  Any decisions of a Government who allow post office vans carrying large sums of <Col N="535" /> money to travel regularly throughout the country without security must come under scrutiny.  If we cannot improve our security standards in this regard we are encouraging criminals to help themselves.  In August, 1975, the Government, and the Minister for Justice, deliberately decided to cut back on the amount of overtime work being done by gardaí.  The implementation by the Minister for Justice of these financial restrictions has prevented the Garda Síochána from doing the work they want to do, combating crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister, being the astute politician he is, has tried on every occasion to deny that there have been cutbacks on overtime but, of course, that is not true.  The Minister said he restricted the growth in overtime, as reported in column 779 of the Official Report of 5th May.</P>
    <P>The Garda Representative Body, a body for whom we all have nothing but the highest respect and regard, have publicly contradicted the Minister and vehemently said the cutback in overtime is responsible, to a great extent, for the dramatic increase in crime and the noticeable decrease in crime detection.  The Garda Representative Body say they have been angered by the Minister's denial.  They say the Minister was in grave error.  They say definitely the cutback exists.  They say it is serious and sustained and is having a most serious effect on the level and quality of the service given by the Garda to the general public.</P>
    <P>They say the cutback in overtime is responsible for a grave diminution of Garda presence on the streets.  They say it is also responsible for the widespread grounding of squad cars and patrol cars, leaving the public unprotected in sensitive areas at sensitive times.  The cutback in overtime naturally exposes members of the Garda to unnecessary dangers because of the lack of back-up services.  The Garda have gone so far as publicly to contradict the Minister.  They say the Minister earlier acknowledged the existence of a cutback when members of the representative body met him on September 4th, 1975.</P>
    <P>It is reported that, on that occasion, <Col N="536" /> the Minister told the members of the representative body that the scale of overtime was such as to make it impossible for him to argue with his colleagues in Government that there should not be a cutback in the light of the serious state of the economy.  This is now seen by all as a grave error by the Minister in trying to achieve economy irrespective of the consequences. It was a false economy on the part of the Government and now its signs are clearly seen in the huge crime increase and in the non-availability of Garda properly to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of the cutback, Garda patrol cars were kept on the roads even when it was necessary to employ gardaí on overtime to crew them.  The Garda say a system of beat tolerance in Dublin and certain other areas ensured a minimum level of street patrolling.  Emergency duties were undertaken by gardaí on overtime when no other members of the force were available.  Immediately after the cutback was introduced by the Minister for Justice, at the behest of the Government, Garda cars were grounded, beat tolerance was discontinued, back-up services which are so vital to an effective police force were cut back and directions were issued changing previous policy towards the employment of gardaí on overtime in the investigation of crime.</P>
    <P>The Garda said a strict system of financial control was introduced which made certain that the cutback was deep and effective.  An examination of the overtime records in any police station would show how effective and how severe the cutback is in reality. The Garda Representative Body hold the view that the cutback has been implemented for its own sake and without any regard whatsoever for the effect it is having either on the crime rate or on the morale of the Garda, who now see duties previously regarded as essential being practically completely disregarded.</P>
    <P>The Garda Representative Body say their members are especially worried because of the effect the cutback has on their safety.  If this cutback continues to be applied, as it was in the earlier stages, to members of the force <Col N="537" /> on Border duties, that will be dreadful and, to my mind, it will show a disregard for the safety of members of the Garda who have the very difficult task of police work in Border areas.  Throughout the length and breadth of the country members of the Garda can only look in one way at the Minister's denial that there has been a cutback in overtime.  They know best when they look at the Minister's denial.  Unfortunately for the sake of our democracy and democratic institutions, they can only look at it with disbelief and with disillusionment.</P>
    <P>Their comments on the consequences of the cutback in overtime imposed on them by the Minister at the behest of the Government were conveyed to the Garda Commissioner last March.  They requested the Commissioner to convey their views to the Minister.  The Minister has remained silent on the Garda comments and on their views as to how his actions, at the behest of the Government, are having such a disastrous effect on their operations and showing how false the economy is.  Naturally the Minister should be worried about the truth of the situation as outlined to him by the Garda.  Naturally when the Garda started talking about trade unions and the right to strike, this played on his mind, troubled his conscience and showed him the falseness of the economy he was effecting.</P>
    <P>When the Minister spoke at a passing out parade at the Garda Training Centre in Templemore on Friday, July 16th, 1976, he said to the young new gardaí there that afternoon that loyalty means the ability to stay silent under the pressure of a grievance when its public expression could lead to unease and misunderstanding.  In the interests of what is involved, the Garda Representative Body have the right, the duty and obligation to speak up when they see their best efforts to combat crime being thwarted by a Government whose prime consideration is to effect economies irrespective of the consequences.  Now we can see the consequences in the report by the Commissioner for 1976.  Now we can see the consequences which are listed for us in the crime report for 1975, mainly due to the cutback.  The facts <Col N="538" /> listed in this report prove without doubt that the Minister was wrong and the Garda were right.  Unfortunately that is so.</P>
    <P>The Minister is on record last May in this House trying to play down the level of violence and criminality.  He did not accept that the crime situation was out of hand.  He said we were relatively free of serious crime.  Does the Minister still hold this view and, if so, who is supplying him with the information on which he is basing his view?</P>
    <P>I believe that in holding this view the Minister could not be further from the truth of the situation.  I believe it is not on the advice of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána that he is stating this view.  The Commissioner has all the facts at his disposal and could not give advice to the Minister along those lines, because it would be contrary to the facts, and the Commissioner would not advise contrary to the facts.  It is unfortunate that the Minister's head-in-the-sand attitude and his mentality have severely damaged the morale of the ordinary member of the force.</P>
    <P>Spokesmen for the Garda are on record as saying that increasing disillusionment is clearly seen among its members, not alone in the crime problem but also in matters of welfare and force morale.  They say that right across the board the Garda Síochána are faced with enormous and rapidly increasing problems.  The gardaí believe that right up to Government level the official reaction operates on the principle that if you do not admit their existence they will disappear.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the gardaí have publicly said that matters have recently come to a head with the emergence of problems which concern not only the Garda Síochána but the community as a whole.  They say we are now facing a situation in which the criminal <i>de facto</i> rules our streets and our countryside and that the morale of a once proud police force now lies battered. They say this without any joy or satisfaction but they say it with honesty and conviction when they say the criminal is winning and that the public are losing.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána, through their <Col N="539" /> spokesmen, are speaking of the armed robber, the mugger, the burglar, the thief, for whom, unfortunately, in recent years our streets and our countryside are wide open because of the lack of Garda patrols.  Does the Minister believe that our children are safe as they go about their ordinary day's activities, whether it be school, games, discos or dances?  Does the Minister believe that our old people living alone are safe in their isolation, as it might be in rural Ireland, or seclusion, as it might be in an urban area?</P>
    <P>The Minister is, I am sure, aware of the public invitation issued to him by spokesmen for the Garda Síochána to walk down O'Connell Street in Dublin or, indeed, O'Connell Street in Limerick, some night after dark alone, or an invitation to visit elderly, terrified residents of flats and houses around our cities and towns.  I believe that if the Minister could only accept this five- or six-month-old invitation to see things for himself, then there would be a hope that he would convince his Government colleagues that they should ease the financial restrictions which are choking the very life out of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Garda themselves have been clamouring for additional strength to take on the growing menace of ordinary crime, much of which they say has to go uninvestigated at times, and of course, preventative policing disappeared into thin air about 15 months ago.  The Garda say that the effect on their morale is disastrous.  Yet last May the Minister is on public record as saying in this House that their morale is of the highest.  With all due respect to the Minister as a person for whom I have a high regard, I must say in this case I believe the Garda.</P>
    <P>There are two basic requirements if the Garda are to combat crime.  First, I say even late in the day to the Minister for Justice, to let the existing gardaí back on the streets to do the job the public want them to do, the job the gardaí themselves are prepared to do.  The gardaí, as citizens of this country, want to do their policing, the work they are trained for, in the <Col N="540" /> most effective manner.  I ask the Minister to please let them do it.  Would he endeavour to convince his Government colleagues of their wrong judgment, of their mistake, in trying to effect economies here which have been proved to many as being false economies?</P>
    <P>We urgently need many more gardaí.  The 500 extra gardaí announced by the Minister as a result of a Government decision of June 18th last, and still not recruited, are not likely to be recruited before Christmas. This number will not be enough or anywhere near enough to do the job that has to be done.  A conservative estimate of our additional requirements, in my view from what I have learned from my discussions, is between 2,000 and 3,000 extra recruits. This Government stand accused of deliberately slowing down trainee Garda recruiting.  Templemore Garda training centre was virtually unoccupied with trainee gardaí in recent times, and I believe it is well below capacity.  The Government did announce last June the recruitment of an extra 500 Garda recruits.  That was six months ago, and the Government have done nothing about it since.  I am sorry, I have wronged the Government here.  They did do something about it. They changed the method of intake of recruits into the force, which will naturally slow down recruitment many more months.  Certainly it will be many more months before these men, who are urgently required, will be on the streets.</P>
    <P>The best recipe for putting down crime is the likelihood of detection and with detection, punishment.  For too long the Minister allowed disputes about the legal aid system to drag on, involving first the solicitors and later the barristers.  The result was that the trials of many accused could not take place.  District justices and judges were obliged to release them on bail, often a very nominal bail.  The result has been that even in the cases where crimes were detected they were not processed with the promptitude required. I understand that at present there is a great backlog of cases in all courts.  I understand also that if the <Col N="541" /> Special Criminal Court did not receive one new case it would take it approximately a year to process those in the pipeline already.</P>
    <P>Is this the right basis for fighting crime?  The two go together and let no one, the Minister or anybody else, accuse me of introducing knocking arguments.  There should be a police force at full strength with proper equipment properly deployed, and once a crime is detected there should be a court system deployed and equipped to receive and process the cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thought I would offer, having listened to Deputy Collins, is that in endeavouring to paint a picture to justify his original motion the Deputy has endeavoured to paint a picture of rampant and endemic crime, of a place where people are afraid to go about their lawful business, where the police are ineffective and the courts no longer function properly.  He endeavoured to paint a picture of a nation in a totally lawless condition.  To any casual observer that must seem a gross exaggeration.  It is so far removed from reality as to be incredible.  The Deputy's contribution was made in tones of indignation.  He might mislead some people but those of us who know Deputy Collins will not be misled by his tone of horrified indignation.  We live in a state of emergency as a result of the existence of a subversive organisation dedicated to the overthrow of the State, an organisation being fanned by the conflagration that is taking place in the other part of this island.  The rule of law is strong in this State.  Our police and courts are effective and our citizens are at ease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the Deputy to say that the criminal is in possession of our country so defies facts that one would not believe he said it unless one had heard it.  He endeavoured to bolster his case by the selective use of statistics from the latest Garda crime report.  There are disturbing trends in that report which have been acknowledged in the amendment.  It is a matter of concern that there are increases in certain categories of crime but to paint a picture of total lawlessness <Col N="542" /> from certain increases is improper and is a misuse of the facts.  The increases mainly relate to offences against property with or without violence.  There was a substantial numerical increase in these offences, mainly in the last quarter of 1975.  As a result the total increase in crime figures in the calendar year 1975, as compared with the 1974 figures, which relate to the year ended 30th September, 1974, was 20.7 per cent.  This, however, is not comparing like with like and in fact a comparison between the two calendar years shows an increase of 15.3 per cent, which is a significant difference.  Deputy Collins failed to pinpoint one significant and heartening figure in the report.  He omitted to point out that offences against the person, which I consider to be the most serious offence, have decreased in the period in question by no less than 14.8 per cent.  That figure was in the same column from which Deputy Collins quoted.  It is a dishonest use of statistics to use them to bolster an unreal case.</P>
    <P>Let us go deeper into the figures. In the category of offences against property, the offence of breaking and entering premises is a serious one. Housebreaking and breaking into shops, warehouses and so on showed a significant increase over the previous year.  The biggest increase in this category is in the offence of larceny from unattended vehicles. This offence has been causing a considerable amount of concern and it will have to be combated, primarily by the owners of vehicles.  They have a duty to make sure that their vehicles are securely locked and in safe parking places.  When we examine this percentage increase on which Deputy Collins bases his claim, we find that the biggest input is the increase in the offence of larceny from unattended vehicles.  So much for his case that fear stalks this land. Deputy Collins's exaggerated picture is not sustained by the report from which he quoted.</P>
    <P>The provisional crime figures for 1976 show an estimated 36,950 indictable crimes during the first nine months of the year.  If they are projected on a 12-month basis they work <Col N="543" /> out at 49,200 crimes or an increase of less than 2 per cent on 1975.  This indicates that the 1975 trends, bearing in mind that the main input relates to the offence of larceny from unattended vehicles, are not being maintained. These facts should be made known so that the gloomy analysis of Deputy Collins can be seen in its true light.  To suggest that we are living in a State where the rule of law has broken down is false.</P>
    <P>A comparison of figures with our neighbouring common law jurisdiction might be of interest.  I propose to give the number of crimes per 100,000 of population.  In the London metropolitan area the number is 6,000.  In the rest of England and Wales the number is 4,000, and in Ireland it is 1,600.  So much for the Deputy's suggestion that there has been a breakdown in law and order.  I am entitled to say that he has done a disservice to the country and to the people who might be considering this country as a place of investment or for holidays. These matters should be put in perspective.</P>
    <P>The most vicious type of crime is that of the offence against the person, and that in the year 1975 showed a decrease of 14.8 per cent over the preceding crime year.  That is the most significant figure in the crime report under consideration.  This is a figure that was staring Deputy Collins in the face when he was reading this crime report but for some unknown reason he chose to ignore that figure and, he having chosen to ignore it, I submit that his entire case was false and exaggerated. We are not happy or content with the present position but I will indicate some action that is being taken to ensure that the continuing battle to keep crime in control is being fought successfully and well.  In 1972-73&mdash;I do not have to tell the Deputy what a watershed 1973 was in the life of this country&mdash;the provision for the Garda Síochána was £23.279 million whereas in 1976 that figure is £57.837 million, an increase of approximately 140 per cent.  Garda strength on 28th February, 1973, was 7,525 and on 31st October, 1976, it <Col N="544" /> was 8,477, an increase of 952.  Notwithstanding the belittling efforts of Deputy Collins, a further 500 are being recruited&mdash;I am disappointed with the slow rate of recruitment&mdash;and that will bring the force to an all-time high of 9,002.  The number of Garda cars has increased by 115 from 1973, and overall cars engaged on police work have travelled an extra million-and-a-quarter miles this year as compared with 1973.</P>
    <P>These statistics show an active energetic Garda force doing its job in combating crime.  This is a far cry from the time when Deputy Harte in Opposition was questioning my predecessor about the state of affairs in Buncrana&mdash;when the patrol car there met an emergency it could only contact the local station by hurrying to the nearest telephone kiosk to make a phone call because the radio of the car was antiquated and it did not work.  Every car now is equipped with the most modern radio equipment. The use of computers has now been introduced into the Garda force and this is leading to increased efficiency.</P>
    <P>It was sought to suggest that the restriction on the growth of overtime which I introduced in 1975 has been a contributing factor to the increase in the crime figures.  The expenditure on overtime in 1975 was £8.441 million, the estimate for 1976 is £5 million, or a reduction of 40 per cent. The comparison of overtime expenditure and crime statistics for the first nine months of 1974, 1975 and 1976 is as follows&mdash;I take nine months because we have only nine months of 1976 with which to compare&mdash;1974 overtime expenditure was £5.104 million and the indictable crime was 31,436.  Expenditure for the first nine months of 1975 was £6.826 million, indictable crime rose to 34,375.  Expenditure for the first nine months of 1976 was £3.743 million, indictable crime was 36,950. These figures show that, despite an increase of £1.7 million or 34 per cent on expenditure in overtime in the first nine months of 1975 over the corresponding period of 1974, the crime statistic for that period increased by 9.3 per cent.  Although the expenditure on overtime for the <Col N="545" /> first nine months of 1976 showed a reduction of 45 per cent on the expenditure in the same period of 1975, the increase in crime was less, at 7.5 per cent.  To attempt to show a mathematical equation between the volume of overtime and the volume of crime is nonsense.  There is no relationship between the two.  The total crime figures for 1976, as known for the first nine months and projected on a 12 months' basis, show that the level of increase this year over last year will be about 2 per cent.  That is a gratifying sign that the rate of increase in 1975 over 1974 is not being maintained but is being slowed down.  Hopefully in the following year the trend will be reversed and we may begin to show a reduction in the incidence of crime.</P>
    <P>A number of other initiatives were taken to make the fight against crime more efficient.  In 1973 a major crime investigation squad was set up to deal with major indictable offences such as bank robberies.  This force originally was comprised of 13 men and in April of this year it was increased to 25 men &mdash;an inspector, four sergeants and 20 gardaí.  The detection rate for major indictable crimes in the Dublin Metropolitan Area in July of this year was 82.1 per cent, in August 55.8 per cent, in September 64.8 per cent and in October 62.1 per cent.  The detection rate for petty larcenies in the DMA for September was only 17.1 per cent, but Deputies and the public will agree that petty larcenies are notoriously difficult to detect.  I would rather see a high and thereby deterrent detection rate for serious crime than have it the other way round.  Ideally we should have a high detection rate for both types of crimes.  A further initiative that was taken was the crime task force that was set up in 1971.  That was a small force concentrating their efforts on vandalism and so on and that force has now been increased to 38 from its initial number of 27, and this is at a time when demands on the Garda for security duties along the Border are continually growing.  They are two important initiatives that have been taken as regards the Dublin Metropolitan Area, an area which causes a lot of concern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> The increasing level of public co-operation has been gratifying to the Garda Síochána over the past year. Deputies on the other side, myself and my colleagues and the Garda authorities have been asking the public for their co-operation with the Garda.  We have been making the point that the Garda can only be as effective as the public make them; we have been telling people to pass information to the Garda, that the old term &ldquo;informer&rdquo; must no longer be regarded as a dirty word and that it is a civic duty to give information to the Garda.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that the Commissioner has reported that the level of co-operation, and the volume of information, from the public which has been coming in over the past year or more has been significantly greater than heretofore.  I would urge that there be a continuation of that co-operation. The Garda can be only as effective as we make them.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputies on all sides of the House will join with me in making the request to the public to co-operate in every way possible with the Garda.  In addition, there is now at Garda headquarters a Public Relations Office.  The Garda are very interested in community leaders contacting this office with a view to deciding how relations between the police and the community in particular areas might be improved and how there might be greater co-operation and liaison between them.  This sort of situation can be particularly effective in respect of areas where there is a high degree of vandalism.  As I have said here often in reply to questions, vandalism is essentially a social crime and is a problem for the community to solve but the Garda can give professional expertise to the community and can advise as to ways and means of solving that problem.  I assure the public that the Garda are both anxious and willing to give this help. They would like to be approached by community leaders, tenants' associations and so on when help sought will be given.</P>
    <P>Another area that has caused concern in relation to crime, not only this year but also particularly in very <Col N="547" /> recent times, has been the effect of the O'Callaghan decision of 1966.  I refer to the case in the Supreme Court in which it was held that it would be contrary to the Constitution for bail to be refused on the grounds that the accused, if left at liberty, would commit other offences.  This is the case which, in effect, has meant the widespread and almost universal granting of bail in particular cases.  I do not have up-to-date statistics regarding the number of persons committing crime while on bail.  Because the compilation of those statistics was so time-consuming, the practice was discontinued in 1973 but for that year the number committing crimes while on bail was no less than 513, the number of crimes involved being 1,775.  We may take it that there has been no lessening of those depressing figures.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge among certain criminal elements that having got bail they can have several crimes for the price of one when eventually they come to trial with the result that there has been a considerable increase in the number of crimes committed by persons on bail.  Criminals when being sentenced are asking that offences committed by them while on bail be taken into account.  As a result of all this the Government are of the view that they would be reflecting public opinion by asking the people in a referendum to amend the Constitution so as to overcome the constitutional disability found by the Supreme Court in the O'Callaghan case.  Consequently it is our intention to take the opportunity of the referendum on adoption to ask the people at the same time to agree to an amending of the Constitution so that the position as found in the O'Callaghan case may be changed thereby allowing a restriction of the present universal right to bail.  It is not my wish to anticipate the debate on that amendment but having regard to the volume of concern that has been expressed to me on this matter, I am confident that the people would respond to this public need.</P>
    <P>To refuse bail on the ground that the accused might commit other offences while on bail is something <Col N="548" /> which is recognised expressly in the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is the practice in England and in other Commonwealth countries to refuse bail for this reason.  Consequently, we could go to the people on this question quite satisfied that the reply to the amendment would be a resounding yes.</P>
    <P>Regarding the overall crime situation I am concerned that there should be any increase in any category of crime but I do not share the view of Deputy Collins when he seeks to paint a picture of a lawless country in which people are afraid to go about their daily business, where the police force is ineffective and where the courts cannot cope with the number of criminals coming before them. That picture is not merely an exaggeration or a caricature, it is a gross distortion of the situation.  The Deputy made selective use of the figures from the Report on Crime of the Commissioner of the Garda.  The general public are satisfied that the rule of law prevails, that our courts and our police are effective.  There is a general desire on the part of the vast majority of our citizens to obey the laws of the land.  The people are satisfied, too, that the measures being taken to ensure that the rule of law is maintained are effective.  The figures I have quoted for expenditure on men and equipment are proof of this but the success of all this depends on the human element.  I am glad that that part of the report which expresses total confidence in our security forces finds full acceptance on the benches opposite.  I should like to echo Deputy Collins in expressing thanks to the men of the Garda and of the Defence Forces as well as to those in a service sometimes forgotten&mdash;those in the prison service whose job is particularly difficult and against whom allegations are made frequently.  However, these allegations should be treated with the contempt of silence because they are emanating from sources that are universally subversive.</P>
    <P>I should like again to put on record that the picture of this country as a lawless state is far from accurate and represents a disservice to the nation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> The rule of law is strong here.  This situation will continue to be maintained because we have a Government, a Parliament and a people dedicated to the maintenance of law, the enforcement of which will be carried out by the security forces who are loyal, efficient and of high morale.</P>
    <P>I formally move the amendment in my name:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;while noting with concern an increase in the incidence of certain types of crime as revealed in the latest Reports of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána on Crime, expresses satisfaction at the continued maintenance of the rule of law and its full confidence in the security forces of the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When one cannot win an argument on the issues as presented, one presents other issues which may be capable of being defended while ignoring what has been said and by whom it has been said.  In that sort of situation one ignores also the main issue under discussion which in this case is a matter that concerns all of us. Deputy Collins did not say that the rule of law has broken down in this country.  Neither did he say that we are living in a state of lawlessness and in so far as the Deputy made any comment on the grave increase in crime he attributed almost all of that situation to the fact that the Garda who are our main protectors against increases in crime are not equipped either by way of personnel or otherwise to deal with this worsening situation. What Deputy Collins said had been said many months ago&mdash;and this is significant&mdash;not by any Member of this House but by a journal which represents the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, significantly, made no reference to the views of the Garda, although Deputy Collins quoted their views on many occasions.  It is the Garda who have been saying whatever it is the Minister finds objectionable. It is they who have been saying whatever it is the Minister finds false and untrue.  It is they who have been saying <Col N="550" /> whatever it is the Minister finds irresponsible.  We have not imagined this.  It is the Garda who serve this nation and on whom we rely and for whom we have respect who have been saying this, but the Minister did not once refer to their concern as publicly expressed in the editorial of their publication, <i>Garda Review.</i></P>
    <P>I should like to quote from the editorial in the issue of the <i>Garda Review</i> June, 1976:</P>
    <P>There is a certain irony in the fact that within days of the Representative's Body's decision to seek the right to strike, the Minister for Justice, Mr. Cooney, should stand up in the Dáil and play down the level of violence and criminality in the Ireland of today.  He did not accept that the crime situation was out of hand.  Compared with many other European countries, he said, Ireland was still relatively free of serious crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the same this evening. The editorial continued:</P>
    <P>The official reaction, right up to cabinet level, appears to operate on the principal that if you don't admit their existence they will disappear.</P>
    <P>We say it with no joy or satisfaction, but we say it with honesty and conviction: the criminal is winning, the Garda&mdash;and the ordinary public&mdash;are losing.  And we do not speak of the subversive criminal &mdash;the IRA&mdash;we speak of the ordinary, run of the mill, villain.  We speak of the armed robber, the mugger, the burglar, the thief.  Our streets are wide open for him.  They are no longer patrolled.  Our children are his defenceless victims as they go about the ordinary things of life, walking home from a dance or a cinema or from school. Our old folk, often living alone, both in the cities and the countryside, are his victims.</P>
    <P>The Garda have said all these things, not our spokesman.  It is the responsibility of the Minister to show that what the Garda have been saying is wrong; that our concern is unfounded <Col N="551" /> and that the Garda are painting a false picture.</P>
    <P>It is the Garda on whom we rely to ensure our peace in the true sense of their title, the guardians of the peace. When they express concern we, and particularly the Minister who is responsible for this area, must respond to ensure that the conditions about which they complain are improved. We must improve them so that they can discharge their responsibilities in the way they want to.  Let the Minister acknowledge that every reference made by Deputy Collins in relation to the overall pattern of crime is confirmed in every detail by those who are charged with the responsibility of maintaining law and order, the Garda.  Let him not suggest that we are trying to heighten tensions.  If anybody in this House can be accused of that it is the Government who introduced a state of emergency.  It is they who told the world at large that there is a threat to the survival of the State; not just a threat, but that we need to have a state of emergency to ensure the survival of the State.  That is what the Government have said by asking to derogate from the Convention on Human Rights.  All ordinary laws are not sufficient to protect us and now the Minister asks us to accept his amendment which states:</P>
    <P>while noting with concern an increase in the incidence of certain types of crime as revealed in the latest Reports of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána on Crime, expresses satisfaction at the continued maintenance of the rule of law and its full confidence in the security forces of the State.</P>
    <P>Who introduced the emergency declaration? It was the Minister who is now talking about his satisfaction with the maintenance of the rule of law and order.  If the rule of law was being maintained and upheld to the extent that he asks us to express our satisfaction with, surely that repudiates the case made by the Government in introducing the state of emergency. The Government cannot have it both ways.  If anyone has painted a picture <Col N="552" /> of lawlessness it is the Government, not us.  If anyone has painted a picture of an increasing pattern of ordinary crime it is the Garda and not us.  We believe the Garda.  We believe our own experience when we see it and we believe the reactions of the people in the cities, where it is really serious, and in rural Ireland where it is on the increase.  Apparently, we know what the Minister does not wish to know.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with how the Government have been trying to deal with this matter, apart from hiding their heads in the sand and charging all of us with irresponsibility. Apparently, the Minister is satisfied that overtime has little or nothing to do with the level of crime detection. He produced figures to imply that the overtime cutback had nothing significant to do with the increase in crime in the period 1975-76.  Everybody recognises that our Garda are not as available on our streets at night as we want them to be.  The public overwhelmingly support that expression of their concern.  They want to see the Garda patrolling our streets and securing our homes.  They want to see evidence of the Garda doing the job they are best equipped to do.  We recognise at the moment that can only be done by adequate overtime facilities while we are still waiting for the 500 men.  However, instead of providing adequate overtime the Minister sees fit to cut back overtime to £5 million by comparison with the figure of £6.826 million for nine months in 1975.  We all know that £5 million this year is very much a reduction on £6.826 million in the nine-month period for last year.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is saying our position is such that we do not need this extra presence of the Garda, secured through overtime or otherwise, we totally and utterly reject it on behalf of the people who live alone and are concerned. Concern is not too strong a word because the Garda are very concerned about the people who walk our streets at night and about the people who live alone in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Government, as they have done in other areas of social importance that are costly, because <Col N="553" /> of financial stringency choose to look at the areas that cost most and cut back in those areas.  It is almost the story of the children's allowances or the school tranport all over again. We all recognise that there are areas of government that cost a lot and inevitably will cost more.  One of those areas, having regard to the reality of Irish life at the moment, is the maintenance of an adequate police force, adequate in numbers and in equipment. It is costing more and more each year and will cost more and more, but the people are prepared to recognise that.  We have said in this House before to this Minister that this is a matter on which there can be real bipartisanship and that we will not play off one against the other.  The extra money will need to be spent to guarantee an adequate police force and an adequate police presence at every time.  We could not criticise any Government or Minister who would come in here to ensure that our streets were safe and our homes secure.  Yet for some reason the Government have failed to respond to this need.</P>
    <P>It is very strange to hear the Minister responsible coming in this evening and expressing disappointment at the delay in recruiting the 500 we have heard so much about for so long.  If the Minister is not the one to be responsible for ensuring the speed of the recruitment after consultation with the Commissioners and those concerned, who is responsible? It is strange that the Minister should be expressing disappointment about a delay for which we hold him personally responsible in this House and, as Deputy G. Collins has said, all this at a time when it can hardly be stated that the Garda Training Centre at Templemore has been working at over capacity.  Throughout this last year for many months it was working at very much less than full capacity.  Nonetheless, the public recognise that there is a great need for extra young police to serve the security of this nation.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, too, the public at large recognise that there is a great need for the young men of our nation who <Col N="554" /> wish to join the Garda force and who are suitably equipped both in character and education, to be allowed to join the force.  Instead, many of them are being forced at the moment to join the ranks of the inactive and unemployed, thereby perhaps instead of combating crime, for one reason or another, because of their inactivity or frustration, helping, unfortunately, to increase the incidence of crime.  Where the young are inactive or frustrated, particularly the educated young who had expected more, obviously and inevitably it does lead to an expression of frustration, to criminal activity of one form or another.  There is where the responsibility lies.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to justify to us these decisions of the Government to cut back on either Garda recruitment, because that is in effect what is involved now, or the overtime necessary for the gardaí.  When we talk in terms of the rule of law and the maintenance of the rule of law, we are not suggesting that the rule of law as it is applied through the courts is not being upheld or that the gardaí who bring cases before the courts are inadequate or are not capable of bringing these cases.  We are saying that the Garda are not sufficiently supported by the Government in the job they have to do.  That is the case Deputy G. Collins made right through his contribution this evening.  We say to the Minister that the courts at the moment are not adequately equipped to deal with the number of cases before them.  How many times have the Minister and the public heard of the need to introduce even a second Special Criminal Court?  How many times has it been brought to their attention by representatives of the legal profession and others that the criminal courts in Dublin and elsewhere are working with a great delay? How many times have they been told that it is necessary to appoint an extra judge of the Circuit Court to deal with criminal matters?  How many times has all this been brought to the attention of the Minister?  The people who bring those things to the attention of the Minister are the people who are concerned for the maintenance of the <Col N="555" /> rule of law.  The Minister who ignores what they say in the same way as he ignores what the Garda say is the person who is in question.  He and his Government have a commitment to the rule of law, to upholding the ordinary law of the land and not just to creating hysteria or fear by introducing emergency laws which would never be necessary if the ordinary laws were upheld and if there were sufficient gardaí to deal with the breaches of security that the Government mentioned as being justification for introducing emergency laws.</P>
    <P>These are the issues about which we are concerned in this debate. These are the issues the Minister did not answer this evening.  Let me say that if the Minister was to imply that we are irresponsible or painting a picture of something which does not exist, I am afraid he will have to ignore the fact that our concern is derived from the published statements of the men most directly concerned, namely the Gárda Siochána and their representatives.  There is obvious concern that from time to time, in view of the clamp-down, which one can honestly call it, on overtime, officers of the Garda throughout the country sometimes are reluctant to do what may be necessary by way of road cordons or otherwise after the incidence of serious crime because of overtime restriction and regulation which have come through this Minister.  I am sure it has been necessary from time to time for superintendents and chief superintendents to take decisions on the spot in relation to the deployment of Garda cordons in various areas which would involve overtime inevitably. Nonetheless, there is reason to believe that sometimes these superintendents and chief superintendents, as the case might be, did not take steps that they otherwise would have taken if the restrictions on overtime as now being applied were not being applied.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude on the note that, if the Minister wants to distort the reality, let him not accuse us of distorting it.  Let him look to those who are primarily concerned with the responsibility <Col N="556" /> of ensuring our peace and security, the Garda.  If the Minister and his Government want to do something about it, then let them recognise that the price of their economic mismanagement cannot be the peace and security of the citizens of this State. Wherever else they are going to save the money it cannot be in this area, because this is the area which will be essential to maintain the rule of law that the Minister and all of us are so concerned about.  Let us at least have the issues debated accurately without the introduction of implications against us that do not square up to the facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the subject matter of Question No. 8 which was put down in the name of Deputy Faulkner:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government the rent paid to a local authority by a tenant on differential rent who was in receipt of unemployment or disability benefit of £29.40 per week prior to 17th September, 1976; and the rent paid to a local authority by a tenant on differential rent who became entitled to unemployment or disability benefit of £29.40 subsequent to 17th September, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tonight we listened to a discussion which dealt with violence, a violence that is not easy to pinpoint.  Here we <Col N="557" /> have institutional violence where we can pinpoint the situation and point the finger at the Minister for Local Government and the Government for this savage increase that has been inflicted on the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Minister told local authorities they could increase rents to meet some of the maintenance charges.  These rent increases will to a large extent hit the unemployed or the person on disability benefit.  A husband with a wife and four children who was on unemployment or disability benefit prior to 17th September paid 53p rent and with pay-related benefit £1.95.  A person in similar circumstances who became unemployed after the 17th September pays £3.44 and, on pay-related benefit paid £5.51.  Now we have the situation of two unemployed neighbours, with the same number in family and the same outgoings and income, and one pays 53p rent and the other £3.44.  This is victimising the unemployed person or the person on disability benefit.  We are hitting the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>There is no employment for these people.  Many people in my constituency, Ballyfermot, Drimnagh and elsewhere, would be glad to have employment so that they could meet their commitments and pay the higher rent. The unemployed person who did not get the recent increase in the social welfare benefits to meet the cost of living was the victim of this vicious attack by the Coalition.  Now the Minister further increases the burden on the man who, through no fault of his own, became unemployed after the 17th September.  I do not believe NATO were a party to this racket. When the unemployed examine this situation they will let the Minister know just what they think of this viscious assault.</P>
    <P>Before 17th September a man with a wife and three children had an income of £26.80 and was paying a rent of 49p.  A man in similar circumstances who became unemployed after that date pays £2.67 rent.  Where is the equity there?  When the Minister came to power we were told that the renting system was wrong and that he was the saviour of the people who paid rent. There was a rent strike at that time <Col N="558" /> because 4p were imposed to meet maintenance costs.  This is not a small increase.  The difference for a man with a wife and three children, without pay-related benefit, is an increase of £2.18.  If NATO agreed with this they should examine their consciences again.  I do not believe any reasonable man would agree with the Minister about this.  The Minister for Finance has been prodding and pushing the Minister for Local Government and he has yielded to this pressure.  He probably does not like to do this but he has done it and inflicted this injury on the weaker section of the community. This is an appalling situation. We were asked the difference a man with four children who was unemployed on 17th and another who was unemployed on 18th would have to pay, and the answer is £2.91.  If the Minister thinks that a man who became unemployed on 17th September has enough to live on with £29 less 53p rent, then justice was done in that rent scheme.  How then does he expect his next door neighbour who is in the same circumstances and became unemployed on 18th September to live on £26?  Even at this stage I ask the Minister to withdraw this rent scheme and introduce a scheme that will be fair and just to the unemployed.  This is a deliberate attempt by the Government to inflict additional hardship on the people who did not get what they were entitled to in the recent social welfare increases.  This is a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the man whose family are working and whose family income is increased by £20 or £29 a week.  He will be expected to pay an increase of 50p per week, yet the person on unemployment or disability benefit is expected to pay a further £3 a week. This is a social scandal, institutional violence at its worst and we can pinpoint the perpetrators.  If a man can get employment he should not be on low rent.  Give these people jobs.  Let them earn a decent income.  There is no point in the Minister saying that if a man is earning £29 a week he should pay the increase.  There is no man earning £29 a week; the lowest pay for a labourer is approximately £40 a week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> This is one of the most savage attacks ever launched on the weaker section of this community by this or any other Government.  They have tried to do one thing, to divide the tenants among themselves.  What will a man say when he realises that he has to pay £3.44 rent each week when his next door neighbour, also unemployed, has to pay only 53p?  There is no justice in this situation and the Minister must rectify it at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>The increases are higher as we go through this long list.  For a husband with a wife and five children the difference is even greater.  In some cases these tenants have already been charged 50p or 60p extra for central heating.  Therefore, on top of the £3.44 this man had to pay an increase for central heating and last night's rates increase will cost some corporation tenants in recently built houses another 40p per week.  This shows that the increase does not stop at £3.44.</P>
    <P>The Minister's purpose seems to be to plunge local authorities into a state of utter confusion.  One day he issues a circular to them asking them to do one thing and the next a reverse order is issued.  Last week we had a nightrider from the Custom House to the corporation with instructions to the Minister's supporters there to jackboot the outrageous rate through all opposition.</P>

      <P>The level of the rate has an enormous effect on tenants.  Is it any wonder that there are rent arrears of £1½ million?  The present rents system is iniquitous and inequitable. For instance, if a man paying the 53p rent gets temporary employment for a week or two at Christmas he will jump immediately into the £3.44 bracket.  People who are unable to do so are asked to pay outrageously high rents and consequently the local authority here suffer these massive arrears.  Local representatives are <Col N="560" /> being ignored by the Minister who appears to have ears only for groups who are not representative and who are not elected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have become used to Deputy Dowling's obtuse political contributions on this and other issues.  I might at once point out that the rent arrears in Dublin in April, 1973, when I took office, were £1.350 million and in 1976 they amounted to £1,412 million. Deputy Dowling can do his subtraction on these figures and tell us whether these arrears accumulated during the disastrous strike that occurred during Fianna Fáil's term. He spoke about Fianna Fáil's opposition to what he called unrepresentative people.  There was an unjustified attack on NATO.  This is not the first time such an attack has been launched by him and his party.  I want to make it very clear that I consider the National Association of Tenants Organisations a respectable body of men and women representing a respectable body of men and women and I am glad of their co-operation when they discuss these matters.  They make a very hard bargain and I am glad to have discussions with them.</P>
      <P>As I explained in the course of my replies to supplementary questions on the original question tabled by Deputy Faulkner, Deputy Faulkner pursued his question fairly well as far as he could.

      <P>Deputy Dowling has on more than one occasion repeated the remark of my being a stranger to the truth.  May I point out now, and not for the first time, that it was from those benches people were found telling deliberate lies by judges of the High Court and Deputy Dowling should remember that before he accuses me or anyone on these benches of not telling the truth.  As far as I am concerned, I will stand on my record inside or outside this House.  I am not afraid to go before the general public at any time and state facts.  Deputy Dowling stood up, in a fit of pique at the end of a long number of supplementary questions and, when he was not allowed by the Chair to ask another supplementary question&mdash;obviously he was not interested until then&mdash;he immediately asked permission to raise the matter on the Adjournment.  He is entitled to do so, of course, so long as the Chair allows him, but the thing about it is it shows a petty mind when someone attempts to do something like this because Deputy Dowling knows better than anybody else does the disgraceful conditions in which tenants of local authority houses were allowed to live by Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be put off by Deputy Dowling.  The National Association of Tenants Organisations were a party to this agreement.  They were speaking for the tenants, as Deputy Dowling is not, as he knows quite well himself.  Every time the question of deductions from income arose we had complaints from the benches opposite that up to now people who were working were being dealt with unfairly because of the fact that the people who were unemployed were not paying near as much and examples were quoted across the floor of the House again and again and the question asked why was this allowed. Now, we have made an arrangement, and we made that arrangement after discussing the matter with the representatives of the tenants.  At their suggestion the change was made in the rent structure and there was a clause that those who were up to the 17th September last drawing benefit would not be affected because they had been on sick or unemployment benefit for a period and therefore were not in the same position as those who would become unemployed on and after that date.  They asked that this clause be included and it was included.  To hear somebody now like Deputy Dowling coming in here talking about unfair treatment of the tenants of local authority houses would make a cat laugh because when he was on this side of the House, a backbencher, anything was good enough for the tenants in the local authority houses. Anything that was introduced he trooped through the lobby and supported and he has the hard neck now to come in here and attempt to pretend that he is the knight in shining armour out to defend the tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The change in the renting structure came about last September and was announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget.  I am not <Col N="563" /> hiding behind him.  I mention the fact there was an agreement made, a very definite commitment made and agreed to, and the Minister for Finance announced it way back long before last January, long before it came into operation.  The position was the Government had taken a comprehensive look at the disposable income of persons who became unemployed and in view of the widespread and justified criticism of the fact that many unemployed persons had a greater disposable income than when they were working decided that certain action was necessary and there was a chorus from the Fianna Fáil benches about these people who were unemployed and who were so well off they would never go to work again and, when we do something about that, they have a foot on the other side of the fence. Mark you, Fianna Fáil over the last few years have tried to have a foot on each side of the fence and have come to grief and they will find this is another exercise they will fall down on.  No income tax is payable on social benefits and, of course, while a man is unemployed he is no longer liable to pay social welfare contributions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling talked about the man getting £40 a week.  Unfortunately there are many people in this city who are not getting £40 a week&mdash; he knows that just as well as I do&mdash; and they are paying as much in rent, and sometimes slightly more than, the man who is unemployed.  But there is now a measure of justice in what is being done because of the fact that nobody can now say one man is getting away with 55p per week and someone else, who goes out at eight o'clock in the morning to work and comes back at six or half past six in the evening, getting almost the same income as the man who is unemployed, is in fact paying £3 or £4 a week.  This is what everybody wanted and, when it was done, Deputy Dowling decided there was something in this for him and he would come in here and shout in this House to pretend he was very annoyed about the unfortunate council tenants.  My word, if they were depending on Deputy <Col N="564" /> Dowling and his crowd they would be in a pretty bad way.  I suggest the Deputy's real grievance is not that some people may have to pay a higher rent but that the man who is unemployed on 17th September last should also be subject to a higher rent liability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Deputy was saying before this&mdash;this would be unfair to the man who was unemployed for a long period.  There are two very important points of difference between the present national differential rent scheme and the scheme imposed by Fianna Fáil Ministers for Local Government on local authorities and their tenants, differences which Deputy Faulkner has chosen to ignore.  First, the assessable income, not the total income, of the principal earner is relatively low.  He gets a personal allowance of £7 a week plus 83p a week for each child and he is then asked to pay only 1/12th of the remaining income in rent.  Contrast this with the Fianna Fáil scheme under which the principal earner got a personal allowance of only £1 to £2 a week and a children's allowance only at the discretion of the local authority and then, no matter how small his income, he was assessed for rent on 1/7th of the remainder. Which system would any tenant opt for?  The tenants know when they are doing well and Deputy Dowling will find that at the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second important feature of our new rents scheme is the discretion given to local authorities to agree in cases of genuine hardship to accept from a tenant for a specified period a lesser sum for rent than would ordinarily be due by him.  There was no similar concession in Fianna Fáil's scheme of rents.  The arrangement was made, as I say, with NATO and there is no question that they were opposed to it and I believe they represent the tenants and Deputy Dowling knows that too.  What sort of a city councillor is Deputy Dowling if he does not know that there is such a thing operated by Dublin Corporation as a rates waiver scheme under which <Col N="565" /> deserving persons, such as unemployed persons, persons on disability benefit and old age pensioners, can have part of their rates waived and corporation tenants can benefit the same as any other ratepayer?  Deputy Dowling should know these things and not be making a damn fool of himself coming in here.</P>

    <P>Four claims were allowed at reduced pension rates&mdash;one at £7.30 plus £3.60 a week for an adult dependant; one at £7.30 a week; one at <Col N="462" /> £5.00 plus £2.45 a week for an adult dependant; and one at £2.70 plus £1.30 a week for an adult dependant.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the approximate Exchequer contribution in 1976 to the following types of social welfare benefit: contributory old age pension, retirement pension, contributory widow's pension, non-contributory old age pension and non-contributory widow's pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to old age contributory pension, retirement pension and widow's contributory pension is not available.  These, like all social insurance benefits, are payable out of the Social Insurance Fund, which is financed by contributions by employers, employees and the Exchequer.  The Exchequer contribution is the amount by which the income of the fund is less than its expenditure but it is not apportioned between the different benefits.</P>
      <P>The cost of old age non-contributory and widow's non-contributory pensions is borne in full by the Exchequer.  It is estimated that the following amounts will be paid in 1976 on these services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment of unemployment benefit has not been refused to the person concerned.  She required to have at least 26 contributions paid or credited in respect of the 1974-75 contribution year to entitle her to unemployment benefit on her claim of 4th October, 1976.  As her insurance record showed no paid contributions and only four credited contributions in that year, inquiries had to be made about the stamping of her 1974-75 insurance card.  While these inquiries have not been fully completed it has been found possible to allow her credit in respect of sufficient contributions to enable payment to be made to her at a reduced weekly rate of £8.90.  Arrangements have been made for payment at that rate during the present week of all unemployment benefit due to her.  Further payments will continue as they fall due.</P>
      <P>The question of her entitlement to unemployment benefit at a higher rate will be considered when the inquiries regarding the stamping of her 1974-75 card have been completed.</P>

      <P>The person concerned required to have at least 26 employment contributions paid or credited in respect of the 1975 contribution year to entitle him to unemployment benefit on his claim of 18th September, 1976.  His Irish insurance record showed that he had only 11 contributions in that year but as he had also been employed in Great Britain in 1975 the British authorities were asked to supply particulars of his contribution record there.  As soon as this information was received his claim was allowed and arrangements have been made for payment during the present week of all unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit due to him. Further payments will continue as they fall due.</P>

When this had been confirmed payment, including an allowance in respect of the child concerned, was resumed at the full rate.</P>

      <P>The question of the introduction of computer studies as a formal subject into the programme for secondary schools is one for consideration normally in the context of the desires of the school authorities as these are made known from time to time.</P>
      <P>There is, however, sufficient flexibility in the existing programme to enable school authorities to respond to the increasing use of computers by introducing pupils to an awareness of the significance of computer studies. It is in this context that the work on computers mentioned by the Deputy is being done outside school hours by a number of interested teachers in secondary schools.  These teachers have attended summer courses on computers which have been organised by my Department in co-operation with the Computer Education Society of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible within current resources to consider providing schools with their own computers or computer terminals.  The existing facilities in the regional technical colleges are fully used by their own students and staff. Plans have been developed for the expansion of these facilities and in that context consideration can be given in due course to the question of services being provided by regional <Col N="473" /> technical colleges for second level schools in their area.</P>
