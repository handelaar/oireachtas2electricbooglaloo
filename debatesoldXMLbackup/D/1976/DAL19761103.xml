      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to impress upon the Government the necessity to take a look at the SDA loans scheme by which local authorities are empowered to issue loans for the purchase of houses.  At the moment the loan limit is £4,500 and the income limit is £2,350.  This figure was last revised by the Government in May, 1973, when the average price of a house which would qualify for a loan was about £5,000.  Today the average price of a house is £8,000 and yet the loan and the income limits are unchanged. It is almost impossible for a couple to accept the local authority loan and find £3,500 to make up the deposit on an £8,000 house if one considers that a person with over £46 per week will not qualify.  Building societies will give a higher loan, but recently the interest rate for loans from building societies has risen to 14 per cent.  Not alone that, but a fortnight ago a leading building society in Dublin announced that they would take no more loan applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third alternative for people <Col N="880" /> seeking houses is to go on the local authority housing list, but the situation here is also hopeless, because in Dublin alone there are over 8,000 families on the waiting list, despite the good record of Dublin Corporation in building houses.  It is hard to understand why the Government will not inject the necessary capital into housing so that the much needed dwellings can be prepared.  Such a financial injection would take many building craftsmen off the unemployment register, and they could work on the provision of houses for the people.  Some time ago the Minister for Local Government said he was able to take money from the SDA fund, thereby implying that there is too much there.  The money is there, but the point is that it is too dear for people to borrow it.  Those who can afford to take it would not qualify because their incomes would be too high.</P>
    <P>The Government should recognise the need of young couples who are brave enough to try to set up house for themselves.  They simply cannot do it.  I appeal to the Minister and to the Government to be realistic and to provide the necessary finances, which would also boost the building trade. Fewer and fewer couples are availing of the SDA loans.  In Dublin in 1975, 182 loans were issued for new houses to people who qualified.  In the course of nine months this year only 42 were issued.  The SDA scheme also provides loans for older houses, and last year Dublin Corporation issued 590 loans and for nine months this year only about 200 were issued.  It is no wonder that the construction industry is depressed. The private sector, which is the biggest section in relation to house construction, is being starved of the necessary money which would keep the building construction industry going.  Unemployment of building workers is rising all the time.  The Government could provide enough money to get the SDA scheme going as it should be going if they wanted to.  One can readily appreciate the dilemma of a young couple taking a loan from a building society who were informed last week or so that the interest rates are rising to just <Col N="881" /> 14 per cent.  I know a case where a young couple were paying £25 per week in repayments to a building society and that was before the recent increases. If we are to have a decent standard of living, proper housing is a basic need. The Government are watching the housing construction industry grind to a halt because of the lack of finance. The people who borrow SDA loans are willing to take their share of the burden; they do not want anything for nothing.  They are a great asset to our society but they are being deprived of this basic right to have proper housing by the amazing indifference of the Government towards this most pressing need.</P>
    <P>I find it very hard to understand that any Government would deny money to the housing and construction industry. The building industry is the catalyst to prosperity.  If you keep the building trade going, you keep many ancillary industries going.  Look at the figures for unemployment today.  In the past two years in the private sector there has been a drop in employment in the trade of almost 15,000 people.  In fact, 25 per cent of the total work force in the private sector have become unemployed. This has many repercussions, apart from the drop in the number of houses being built, and that number has dropped considerably. Whether it is in Dublin city or county or Cork city and county, there is the same picture of a fall in housing figures, more people forced onto local waiting lists, and the building societies refusing, in one case at least, to accept any more applications.</P>
    <P>Was there ever such a gloomy picture of the housing and construction industry?  Any figures I have given here this morning are taken from the official statistics.  I take no pleasure in pointing out the gloomy scene on the housing front.  I would much prefer to be here offering praise for the steps being taken to boost that industry and keep it going at its maximum capacity.  In the official figures issued by the Government one can see only a picture of gloom.  We on this side of the House may be accused of spreading gloom, but we are doing no such thing.</P>
    <P>If quoting official figures of unemployment <Col N="882" /> in the housing and construction industries, or the fall off in the number of houses being built, or the number of applications for SDA loans, or the fact that building societies would not accept any further applications, is spreading gloom, we must lay the blame for that gloom firmly on the doorstep of the Government who pretend everything is going well and that there is enough money for housing, even though we can use their own figures to show there is not. The Government are offering no hope to young families who are battling to meet their repayments.  If they have a loan from a building society, they see their mortgage rate increasing almost annually.  If they go to the local authorities for an SDA loan, they may not earn over £46 a week.  You do not have to be an economist to realise that, if you are trying to repay an £8,000 loan on £46 a week, you will not be able to eat very much.</P>
    <P>The Government now have a glorious opportunity to show their election promises had some little degree of sincerity.  They promised to provide adequate moneys to sustain the housing drive, and not only to sustain it but to increase it.  Their strange silence on this matter so far gives no hope to anyone who is interested in the housing drive, whether as a borrower or as a person interested in the social aspect of housing.  The deafening silence of the Government on the lack of housing finance is to be wondered at.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, one does not have to be an economist to recognise that the housing and construction industry in general is a barometer for the economic elements.  If the Government want to see what they are doing, I suggest they should look at the housing figures.  When Fianna Fáil were in office I said I would judge them by their progress on the housing front.  Be it said that Fianna Fáil never allowed a shortage of money to hold up the housing drive. They had their difficulties, too, but they found the money and they built the houses.  They kept as many craftsmen as possible at work in the building industry.  If, as is generally hinted, people in the construction industry are <Col N="883" /> pro-Fianna Fáil, that is so because they got a fair deal from Fianna Fáil Governments throughout the years.</P>
    <P>The housing and construction industry is now grinding to a halt and no effort is being made by the Government to prevent that drift to chaos.  I appeal to the Government to inject sufficient money into that industry so that it can progress at a rate which will give some hope to the people who want to be housed.  Too many of our people are still living in unfit housing conditions.  It is the Government's duty to ensure that those conditions are alleviated.</P>

      <P>This is supposed to be a serious debate on the economy, but really it is very difficult to accept that it is being so regarded by the Opposition when one listens to Deputy Moore telling the House the building industry is grinding to a halt.</P>
      <P>At the end of the present year, that is, after four years of the present Government in office, it will be shown that no less than 100,000 houses have been built.  Previously, the best four years ever for Fianna Fáil produced 60,000 houses.  This is an indication of the seriousness of the Opposition in this whole debate.  What they are seeking is not an opportunity to seriously discuss the economy and make worthwhile recommendations, but an opportunity to criticise the Government and, I am sorry to have to say, to dishonestly criticise the performance of the Government.</P>
      <P>We have been through probably the most difficult period in the history of this country, a period when the Government had to provide enormous sums of money, not only to carry on the services, as Deputy Moore has said, but to expand substantially housing output, to expand substantially the services necessary to keep such housing output going, and to do what we promised to do, as he says, in our election promises, to increase substantially social welfare benefits to the less fortunate people in this community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Government, I suppose, can be described as faultless but, if this <Col N="884" /> Government are to be faulted, it is because we have gone too far too quickly.  We have gone so far in the social welfare area that we are now open to the criticism that there are abuses in this area.  Of course there are abuses in this area.  I would say they are much more limited than people generally say, but there are abuses, and there will always be abuses.  We certainly have done more for the poorer classes than any previous Government, and nobody can deny this.  Of course changes are needed.  We all know what is wrong. To say we have no plans and no policy is absolute nonsense.  We know what is wrong and the Opposition know what is wrong.  We do not need any McKinseys to tell us what is wrong. We do not need to go outside the country for advice.  It is too obvious to everybody.</P>
    <P>What must be changed is people's attitudes.  How will we change attitudes? We talk about restraint.  The Opposition talk about the need for restraint.  We all know restraint is needed.  How do we get people to accept this?  How are we to rectify a situation where a lot of people are unemployed and a few unofficial strikers perhaps can keep 1,000 people out of an industry and where it takes so long to settle this sort of dispute? We are trying to put people into jobs. A simple, frivolous disagreement within an industry can have people walking up and down at the gate and have 700 or 800 or 1,000 families in a very poor way arising from this and can have a loss of very substantial export orders and earnings and perhaps can do irreparable harm in individual industries.</P>
    <P>These are attitudes that have to be changed, that we all know need to be changed.  The Opposition talk about strong action.  We can have all the strong action we want, but in a democracy people can change all this.  It is unfortunate that that is so, but that is the position we are confronted with and what we have to accept.  At such a time as this there is great responsibility on trade unions and on leadership of trade unions, great responsibility on management, on industry and on the <i>entrepreneurs</i> in industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="885" /> It is time for resolving that the only way we can get out of the difficulties here is through hard work and dedication to the job and not through criticising the Government.  We have an enormous capacity in this country for criticising the other fellow; it is always somebody else's fault.  The most recent attitude is &ldquo;Borrow another £100 million to put people into employment, another £100 million to give higher prices for reactors&rdquo;.  It is the solution all the time.  One of the sets of people who are criticising us for borrowing too much will in the next breath tell us to borrow more, that this is the solution to the country's problems.</P>
    <P>However the problems are not nearly as great as the Opposition would like us to accept for their own party political reasons.  Everybody knows that things are improving, but everybody knows at the same time that continued restraint is necessary. We are in the best country in Europe and we have the greatest opportunities in Europe if we get down to the job and do it.  But it is well known that the world is now recovering from the most serious and severe recession in the post-war era.  Along with our partners in the EEC our recovery from the recession has been better than we anticipated at the beginning of the present year.  Our growth rate this year is now expected to reach 3 per cent, or perhaps, some people say, 4 per cent, and it should increase further next year.  Our external position is very strong.  Last year our balance of payments position was exceptionally good.  Our external reserves are still increasing.  We have come through the recession with our underlying economic strength in sound heart.</P>
    <P>In this debate I want to concentrate particularly on the industry for which I am most responsible.  Let me remind the House how important agriculture is to the economy as a whole.  Directly or indirectly, half our total work force is employed in the agricultural sector; 42 per cent of our exports are farm produce.  These are last year's records; they are there and cannot be contradicted. Almost 20 per cent of GNP comes directly from agriculture and at least as much again from the many <Col N="886" /> economic activities related to agriculture. The growth record of agriculture over the last five years has been outstanding, with a net growth rate of 5½ per cent per annum.  This growth in the agricultural sector has brought a substantial measure of prosperity to our rural areas.  Total family farm incomes rose last year by 50 per cent to a record £483 million.  That is no mean performance by an industry that is regularly criticised by a lot of people. Over the past three years farm incomes per head have more than doubled and there will be a substantial further increase in the present year.  This prosperity is showing itself in the large increase in investments by farmers in land improvements, buildings, machinery and livestock.  A prosperous agricultural sector depends on access to markets at realistic prices.  Now at least we have that access.</P>

      <P>Our membership of the European Community has brought welcome improvements to the prices a farmer is paid for his produce, despite what Deputy Gibbons has said about this NCA payment that none of us is happy about and we are trying to remove it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the creamery milk price is expected to average almost 35p per gallon, three times the 1970 level. Good quality cattle are making £30 a hundredweight and in some cases more.  I am not making the case that <Col N="887" /> of course costs have increased and very substantially, but so also have profits, thanks be to God.  Of course consumers in Ireland have now to pay an economic price for their food.  The Government, however, are making every effort to help the consumer by very large subsidies on the basic foodstuffs. In the budget this year we provided over £37 million to cushion the consumer against increases in the prices of bread, flour, milk and dairy produce.  These are very substantial subsidies.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something about food prices and the problems of the green £.  There seems to be a view that the EEC are deliberately setting out to raise food prices through the operation of the green £ mechanism. In fact the opposite is the case.  If the effect of the continued devaluation of sterling were to go unchecked by the green £ mechanism, the increase in food prices would be far more serious. We are an agricultural exporting nation with farm products comprising 42 per cent of our total exports.  Because of this we lose from that part of the common agricultural policy which seeks to negative the benefits that a depreciating currency gives to export earnings.  The loss to farmers is an obvious and immediate one. However we must not forget that we as a nation are also poorer as a result and the effects are felt throughout all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that the continued depreciation of the £ confers substantial benefits on that part of our industrial sector which is export-orientated. In fact the gains to exporting industry are greater than the gains to the farmer because the green £ is still 25 per cent above current market value of sterling and this unfortunately is increasing.  I want to make it absolutely clear that the industrialist and the industrial worker concerned with selling their produce abroad are enjoying a greater benefit from the devaluation of sterling than is the farmer on whom a monetary tax of over 25 per cent is imposed on his exports.  This is something that is not clearly understood, and every time <Col N="888" /> there is an adjustment in the green £ people think that farmers in this country are getting something that is not their due.  At the same time the increase in food prices resulting from the recent green £ will add only .7 per cent to the consumer price index.  That is a very small increase in relation to increases in prices of other goods and in wages and salaries.  The increases in food prices will add only a few shillings to the budget of the ordinary household but, at the same time, the green £ will add £40 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said the green £ will add £40 million&mdash;that is the estimate of the experts in this area. It will enable farmers to keep more in step with the increases in wages and salaries in other sectors.  We must recognise that the current monetary situation is giving rise to serious concern about the future of the common agriculture policy.  Commissioner Lardinois has recently put forward <Col N="889" /> proposals for the elimination of monetary taxes on agricultural trade within the Community.  This would be possible if the green £ were brought into line with the value of sterling on the money markets.  Ideally this would come about if sterling were stronger and appreciating in value.  If this happened MCAs could be eliminated without any adverse effect on consumer prices.  However, if sterling remains weak it will be necessary to adjust the green £ to bring it into line if we are to get the full benefit of participation in the CAP.</P>
      <P>The main effects of the green £ are on the farmgate prices for cattle and milk, the products that benefit most. As I have already said, cattle prices are satisfactory and we have reached the autumn peak with no adverse effects.  Cattle disposals this year will not reach last year's record of nearly 2.4 million but, nevertheless, they are at a very high level compared with last year.  Cow slaughterings are running at only half last year's level and our national cow herd is expanding and building up again.  We know there was an exceptional slaughter of cows last year: we slaughtered in the region of 600,000 cows.  We explained previously how this came about and it is not necessary to go into it again.</P>
      <P>This is a very opportune time for farmers to plan their cattle systems. We have still too much of our land producing only 2 cwt. to 3 cwt. live-weight gain per acre.  A well planned cattle system can produce three times that output.  I can see no way that the 60 per cent of farmers on farms of less than 50 acres can make a decent living by producing cattle on an extensive basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been fooling these people for far too long and I hope that they have now got the message. More intensive systems, particularly rearing calves right through to beef, must be developed.  This must involve the advisory services in planning the best systems for individual farm circumstances.  The major portion of the time of the advisory <Col N="890" /> services is now engaged in this type of work and this is a very welcome change.</P>
      <P>The expansion of cattle output will mean retaining more heifers and perhaps less rigorous culling, at least for the time being.  In the short term this will mean fewer cattle for sale but only in this way can the breeding herd be built up.  There are indications that this is happening and I expect to see the national cow herd significantly up by the end of the year.  If we can develop cattle systems that bring animals to slaughter at a younger age, extra cattle can be carried without reducing the area available for tillage or for other livestock.</P>
      <P>A bigger cattle breeding herd will mean more cows in milk and a higher total milk output.  We still have a long way to go before we realise the potential of our grasslands or before we catch up on the productive levels per acre of our main competitors.  I know there is concern about the problem of surpluses of dairy products in the EEC and about the Commission's package of proposals to deal with this matter.  I want to emphasise that the question of a milk levy and a non-marketing premium and the other points put forward by the Commission are only proposals at this stage and are not decisions.  This is a package that has to be discussed for some considerable time yet before decisions are reached and, in any case, whatever is decided will not be implemented until the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be wrong to disclose publicly our negotiating position while we are still in the course of negotiating. In the middle of negotiations I am always under pressure to tell everybody what I propose to do in Brussels about several matters.  This pressure is wrong.  It is bad for the country and it is bad for our prospects of negotiating a good deal.  The long-term stability of the EEC market for dairy products is a matter of the greatest concern for this country and the Council of Ministers must find a satisfactory solution to the present situation.  We have major competitive advantages over other European producers and we must retain our opportunity to exploit <Col N="891" /> these advantages.  This means we must ensure that everything possible is done to help those who are in milk&mdash;I should like to see them expanding in this area.  I should also like to see others going into this area not only for milk production alone and the employment it gives but for the increase in cattle numbers this will automatically provide for the beef sector.</P>
    <P>The price of calves this year has reflected the demand on home and export markets.  Calf exports to Italy have reached 60,000 so far this year but in recent weeks the exports have dropped sharply.  Total calf and store exports to Italy are very much lower than last year because the home demand has been so much stronger.  To some extent I suppose this has been responsible for the reduction.  The fact that calf prices have got much dearer is helping us as well.  This export trade to Italy has been a useful source of demand when other outlets were very weak but I do not expect to see calf exports on a scale that would seriously affect our supplies in the years to come.  Our future supplies of cattle will also reflect progress in disease eradication.  We need to make more rapid progress if we are to achieve the maximum benefit for the cattle industry. This will entail some temporary loss of income, but healthier cattle will bring their own reward to producers. Only through complete co-operation between the different interests concerned can we achieve that rapid progress.</P>
    <P>As well as the upturn in cow numbers, there are very encouraging signs of a growth in our ewe flock.  Sheep prices have been very firm in recent months and this has brought new interest in sheep production.  The problem of access to the French market, however, still remains.  In view of the complete failure of efforts to reach a satisfactory agreement with the French, we now have to consider whether we should, even at this late stage, take direct legal action in the European Court.</P>

      <P>The problem, however, is that by the time the case is heard most of the remainder of the transitional period, which ends in December, 1977, will have elapsed.  It may be necessary to take further action in relation to the post-transitional situation.  The various ideas put forward by the Commission were discussed further at a Council meeting no later than last month, but no solution was reached.  Our legal and other experts are now studying the position to see what steps we should take to secure the best solution to this long-standing problem.  It is most disappointing that despite all our efforts over a long period this question has not been resolved.  At the last meeting when we discussed this problem, again I had to say that the Council of Agricultural Ministers had completely failed to solve a serious problem for an individual member state, that we had got a common organisation of the market for much lesser products in earlier years, and that the only reason why we failed to get a solution to this problem was that two of the big powers made up their minds that we were not going to have a common organisation of the market for sheep.  I named the two states, France and the UK.  It was in their own selfish interests not to give us a common organisation of the market for sheep.  I said that that institution of the EEC had failed to do its job and it was now obvious the only course open to us was to use another institution of the EEC, that was, the European Court.  That, as I say, is what we are now considering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acreage under the main tillage crops has also expanded this year.  The wheat acreage increased by over 10 per cent after having fallen every year in the current decade.  The acreage under barley went up by over 20,000 acres to exceed 600,000 acres for the first time ever.  There is still a great potential for further expansion, and this is to be discussed in detail at a <Col N="893" /> special conference next week in which my Department are actively participating. I look forward to a large rise in the acreage under cereals again next year, for there is no doubt in my mind that tillage efficiently done is one of the best ways to increase a farmer's income.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about our failure to increase tillage more rapidly, because the opportunities here are very substantial indeed.  We have tried very hard, last year particularly, to get farmers to produce more grain, more beet, and more tillage generally, and we have had limited expansion in this area.  Sometimes it occurs to me that it is all very well to give advice; people listening know that it is good advice, but very often they have not the machinery to put this advice into effect.  More and more I am convinced that good local contractors are an essential part of this whole campaign.  They will have to be encouraged and organised in every possible way.  Both the farming organisations and the advisory service will have to take a serious part in keeping the work coming up for these people so that they do not go out of business simply because they cannot live in it without charging too much and because the work is not organised in their favour.  In the parts of the country where they are in existence, where there is a big investment in machinery and where the business is well organised, we have the percentage of tillage we all would like to see. But 10 per cent of our total area is completely inadequate and something we cannot be proud of.</P>
    <P>The potato acreage is also up this year by 20 per cent.  The drought of course affected yields so that there is a very strong demand in relation to the supplies available.  This should help to encourage farmers to expand their acreage of potatoes next year, but we must always bear in mind that it is very easy to over-produce potatoes and it is very difficult to be certain that we will have a saleable outlet that will leave a profit for farmers.  We have all seen farmers dumping potatoes.  Last year there was more than a sufficient acreage to <Col N="894" /> over-supply the market if yields and weather were normal and if the situations in England and elsewhere were normal, but they were not.</P>
    <P>As far as sugar beet is concerned, as I said recently, both the growers and the Irish Sugar Company have met the challenge presented by our entry into the EEC.  They have grasped the opportunity which came with the increased sugar production quotas which we were able to secure for the period up to 1980.  Last year our sugar production reached a record level of 186,000 metric tonnes.  I hope that by the end of the current season we will have maintained our position despite the very difficult harvesting conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit it will be very difficult because sugar content is very low.  It is absolutely essential that production in the years up to 1980 should be continued at this level or even increased if we are to be in a position to make a strong case when discussions commence in Brussels on the sugar regime to apply after 1980. I am convinced that it would be in the best interests of all concerned to see the largest possible quantity of beet processed.  Our target should not be just growing our A quota but also a substantial part of our B quota, if not all of it, because this is the way we stake our claim when we are next discussing this in Europe.  I would urge the growers and the Sugar Company to have this aim continuously in mind in their negotiations.  Apart from the important consideration of helping our case for negotiating a bigger quota post-1980, it will also benefit growers themselves in two ways: in the first place, they will enjoy the very remunerative returns which beet growing provides and, secondly, they will make a substantial contribution towards ensuring the continuing prosperity of the beet sugar industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, a great threat to the beet sugar industry at present which we have at least started to fight and I hope will be able to fight successfully, that is, the production of high fructose corn syrups that has unfortunately <Col N="895" /> got well under way.  I raised this at the last meeting of the Council of Ministers and urged the Commission to produce a paper and recommendations for our next council meeting, if that is possible, before the position reaches a stage where it will be very hard to stop it.</P>
    <P>Horticulture is an increasingly important branch of intensive agriculture with a farmgate value in 1975 of over £28 million.  It is an important element in our food processing industry which comprises major employers and important exporters.  The State fully recognises the value of horticulture and has aided its development by education, advice and capital grants and services and direct State involvement in processing.  The industry has come a long way since the days of small, scattered units and has now become an important element of cropping for many farmers.  The radical change in vegetable cropping from the traditional market garden to modern, efficient field-scale production by tillage farmers is indicative of the development throughout the industry.</P>
    <P>I visited Belgium recently mainly to have a look at sugar processing.  I came across one firm growing 50,000 acres of vegetables, canning the lot and selling the produce in a small corner of the Community.  This indicates the opportunities there are in this area if horticulture could be properly organised and pursued.  The potential employment content in increasing horticultural production and processing is particularly important at present.  As an industry, it obtains the greater part of its input from home sources.  It is only beginning to be tapped.  The importance of food processing in the local economics of areas like Cork, Offaly and Monaghan cannot be over-stressed. For the young and enthusiastic grower horticulture offers many enterprises which give reasonable returns with relatively low capital requirements.  But if the agricultural sector as a whole is to expand there must be an integrated programme of investment at farm level. The farmer wishing to modernise and expand his business never had such a range and attractive level of incentives <Col N="896" /> available as he has today.  Grant levels for farm investment were never higher and every farmer has the full support of a comprehensive advisory service to help in carrying his plans to completion.</P>
    <P>Recently I announced a new scheme of grants which would be available to groups of farmers in disadvantaged areas who came together to acquire jointly machinery to be used by the group for the production of winter feed. The rate of grant which will be offered to groups will be 30 per cent of the cost of the machinery up to a reasonable maximum and a wide range of machines will be covered.  This level of grants should be a very real incentive to farmers in the areas concerned to form themselves into local groups in order to avail of grants and, more important, to gear themselves to produce enough winter fodder to face even the worst winter conditions with complete confidence.</P>
    <P>In the first six months of the present year the Department's farm development service approved grant-aided capital investment projects worth £45 million.</P>

This is unprecedented and indicates the very high level of confidence there is at present.  That would normally represent three or four years' investment.  I was very glad to find that this confidence has carried through into the credit agencies.  This year, when I met representatives of all the banks on a couple of occasions, they were agreeable to extend credit over a period of 12 years.  This is something new in banking.  I was also very pleased recently to hear a prominent banker say that farming was now regarded as the best risk in the country. This is a new and very welcome attitude.</P>

      <P>Farmers must expect to be affected by the recent increase in interest rates and will look harder at their investment programmes.  However, the progressive farmer who invests in his business with the help of the ACC or a bank loan will find that in the end his efforts will be fully justified.  The exact gain will depend on the level of prices over the coming years but I am confident that the prospects would justify the farmer investing in expanding his farm business. We must keep going on this confident note.  Prospects, as far as we can examine them, are good and justify the confidence that farmers are now showing in their business.</P>
      <P>There is also a major upturn in land prices which is a very mixed blessing.  Particularly it is not a blessing for the small farmer who is trying to increase his area and expand his income by having a bigger and better farm.  But the output from all this land will have to be exported because the home market is already supplied. It is important to us for our balance of payments which will benefit directly.  Last year our total farm exports brought in £600 million compared with £180 million in 1970.  By 1980 this figure of £600 million will be much greater.  This will affect the whole economy for research recently has shown that every additional £1 million of agricultural exports generates a £1.9 million increase in our GNP.</P>
      <P>Before I finish I should like to mention our success in the negotiations on the fishing industry.  This is a very complex issue which involves a lot of hard bargaining.  The outcome of the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the EEC was very heartening to all concerned with fishing.  The prospects for the fishing industry are just as promising as those for our farmers.  I have no doubt that these new opportunities will result in a larger and more prosperous fishing industry in the future. These negotiations have a long way to go but I hope they will be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have set out in our Green Paper on economic and social development to 1980 the growth rate that we believe we can achieve in agriculture.  We are <Col N="898" /> looking for a 6 per cent increase per annum in total farm output.  This will require a substantial increase in inputs of fertilisers, feedingstuffs and other farm material but it can easily be achieved.  It was not a figure taken off the top of somebody's head in the Department; it was arrived at after most careful and detailed examination of every possible farm product.  I know this figure can be well exceeded if we really get down to the job confidently. Farmer confidence is and always has been the most important ingredient in all this.</P>
    <P>It will involve a more productive use of our grasslands, particularly higher stocking rates and increased milk yields.  We hope our tillage acreage will continue to expand and that farmers' incomes, as a result, will rise fairly substantially.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I am not satisfied with what is happening, with our achievements in agriculture up to the present. There is enormous potential here but I do not think that any man in my job can achieve this without the full co-operation of everybody involved.  I have said time and again that this is a team-work operation for the success of which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries can never take full credit nor should he be blamed for its failure because there are too many people and organisations, too many considerations, too many outside effects involved.  I do not want to take total credit for successes in this area.  I want to see success. I know the possibilities are there and that we can realise them, but we will not achieve them by criticising each other and by looking for more at present.</P>

      <P>Figures issued by the Central Statistics Office last night show that the number of building and construction workers unemployed is now 25,257.  The figures show that 3,700 more workers are unemployed in that industry than in the same period last year.  These figures underline in clear terms the ill health of the building and construction industry. No series of projects however plausible can change that dismal picture. The building and construction industry is now in the unenviable position <Col N="899" /> of being the leader in the unemployment stakes.  Government speakers mention the signs and portents which signify an improvement in the economy with special reference to the building and construction industry. Let me point out that the statistics issued by the Central Statistics Office show that the unemployment figures have increased by 1,430, even on the previous month.</P>
      <P>In debate after debate in this House Fianna Fáil have endeavoured to point out to the Government and in particular to the Minister for Local Government the desperate plight of the building and construction industry. Unemployment among building workers has increased by 99.7 per cent in two years.  House building in the private and public sectors is decreasing. Construction in other areas is deteriorating rapidly.  The queues of people seeking new houses are getting longer each week.  We have had no reponse from the Government or the Minister.  We pointed out the advantage to be gained in providing new homes and employment by giving this industry a worth-while injection of capital.  The Government persist in ignoring an industry which could provide jobs immediately without causing any balance of payments problems. At a time when we have 108,000 people on our official unemployment list and thousands of others not listed, we are convinced that thousands of jobs can be created through proper financing in building construction and in the ancillary industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we return to office we propose to inject £30 million into the building and construction industry to provide 5,000 badly needed jobs.  The deteriorating situation in the industry was apparent from 1974.  In 1974 the volume of output in the industry was £196.41 million at constant prices of 1968-69.  In 1975 the volume had declined by 4.5 per cent over the previous year.  In 1975 the output for the private sector had declined by 3.6 per cent in comparison with 1974. The decline in output had clearly manifested itself in the rising unemployment in the industry.  There was <Col N="900" /> a drop in employment of 10.5 per cent in 1975.  This showed the industry to be the sector of the economy that was being grievously damaged. That point is clearly indicated in the figures issued by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>A study of the public capital programme, which is vitally important to the construction industry, shows that allocations to the private sector of the industry in 1974, 1975 and 1976 had been reduced in real terms though showing an increase in current terms. The programme shows a reduction in the allocations for sanitary services, houses, hospitals and so on.  In view of the experience of 1974 and 1975 one would have expected an effort to correct the decline.  We are being deluged with selected statistics and irrelevant financial comparisons by the Government and the Minister for Local Government.  These ignore the frightening inflationary situation which has resulted in a 99.9 per cent increase in building costs since May, 1973.  That is higher than the ordinary percentage increase in inflationary rates.  All this is done in an attempt to distract attention from the reality of the critical condition of the building and construction industry.  The attitude of the Minister is causing grave concern. Until he recognises and accepts that the situation is critical it is hopeless to expect that the problems will be tackled in a realistic manner.</P>
    <P>My appreciation of the condition of the industry is borne out by the figures I have quoted.  Persistent calls for assistance from the Construction Industry Federation, the trade unions and the local authorities have been to no avail.  The Minister's usual reply is to quote current figures of expenditure and gross output in the industry and to make a comparison between these figures and expenditure during Fianna Fáil's term of office without any reference to the unchecked inflation which is damaging this industry more than anything else and without reference to the fact that the money being made available now and the gross output of the industry in real terms are lower now than they were in 1974.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> If we are to make any progress and any impact on the frighteningly high unemployment figures, this pretence must be abandoned.  The Government must face the reality that employment in the building and construction industry has fallen from 63,000 workers in 1974 to 48,900 workers in 1976.  In May, 1974, there were 12,718 building workers unemployed.  In August, 1976, there were 25,256 building workers unemployed. This shows a 100 per cent increase in unemployment.  These are the official statistics.  We must face the reality that the percentage of the total labour force unemployed in the building and construction industry has risen from 19 per cent in 1974 to approximately 22 per cent in 1976.</P>
    <P>This is an industry in which we could justifiably expect increasing employment. Yet the Minister for Local Government expects us to believe that all is well with the industry and that its production is just as good as ever it was, at a time when there are 25,256 building workers unemployed, a quarter of the total labour force.  The decline is there for everybody to see.  The official statistics point to the fact that 1,289 fewer houses were built in the private sector and 518 fewer in the public sector in the first two quarters of 1976 as compared with the first two quarters of 1975, that is to say, that there was a total of 1,807 fewer houses built in the first two quarters of 1976 as compared with the first two quarters of 1975.  Even more disturbing is the fact that there was a total of 2,506 fewer houses under construction in the first two years of 1976 as compared with the first two quarters of 1975.  The drop in the number of houses constructed as compared with last year, added to the unemployment figures, shows the real trend we predicted long ago and which the Minister refused to accept and still refuses to accept.</P>
    <P>In the early days of the Coalition we had regular announcements from the Government about their supposed achievements in the building and construction industry.  They claimed all the credit, even though they were well aware that at that time, they were building, in every sense of the word. on the sound financial and economic <Col N="902" /> base left to them by Fianna Fáil. Houses were being constructed by us in ever-increasing numbers.  Plans for future development were in course of preparation when we left office.  Large tracts of land were purchased to ensure there would be no let-up in the effort. Indeed, the quantity of land bought during our term of office was so large that the Minister is still building houses on that land.  His contribution in this area has been to issue instructions to local authorities to cut down on land purchases, with the result that the future will reveal a scarcity of land for building purposes.  Today, when the Government must face up to their problems, when they must continue to try to remain afloat on their own efforts, the only reply we can get from the Minister for Local Government and the Government themselves to our request to revitalise the building and construction industry is to ask us are we not aware that there is an emergency and that money is scarce.  Of course we are aware that there is an emergency but we are equally aware that the Coalition are largely responsible for it by their inaction and complete lack of leadership, though a stranger might be excused from appreciating that the Government really believe there is an economic emergency if he were to judge by the Government's priority as expressed through the recall of the Dáil during the Summer Recess.  We are aware also that the country has the highest inflation and unemployment rates in the EEC.</P>

      <P>We are the only country in the EEC continuing down the slippery slope, and that includes even Britain, when other countries are making a reasonable effort to overcome the problems facing them.  For some inexplicable reason the Government and the Minister for Local Government appear to be bent on destroying all incentive for the lower income group to build or buy their own houses.  Every action they have refused to take in this sphere points to <Col N="903" /> that fact.  State grants were available to all who built a house under certain specified square footage and supplementary grants were available to large numbers of those who qualified for state housing grants.  Now, due to a ministerial decision, a person with an income of £38 a week, or a young couple with the princely income of £40 a week are no longer entitled to State housing grants or to supplementary grants.  Such young couples, with an income of £40 a week, are too well off according to the socialist partners in this Coalition Government to be entitled to housing grants to enable them build or buy their own homes.</P>
      <P>The refusal by the Minister to increase the SDA loans and qualifying income limit has the most serious implications for the building and construction industry.  These loans were the backbone of the industry.  The refusal by the Government to change the qualifying income limit, despite the exhortations not only of this party but of the General Council of County Councils, the municipal authorities, trade unions and the Construction Industry Federation is something we can never understand.  It has resulted in whole classes of people who were entitled to these loans when we were in office, and who availed of them in the past in large numbers, being no longer entitled to them.  While the standard of living for large numbers of them has deteriorated since 1973, their monetary income has increased to the extent that they are over the income limit of £45 a week and therefore do not qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall give a brief synopsis of what has happened.  In this synopsis, as I have been doing already, I shall quote official figures.  In May, 1973, the maximum loan level was fixed at £4,500 and the qualifying income limit at £2,350.  The average price of a house built on an SDA loan at that time was something in the region of £5,900 and the repayment period was 35 years. An applicant for such a loan could be assured of a State housing grant and in many instances of a supplementary housing grant as well.  This meant that he had approximately £5,100 and had to make up only the difference, either <Col N="904" /> from savings or in some other way. Today the loan maximum and the qualifying income limit are as they were in 1973; they still stand at £4,500 and £2,350 respectively.  The price of an SDA loan house is now over £8,000.</P>
    <P>I should stress again that I am quoting from official statistics here.  As I have already explained, most of the applicants are not now entitled to a grant of any kind, either State or supplementary. On top of all of that the repayment period for the loan has been reduced from 35 years to 30 years. Finally, the interest rate, which was increased on two occasions in the past year, by 1 per cent on each occasion, was increased <i>in toto</i> by 2 per cent to the huge total of 12½ per cent.  These loans were intended for people in the lower and middle income groups who wished to build or buy their own homes.</P>
    <P>The situation now, as I see it, is absolutely deplorable.  How could a young couple with £45 a week build or buy a home for themselves with a loan of £4,500 at 12½ per cent with no grant of any kind?  The simple answer is that the Government have deliberately created the conditions which ensure that the poorer section of the community are being deprived of the right to build or buy a home of their own.  Any unctuous talk about concern for such people is just so much talk and nothing more.  In reply to a question by me the Minister for Local Government yesterday stated that the number of SDA loans approved in the quarters ended 30th June, 1975, and 30th June, 1976, were 2,871 and 1,394 respectively and that the percentage change was 51 per cent.</P>
    <P>These figures tell the true story.  The loans are being phased out to the disadvantage of the poorer sections of the community which the Labour sector of the Coalition would like us to believe are their main concern.  In reply to a supplementary question the Minister told me that it was no responsibility of the Government to provide all the money for housing and that there were many other lending agencies in existence to make this money available.</P>
    <P>Can anybody imagine a young couple with an income of £46 per <Col N="905" /> week and looking for a loan of £8,000 receiving red carpet treatment from any of the other lending agencies?  Is it not a fact that the only hope they had of getting a loan was from a local authority.  Such loans were valuable when they were of a reasonable size in relation to the price of the house?  The fact of the matter is that young people who have the courage and the initiative to buy or build their own homes are not being permitted to do so by the Government and the serious fall in the total number of applications for loans and of loans approved underlines this fact.  There is another aspect to this matter which should be borne in mind and that is that it is easier to run down a scheme of this kind than to bring it back into operation.  The Minister now appears to be relying entirely on the moneys available from other lending agencies but we have had experience in the past of a situation where the other lending agencies had not sufficient money.  That occurred in 1974 when there was a serious dearth of money in the building societies.  If this scheme is run down further and we return to the situation we experienced in 1974 with regard to the other lending agencies&mdash;something which is quite possible&mdash;what will be the position in the building industry?  There will be no money available for SDA loans and severe restrictions in relation to money from the building societies. What will happen then to the building industry which at present is at crisis point?</P>
    <P>When we are returned to government, and that will not be very long, we propose to raise SDA loans and the qualifying income limits to realistic levels and to make worth-while grants available for first purchasers. It is an amazing change of front for socialists in this Government to adopt a policy which relies on private enterprise to provide finances for new housing and restrict State investment in housing.  They always claimed that the State should in the main be responsible for such activity.</P>
    <P>An announcement was made recently by the building societies that they proposed to raise their mortgage interest rates by more than 2 per cent, <Col N="906" /> to 13.95 per cent.  This announcement, even though some increase was anticipated after the increase in the bank rate, sent a chill down the spines of many mortgage holders.  On receipt of this information, I called on the Government to make a subsidy available to the building societies to help counteract the effect of this increase. I did so in the knowledge that this increase was the last straw as far as a vast number of building society mortgage holders were concerned.  It is an intolerable burden for them. Many mortgage holders have not got any increase in their incomes over the past year because of the circumstances of their employment.  Quite a number of those who took out mortgages some time ago are unemployed, due largely to the failure of the Government. The Government's oft-repeated recipe that inflation has helped overcome problems with regard to mortgages has no validity in these cases; in fact, the reverse is the situation. For many who are repaying these mortgages the cheeseparing can go on no longer; there is no fat left.  There is no way that many of the families involved can cope with increases which are considerable.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that if the Government do not take action in respect of a subsidy we could have a grave social problem.  Most mortgage holders know little or nothing of the exigencies of high finance.  They consider carefully the situation which will pertain if they apply for and obtain a mortgage at a certain percentage rate and they make a decision to proceed with the mortgage or not to accept it. If they decide to proceed and a new element which they have not bargained for, such as the exceptionally large increase in interest rates, comes about they enter a new situation leaving many of them in dire straits. Elementary justice dictates that the Government, who have been relieved of an obligation by many of these mortgage holders in providing their own houses, should come to their rescue.  Another serious aspect of this matter is that many people who were considering taking out loans to buy or build their own homes will now change their minds when faced with <Col N="907" /> an interest rate of almost 14 per cent. The effect this will have on an already disturbed building industry can be appreciated.  At a time when one-quarter of the total building work force, more than 25,000, are unemployed it can be a catastrophe.  The building industry now heads the unemployment league and if something is not done to correct the situation in relation to the SDA loans and to assistance to curb the interest rate increase, we will find that the numbers unemployed in that industry will escalate at a faster rate than at present. In these circumstances it is incumbent on the Government to make money available to subsidise building society rates immediately.</P>
    <P>The mishandling of the SDA loan situation, added to the exceptionally high building society mortgage interest rates, will have the effect of putting more and more prospective loan applicants on the long queues waiting for local authority houses.  This is being done at a time when the Minister for Local Government is predicting a fall in the number of local authority houses being built.</P>
    <P>In his statement on this matter the Minister expressed the hope that the private sector of the building industry would take up the slack which would arise because fewer houses were being built in the public sector.  How can he imagine that the private sector of the building industry, which has been harassed by this Government for the past two or three years, will take up that slack when he refused to increase the maximum loan levels and qualifying income limits and when as yet we have not got from the Government any word as to whether they propose to subsidise these enormous interest rates which now must be paid by mortgage holders?  Added to this enormous increase in building society interest rates we have very large rate increases all over the country.  The rates increases on their own are a very heavy burden and would have been a sufficient burden in themselves for mortgage holders, but with 13.95 per cent mortgage interest rates, the total increase is intolerable.</P>

      <Col N="908" /> I want to put on record that when we are re-elected we propose to abolish rates on all dwellinghouses.  The Coalition rates remission scheme was a failure.  The repetition by some members of the Government that rates would be higher if they had not taken the steps thereby saving the ratepayer some money reminds me of a supermarket advertisement calling on people to come in and buy and save money.  Rates on private dwellings are an unfair system of taxation and should be abolished.  That is what we propose to do.</P>

      <P>There are 25,000 unemployed building workers at the moment&mdash;the highest figure ever known in the building industry.  They are at the top of the unemployed league table, yet the Parliamentary Secretary says in effect, &ldquo;Don't bother about them&rdquo;.  I can assure him that we propose to bother about them and I have laid down in this speech the way we will do that.  We have indicated in our economic policy the manner in which we will finance any commitments we make, including the removal of rates from private dwellings.  When we introduced free education it was <Col N="910" /> said that we could not pay for it but we did and we will remove rates from private dwellings when we get back into power.  The people can be assured that when we give our word we will keep it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I can take it that it is most unlikely there will be very many shillings in the coffers when we get back into Government, but confidence will be engendered by a return of Fianna Fáil to Government.  There will be a unified approach to problems rather than the present situation where we have the right-wing Fine Gael going in one direction and the left-wing socialists going in the other. Everybody knew this Coalition could not work.</P>
      <P>When the Tánaiste stated some years ago that he would rather go to the backbenches than join in any future coalition, he spoke from experience. He knew what happened in previous coalitions.  He knew they would not work.  He changed his mind. I am not going to act as a holier than thou person.  If he wanted to change his mind that was his business but his original contention has been more than borne out.</P>
      <P>My experience dealing with the building and construction industry since I took over as Fianna Fáil spokesman, has shown me the shocking deterioration that has taken place in that industry over the past two or three years.  When we put forward a case as we see it we are reminded of the number of houses that have been built; we are asked if we are not aware that there is an emergency and a shortage of money but we know that properly financed and directed, jobs could be made available in this industry almost immediately.  Instead, there has been a constant cutting back in real terms as shown in the statistics issued last night. It is a disgrace to find that more than 25,000 building workers are unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the problems affecting the building industry there are problems also in relation to other sectors <Col N="911" /> of the Department of Local Government. For instance, our roads are deteriorating because money is not being made available to resurface and repair them.  The Government have stated that they have transferred moneys intended for work on the main arterial roads to the smaller roads so as to provide more employment but no such transfer can create employment if the moneys being made available are not increased and the figures show that there has not been an increase in this area.  In 1974 the amount of the grants paid to local authorities for road works was about £20 million while in each of the years 1975 and 1976 the amounts were almost the same.  During that period inflation rates increased by 40 per cent.  It is nonsensical to suggest that employment can be created while the moneys concerned are reducing considerably in real terms.</P>
    <P>We have the highest rate of unemployment in the EEC.  Our inflation rate is the worst of any EEC country while our national output is at an abysmally low level.  The Government have shown that they are incapable of making decisions.  Their only aim seems to be to hang on to office for as long as possible.  Even those decisions that were made and which might have had a worth-while effect on the economy were changed under the slightest pressure.</P>
    <P>I should have liked more time in which to develop these points but some of my time was lost because of the Parliamentary Secretary's interruptions. In conclusion I would refer to the document put forward by us recently.  This is a policy on which to base economic recovery.  Our record is such as to assure the people that when we put our hands to the plough and make decisions there will be no turning back.  The road ahead is a hard and a long one but we have confidence in our capabilities and that is an essential ingredient if we are to succeed.  It is obvious that there is no future for the country or for any of the people under the present Government. On our return to Government the confidence which will be engendered will result in an upsurge in the <Col N="912" /> economy just as there was when Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1957 after the last Coalition Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time available to me I hope to cover 11 areas which are worthy of some examination during this debate.  I intend, first, to look at the underlying long-term problem of employment that has existed for more than 50 years.  Secondly, I wish to look at some new developments in the context of that problem regarding, particularly, changes in our population, the impact of free trade and our relationship with the UK economy. Thirdly, I wish to analyse the impact of the world depression on our own economy.  Fourthly, I shall deal with the Government's short-term response to that situation; fifthly, and arising out of that, the budgetary situation and, sixthly, what I believe to be necessary&mdash;a short-term economic plan followed by a long-term plan.  I wish to look, too, at the Green Paper and at the Fianna Fáil policy document and to analyse the impact of the sterling link on our rate of inflation. Lastly, I shall look at the current economic situation and some of the underlying trends which have appeared lately.</P>
      <P>In a debate of this nature it is important to emphasise that there has been always an unemployment problem, that no Government have proved capable of solving that problem.  In 1926, on the occasion of the first census, there were 1,250,000 at work. Fifty years later the figure is in the region of 1,050,000.  This failure to increase the working population is without parallel in Europe.  It has not been confined to any one phase during the past half century for most of which time Fianna Fáil were in office. The problem has been a persistent long-run characteristic of the Irish economy.  Even if we might dignify some of the goings-on of Governments with the title of strategy we have failed to absorb into the work force the natural increase in our population. There has been the problem, too, of those who have been leaving the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well to remember that other small and relatively unendowed economies such as some of the <Col N="913" /> Scandinavian countries which at the time of the accession to power of Fianna Fáil in the early thirties had GNP's comparable with ours now have standards of living twice or three times greater than ours and at the same time have been able to provide work for those who wish to stay in their own countries.  In terms of the EEC our GNP per head is only half the average.  Our economic record involving all parties in all Governments has been one of long-run failure.  We know how the problem was solved in the past.  The surplus population was forced to emigrate.  Today some one million people born in this country are now registered in the UK and registered in the census of that country's population.  These people, when taken in conjunction with the hundreds of thousands elsewhere throughout the world, give some idea of the dimension of the problem and how we solved it year after year. Emigration was the implicit economic variable which solved the intolerable limit of unemployment but it was a solution which had terrifying consequences socially and culturally&mdash;consequences which most of the time we are prepared to admit privately, if not publicly.  The heavy unemployment of the fifties specifically left us with a very imbalanced pay structure and, consequently, with a very high dependency ratio which naturally affects the budget not only in terms of taxation but in regard also to the social services which must be funded from a very narrow taxation base.  We have proportionately high numbers of young and old in our population and these categories are the heaviest consumers of social services.  That situation imposes a heavy taxation burden on the active section of the population.</P>
    <P>I know it can be argued, and will be argued, from the Opposition benches that the problems I am describing are problems of the past. Certainly the thirties were terrible. The forties were a particular set of circumstances because of the war.  In the fifties we had high emigration. Our own economic miracle began in the sixties.  It is true there has certainly been a remarkable change <Col N="914" /> and it is right to say so.  A quarter of a century ago only 5 per cent of our exports were manufactured goods. Today over 50 per cent of our exports are non-agricultural.  In 1960 the total number of workers was 1.005 million. In 1970, the end of the decade, the total was 1.053 million.  During the 15 years, 1960 to 1974, the total number engaged in industry rose by only 50,000, an average of just over 5,000 per annum.  At the same time service employment grew by 60,000 but agriculture dropped by about 9,000 per year.  These are hardly statistics of success.  They indicate a static situation.</P>
    <P>I believe we should define economic success in human terms and not in terms of statistics.  That period from 1960 to 1974 could be presented as a period of spectacular growth because the annual growth rate was 4 per cent. Exports rose by 6½ per cent a year in real terms and the industrial sector expanded at just over 6 per cent.  Nonetheless, during that period the number at work was virtually unchanged at about 1.005 million.  As I indicated, the numbers leaving agriculture balanced out increases in industry and in the service sector.  That was the reality of our economic performance. We continued during that period to export surplus population and this was the way we managed to keep unemployment figures within tolerable limits.</P>
    <P>I was one of those temporarily exported during that period.  I know the agony of emigration, having experienced it at first hand and having lived amongst Irish emigrants.  It was a reality to which, of course, our society blinded itself and one would, and particularly the Opposition, rather describe the period of the sixties as a period of great economic success.  Yet, even during the period of the Third Programme there was a decrease of 17,000 in the total numbers at work from 1969 to 1972 compared to a target of increase of 16,000, which was modest enough.  The result was a shortfall of 3,000 jobs and more recently, of course, because of the world crisis, there has been a further drop in employment and we know of <Col N="915" /> the particularly distressing performance of the economy last year. Unemployment went up.  We lost about 13,000 jobs last year in manufacturing industry alone despite the best efforts of the IDA.</P>
    <P>But something else has happened in addition to this long-run problem.  We are now aware that something profoundly important is happening to our population structure.  We have now in our possession a demographic study prepared by Professor Walsh of the ESRI published last year by the National Economic and Social Council which indicates that we have entered into the first stage of a population explosion making itself evident now in the number of those seeking work. This is a situation which will continue for the next decade at least.  Professor Walsh reckons that the industrial and service labour force will increase by approximately 300,000 between 1971 and 1986.  This means we will require about 25,000 new jobs a year over the long run if we are to absorb an expanding population and also the continued drift from the land.</P>
    <P>Last November the OECD in a report, which was not widely commented upon in the Press, the media generally, or here, pointed out that this figure does not include extra new jobs to re-employ those made redundant because of the world crisis over the last two years.  The Minister for Finance at the tail-end of his budget speech earlier this year accepted the forecast and estimated that by 1980 the population would rise to 3.3 million with a work force of 1.18 million.  He foresaw the need for creating 155,000 new jobs in manufacturing industry during the period 1976 to 1980, which is an annual average of over 30,000 and, in an uncharacteristic understatement, he described it as a massive challenge to manufacturing industry.  It certainly is, given the performance of this economy in the past.</P>
    <P>This is a challenge I cannot visualise being accepted or being met if we simply continue with current policies; 31,000 new industrial jobs each year every year is self-evidently beyond the capacity of existing policies even <Col N="916" /> in the most favourable economic conditions. In 1973, and it is quite immaterial to me as to which Government, the former or the present, claims credit for that particular year, once the point is established, that it could be claimed as our own economic miracle, output went up by 8½ per cent in manufacturing industry but employment rose by only 7,800 and over the whole economy by 12,000 to 13,000. How then can we expect in face of a world recession to get from that sort of base up to a figure of 31,000 new jobs if we continue with past policy centred around the IDA and based on private enterprise?</P>
    <P>As I said, unemployment has always been a problem for Irish Governments which Irish Governments persistently have failed to solve.  The solution in the past has been that those of us who stayed at home took all the growth in our own interest and forced the rest to emigrate.  During the sixties, which Fianna Fáil have used and will continue to use in this and other debates on the economy, GNP went up by 50 per cent.  Yet the total labour force remained static.  The population rose and we know there were approximately 150,000 people exported from this country during that period.  That is how unemployment figures were kept within tolerable limits.  No wonder the dole queues did not grow.  Those who should have been on the dole queues were abroad, mostly in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Let there be no doubt about it and here it is instructive to look at the employment record of the three former Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance who now grace the Opposition benches and who have lectured the nation and this House on the management of the economy.  Let us look at them, each in turn.  Let us take Deputy Lynch during his sojourn as Minister for Finance during a period of relative economic tranquillity, not only here but throughout the world, from 1965 to 1967. During that period manufacturing industry employment went up by 3,000. All industry went up by 1,000 and the total number of workers fell in fact by 9,000.  He was succeeded by Deputy Haughey.  Between 1967 and 1970 manufacturing industry went up <Col N="917" /> by 15,000&mdash;that was a better record&mdash; and all industry went up by 17,000. Services went up by 15,000.  Yet the total numbers at work fell by 5,000 and there were 5,000 fewer at work when Deputy Haughey left office. Deputy Colley was the last of the triumvirate and during his period in office, manufacturing industry employment went up by 1,000 and all industry went up by only 1,000.  In fact, the total numbers at work fell by 7,000.</P>
    <P>There is one persistent characteristic there.  Each of these former Ministers for Finance presided over a drop in total employment during a time when the world economy and international trade grew at a rate never before experienced, a rate that possibly will never be equalled in the rest of this century.  Not a very edifying performance.  During the total period covered by those three Ministers, 1965 to 1972, total employment fell by 21,000.  The statistics are those published by the Department of the Taoiseach and they are available in the Library to every Member.  I do not think that any one of these three cases provides the Opposition with justification for acting either in the role of critic of existing policies or in the role of proponent of new ones with any creditability.</P>
    <P>The situation in the seventies has dramatically changed from that of the sixties.  As I said earlier, and as the study of Professor Walsh indicates, we are now in a situation of demographic normality.  For example, the population over the last five years has gone up by 185,000, whereas in the previous ten years it went up by only 160,000.  Therefore in the last five years our population has grown in the aggregate more than it did in the previous ten years and emigration has ended.  It has, in fact, reversed itself in the last five years. From 1971 to 1976 there was an immigration of 12,000 compared, in the previous five-year period with an emigration of 54,000, which is a turn-about of 66,000.</P>
    <P>We know that something profound is happening to our employment structure which I believe has the most awesome consequences for economic <Col N="918" /> policy.  Those figures have been analysed and presented in a study by Professor Walsh.  It is important to understand the uniqueness of our current population situation.  Over the next decade the growth in the active population in the country will be approximately 17 per cent.  Yet the percentages for roughly the same period for other EEC countries are: The Netherlands, 16 per cent, which is very near; Italy, 11 per cent; France, 8 per cent; Belgium, 6 per cent; UK, 3 per cent; Denmark, 3 per cent; and West Germany, just over ½ per cent. With the exception of the Netherlands our growth potential is significantly higher than any of our EEC partners.</P>
    <P>As Professor Walsh has indicated, this growth will be very unevenly distributed by age group, the younger ages experiencing a very rapid growth, the older ages experiencing a contraction. The male and female labour force over the age of 44 will decline by 1986, but there will be a very rapid expansion in the younger labour force, amounting to over 2 per cent annually for males.  The total labour force is projected as rising at over 1 per cent. In addition to experiencing a major change in age distribution within the working population, younger age groups becoming more dominant, there will also be a change in the total numbers at work and looking for work.  This is fuelled, in the main, by a rapid expansion in the younger age group.</P>
    <P>This growth is of an order of magnitude never previously experienced in the country and for which, I believe, we are as yet unprepared.  I believe we will pay the economic and social cost of very heavy emigration during the fifties.  We had in the past what I described as a situation of static equilibrium: that those who left the land and the natural increase in population were balanced off by certain low level increases in the service industries and the manufacturing industries and the rest were forced to emigrate.  It looks as if that is an avenue of escape no longer available to this economy.</P>
    <P>We should therefore look at the figures of Professor Walsh and accepted by NESC very closely indeed, because <Col N="919" /> one set of figures will hammer home the enormity of the problems ahead. During the period from 1966 to 1971 the actual annual average growth rate in numbers at work outside of family farming was 1 per cent, and yet the estimate is that the labour force will grow at an annual rate of a minimum of 2.1 per cent and at a maximum of about 2.4 per cent.  Therefore, putting it very crudely, we will have to double the numbers in new jobs each year outside of farming simply to take account of increasing numbers in the depletion in agricultural labour force but not taking industrial redundancies into account.  NESC have put the figure at 25,000.  This has been accepted by OECD.  The Minister for Finance in his budget speech indicated that the figure is of the order of 30,000 per year.  The OECD say that unless the pattern of migration is reversed a total of 25,000 new jobs per year will need to be created each year over and above the recovery of employment from the present recession, a figure substantially greater than that which was achieved in the past when real GNP was rising at an average annual rate of about 4 per cent.  A similar rise of activity over the medium term would apparently not be enough to provide sufficient employment opportunity.</P>
    <P>That is a pretty ominous conclusion. The situation would be bad enough if we did not have to cope at the same time with the impact of free trade and simultaneously deal with the most severe world recession since the thirties. Structural changes have been occurring during the sixties, which I have indicated.  This economy is now an industrial economy in terms of employment, output and exports.  Free trade, either through the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement or through our membership of the European Economic Community, plus the world recession, have come at a time when we were more dependent than ever on world trade and therefore had a bigger effect on us now than it would have had in a situation comparable with the fifties.</P>
    <P>The coincidence of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, the EEC <Col N="920" /> and the depression could not be worse for our economy, coming on top of the increase in population.  My belief in respect of free trade is that redundancies caused by the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and by the EEC are far greater than was anticipated or is currently realised.  I believe that policy was one of grave miscalculation by the previous Fianna Fáil Administration, the effects of which are being cloaked at the moment by the effects of the world depression but which I know many professional economists in the country now believe is a factor at work on our unemployment as serious as that of the world depression.  I believe the impact of free trade on our manufacturing sector has been profound.  In addition to that we have had the unlucky conjunction of a very poor performance in the United Kingdom economy, not only in terms of inflation, but in terms of unemployment and, of course, depressed demand.  In reality this country is linked with the weakest economy in Europe.</P>
    <P>All of these factors would individually have caused us great difficulty. Collectively, the increase in the population, the impact of free trade, adjustment to EEC conditions would have posed the biggest set of economic problems outside of war time; but, added on top of all that, we have been confronted with the most serious world depression since the thirties.  We are aware of the origins of that crisis, the tripling and indeed the quadrupling of oil prices in 1973, constituting the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the world, with shock effects on world trade, world employment, and on world inflation.  It is true that when it happened most countries, most governments and most economic institutions underestimated the severity and indeed the duration of the crisis.  It is also true that in the inital stages most governments concentrated on dealing with the inflationary aspects of the problem when the real problem was one of depression because of the impact which the transfer of wealth would have on world trade and consequently on domestic production in each country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> The real problem as it emerged was the question of unemployment.  There are now five million people unemployed in the EEC.  We saw in the recent presidential campaign in the United States that Governor Carter, the now President elect, consistently hammered President Ford with one particular statistic, that there were two million more Americans unemployed at the time of the debates than when President Ford took office, and in the last six months 500,000 more Americans had gone on the unemployment register.  No country escaped the impact of the world depression and to pretend otherwise is asinine.  The world crisis created our current spate of economic difficulties.  We did not create the world crisis.</P>
    <P>There is nothing more depressing at a time of economic depression than Fianna Fáil economic propaganda which ignores the very existence of the world crisis.  There is no reference to the external world economy in the recent Fianna Fáil policy statement and there is no reference to the difficulties created by the world crisis in the budget speeches of the Fianna Fáil spokesmen earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Only the most fleeting reference was made by Deputy Lynch in his opening remarks on this debate to the impact of the world recession.  Deputy Lynch's attitude is either dishonest or unbelievably ignorant of the outside world. Fianna Fáil have cast aside all standards of decent debate in an attempt to pin our current economic difficulties on the Government.  On the other hand, the world depression is implicitly recognised by Fianna Fáil when they state that other countries are doing far better than we are at the moment. That is untrue.  Nobody could argue that the economy across the water is signally improving, that it is an example which can be offered in terms of policies which work in respect of employment or inflation.  In France we know of the Prime Minister's plan to tackle inflation.  In Japan inflation has once more taken hold and Germany is also in trouble.</P>
    <P>We are more dependent than ever before on world trade.  In 1975 when world trade fell by 4 per cent, was it <Col N="922" /> surprising that our industrial exports fell by 4 per cent?  When OECD output fell by 3 per cent, was it surprising that ours fell by 1 per cent or was it surprising that unemployment rose by 20,000 during that year?  The Government did not create the world crisis but they have the responsibility of dealing with it.  The area of contention is in relation to how it is to be handled not in relation to who was responsible for the crisis.  Given the past economic policies in this country, the Government's response in relation to budget deficits was a courageous and an enlightened response despite inane and ignorant attacks launched upon it.  It saved jobs, the level of social services and it protected the poor.  What has been achieved in this area has not yet been recognised. While current expenditure went up by £1,000 million or by 260 per cent, revenue only went up by approximately £700 million which left us a shortfall in the region of £300 million. That could have been handled either by cutting services thereby increasing unemployment or it could have been handled by the policy of budget deficits which was pursued by the Government.  The deficit is greater than the expenditure on health, the expenditure on social welfare, the expenditure on education and it is greater than the expenditure on economic services and security and that gives us an idea of the magnitude of this expenditure.  The Government's response was the best response for the country.</P>
    <P>It can and it has been argued with justification that we are at the end of the depression, we are now in a transition period and we require a period of adjustment so that we can accommodate ourselves to a more healthy external environment.  In terms of budgetary policy the improvement can be seen in the fact that the Exchequer figures have improved dramatically. This was a fact hidden by the bank strike but by the end of September it became evident that the deficit would be in the region of £60 million less than was originally anticipated due to buoyancy in revenue.  On current figures, I believe, the deficit will be somewhat below that anticipated.  Control <Col N="923" /> of public expenditure has been exemplary.  Revenue is up by about one third and the budgetary situation is much more healthy than would have been forecast at the beginning of this year because of the correct policies and because of an underlying trend of improvement in the economy.  This gives us an opportunity to get away from any commitment to phase out the deficit over a period of four years because the economy will handle the situation itself.  We will also have an opportunity to avoid further recourse to indirect taxation which would fuel increases in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>At the moment we need a short-term economic plan.  Discussions are going on at tripartite level and also in the context of the Employer/Labour Conference. The Employer/Labour Conference concept is now redundant.  The difficulties in reaching agreement on incomes at a central level proved almost insurmountable last year and this year proved practically insuperable until the Government invited social partners to the tripartite talks.  We should now place discussions on centralised bargaining with respect to incomes within the context of a national short-term economic plan which would be overseen by a national economic council consisting of the parties now engaged in the tripartite talks involving not only income but income tax, social welfare, profits and investments and, therefore, employment.  At the moment there is no conjunction between what is being discussed at the Employer/ Labour Conference and what is being discussed in the councils of the Government in respect of budgetary policy, and yet one has an immediate and obvious impact upon the other. Nothing could be of more importance to the Government in respect of their budgetary policy than agreement reached on pay and the impact that that will have on public service pay. For that reason, we should accept that the Employer/Labour Conference, which was designed in totally different economic circumstances, should now be superseded by a national economic conference at which the Government is an open and explicit participant.</P>
    <P>The Employer/Labour Conference <Col N="924" /> was established prior to the oil crisis in a time of relatively low inflation and extremely high world economic growth but, since 1973, inflation has doubled and, indeed, trebled, while unemployment has increased by about 50 per cent and GNP until this year has been static.  I do not believe the Employer/ Labour Conference is equipped to deal with economic issues other than pay. Yet its decisions affect employment, prices and Exchequer finances.  These considerations, particularly Exchequer finances, are directly influencing the content of the national agreement proposals, yet the parties to the agreement have no explicit way of putting these issues onto the agenda of the Employer/Labour Conference, since their only mandate is to deal with incomes and with costs.</P>
    <P>The big economics issues at the moment are precisely those which are affected by the agreement, but cannot as yet be incorporated within it, employment, inflation, Exchequer financing and budgetary policy.  It is almost impossible to expect from workers a response to cries for restraint, if they do not see that restraint translated into extra employment.  There is no guarantee that restraint, resulting in increases in profits, will be channelled into investment and, therefore, into more employment.  For that reason, the only possibilities for success are within the context of a short term economic plan which would involve budgetary policy.</P>
    <P>As a corollary and a supplement to that, we need a real economic development plan because of the dimension of our employment problems which, as we have demonstrated, are way beyond the capacity of present or past policies, which mainly have been centred around the IDA and completely dependent upon private enterprise.  We need a commitment to full employment, using whatever means are open to us to generate employment.  I do not mean by a plan the control of public expenditure, which is a viewpoint often held by certain people, but we require a plan in the full meaning of the direction and control of investment.  Also we need to liberate, within the context of this plan, the State sector from the confines to which it has been restricted <Col N="925" /> by past ideological attitudes.  In that regard, the publication of the Green Paper is to be welcomed specifically, because of its commitment to a plan which it described as a clearly defined plan and, on page 38, to effective economic and social planning, because of its commitment to a planned system to ensure social justice, because of its commitment to job creation as the overall national priority.</P>
    <P>Because of its commitment to new institutional arrangements to carry out effective economic and social planning, a commitment contained on page 38, as a Deputy of the Labour Party I welcome this aspect of the Green Paper wholeheartedly and see in it a real hope for the future that, as distinct from programming, we can have the emergence of real economic planning. I welcome, too, the Green Paper's short-term response to reduce unemployment and the various means outlined in it.  I also welcome the commitment to mobilise the potentialities of the existing public enterprises, contained on page 37 of the Green Paper, and the prospect of the creation of an industrial development corporation which would supervise and co-ordinate other semi-State bodies and which would also be charged with the identification of new opportunities for productive investment, either public or joint ventures.  That is one of the most important and significant policy innovations contained in the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>I welcome, too, the commitment to regenerate Mianraí Teoranta so that it will undertake directly on behalf of the State exploration and the development of our natural resources.  I welcome the commitment to the establishment of a zinc smelter which has, as we know, a guaranteed supply of concentrates, and the anticipation within the Green Paper of downstream industries involved in processing products of the smelter.  I also welcome the consideration of a development bank, the planned changeover to co-operative enterprises, the sponsoring of co-operative projects, the encouragement of worker participation and profit sharing, the national development bank and the incomes related to pensions schemes which lately has been <Col N="926" /> the subject of a Green Paper.  All of these are to be welcomed.  They are contained within the Green Paper and make it a very worthwhile prelude to planning indeed.  It will not have any response from me other than a positive welcome.  I believe that on the basis of it we can look forward to a White Paper and to a plan based on consensus.</P>
    <P>I believe the Fianna Fáil policy document to be dishonest since it does not mention the existence of a world crisis which must, in itself, be a record.  I believe its job creation targets to be unrealisable.  Specifically, given that in 1973 a 7 per cent increase in GNP only led to 13,000 jobs, I am quite at a loss to see how a similar increase in GNP is projected in 1978 and 1979 to give 25,000 new jobs, given that in those two years the public capital programme contained within that plan is to remain constant. I also believe it to be unrealistic in respect of inflation.  A flexible exchange rate would be the only way in which we could prevent this economy from suffering the worst ravages of inflation.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we can have a meaningful comprehensive economic response to the existing situation unless we also incorporate in it a major review of the link at par with sterling. This year we celebrate the 150th anniversary of that link.  No currency has been linked with any other currency in the world for so long.  It is a situation which is totally and absolutely unique.  It may have had some justification in the 1920s and the 1930s, the last occasion on which it was examined at the behest of this House and of the Government.  We must now have a re-examination of that link.  It is the automatic means for importing inflation, something which is recognised now not only by academic economists, but by the Government and by the Central Bank and, implicitly, yesterday by Deputy Lynch, and yet not acted upon.  I believe inflation in the UK will increase next year, not diminish.  We face the prospect, at a time of economic recovery, of importing a very high rate of inflation.  We have seen its impact.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> For example, it is affecting mortgage rates.  It inhibits investment.  It raises food cost.  It creates social chaos and imbalances.</P>
    <P>This is a taboo which should be subjected to the light of discussion, not only in this House, but preferably by a Government commission.  I hope the Government will undertake to establish a commission along the lines of that set up by the Fianna Fáil Government in the 1930s when this matter was last analysed.</P>

      <P>The sheer naïvete of Deputy Halligan's remarks about sterling, which clearly are not shared by the Government, and let that at least be to the credit of the Government, gives one reason to be disappointed with everything he said before that because if what he said before is based on equally spurious reasoning there cannot, unfortunately, be much sense in any of it.</P>
      <P>Time and time again over the past two years this party in this House and outside it have hammered home the point that in the circumstances of the economic conditions which were obviously developing there was no place whatever for complacency or superficiality or the pursuit of party political advantage.  We repeatedly urged the Government to forego the short-term and blatant pursuit of popularity and to face up to the real issues of inflation and unemployment before it was too late and before total disaster was upon us.</P>
      <P>In that respect I want to quote from a document which was published yesterday and which is most disturbing, to say the least of it.  It was commissioned by the Bank of Ireland, prepared by Messrs McKinsey in a totally apolitical way without any axe to grind in a political or any other sense in regard to this country.  It is simply an effort to set forth the facts in relation to this country and the future of our economy.  I quote part of paragraph 6 on page 2 of that report where it sums up the present situation and what faces us:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But so far we have been buying time rather than addressing the basic issues.  It is no exaggeration to say that a continuation of our present course will lead us headlong into disaster&mdash;and fairly quickly. We shall lose more jobs as our competitive position deteriorates.  The job opportunities open to our young people will become more and more limited, both in numbers and in <Col N="929" /> scope.  There will be major threats to our living standards as investment dries up.  As time passes, the choices open to us will become more difficult&mdash;and more painful.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody could deny the accuracy of that.  It is not tendentious, it is not emotional, it is a simple, plain, factual statement, and unfortunately I am afraid it is true.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to believe that the Government's approach to the economic crisis is anything but a tawdry attempt at papering over the cracks in their bankrupt economic policies.  They had the brass-necked audacity to claim here last night that a major recovery is already on the way, when every ordinary member of the public, not to mention every responsible commentator, is quite clear that we are even now looking over the sheer edge of the precipice. Yesterday we had the Minister for Finance in effect for the first 20 <Col N="930" /> minutes or so of his speech telling us we never had it so good.  That was the gist of his message.  He told us our output was increasing and that a few other things that he managed to scrape up somewhere or other were improving. He and other speakers told us that there had been a major world recession which was the sole cause of our recession here but that we had now turned the corner and there were tremendous prospects for us.</P>
      <P>I can recall as long as almost two years ago attending the opening of a factory in the mid-western region and being informed by the Minister for the Gaeltacht that our economy had turned the corner and that there was nothing but prosperty ahead of us in the years to come.  That was at the end of 1974.  The Government speakers dared to test the patience of the people by claiming again, as they did yesterday, that the current unprecedented chaos for which they are so patently responsible is really due to the fact that Fianna Fáil were in power for so long.  This is the kind of wild statement that we have only too tragically come to expect from that well-known economic wizard the present Minister for Finance.  Let me very quickly, calmly and factually tell him and the Government a few home truths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our national debt today is of the order of 70 per cent of our gross national product which puts it among the highest in the world.  This total debt is nearly three times what it was in 1972, the last full year of Fianna Fáil administration.  The foreign proportion of that debt is now more than four times what it was when we left office.  The servicing of that debt is now costing approximately £7 per week for every worker in this country compared with a little over £2 per week at the time Fianna Fáil left office.  But it is in the current budget deficits of the last three years which I find some of the greatest source of worry of all and to which I will be referring later.  The budget deficit for the current year is no less than 70 times what it was in the last Fianna Fáil budget.  Worse still, the cumulative deficit since this Government <Col N="931" /> came to power is now requiring no less than 25 per cent of the total national debt to finance it.  May I remind the Government that during the entire length of the last world war Deputy Eamon de Valera's Government allowed the national debt of this State to rise by no more than £20 million?  It now costs us more than that each month to service not our existing national debt but the increase in the debt for which this Government have been responsible. Put in simple terms, we have borrowed more in the past 3½ years than we borrowed in the 52 years that this country was independent, from 1921 to 1973.</P>
    <P>This Government were elected in 1973 primarily on the spurious claim that they would control prices.  Since they came to power prices have doubled.  The consumer price index is there to prove that.  Of course many individual items have far more than doubled.  Inflation has now been at disaster level for over two years.  Our unemployment is by far the highest in Europe.</P>
    <P>The truth is that these two years are extremely reminiscent of the period 1956 and early 1957 under the last Coalition Government.  Then, as now, the economy was either contracting or, at the very best, not expanding. Then, as now, unemployment was a growing threat.  Then, as now, the future looked grim and foreboding. To those who lived through those years it will not be necessary to remind them of the comparison nor of the sense of confidence and optimism which was heralded in late 1957 and in 1958 by the return to power of the Fianna Fáil Government.  At that time it seemed impossible but 1958 saw the beginning of a period of 14 years of uninterrupted growth in this country.  There are some people who believe that because two previous Coalitions made a mess and because those messes were put right by Fianna Fáil that it can be just as easily done by Fianna Fáil on this occasion now that the third Coalition has been the most disastrous of them all.</P>
    <P>I do not want to disillusion them about Fianna Fáil's ability ultimately <Col N="932" /> to rectify the economy but I would draw to their attention the huge distinction that exists between the messes which ended each of the last two Coalitions and the mess that exists as this one approaches an end.  The distinction is this: the mess that the two previous Coalitions made more or less ended with themselves.  It was possible to change around the economy within a relatively short time and on each occasion it was done substantially within 12 months.  On this occasion the consequences of this Coalition will haunt this country for decades to come because this Government, unlike the two previous Coalition Governments, have mortgaged our future and that of our children in such a way that the taxation that will be raised here by successive Governments during the next 20 years will have to go in increasing proportion simply to repay what was borrowed in these 3½ profligate years.  That is the major difference between this Coalition and their two ill-fated predecessors. It will be well into the 1990s, and possibly into the next century, before this nation is free of the millstone that has been tied around its neck by the borrowing and profligacy we have seen since 1973.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage I say to the members of the Government for God's sake face up to the truth.  I would tell them: &ldquo;The beginning of wisdom is to admit that you have been wrong.  You have been wrong in your choice of the soft option since you took power.  You have been wrong in refusing to listen to this party and to responsible commentators in budget after budget.  You have been wrong in placing your instincts for power above your concern for the country.  You have been wrong in discouraging the Irishman's and Irishwoman's natural desire to work and to work hard.  You have been wrong in creating a new <i>élite</i> out of those who cynically prefer leisure.  You have been wrong in the content and in the timing of your fiscal reforms.  You have been wrong in your policy and in your ham-fisted negotiation attitudes to the development of our natural resources.  There have been few activities of your administration as a Government which have not been either <Col N="933" /> superficial in their analysis, cynical in their motivation or naïve in their execution. The only single thing you can do now to redeem this unparalleled travesty of a Government is to admit it, to face up to it and to tell the people you have been ill-advised, that you have gambled and lost.  Even now you should bring your joint attention to the economic plight of the country and away from your habitual concern and concentration of simply retaining power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Throughout the 3½ years of this Government there has been a belief that massive use of inflationary current deficits would of themselves end unemployment or reduce it substantially. There was no heed given by the Government to our warning that at a time when the climate of investment confidence had been seriously damaged or destroyed, when the interest rates were high and likely to rise further, when unemployment was at a crisis level and with inflation at the highest rate ever seen in the country, that to continue to increase money supply would not of itself solve unemployment or any other problem.  There was no way that the sort of spending that was induged in could fail to add another major twist to the spiral of inflation at a time when there was no realistic possibility of a growth in output because the private sector had been so discouraged.  This advice was given at successive budgets by Deputy Colley and by other speakers on this side of the House but still the Government continued to plunge us deeper into the financial mire, chasing the chimera of inflation curing employment. Now we have unemployment at the highest level in Europe to prove the point of our argument.  What I fear is that in spite of all their mistakes this Coalition Government are so drunk with power they have not learned anything from their long list of mistakes.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to the other arm of the deadly pincer which is producing the actual crunch in our economy.  I refer to the amazing level of our current savings.  This is mirrored in the fact that we are saving more than 20 per cent of our disposable income, a truly staggering figure <Col N="934" /> which placs us firmly at the head of the European league.  In normal times, indeed up to three years ago, this would have been something to be proud of and to boast about and it would have been of the most tremendous value to the country.  However, in the context of the current economic chaos it may well mean just the opposite.  Such an abnormally high level of savings is undoubtedly due to fear, doubt and uncertainty.  These are the very motives that are governing the activities, or the lack of activities, of investors and causing decisions by entrepreneurs to be deferred or not to be taken at all.  One great danger is that this abnormal rise in savings, compounding the fall in industrial investment, has been more than making up for the direct stimulus given to demand by these recurring budget deficits.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to explain in relation to this that the constant large current budget deficits that we have had should have put a lot of money back into the economy and should have stimulated consumer and domestic demand generally at home.  However, they have not done that.  The figures prove that there has been no significant real rise in domestic demand in spite of the fact that the Government, by virtue of the deficit strategy, have put hundreds of millions of pounds into the economy.  The reason there has not been a rise in consumer and domestic demand is due to the fact that people who have money are saving it, are putting it aside rather than spending it.</P>
    <P>Such value as there might have been in these large and continual current budget deficits has been set aside and rendered useless due to the fact that 20 per cent of our people's disposable income over the past years have often gone into savings when a good proportion of them should have gone into the purchasing of goods of all kinds to stimulate demand within the economy and another large proportion of them should in the normal way, and would I suggest in a normal economy under a normal government, have gone into industrial and commercial investment.</P>
    <P>The tragedy of it is that this has <Col N="935" /> not happened and the abnormally large amounts of money now being saved and now available in the banks and similar institutions is lying there and is not being put to the use to which it could and should be put because of what I described as the atmosphere of fear, doubt and uncertainty about the future which exists not just among entrepreneurs or industrialists or potential industrialists but among even the ordinary people who are not prepared to take the slightest risk and who are not even prepared to spend the money which is now available to them.  The result is that over the past three years there has been almost static demand in our home market in spite of the fact that the Government, in an effort to stimulate demand, have been running record accumulating current budget deficits.</P>
    <P>It is well to remember that very early on in the lifetime of this Government, in fact, on Tuesday, the 11th December, 1973, at Volume 269 of the Official Report, there was a debate in this House on the oil supply situation which had just become a serious problem for this and for other countries.  In the course of that debate, which broadened a bit from just the question of oil supplies and went on to the economy in general, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Keating, then not long arrived in that office, eight months or so, and still presumably full of enthusiasm, said a large number of things which if I had time I would like to quote. However, I will confine myself to two short quotations in that Volume.  At column 1335 he said:</P>
    <P>What one can do, and what prudent government requires is the most detailed planning based on the most detailed investigation and that is being done.</P>
    <P>At column 1337, in the last few sentences of his speech on that occasion, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said:</P>
    <P>The only prudent course is to plan, to work out details and to have ready all the counter-measures on the basis that the less desirable <Col N="936" /> or advantageous options will materialise. This is the only way to approach it.  It is the way we are approaching it.</P>
    <P>I think it is worth looking back now, nearly three years later, at those sentences. What have we seen from the Government and, in particular, what have we seen from the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the lines that he indicated there?  What planning, what detailed investigation, what counter-measures have been proposed and put into effect?  The question is rhetorical, and there is nobody in this country in any doubt that the answer to it is &ldquo;none&rdquo;.  Instead, what have we had from that Minister for Industry and Commerce in the almost three years that have elapsed since 11th December, 1973?  We have had a display of lethargy, disinterest and vacillation. We have not had the introduction in this House of any legislation to deal with the IDA or with the terrible industrial problems that face us today other than two tiny Bills allowing the IDA to borrow more from the Government and allowing the IDA to lend more or to guarantee more to certain industries.  We simply changed the figure of £40 million in the Act of 1969 to £80 million and changed £50 million to £100 million. He introduced those and we tried to have a debate on industrial development and we were told: &ldquo;The IDA are doing great things.  They are sending proposals to my Department and when I have thought them all out we will bring in a Bill and debate them in full.&rdquo;  That is the extent of three and three-quarter years almost of work by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Last week his Parliamentary Secretary, a very pleasant young man, came in here with a Bill about friendly societies being allowed to lend a little more money to their members; he introduced another Bill giving information to consumers, and he will be here tomorrow with a measure setting up some science board in place of the present National Science Council.  These are commendable activities in themselves but they are totally peripheral to the terrible problems that face us.</P>
    <P>We are well over half way through <Col N="937" /> this debate and one would have thought we would have heard from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but we rarely have that pleasure in this House.  I am afraid that the continual display of lethargy and indifference that has been so evident over the past three years is extended to the House as much as it is to all sectors of industry, commerce and development.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few remarks&mdash; I can do it only in general terms in a very confined debate such as this&mdash; about the lack of industrial development, the failure to grasp our opportunities over the past few years in this field, and to make some suggestions in that regard.  The first thing I want to say is that, so far as future industrial development is concerned, I am convinced, and this party is convinced, that in the long term it will have to be based on our own natural resources. We cannot expect to prosper forever or to get away forever with the somewhat artificial industries that we were forced by circumstances to create over the past 20 years or so.</P>
    <P>The long-term secure development of our country can only be assured by industry which is based on our main natural resources, and the principal one of those is agriculture.  It may seem strange to say this now when, unfortunately, we see major coops in this country failing or being on the point of failure, but it is in the processing of milk, beef, pork, poultry and all our other agricultural produce, which they are fortunately in the position to produce more cheaply in most cases than anyone else in this country, and in the adding of value to those, that our long-term secure future as a growing industrial nation will lie.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with a Government decision in October, 1974, the Minister for Health has the main responsibility, including that of co-ordination, in relation to child care.</P>
      <P>Pending receipt and consideration of the final report of the task force on child care services, it would not be appropriate to make any major change in the existing statutory arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say but, as the Deputy is probably aware, there was an interim report and arising out of that the main responsibility was transferred to the Minister for Health. Two other Departments are principally involved, Education and Justice, and the task force is considering the position at present.  I cannot say when it will report but I hope it will not be too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope so, but there may be certain difficulties of either an administrative or legal character that involve these other Departments. The aim was to transfer it to one Department and the task force is considering how that can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Tánaiste has indicated that he would like this situation to come about.  Could the Taoiseach give us his own considered opinion on the matter?  Would he accept that the idea is a good one and, as Taoiseach, would he encourage the realisation of this objective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the Government took the decision to transfer responsibility to the Minister for Health.  Up to that it <Col N="939" /> had been shared between three Departments. A number of factors are involved and it was felt that a task force or inter-departmental body should examine the matter and that is what the task force is doing.</P>

      <P>No bipartite discussions with the British Government are planned on this matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is completely free at her own discretion to sever the £ for £ relationship between the Irish £ and the £ sterling.  As no doubt any other country would make decisions in regard to its currency out of regard to its own interest, Ireland would do the same.  But we must also <Col N="941" /> bear in mind our position within the European Community and the relationship which exists between ourselves and the members of that Community and the consequences to ourselves of variations in the value of the Irish £.  The Deputy may be assured that, while we have had no formal bipartite discussions with the British authorities, we have a continuing exchange of views about the consequences to our economies and to the European situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the consequences of the fall in the value of sterling in our situation would have been a great deal worse had it not been for the foresight demonstrated by the Central Bank at an early stage in present developments in converting the great bulk of our official reserves into currencies other than sterling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the situation as far as Ireland is concerned would have been more disadvantageous if several people, including the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance, had not had adequate foresight to anticipate some of the changes that have taken place.  There have been very substantial changes in recent times which are not in keeping with the true value of the £ sterling. It is possible that adjustments may yet come about which will result in a situation in which the value of the £ will more truly reflect the position in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would agree that not sufficient credit has been given to whoever was responsible&mdash;officially it was the Central Bank&mdash;for their foresight in making that very considerable switch to other currencies when they did?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most certainly helpful that Ireland's foreign reserves are now held substantially in currencies other than sterling because it means that even as the cost of repayment of non-sterling loans may increase, as far as Ireland's overall economic welfare is concerned, the asset value of our external reserves is rising since such <Col N="942" /> reserves are held in non-sterling currencies.</P>

The annual fee becomes payable in November/December and we anticipate that that amount will be collected.  I share the Deputy's view that there is a need to update the Betting Act to take account of changes in social patterns since the Betting Act was introduced.  There is also a need to ensure that illegal betting does not occur in premises which are not licensed for betting, particularly in premises which are licensed for the sale of alcohol.  I have been in discussion with the Department of Justice and the industry itself.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>I indicated in my reply to parliamentary questions on the 4th November, 1975, that the encashment of the outstanding genuine cattle feed vouchers was the liability of the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters Society Ltd. and that the Society then had remaining liabilities of about £200,000 in respect of some 27,000 such vouchers.  I am not aware of any change in the position since that date.</P>
      <P>My Department estimates that approximately £3,100,000 was paid by the society to merchants in respect of genuine vouchers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, there has been a High Court case about this.  The outcome of that was that the fresh meat exporters have been held responsible but they have decided to appeal that decision in the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that when the merchants became involved in this scheme they did so in the belief that the Department had recommended it, also in the belief that they would be paid for the services rendered and the goods supplied?  Is it not a ridiculous situation that almost two years have elapsed and yet small merchants throughout the country have not been paid?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is very unfortunate.  I agree with the Deputy. But these vouchers were the vouchers of the fresh meat exporters and the undertaking to pay was given by the fresh meat exporters.</P>

      <P>Pig numbers have been increasing since about mid-1975 and the latest pig enumeration, at August 1976, showed an increase in pig numbers of 18 per cent over August, 1975.  However, it would appear that the rate of expansion has slowed down and that production in the coming months will show only a modest increase over current levels.</P>
      <P>In the free market conditions of the EEC, we are bound to have fluctuations in production and in margins of profitability.  I am of the opinion that fluctuations in production will be less severe than they were in the past because the larger pig producers realise that it is in their best interests to maintain a steady level of production.</P>

The average list prices of pig fattening meal ranged from £105.25 to £112.29 per tonne in October, 1976, as compared with £82.25 to £85.85 per tonne in October, 1975.</P>

      <P>That was the point I was making a while ago, that the price of meal has jumped by almost 30 per cent but the price paid for pigs has not, irrespective of what the meat costs in the shops.  The price <Col N="956" /> of meal has gone sky high but the price for the finished product has not risen in accordance with it and the result is that some producers will be put out of business.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The only EEC regulation in relation to imports of sheepmeat from third countries is the requirement under Article 59 of the Treaty of Accession that the new member states must align their customs tariff by stages with the common customs tariff of 20 per cent.  This alignment will be concluded as from 1st July, 1977.</P>
      <P>The effect in the UK of the tariff alignment would be difficult to isolate because other factors, such as volume of imports and of home production and prices of other meats affect the price level of sheepmeat there.</P>
      <P>The situation in France is that the common customs tariff applies.  In addition, France operates a system of minimum import prices and levies on imports of sheep and sheepmeat from third countries and from the new member states designed to maintain a high level of sheepmeat prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Salmon and peal are jointly recorded under the heading of salmon.  The number taken from the ESB weir at Limerick in each of the years 1972 to 1976 was 3,285, 4,247, 2,556, 4,184 and 1,465, respectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The drop in the 1976 catch is considered to be due to the following: reduction of returning stock, illegal fishing by bigger vessels off the mouth of the Shannon and the low-water period coinciding with the peak period for fishing.  My information is that it is likely the numbers will increase again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot confirm that information, but what steps are being taken to prevent the illegal fishing which is going on continuously not alone at the mouth of the Shannon but around the coast generally, particularly in the counties of Kerry and Clare?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Every possible effort is being made by the Department and boards of conservators to reduce illegal fishing.  In my view it is almost impossible to wipe this out, but measures as effective as we can <Col N="963" /> make them are being taken and the Deputy can be assured that the Department are mindful of the destruction caused by illegal fishing.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware there has been some difficulty in the Dublin area in the expansion of the projects.  This arises from the situation whereby each one of these projects has to be agreed with the trade union authorities.  Schemes are prepared on the basis that craftsmen will not be ruled out, that there will be no loss of work opportunities for any such trade union people who may be unemployed.  This has involved consultation with the building groups in the ICTU and with the training authority and before each project gets off the ground it must be agreed in consultation with these interests.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would look at the details of programmes he would realise that sometimes it is very difficult to reach targets.  In relation to the premium employment programme I set a target which was roughly double that which was achieved.  In the area we are talking of we are faced with one serious difficulty, that is, the necessity of consulting with union organisations in the area in which we wish to see projects expanding.  Certain difficulties have arisen in the Dublin area.  We are endeavouring to overcome these but they may result in targets not being met.  The difficulties arise from the legitimate objections of unemployed craftsmen who claim that work would be lost to them as a result of the projects.</P>

      <P>While the target set was 10,000, we succeeded in achieving a figure of about 5,500.  As the Deputy knows this programme depended for success on employer and business confidence and on the state of the market.  As a result of these factors we did not reach our target. However, this does not mean that at any time we should fail to set targets or try to have them achieved but when targets are not achieved we should be accurate in giving the reasons for the failure.</P>

      <Col N="970" /> *Figures showing the numbers of persons registered with the National Manpower Service must be treated with caution. The service is available to all persons&mdash;not just those who are unemployed and it is not possible to say how many of the total are &ldquo;job-changers&rdquo;, i.e., people with a job who are interested in seeking alternative employment and who register with the service for this purpose.  Also a proportion of those who are registered on any one day may have secured employment otherwise than through the service.  Changes in the numbers registered also reflect changes in the administration of the National Manpower Service and do not therefore accurately reflect changes in labour market conditions.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann expresses satisfaction with the Government's economic and social policies.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Labour.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the luncheon interval I was speaking about some of the views expressed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce here in this House on 11th December, 1973, about planning that he was starting and the counter-measures against economic difficulties he was about to take.  I read two short quotations and I should like now to read one more sentence from column 1336 of the Official Report of that date.  Talking about solving economic crises and economic problems he said: &ldquo;When I say &lsquo;solve&rsquo; one can either react courageously, vigorously and with foresight or one can fail to react&rdquo;. Those were stirring words but that is all they were, words.  I should like to ask where is there evidence of the courage and vigour about which the Minister spoke nearly three years ago. Where is there evidence of the plan about which he spoke?  Where is there evidence of reaction to difficulties? Where is there evidence of the counter-measures taken to resolve the difficulties that arose?  I cannot see any evidence of any reaction, other than short-term expediency to try to maintain the popularity of the Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This process of Coalition Government was described at the time as open Government.  I should like to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whom we so very rarely see in this House, to what are the Government open?  In his case Government seems to be open to nothing but vacillation and lethargy.  We have had no example of anything except these qualities over the past three years. We had this man whose whole life's work ever since he graduated from that well-known academy in Pembroke Lane seemed to be dedicated to planning. We heard him on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; on Saturday night last <Col N="986" /> saying that planning was now a thing of the past.  It was impossible if people had not the will for it and there was no point in trying to devise a plan. Is there ever a man who has given up all hope and shown every indication that he has given up all hope of tackling, let alone solving, the grave problems that beset the country and its economy today?  I do not think his failure, his unwillingness or his inability to face up to these problems are unique to him.  They are shared, unfortunately, to a greater or lesser degree by all his colleagues.</P>
    <P>Before the luncheon interval I was talking, of necessity, unfortunately, in a confined debate like this, in very general terms about the long-term strategy that we as a country seeking to develop our industry would have to follow and I was recommending that, in spite of the fact that over the last few years we have had an unhappy experience in regard to industries based on our primary natural resources, nonetheless the only secure long-term development for our industrial expansion must be industry based on the processing of the natural resources we have in abundance and they are primarily our agricultural resources. It is tragic to see the failure to add value to these extremely cheap, by world standards, resources.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is and will remain our primary natural resource but there are other natural resources happily available to us, resources of which unhappily we have failed to take advantage.  The one that most obviously springs to mind is the huge zinc and lead mine to come into production in, I understand, a matter of months in Navan.  That is the richest zinc mine in Europe and one of the richest in the world.  We have two other small zinc mines which will probably run out in the foreseeable future but the mine in Navan has a life of between 20 and 30 years, possibly 35 years, depending on the rate of extraction allowed.  What prospect have we of adding value to that ore? We have none in the foreseeable future.  Despite the fact that we have 108,000 unemployed we have not seen fit as a nation over the past three years or so to make the necessary <Col N="987" /> plans to have a smelter built to process at least a good proportion of the ore.  That ore, the property of the Irish people, will be going abroad to have three-quarters of its ultimate value added to it in South Wales, in the Ruhr, in France and other parts of Europe.</P>
    <P>Last April the Minister for Industry and Commerce finally decided he would instruct the IDA over the 12 month period ending 31st March next to have discussions and receive proposals from interested parties with a view to building a smelter.  It is common knowledge the building will take at least four years.  It cannot be done in less time.  The contract cannot be given out before at the earliest April, 1977, and we cannot, therefore, have a smelter in operation before the summer of 1981.  Indeed, it would be surprising if it could be in operation even at that time.  It is likely it will be some years later.  At that rate five years or one-quarter of the ore output of the Navan mine will have departed these shores without any value being added to it by Irishmen and without any value being obtained for it other than the price of the ore itself and the concentrates.  For that to happen at any time would be a tragedy.  For it to happen at this particular time is inconceivably tragic.  It is an appalling indictment of the man or men in Government who have allowed this to happen.</P>
    <P>There is another natural resource happily available to us.  There is natural gas in reasonable quantities off Kinsale Head.  What are we doing with it?  Are we using it for what it is, a cheap source of highly efficient power to develop industry and give industry advantages it would not otherwise have?  Not at all.  We are not doing that.  We are turning it into electricity by a process in which it loses two-thirds of its calorific value. If we had unlimited supplies, some might be used in this way but we have one moderately-sized find and the bulk of that moderately-sized find will go into the production of electricity.  A source of cheap, efficient power is being converted into an inefficient and <Col N="988" /> expensive form of energy.</P>
    <P>We have hopes of the discovery of oil off our coast.  There has been no commercial discovery and the indications are that, if oil is discovered in commercial quantities, it will be discovered off the west coast in waters varying in depth between 1,500 and 2,500 feet.  It is also known and cannot be denied that the whole question of the commercial recoverability of such deposits of oil in that depth of water is a long term proposition.  If a discovery were made next summer it is unlikely that this country would get any benefit from the recovery of the oil within a period of about 12 years because the whole technology for the recovery of oil in such circumstances is only now commencing and the ability to land it and refine it is, unfortunately for us, a distant prospect.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government laid great stress on the likelihood of an early discovery of oil in commercial quantities in situations from which they are commercially recoverable.  It is disturbing to know that, after our finest summer and the calmest seas, in perhaps 50 years and a very long exploration season as a result, there has not been a single discovery this season which began in April and ended last month.  Added to that is the fact that in the comparatively shallow and sheltered waters of the Celtic Sea quite a number of blocks have been handed back to the Government by companies who are entitled to explore those blocks, because they felt there were no longer any prospects in them.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the fond hopes of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government that the terrible debts which are now inflicted on this nation can be paid in some vague way by those oil discoveries in the very near future are but fond and pious hopes.  The evidence is not there, unfortunately for us, to show that we will be in a position to do that and thereby rectify the errors that have been made over the past three years.</P>
    <P>I wanted to deal with the IDA but unfortunately I have no time to do it. I want to do two things in the one breath: I want to pay tribute to them and I want to sympathise with <Col N="989" /> them.  They are doing the best they possibly can in shocking circumstances for them because the rug is constantly being pulled from under them by the Government who should be devoted to helping them to the fullest possible extent.  The Government are creating a climate in this country which is inimical to industry of all kind, whether it be foreign or domestic.  I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that such industries as have opened over the last three or four years seem to be very predominantly foreign industries. They are here for one principal reason: because we, as a result of the protocol which Dr. Hillery negotiated on our entry into the EEC, are still able to offer them tax free incentives on their profits up to 1990.  That is a wasting asset and every year that passes it becomes less attractive.  The IDA, the Government and all of us will have to realise that we cannot continue, as we have been, attracting industry on that rather artificial basis.</P>
    <P>When that started back in the fifties it was a strategy which was very valid in the Ireland of that time with virtually no industry.  We have to change our direction now in the attraction of industry and we have to concentrate on our own people.  We should not concentrate on the type of industry which is coming here to maximise its profits in order to minimise them in other countries where it would have to pay tax.  We have to concentrate our attention on the solid things we have here&mdash;our natural resources of agriculture, minerals, gas, oil and whatever else we may be fortunate enough to find.</P>
    <P>We had a long speech today from Deputy Halligan who blames, first of all, the world crisis for all the difficulties facing the country and the Government today and blames the Fianna Fáil Party, in particular, for leading this country into free trade in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the European Economic Community.  How does Deputy Halligan think that we, as a nation of three million people, can give our people the standard of living to which they are entitled and to which they <Col N="990" /> aspire if we are to go back to the days of the thirties, look inwards and have protection and not free trade? The man must be mad in blaming the world crisis for all our problems. This is in stark contrast with the views expressed by the Taoiseach of the Government which Deputy Halligan now supports, who told us just a year ago that, while the world crisis had a certain influence on our affairs, we are primarily responsible in this country for our problems?  How does Deputy Halligan square what he is saying in support of the Green Paper, and what he calls the economic and social successes of this country over the past three years, with the sentiments of Deputy Barry Desmond who condemned virtually every aspects of the Government's economic policy of the past few years?  Those things do not stand up.  The sooner we get the opportunity&mdash;now that the Coalition have funked fighting a presidential election against us&mdash;of fighting a general election against them, the sooner will we start to get some place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of participating in this debate.  It is important that from time to time we discuss exactly where we are going and give the Opposition time to put forward policies.  To date however we have seen very little of those policies.  The position of our economy has been outlined in detail in recent publications, and there is not much point in going into their findings. A proper analysis of the cause of the problems and the remedies which might be prescribed is needed now.  It is simplistic to lay the blame completely on the Government or to say that the fault lies with external influences only.  Our economy could be put on an even keel reasonably easily if either of those things were true. The unfavourable external influences cannot be underestimated.  It is well to remember that this is not a new thing but has been going on since the late sixties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the reasons which tempted the now Leader of the Opposition to go quickly to the country in <Col N="991" /> 1973.  He was then aware of the economic problems that would beset the country.  He tried to buy time by having a general election in February of that year and get re-elected so that he would have five years to play around with.  He misread the situation. He lost the election.  Solutions to our problems will require clear thinking on what we want from our economy. People must decide to what extent they are prepared to make some sacrifices now to achieve a higher standard of living.  In times of economic troubles it is necessary for us to make certain sacrifices to ensure that the future will be better, that there will be a favourable climate for industrial and agricultural development.</P>
    <P>It is essential to realise that, in comparison with many European countries, Ireland is relatively underdeveloped in regard to economic structure. Along with this there is a demand for Government services and wages on a basis comparable to larger economies.  We feel we must be in line with the wealthier nations in their welfare services, educational standards and wage structures.  That is not possible unless we match those nations in productivity.  If we are not prepared to match them in productivity, then we must tailor our expectations accordingly.  Without higher productivity, increased wages are a mirage and are not a reflection of higher living standards; they will raise the cost of living and inflation, and will in time undermine our whole economy.</P>
    <P>To improve living standards there must be structural changes in agriculture and industry.  Investment is required to provide further employment. I am glad the Minister for Finance said yesterday that the emphasis will have to shift towards greater investment in the agricultural industry.  There is a great potential, now that we are in the Common Market, for development of our agricultural industry.  The market and the profitability are there.  It is a question of the Government providing the necessary incentives and encouragement to ensure that the agricultural <Col N="992" /> end of our economy expands.  A greater emphasis must be placed on the spin-off industries from agriculture so that we get the greatest return from them by way of jobs and money.</P>
    <P>The same must be said of industry. We are an emerging industrial nation. Industries have been protected for too long and are now feeling the full blast of free trade.  This is one of the reasons why there is such high unemployment, that when free trade came industry was not sufficiently geared to meet it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley spoke about our natural resources being dissipated or not being used to the full.  It is time the smelter was got under way.  However, the Fianna Fáil record in the field of mining leaves a lot to be desired.  At least this Government have structured the tax mechanism to get quite a large slice of profit from the mines for the people of Ireland.  We must contrast that with their performance when they were in Government, when they gave such enterprises a tax-free holiday for 20 years, when after 20 years there would not be a trace of ore left in the ground.  When one listened to the last speaker pontificating about this despite their own performance when he was a Minister in that Government, one had to doubt his credibility.</P>
    <P>The messages contained in recent independent reports have been repetitive: competitiveness must be improved; a greater quantity of goods must be sold to achieve growth in the economy and to reduce unemployment. However, this message does not seem to have got across to those engaged in determining pay policy.  The extent to which it has been ignored is alarming.  The unions appear to be more anxious to push selfishly for short-term gain.  The unions as well as all other associations have an obligation to the whole of society not just to their members.  The unions in particular have an obligation to the unemployed, to the people who were working and who, because of economic trends are no longer working.  It is not good enough particularly for the stronger unions who have many members in protected employment to push demands that cannot be met <Col N="993" /> without creating further unemployment. Everyone has a role to play and I am not knocking the unions as such.  Most other pressure groups in the nation are lecturing the Government on what they should do, but they themselves do not appear to feel that they have any responsibility to the country and lay the blame completely and continually at the doorstep of the Government.  The Government have of course a responsibility to give leadership, but these groups in society also have a responsibility to ensure that what they are doing is in the best interest of everybody.</P>
    <P>The major problem in our economy is a tendency to fossilise in its existing way of doing things.  Even if the economy is only to maintain its present progress, it must be made more willing to adapt to change.  Other nations have been more adaptable and flexible in their production methods. If we are to remain competitive we must meet this change.  I must pay tribute here to the Government for the moneys being allocated to AnCO for the purpose of industrial training. This is a further proof of the Government's aim to provide manpower for the expansion in our industrial output and in the economy generally when it comes.</P>
    <P>We cannot overstress the importance of improved productivity.  If we want to maintain and improve our standard of living we must be prepared to change and to make sacrifices in order to ensure that we can gear ourselves to a course of higher productivity. It is important that wage restraint be considered. If we pay ourselves too highly we will price ourselves out of the markets we have.  The world, the EEC and our neighbours across the water owe us nothing.  We must be competitive.  Great markets with tremendous potential are there, now that we are in Europe; but we must change our attitude and style so as to avail of them.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have discovered natural resources and that we shall have gas available in fairly substantial quantity will make a great difference in our economic life, but it will only <Col N="994" /> be effective if we plan and develop our resources properly.  It is time that the smelter proposal got under way. It will give a further stimulus to industry because I would see resulting from this smelter a new metallurgical industry.  The possibilities are great. In planning for the eighties we must plan along the lines of our natural resources.  This would mean that we do not have to import at high prices since we have the resources at home to manufacture, develop and export goods.</P>
    <P>One can see tremendous possibilities in the areas of agriculture, natural resources and our industrial arm. These must all be developed.  We must decide where we are going and what we want to do.  Our entire industrial package needs to be examined regarding improvements in terms of market research so as to find out exactly where markets exist for what we can produce.  This is a tremendous field.  I must pay tribute to the various Government agencies in this connection. They have done a good job but, like all agencies, they must be examined from time to time to ensure that they are measuring up to and meeting the needs of our situation.</P>
    <P>The future need is investment to provide jobs.  One of the major problems which we cannot escape is unemployment. It is a cancer in our society that we must strive to eradicate. The Government must provide the props, the leadership and all the aid it can give.  If these aids and props are not availed of by industry, by the unions and other bodies concerned our efforts will not succeed.  It is up to free enterprise to take the initiative. The Minister for Finance said yesterday that the growth rate this year will approach 4 per cent.  That is encouraging but we must not consider this adequate.  We must now build solidly for the future.</P>
    <P>The major cleavage today is not between the white collar and the blue collar workers, between the skilled and the unskilled, but between those in secure jobs and those in jobs which can and may disappear.  It is easy for people in secure employment to demand high increases.  They feel they <Col N="995" /> have the muscle with which to get big increases at the expense of employment in competitive fields.  We had the case of the building workers and the banks.  The banks were trying to justify large increases but they operate in an area of protected employment and had the wherewithal to pay regardless of what the ultimate cost might be to the community generally. In the case of the building industry, basically they are only in competition with each other.  They sell houses only in the home market and this industry is a type of closed shop, in my view. They do not price each other out of business.  So, it is easy for these businesses to look for large increases.  In both cases the employers wanted to give the increases because it would not affect their business to any great extent.  But what about the large number of businesses that are in competition abroad?  They cannot afford vast increases and if they are forced into conceding them it results in further closures.  This is why it is imperative that we come up with some sound incomes policy.  When people talk of an incomes policy they conjure up all sorts of sanctions being applied.  I think the only way to get a satisfactory incomes policy is by negotiation and agreement.  There are talks between the social partners and the Government going on at present.  I wish them well and hope they will succeed in reaching a fruitful conclusion. The outcome of the talks will affect our economic development.  If agreement cannot be reached in this area it will be very hard to plan for the future.  It is desirable for the social partners not only to consider the thousands of people they are bargaining for but also the thousands of unemployed and those who might be unemployed if an equitable settlement is not reached.</P>
    <P>The Government should give an incentive to industry to create the right climate for profitability.  Industry must make profits in order to reinvest for expansion.  That is an important aspect of any fiscal policy.  People go into business to make a profit.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Indeed, it is man's primary motivation.  Man is a <Col N="996" /> selfish animal and only looks for gain. If we do not give industry a profit motive people will invest their money in non-productive areas.</P>
    <P>There should be a more trusting relationship between private and public enterprise.  Some extension in Government activity is inevitable in view of our economic difficulties.  Great play is made of our high unemployment figure.  In the past we had the buffer of the emigrant ship to keep unemployment at a low level but that is no longer the case today.  A new outlook in education will have to be adopted to help our young people.  In times of scarcity it is necessary to direct resources into more productive channels More money should be spent on technical education and the time has come to have a technical college on the north side of the city.  When this country emerges economically and industrially stronger more technical skills will be required in order to avail of our opportunities.  There is no point in having to import expertise.  It is important that the Government should come to terms with our economic problems.  There has been a lift in the economy but we must plan for the future.  We must develop markets in the EEC with a view to creating the maximum number of jobs.  The time has come to plan for the eighties. People are not fools; they know that our economic problems will not disappear overnight.  One sees the potential of this country.  But we must provide a plan, we must ensure that the industrial and agricultural part of our economy is exploited to the full.</P>
    <P>The future for this country is very bright.  In the teeth of a world recession and economic disaster in other countries, under this Government the ship has sailed reasonably steadily. That is something we should remember. Had the Opposition been on this side of the House during this economic recession&mdash;when one looks at their performance about giving away our mineral rights and how they would have taken on any other aspect of our economy&mdash;one must give credit to the Government and be thankful that we did not have the Opposition here at this time because their performance, as an Opposition, during this period of <Col N="997" /> economic problems has been pathetic. What would their performance in Government have been like?  I have no doubt it would have been even worse than it has been in Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose one could do worse than take the penultimate sentence of Deputy O'Brien's contribution as a text because it seems to be the key note of Government speeches in this debate, such as they have been.  Deputy O'Brien said that the ship of state is sailing steadily on. Then he quoted the hypothesis that the situation would have been a great deal worse than it is now had the Fianna Fáil Party been in Government. This is an unsupported statement of Deputy O'Brien.  I did not have an opportunity of hearing the Minister for Labour yesterday but I did hear the Minister for Finance for some time.  Putting the reports for the Minister for Labour's speech along with my hearing of the Minister for Finance it would appear that these two Ministers also feel that things on the whole are fairly good in the country. The Minister for Finance yesterday referred repeatedly to some prediction made by some unspecified economic expert of the expectancy of a 3 per cent growth rate in the coming year.  Then gratuitously he said there could very well be a 4 per cent growth next year, and that was very good.  I do not know what is the basis of this expectation.  The Minister did not enlighten me as I listened to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning we had the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  He, naturally, and I suppose rightly, dwelt fairly heavily on agricultural matters.  He did seem also to share his Government's belief that there is really no problem of any great dimension in the country.  All of this begs the question: are the Government living in a world of unreality?  Are they totally unaware of the running-down of industry, of the rapidly growing problem of the employment of young men and women leaving schools and colleges?  I should imagine it would not be an over-statement to say that there must be at least 100,000 of these unregistered unemployed looking for jobs that are not there, <Col N="998" /> in a country where jobs are diminishing rather than increasing.  In spite of that three Ministers and Deputy O'Brien seem to think that, for some obscure reason, about the nature of which they did not enlighten us, there will be this growth rate of 3 per cent, and possibly 4 per cent, in the coming year.  Perhaps before the debate ends we will hear the source of that confidence.</P>
    <P>I was hoping that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in the context of this expectation and indeed in his area of influence on agriculture, would have made particular reference to the Government's Green Paper published recently postulating a growth rate in agriculture of 6 per cent per annum.  I had hoped the Minister would have dwelt somewhat on that matter in his contribution, most of which I heard this morning. But, I regret to say, he did not.  Like Deputy O'Brien, who has just left the House, he unburdened himself of a number of platitudes to the effect that it is necessary to apply fertiliser if one wants to produce more grass; it is necessary to have more cattle if one wants to increase meat and beef production; and certain other observations of that kind which one would have thought were fairly widely-shared objectives.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that possibly one Minister or backbencher in supporting the Government, would have had something to say about the increasing unprofitability of work in Ireland and the increasing tendency to tax the diminishing work force in order to support the increasing number of unemployed.  There are extraordinary abuses and anomalies in that area.  I would have thought they were a matter of such importance that some member of the Government would have dealt with them and told us, first of all, with regard to the question of abuses of unemployment benefit, what measures the Government proposed to rectify the situation where the increased taxation of the work force is being used to subsidise this type of abuse and thereafter tell us what expectancy we might have that the situation might revert to its former <Col N="999" /> position, which it ought to be in all the time: that the reward for working will always be greater than that which people get either for being deprived of their employment through the closure of their workplace or for electing personally to remain unemployed.  Anybody who thinks about the affairs of this country knows that this is so, especially in the case of the lower-paid workers who are severely taxed in income and other taxes while, in a great many cases their unemployed neighbours may be drawing a great deal more.  But it is forgotten that the money which unemployed people draw is taken, in the first place, from workers generally, including the lower-paid. I had hoped that that situation would have been clarified a little by some Government speaker but it has not been touched on at all.</P>
    <P>I want to come to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries' contribution to this debate this morning.  His speech seemed to have been prepared three weeks ago because embedded in the middle of it was an idiotic claim, a parrot-like repetition of the bonanza story that hit all the headlines of the newspapers and was heard on the radio and television news bulletins after the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries had attended the meeting of the Council of Ministers at which the Irish green £ was devalued.  We have become accustomed to this when the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries goes to Brussels or Luxembourg.  The Minister told us this morning that this bonanza was worth £40 million put into the farmers' pockets.  A moment's thought would have told the Minister that as far as trade with Europe is concerned the situation with regard to monetary compensatory allowance is now far worse than it was before 2nd October when the devaluation took place.</P>
    <P>I should like to put the figures on record.  On 2nd October the MCA for exports to Europe was £6.47 per cwt.; or, in the case of a 12 cwt. bullock, about £77.52 taxes on each bullock. As a result of devaluation, in the first week these MCAs dropped by £5.88 per cwt. to £70.56 per head for the 12 cwt. bullock.  On 16th October, two <Col N="1000" /> weeks later, the MCA per cwt. on these exports was back to where it started, £6.46 per cwt. or £77.52 per head export taxes.  There were other taxes also. It stayed stationary for 14 days and on 30th October it had risen to £7.32 per cwt., almost £1 per cwt. more than it was on the day of devaluation.  That meant that the MCA taxes on the same bullock would then be £87.84.  Next week the situation will be that the MCA will have risen to £8.40 per cwt. or £100 MCA tax on a 12 cwt. bullock. That is the &ldquo;bonanza&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that, because of the failure of the British Government to devalue at the same rate as we did, there is a residual benefit provided we export to the United Kingdom.  The Germans, or the Danes, exporting cattle, as they do intensively at present, will get an export refund, money handed into their fist by the EEC, at the rate per lb. deadweight of 28p.  We must compete with that with our 5p gained by devaluation of the green £.  A German farmer gets £17 per cwt. export refund if he exports to the United Kingdom market and a Danish farmer gets the same, but an Irish farmer gets £3.  This morning the Minister was still talking enthusiastically about that as the bonanza, the <i>El Dorado</i>.  Last week the Minister for Finance in Luxembourg, contemplating this bonanza, said the time had come to tax the farming community more heavily because of the increased wealth they would be gaining from this phantom.  Later he denied he had made the suggestion and later still he denied that he denied it. I am waiting to see whether the Minister has yet settled and reached the earth and whether the denial of the denial denial is the final position.  The Minister for Finance seems to share the relief of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries that the ephemeral effect of the devaluation of the green £ was a thing that should be taxed.  I should like to tell the Minister that the Government have been subsidising the Irish consumer for the last three years at the producers' expense by failing to get a realistic devaluation of the green £.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was this morning talking about the restoration of confidence and our incapacity to advance unless we <Col N="1001" /> had a restoration of this confidence. But I should like to suggest that the way to restore confidence is to pay the producer the price he is entitled to, the price that his French, German and Dutch colleagues get in Europe.</P>
    <P>Our reference price, apart from the United Kingdom, has been the lowest of the other member states.  It is not fair or right to compare our situation to the situation in the United Kingdom, because they are large net importers of food.  On the other hand, more than any other country in Europe we live by exporting food, and it is reasonable to say that the more we get for the food we export the better off the country is.</P>
    <P>If farmers' incomes rose sufficiently to derive benefit from the real value of exports, the Minister for Finance might talk sensibly about taxing farmers' incomes. For the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries not to understand these matters is something I find hard to believe&mdash;I do not expect the Minister for Finance to understand them.  It was clear this morning that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries had only a hazy idea of what had happened since the glorious victory of 2nd October.  It is a fantasy that is put on for the benefit of the press.  The view appears to be that if one gets the headlines the first day what happens afterwards is really not important.</P>
    <P>In my view the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is being held back by his socialist colleagues in Government who want to have the situation continue that the food producers will continue actively to subsidise the price of food by forfeiting the profit they are entitled to.  The Minister is too loyal a colleague to say this, but he must know it.  He established one thing in Luxembourg: that it is no longer necessary for us to follow like sheepdogs behind their masters; it is no longer necessary for our green £ and the British green £ to keep any sort of steady relationship. Having done that the Minister should now go for a realistic devaluation of the green £ and then he will get the restoration of confidence, the rebuilding of the herds that he was talking about this morning.  In talking about <Col N="1002" /> it the Minister was conceding that the Irish herds&mdash;cattle, sheep or pigs&mdash; have been decimated in numbers and in health since the arrival of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the speech, which was dated, was written by a civil servant who was unfamiliar with the world.  The Minister innocently spoke of free access to the European market. How can he say that when if you want to send a bullock on the hoof to Germany next week, it will cost you £100 to pay the MCA before it gets on the boat?  The real effect of this change in the revaluation of the German Mark, the continuing slide of the British £ and the puny devaluation of our green £ is that we are excluded almost totally from the European market, where we must build.  Britain is very rapidly reaching a condition of self-sufficiency in red meat.  The Irish agricultural economy must of necessity develop rapidly in the markets of the mainland.  The effect of the smallness, weakness and short-livedness of the Minister's famous victory is to exclude us almost totally from the European market.</P>
    <P>The Minister, talking about the need to reconstruct the cattle herd above all, got the message from this party. It is slowly beginning to penetrate his mind that the greatest resources this country has is the cattle herd, in spite of the fact that during the last couple of years we have seen the wholesale slaughter of breeding stock and the sale of calves and this is still going on.  If the Minister got a realistic devaluation of the green £ this need not go on.  It would not pay an Italian to come here to buy calves.  Perhaps the Minister had not the permission, the vision or the will to go for a realistic devaluation.  In no other way will the Irish producer get the reward to which he is entitled and, having got it, he is entitled to talk to the taxman.  That is the situation as I see it.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know that the downturn in livestock numbers of all kinds, cattle, sheep and pigs, has been largely the result of the mismanagement by the Government of which he is a member.  I hesitate to <Col N="1003" /> blame him solely for this because there is such a thing as collective responsibility. As he is the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries he is the man who must take the blame.  Within the Government itself he is the victim of unfair pressures.  While he might recognise the vital steps that must be taken for the restoration of the cattle herd, he will not be allowed to do it, just as the various EEC schemes, most of which are contributory, have become stultified and made a nonsense of by the reluctance of the Government to make a sufficient contribution to render them worth while.  I am talking now of such schemes as the disadvantaged areas scheme or the retirement scheme under Directive 160.  The Government do not want these schemes because if they worked the Exchequer would have to make a subscription.  In the case of Directive 160, I think, it is a 65 per cent contribution. They would have to make a similar contribution under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  The Government do not want to pay, so the retirement scheme is not working at all. That is the way the Government want it.</P>
    <P>I keep hoping the Government might recognise the vital necessity for the restoration of the suckler herd. There were 750,000 cows in the suckler herd three years ago; there are so few now that they are not worth talking about.  They were slaughtered in 1974.  In order to keep a floor under the calf market and rebuild the numbers in the herd, it is absolutely vital that we re-establish the suckler herd that was wiped out by the inaction of the Government.  I suggest that the beef incentive scheme be resuscitated because it is necessary for the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister alluded this morning to the price of the land and described it as a mixed blessing.  That is very bad for farmers, especially small farmers, because it has the effect of wiping the small man out of the land market altogether.  The price of agricultural land at present bears no relation to its economic value as farm land.  The victims of the speculator <Col N="1004" /> scales are the small farmers, the farmers aspiring to development status which they cannot reach unless they get extra land.  How can they pay £1,500 an acre?  Where will they get that money?  It is simply not on. There is no protection for the small farmer from the speculator.  If the Government do not do it, we will. Any responsible Irish Government must carry out their responsibility to their people on the land.  If the people are not there what good is the land? I do not know if these points were perceived by the Government or any member of it.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has joined us because I want to refer especially to the small farmers in all areas, but especially the western areas.  He said this morning that they should put out of their heads forever the notion of trying to be cattle farmers on 50 acres because it will not work.  There are two things that will work, apart from horticulture, and they are milk production and pig breeding.  Fattening pigs should be done co-operatively, as it is done in many areas.  The breeding of pigs can be done on a fairly large scale by people with very little land.  I would prefer to see smaller farmers, especially in the western areas, being assisted in this highly skilled business and we must provide that skilled assistance. We are all talking through our hats about saving the west&mdash;it is still worth doing&mdash;unless we adopt the necessary means to do this.  Keeping a medium-sized breeding herd of pigs can improve the fertility of the holding and the farmers can make a living from the project.</P>
    <P>This morning on the general question of the glad new dawn the Minister spoke about the desirability of using fertilisers.  There are two infallible markers as to the condition of agriculture.  One of these is livestock numbers&mdash;we have been talking about those&mdash;and the other is the use of fertilisers. Since 1973 fertiliser use has been cut in half.  It is necessary to bear this in mind when the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or any of his colleagues is talking in a rather blithe way about the 6 per cent per annum expansion expected.  In the context of <Col N="1005" /> diminishing flocks and herds and of the diminishing use of fertilisers it must be admitted that the cost of raw phosphate or of any other phosphate has quintupled since the Coalition came to office.  It is true also that the profits to which farmers and food producers are entitled have been filched from them by the failure of the Minister to get a sufficient devaluation of the green £ as the £ sagged during the past three years.  If the farmer were receiving the profit to which he is entitled he would be buying the phosphate and the potash, dear as they are.  Unless there is sufficient use of fertilisers the Minister cannot hope to get the increased production he talks of.</P>
    <P>There is another factor in soil fertility to which the Minister did not allude.  I refer to the use of some form of calcium carbonate, the price of which has trebled since this Government came to office.  While I cannot say exactly what are the usage figures of this product, I know that they have dropped dramatically.  This is a very important factor in the context of the western areas in particular because the lime content of the soil must be kept right.  Most of the poorer soils are very acid and cannot be used for production purposes unless the imbalance is corrected.</P>
    <P>After the ill-treatment in the area of the cattle herd in the past three years, its rebuilding will be complicated out of all recognition by the battle that went on for two years between the Department and the veterinary profession.  We now have a situation in relation to TB and brucellosis in animals very much akin to that which existed before we embarked two decades or more ago on the TB eradication scheme.  Any Deputy here who has any knowledge of brucellosis will know that the country is rampant with the disease. Yesterday two farmers from County Meath came to see me here.  Both of these men are in liquid milk production but their herds are suffering a brucellosis storm at present.  I understand that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries told one of these men personally that he has nothing to offer him but £85 per head on the <Col N="1006" /> sale of the reactor animals.  The man I am talking of has 90 cows on 105 acres and unless he can be given greater assistance than that which has been offered he and his family will be forced to leave agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not tell the whole story?  This man brought in 20 cows from the North, all of which went down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not dispute that with the Minister, but he and I know that a brucellosis storm is something which may strike at random. When that happens the milk as well as the calves are lost.  The cows, too, are lost because they become infected useless animals that have to be disposed of at scrap prices.  The two farmers I am speaking of are merely isolated cases.  No disease eradication scheme will be worth anything unless the compensation offered is realistic.</P>
      <P>I concede that the Government have a serious problem in this area. The farming community must not wash their hands of their responsibility in the matter because they, too, have a responsibility to their neighbours.  The £85 scheme will not work.  Let us not waste any more time because the disease is running through the herds of the country.  The Minister has a very good case to take to the EEC in this regard.  They have offered £38 for cows and half that amount for steers; but, as the Minister knows, that is no good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Lomé Convention the EEC at the same time are permitting the importation of cattle from such countries as Botswana, Swaziland, Zanzibar, and Madagascar.  I should like to know what is the disease status in these countries.  While that meat is admitted into the EEC without any great problem Irish TB reactor meat will not be admitted under present regulations.  I suggest that it must be possible to devise a scheme involving the private storage of reactor meat for which rather substantial EEC grants are available.  In good faith I suggest to the Minister that we must strain every finger in using every tactic available to us to <Col N="1007" /> get a reasonable compensation price. Unless the compensation is worthwhile we will not get the reactors from the farmers.  Some herdowners, although they identify reactors, are not prepared to sell.  They are harbouring disease.  They become a menace.  I urge the Minister to look at this.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion&mdash;but it is something I have not researched&mdash;that taking the headage payment offered already by the EEC as well as propositioning the Community regarding a deal involving private storage grants and assistance in sale to third countries, should that be necessary, we could do better.  If the Minister looks for this we shall support him in every way.</P>
    <P>In his continuing series of victories, the Minister referred briefly to the victory of his colleague on the fishing front.  As usual that achievement was heralded as a great breakthrough.  Incidentally, I might mention here the Minister's press release which contained the longest single sentence I have ever seen.  It comprised half a foolscap page and had only one full stop.  It was rather unintelligible.  However, on reading the fine print we discovered that we would have the blessing of the Community if, during the next four years, we doubled our fishing fleet and catches.  I trust that either the Minister for Foreign Affairs or some other Minister can tell us how that is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>While we are attempting to double our fish catch in our own waters in the next four years we can be quite certain that there is nothing at all to stop the trawlers of the other member states of the Community from fishing within our limits because there is no inclination on the part of the Community to concede what we must get and what the fishing industry has been looking for all the time, namely, a 50-mile exclusive limit.  The public and the fishermen were confused recently by the proposal of British Members of Parliament that a 50-mile conservation zone be established, embodying quotas for pelagic fishing.  This also got the hero's <Col N="1008" /> treatment to which we are becoming accustomed.  It was, of course, a fraud; and I am very much afraid the Minister for Foreign Affairs' most recent outing, which he is trying to sell as a famous victory, was at best a conceding of ground and the abandonment of vital territory without which it will be impossible to fight effectively.</P>
    <P>Earlier I was talking about this business of taxing farm incomes and the difficulty into which the Minister for Finance had got himself, having first of all to deny that he had said farmers should be taxed and then having had to deny the denial.  This all evolves around what seems to be the manifest intention of the Government to impose extra taxation on farmers and to pin that on something or other.  The Minister is pinning it on to the £50 million bonanza won by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, something which never happened.  As far as exports to the Continent are concerned, the position is now a great deal worse than it was before devaluation and it is that worse position the Minister for Finance proposes to tax. The reality, according to the IFA, is that instead of the Central Bank's assertion that farm incomes were up by 50 per cent on 1974, if one takes 1973 as the base year there is a real drop of 8 per cent.  It is true the price of livestock is very good at the moment and I hope it will hold.  I am afraid it will not because there is every danger of oversupply on the British markets, which is the only market now.  There are also heavy exports from Denmark.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister in his resolve to deal with the growing problem of high fructose corn syrup.  It is absolutely vital to preserve this.</P>
    <P>Government speakers spoke of the free availability of credit to farmers for development purposes.  I know one farmer in Kilkenny with 1,000 tons of silage and a large quantity of feeding barley.  He has a very modern silage lay-out.  He cannot get money anywhere to buy cattle.  The ACC have turned him down.  It is not that easy to get money for development. <Col N="1009" /> I want to end by telling the Government that their assertions that all systems are going, that things are not too bad, that we are around the bend, coming over the hill, all that jazz, is just not true.  There are at least 100,000 school leavers looking for jobs and there are no jobs for them.  The best thing the Government can do for the country at the moment is to go and go as quickly as they can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to talk first about the mood that seems to be in the country because it is very easy, for good or ill, for prophecies to become self-fulfilling.  It is also true that commentators and the public at large can lag behind reality.  They do not keep up with it.  They follow after the event without changing as quickly as events change.  It is easy for one side in the House to say everything is quite dreadful and for the other side to say that everything is getting better.  It seems to me that the correct thing to do is to say exactly what the reality is and I want now to take a little time to try to indicate statistically what the reality is and then go on to talk about the future.</P>
      <P>It was, I think, Keynes who pointed out that there is an irrational element in any sort of economic life which depends on what people think will happen and, if our people think that our economy is in chaos, they will hold off their investment decision and thereby contribute to its difficulties.  If people think their real standards of living are declining rapidly they will be less inclined to come to rational solutions necessary for future growth.  You do not make problems go away with words, but you can create problems with words.  To some extent that is happening here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not go through the contributions of the various Opposition speakers but I want to quote just one sentence from the leader in today's <i>Irish Press</i> because this sentence seems to me to sum up all the wrong emphasis and all the wrong understanding of what the position is: &ldquo;For manufacturing industry the lesson of the past four years is that it has declined, <Col N="1010" /> is declining and has no future&rdquo;.  That is a value judgment.  I can equally say a great many positive things but what I want to do is simply to quote some facts because what one is referring to is important.</P>
    <P>The world has seen an enormous recession, the worst since the 1930s. It is true that, if you take the year 1975 and compare it with 1974, there was a decline in the volume index for manufacturing industry of 6.5 per cent.  That is comparing now the whole of 1975 with the whole of 1974.  If you compare the second half of 1974 plus the first half of 1975 with the second half of 1975 plus the first half of 1976, in other words, not calendar year on calendar year but still one year intervals and coming up to the second half of 1976&mdash;we do not have detailed statistics after that&mdash;then the volume of output has grown by 3 per cent.  It has not declined by 6.5 per cent.  The quarterly volume index, which has the base year of 1953, in the second quarter of 1976, stands at the highest level that it has ever been, 308 unadjusted and 297.3 seasonally adjusted.  If you take the volume figures for the second quarter of 1976, the most recent quarter we possess, and compare this with the same period in 1975, then the increase in the volume of manufacturing industry is 13 per cent.</P>
    <P>I will not make much comment about those figures because I wish people knew them.  If you take the most recent quarter for which we possess figures for manufacturing industry, the quarter, which ended in mid-summer, and compare that with a year ago and you find that the increase is 13 per cent&mdash;we have to assume that the statistics which come from the CSO are reasonably neutral and nobody tweaks them or badgers them politically and they say this is what the researchers reveal it to be&mdash;how can you reconcile that with saying for manufacturing industry the lesson in the past four years is that it has declined and is declining?  <i>The Irish Press</i> leader says that manufacturing industry is declining.  How can those things be reconciled?  I do not think they can.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> This is an example of the sort of move which goes in the adverse direction, far beyond the reality.  It is fair, not because I feel defensive about the Government in relation to industry or about my role or my Department's role in relation to industry&mdash;I do not&mdash; but because working as close with industry as I have done for three-and-a-quarter years now I identify with industry as a whole, to say that those sorts of accusations make me cross for industry.</P>
    <P>I want to try to put the thing into context not just for the most recent quarter of 1976 against 12 months ago but into the European context and the OECD context.  I will list 18 countries in a ranking order.  The source for this is the OECD main economic indicator. The percentage change in industrial production from the second quarter of 1975 to the second quarter of 1976, the most recent figure we can have for all of these countries, Ireland included, shows that of the ranking of 18 countries that one can make, using the OECD's statistics, Japan is first, Italy second, Belgium third, Luxembourg is fourth and Ireland is joint fifth of that 18.  Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Switzerland, Sweden and God knows where else are all behind us.  That is listing up to the most recent quarter.  The percentage change in industrial production, taking it over two years from the second quarter in 1974 to as late as we can go, the end of the second quarter of 1976, twice the period I have just given, shows that the ranking order is that Ireland is not in joint fifth place but is in third place of the 18, exceeded only by Greece and Italy.</P>
    <P>When one takes the percentage change over a longer period, one which is relevant to the responsibility of this Government, we find that with the percentage change in industrial production from 1973 to the most recent figures we have, the end of the second quarter of 1976, then the ranking is Greece, first, Spain, second, Italy, third, Ireland, fourth, Belgium, fifth, Austria, sixth, Sweden, seventh, Netherlands, Norway and Canada, joint eighth, France eleventh, Germany <Col N="1012" /> twelfth, Japan thirteenth and so on.  I will not go through all of the 18.</P>
    <P>This is all a bit statistical.  I am not emoting and I am not offering opinions or judgments.  I am quoting figures.  If, taking it over one year, two years and then taking it from 1973 to the end of the most recent quarter, and if over those three periods we rank joint fifth, third and fourth out of 18 of the OECD countries, how can that be said to be a circumstance in which our manufacturing industry has no future?  Is that fair comment?  It is not.  It is comment that does harm because it tends to bring about the circumstance that does not currently exist but that it describes.  That sort of pessimism is very bad for people's investment decisions.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about facts in regard to employment and unemployment because the most horrible guesses are bandied about on that subject and we have good statistics in the country. No two statistics of different countries are comparable.  We have suffered very severely from the recession and we have unemployment at an unacceptably high level.  The figures reveal the stabilisation which has occurred since mid-1975.  We are now in November, 1976 and we ought to be noticing changes that have existed for 12 months or so.  The fact is that employment in manufacturing industry has increased by 2,000 people seasonally adjusted, and by almost 3,000 unadjusted between March and June, 1976, the most recent quarter for which we have detailed figures.  Some of those increases occurred in areas which we are told are disaster areas, like an increase of 500 in textiles. One sees the stabilisation of the employment situation and one sees much later than the increase in production but worryingly small, in the manufacturing section, evidence of a small growth in employment.</P>
    <P>I am not commenting here.  I am begging people to listen to those figures, not to make things either better or worse than they are because neither euphoria nor needless gloom <Col N="1013" /> are helpful to us.  It is helpful to us to tell it like it is.  There are figures that are still very depressing and there are some figures that are very good.</P>
    <P>I should now like to come to the area of exports.  I want to give the figures first and, although I have not been commenting very much, I want to comment then.  I am especially concerned, through my Department, with the export of manufactured goods.  These, in the table of our exports, are sections five to eight.  There is a tot of those sections offered separately in the table of exports which is published every month. If you compare January to the end of September for this year with the same period last year, you find that the value of exports is up 38 per cent. That is not standing still.  When there are different rates of inflation in different market places in which we sell, it is hard to relate that increase in value to the increase in volume, but it is a fair and reasonable and neutral estimate to say that the increase in volume of manufactured goods exports for the first nine months of this year as compared with the first nine months of last year, making allowance for inflation, is between 15 and 20 per cent and is nearer to 20 per cent than to 15 per cent. That is a figure I am very proud of, not for me as the responsible Minister or for this Government.  I am proud of it for Irish manufacturing industry and for Irish exporters and indeed for the promotional agencies, for Córas Tráchtála.  It is a very fine figure in difficult times and an especially fine figure for the reason that half our exports go to the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom's market is currently sluggish.  So the vast majority of those gains have had to be made in other market places. Taking the figure for January through September this year for exports to the United States it is up by 65 per cent on 12 months ago and that is a tremendous figure.  Exports to Japan are up by 178 per cent, exports to Belgium 42 per cent <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>Certainly we see difficulties and points of weakness but so do we see some real progress, particularly in the <Col N="1014" /> most recent months.  It is necessary that we see those economic indices which have now been accumulating for 12 months as they are; not better than they are, that there are no difficulties, but not worse than they are, to say there is no sign of improvement. I wish that economic news in Ireland was as interesting to people as political news.  We have good political reporting.  We have good what I would call business reporting, analysis of firms and news about companies and that sort of thing.  We have good economic statistics, but the general presentation of broad economic statistics to the public so that we understand at any given time where we are so that we spot changes in direction is not really well enough done in Ireland.  I do not apportion blame for that.  If the public wanted it more and were interested in these indices, the media would cater to that want.  I do wish that the level of knowledge in that area was higher than it is.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the facts of inflation.  The reality and the expectation of inflation have an immense effect on investment decisions, on wage settlements and on a whole lot of things.  One can work out a figure for a month which many countries do and they publish an inflationary figure for every month and these figures hop up and down a good deal.  We publish figures quarterly and we have annual figures.  The annual figures relate to a period, say, between 15 months ago and three months ago because there is an inevitable lag between collecting and publication of the figures and annual figures are always a little bit out of date.  We had frightful inflation of more than 20 per cent and it is right to affirm that and to declare how desperately serious for our economy that situation was.  We also have the figure of the most recent quarter, that is up to mid-August, which was 1½ per cent for the quarter. I do not pretend that it would be a fair argument to multiply that quarter by four and say that we are inflating at the rate of 6 per cent a year.  It is not fair to do that to reduce it any more than it is fair to play tricks out of the past to increase it.  It is fair to <Col N="1015" /> try to make a reasonable guess as to where it is.</P>
    <P>We have seen the use of the figure 18 per cent in a lot of this debate and in the media recently to express a rate of inflation which, I say with an enormous sense of relief, no longer exists.  That is an out-of-date figure and is higher than the current figure. If you take it month by month or even quarter by quarter, you get an odd figure.  I wish it was 6 per cent.  It is not.  It is higher than that, but the point that is important to make, for the sake of investment decisions, of expectation of workers in regard to wages and social welfare recipients in regard to the real purchasing power of what they receive from the State is that there has been a very considerable slowing in the rate of inflation. It is fair to say that too.</P>
    <P>Since it is my Departmental responsibility, I want to talk about the work of the IDA.  The basic industrial thrust of this country is built around the IDA.  There is national consensus on it among all parties.  The basic ideas were generated by my Labour predecessor in the Department of Industry and Commerce, the late Deputy William Norton, during the second Coalition, but they were not brought to fruition in his time.  They were carried on and expanded and strengthened under Fianna Fáil, and three and three-quarter years ago when we had Coalition Government again we did not challenge those policies or end them or undermine them.  We expanded them more.  There is national consensus about the thrust of our industrial investment policies which have been going on for some years under two Coalitions and 16 years of Fianna Fáil Government.  It is a very strong, involved, sophisticated and skilful programme, one of the best programmes of industrial promotion in the world.  It is widely admired and, indeed, copied and that is not a matter of a political football between two sides.  I will talk later on about other things we have done in regard to our commitment to it and expressed by the way we have funded it during difficult times.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> The most recent events industrially in Ireland and overseas indicate that we believe that the 17,000 job approvals target which had been the IDA's target for 1976 will be reached and may be exceeded.  We said some months ago that we did not think in the economic circumstances as they were then developing that it would be possible to reach that target.  Now it has become clear as the inquiries, decisions and commitments come in that we can look a little higher than we were able to look four or five months ago, that we believe that we will reach the target set a considerable time ago and we hope to be able to exceed it.</P>
    <P>I refer also to the number of serious inquiries from overseas in the pipeline, and the percentage of those being processed through to completion, to fruition, as a mature project. That is a very sensitive index to the relative position of a country in comparison with other centres of investment and of any international decision-making process in regard to industrial investment anywhere.  That pipeline has filled up again in the recent past after difficult times in 1974 and 1975 and, indeed, early this year. In two areas of relatively new initiative we have been able to over-fulfil targets and will over-fulfil targets this year.  One of those is the service industries programme of the IDA which was initiated during my period in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The basic argument is that a service job in something like banking or insurance is as well-paying and satisfactory and produces as socially useful and good an end product as manufacturing industry.  What we have done is to end the restriction of our promotional efforts to manufacturing and extend it into services.  In general, services is a fast-growing area, faster than manufacturing industry if you take it world-wide.  Because of our location, our communications and our language we are very well advantaged to be a major service area and I am glad to state that for this year the targets set by the IDA and the service industries programme will be substantially exceeded.</P>
    <P>There is another interesting area <Col N="1017" /> which has been of particular concern to me during the years, namely, the small industries programme.  If we are able to attract the inflow of foreign funds with big companies there is always the danger that we may forget about and neglect our indigenous base and the small <i>entrepreneur</i> who can get off the ground now with a project and who, given luck, courage, brains and vigour, will be the large industrialist a couple of decades hence.  The current year job approval of the small industries programme will significantly surpass the targets set. We will have a record level of job approvals in the programme at the end of this year, even though it has been a difficult year with the continuous drag on us of the level of the British economy.</P>
    <P>What is happening in the small industries area is especially welcome because I have felt there was a weakness in that area.  The improvement in the proposals in this area is mainly in response to the growing opportunities that exist in the Irish economy for linkages between small firms and major new industries.  In other words, we are getting a kind of downstream effect from the coming in and establishment of the big industries.  Small industries are being established or expanded; for example, they may provide either specialist components or specialist services for the major export-oriented firms.  This year that sector of the IDA's work will significantly surpass the target and we think it will get to a record level.  Of course we are not out of the wood; but is what I have pointed out not good news?  It is not a matter of a Government; it is a matter of an agency and of a reflection of a whole economy.  In that sector of our economy there is courage, initiative and an expanding level of activity.</P>
    <P>It is fair to put into context the scale of the effort by this Government in the industrial sector during a very difficult period.  I am now going to give the funds for industry in the public capital programme.  In the year 1971-72 it was £36.3 million; in 1973-74 it was £34.23 million; this year it is £119,500,000.  Of course there has <Col N="1018" /> been inflation but nevertheless we must note that in 1973-74 it was just over £34 million while for the calendar year 1976 it was over £119 million.  That is a very dramatic increase. In the last year in office of the previous Government the IDA got £24.7 million; this year they are getting £53.5 million.  SFADCo got £2.79 million in 1972-73 and now they are getting £5.52 million.  The case of the ICC is interesting because, while Governments can create an environment, in the end it is the <i>entrepreneur</i> who creates the jobs.  The ICC had a budget of £4.61 million in 1972-73 but it is up to £29.3 million this year.  In the area of loans, of the budgets of the IDA, SFADCo and in various other areas there is a very dramatic increase in the sums of money being spent not alone in actual terms but in value terms when adjusted for inflation.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not made exaggerated claims for the ending of problems.  I have tried to give a fairly large amount of information, which is on the record of the House, to indicate that the statement for manufacturing industry&mdash;that the lesson for the past four years is that it has declined, is declining and has no future&mdash;is exaggeratedly gloomy, is unfair and does some harm.  As I have said before, the essential thing is to tell it like it is.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with some of the topics in the Green Paper which relate to my own area of responsibility, to talk about what I see as the strength and pitfalls for the future and what I see as the essential conditions we have to fulfil if we are to take advantage of what seems to me the basically sound fundamentals of our economy.</P>
    <P>First, we are beginning to have a real contribution to our economy from the natural resources area.  We have made the commitment in the Green Paper.  I wish to quote from paragraph 2, page 37 of the Green Paper:</P>
    <P>Mianraí Teoranta will be revived to undertake directly on behalf of the State exploration and development of mineral resources in parallel <Col N="1019" /> and in co-operation with the private sector.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things to be said about that.  It was a pity it was not continuously sustained and developed and built into a powerful organ, but we are in the course of doing that and it seems to me the correct thing to do.  I wish to draw attention to the part of the sentence which says &ldquo;in parallel and in co-operation with the private sector&rdquo; because traditionally in the polemic of various political points of view we are presented with a situation which I can only call &ldquo;confrontational&rdquo;, that either one says one can have a State sector&mdash;for example in regard to minerals&mdash;where the State must do it or that the State must stay out and the private sector must do it.</P>
    <P>One must look at the realities of success in parts of the world where there is success and where there is the maximum benefit to the population. What is necessary is to avoid the confrontation and to structure the co-operation of both sectors.  It seems to me in regard to Tara, Bula, Mianrí Teoranta and in regard to our smelter proposals when they emerge&mdash;and I can tell the House that we are thorough, meticulous and careful in the preparation, as we have been in the case of oil and gas; we have gone through extensive feasibility studies, we have had submissions and we are fairly close, within a matter of months I think, to a public position in regard to the smelter&mdash;the task is to use the expertise, both technically and financially, of the great companies and in marketing.  Also, because there is a State sector that can co-operate with an indigenous private sector, it is essential to see that you do not get ripped off by the great international companies who possess such great power and expertise.</P>
    <P>It seems to me possible to balance the interests to mutual advantage.  In the area of the minerals on land they are now providing worthwhile employment and will have a worthwhile effect on our exports and on our balance of payments in the near future.  Soon after that they will provide downstream industries when we process the metal <Col N="1020" /> into things made from the metal.  This will have a beneficial effect on the entire industry and on our financial position. That is something that is moving along quite steadily.  The statistics are there and it is a welcome addition to our economy.  It is something that has a good future.</P>
    <P>With regard to oil and gas, the situation is that this year has been disappointing but it is also true that the existing gas field is being developed rapidly.  We have advanced the date on which we want the participants to bring it ashore, and they seem to be able to do that: to meet an advanced date.  By the first half of 1978 we will actually be seeing the product, be it electricity or fertiliser.  Already that is having a beneficial effect on investment and employment, and it will subsequently benefit our balance of payments and our exports position and ease our imports position, which is just as important in the final tot.</P>
    <P>These sectors are moving along, and as I believe there has been unfair criticism in regard to the licensing conditions for oil and gas offshore, I want to say two things: perhaps I should say first that a Minister as an individual is identified with the small print of these matters.  Of course he sets the atmosphere and determines the guidelines, but no one individual is able to carry out that work by himself.  Some of the abuse that in the past was hurled at me for tardiness was, in fact, by-passing me and impinging on people who were working far beyond the call of duty and who are now recognised internationally&mdash;and I have heard it in different parts of the world&mdash;to have done an extremely good job in an almost unbelievably short space of time.  I emphasise it was not I&mdash;I am not praising myself&mdash;but staff in my Department, and that the final result was the absolute maximum that could have been obtained for this country, that it is a final result which nonetheless got us a very significant drilling programme this year, which was carried out, and we still have a very significant drilling programme next year.</P>
    <P>This year we did not get an oil field or a gas field, but we do have the undiminished <Col N="1021" /> interest and the determination to continue with this programme by the companies.  You never have oil or gas until somebody pokes a bit into the reservoir and it is actually there. That has not happened to us this year. All we have is the one gas field.  However, it is as wrong to think that it will suddenly solve all our problems as it is wrong to be unduly pessimistic.  The balanced opinion of the experts&mdash;the geologists and those who assess the results of the drilling, look at the cores, the logs and the wells&mdash;is that their expectation as a result of this year's drilling is not diminished in regard to the potential of our Continental Shelf. I have in the past spoken out against undue euphoria and the belief that it would solve all our problems; I think it fair now to speak out against undue pessimism.</P>
    <P>I want now in the time that remains to me to say I believe that, because of high world food prices and because of the EEC circumstances, our farmers are now at last beginning to make some money and they are re-investing that in Irish agriculture.  The mid-term prospects for agriculture are that it will make a very significant contribution to our national wellbeing and to our economy.  My reading of the experience of the recession over the last three years, since the October war, since the oil embargo and since the shortage of imported raw materials, is that Irish industry&mdash;while I understand the gloom, the pessimism and the restless mood that now exists&mdash;can be proud of itself for having, in a little, open economy, come through a desperately difficult time with so little real damage, in fact, in some areas having grown stronger and become consolidated.</P>
    <P>Very interestingly the figures show in the last 12 months and longer that there has been a considerable reequipment of plant, so that the quality, the up-to-dateness and the productivity of plant in much of Irish industry are better than ever.  Let us talk about the things that threaten our economy.  As regards agriculture, we are in a community situation where the basic decisions are made outside this country, but the fundamentals for agriculture are good and are likely to remain good <Col N="1022" /> for some time.  I believe that if we do certain things that I will try to enumerate, the fundamentals for industry are good too.  They are also good in regard to natural resources, but we are suffering desperately from the point of view of tourism and quite immeasurably from the point of view of investment through the violence in our society.  Romantic people say: &ldquo;It is a pity that people get shot, it is a pity that bombs are let off, but that is not really doing us frightful damage. We are compensating for the damage and we are overcoming it.&rdquo;  However, as one who travels a great deal promoting industrial investment, I know the extent of the pre-occupation in the minds of potential investors as to whether the violence will spill over, and I would commend to the House, if people have not seen it, an interesting, frank and very good report on the <i>Economic and Industrial Strategy for Northern Ireland</i> which issued very recently, the so-called Quigley Report. That shows the immense damage that violence has done to that economy. The sluggishness of the Northern economy spills over on to us.  Were it dynamic it would be a help to us.  The evidence of the de-industrialisation there is a hindrance to us.  Therefore the violence is something that jeopardises our future economically as well as politically.  It has diverted immense amounts of money in lost tourism, lost investment and increased security expenditure that we could well have used in other ways.</P>
    <P>The other threats seem to me to be three: that we do not master inflation, that we allow our cost structures industrially and throughout all our economy to explode, and that we do not maintain an environment where people make positive investment decisions. I believe the basic strategy of deficits and of overseas borrowings to bring us through the desperate hardship and the worst of the recession was correct, but I do affirm that it is not possible to go on borrowing on that scale&mdash;It is not possible or economically correct to build up overseas debts. It is not possible or economically correct to divert larger and larger amounts of GNP into current social consumption.  If you do that you are <Col N="1023" /> eating the seed potatoes, because you are consuming your future expectations for the sake of present satisfaction.  We must try to control certain elements of inflation.  Let us again try to tell the truth about inflation, because some parts of it, like the tremendously high interest rates in London or the down-float of the £ that increases the price of every raw material we take from the non-sterling area, are not our fault and we cannot do anything about them.  The components of wages and public expenditure we can do something about.  Those are the areas inside our competence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I believe that the Green Paper is an area where the Government can and must give leadership. But the doing of those things requires the concurrence of the whole population. If the people will not agree to forego some current consumption, then those policies, set out in outline in the Green Paper but not in detail, cannot be set out in detail until there is a consensus, because you do not have the wherewithal to do it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My sympathy went out to the Minister as one from whom so much was expected and who promised so much three-and-three-quarter years ago.  One sympathised with him for the weakness of the case he was trying to present tonight.  One <Col N="1025" /> must give him credit for making the best of what he, more than anybody else, knows to be a hopeless case.  Like the Minister for Labour last evening, he also was trying to tell us that, bad as things are, they could be worse.</P>
      <P>It is inevitable in a debate on the economy at the present time that we should come to the employment situation. I was shocked and amazed last evening when the Minister for Labour in opening the debate spent so little time giving hope to the unemployed who would dearly love to get a message from him, to the many thousands of school-leavers who are disappointed and frustrated in seeking employment. No message from any Government speaker in this debate has given them the hope they deserve from the Government. At all times, blame has been laid on the recession abroad.  The Ministers opposite stand indicted for neglecting from the very beginning the employment situation and the job creation and retention that was so necessary if we had this dreadful recession that has been offered as an excuse for so long.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour glossed over the unemployment situation.  He referred in glowing terms of percentages to the improvement in manufacturing industry.  He took quarters <i>ad lib</i>.  He took a quarter at the end of 1975 and a quarter at the beginning of 1976 and spoke of the great improvement there had been.  I, too, am very pleased when I see any improvement but the Government must maximise any improvement they can claim and must not cod people or induce false euphoria.  This is what the Minister for Labour was doing or trying to do.  I heard him being scoffed at by people in the streets this morning because they could see no evidence of what he was saying.</P>
      <P>Yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i> carried a report from the Confederation of Irish Industry which referred to an improvement in manufacturing industry but added a note of caution concerning the greatest evil and problem in our society, unemployment.  The paragraph to which I refer said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Confederation <Col N="1026" /> points out that although output is back to pre-recession levels, employment is not, due to the fact that the recovery in output is partly attributable to new capital-intensive firms which came into production in the last two years.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour could be accused of misleading the House when he gave those figures and told us in typical Coalition style that the good times were just around the corner, something we have been hearing since February, 1973.</P>
    <P>I submit that there is in the Government, as there has been from the beginning, an attitude towards enterprise and effort that has only the result of stifling them.  The Minister who has just spoken has shown a complete about-turn from the time when he was in Opposition.  I am not sorry that he is at last showing a certain sense of responsibility.  I was interested to hear him refer tonight to the entrepreneur.  A few years ago that was an evil word with the Minister's party.  The person who had the courage to tackle life himself, set up a business and, as a result, create employment was scoffed at and frowned on by the Minister and his party and every effort was made to curb his activity and criticise it.  Some members of the party refer to the entrepreneur as the &ldquo;fast buck merchant&rdquo;.  I have no time for the &ldquo;fast buck merchant&rdquo; but the vast majority of these people contributed their share to the economic growth of the 'sixties so successfully led by the Fianna Fáil Government when a climate was created for that growth.  Compare it with the flourish of trumpets that saw this Government come in with budgets designed to stifle opportunity and to prevent the expansion we need for job creation.  The Minister for Labour mentioned that many of our school-leavers in the late 'sixties went on to further education, a pattern that had not been there until the education scheme introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government came into operation.  That is a consideration that should have been taken into account long before now.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the employment figures.  The 108,000 that are unemployed <Col N="1027" /> according to the live register is a figure that bears little relation to the true unemployment figure at present.  There is no point in Ministers opposite saying that the statistics are the same now as when Fianna Fáil were in office.  Many thousands of people were not included in these statistics, people who were not around seeking employment when Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    <P>I am not denying that the statistics are the same now as they were then but the statistics as they are structured do not fully represent the true figure of unemployment at present. Two weeks ago we heard a report of an EEC survey which showed a figure of 180,000 in regard to unemployment, a report which was emphatically denied by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach. Before the report was mentioned in the Irish papers I had seen it in an English paper.  That figure is nearer the truth.  After the schools closed this year I said that the real figure was 180,000 to 182,000.  The figures for school leavers this year are 15,000 at first level who did not go further; 48,500 at second level, and 8,000 at third level.  That totals 58,000 school leavers.</P>
    <P>Last year's figures show that 30 per cent returned to the same level of education because of lack of employment opportunities.  If we take it as a third, we can expect that 40,000 are still looking for jobs in addition to the many thousands who left school in 1975 and in the previous year.  That point has been completely overlooked by the Ministers who have contributed to this debate.  It is the greatest evil facing our society.  Not alone is there a lack of employment opportunities but there is the suffering mind of the young person who has worked hard at school, probably at considerable expense to his parents despite free education.  There are Ministers who seem to ignore this problem and the social evil it creates.  Some members of our Government have publicly committed themselves to Marxist and <Col N="1028" /> socialist policies and have said that this country is not yet ripe for their policies.  Maybe there is some satisfaction in the fact that there are so many frustrated young people in whose minds it would be so easy to sow the seeds of discontent.</P>
    <P>If any Minister in this Government deserves to be charged with neglect it must surely be the Minister for Labour.  I will give an instance of the Minister's negligence in answering a question concerning the National Manpower Service, a service which was set up by the man we are proud to have as our presidential candidate, Dr. Hillery.  Question No. 35 on today's Order Paper reads:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Labour the number of persons at present seeking employment under the National Manpower Service in the following areas: Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and the rest of the country; and the number of persons who were seeking employment on the same date last year.&mdash;Gene Fitzgerald.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>The reply to the Deputy's question is in the form of a tabular statement and I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to have this circulated with the Official Report.</P>
    <P>In a supplementary question I asked the Minister to give me the total figures.  All I got was this tabular statement which I can place on the record of the House if necessary.  The table shows the number of persons registered on 3rd October, 1975.  There was no reference in it to the first part of the question.  I beg your pardon. There is a reference in it to the number of persons registered for employment with the National Manpower Service on 1st October, 1976, and 3rd October, 1975.  There is no reference in it to 1st October, 1976.  The cities and towns and the figure for October, 1975, are quoted.  If that is not misleading a Deputy of this House I do not know what it is.  It shows absolute neglect and a careless approach by a Minister to a question in connection with a service that is inundated with <Col N="1029" /> requests for employment at present. The staff of this service are working at their maximum capacity to try to facilitate the large number of job seekers.  In regard to employment, I could go further with today's questions and instance another reply.  Deputies are entitled to better treatment than that.  It seems that some Ministers have lost their drive and enthusiasm and have adopted a negligent attitude towards their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The second question I wish to instance asked the Minister for Labour the number of schemes at present in progress under the youth community projects and the number of persons employed in each.  The Minister answered that there were 37 projects in progress at present and that the number engaged in individual projects can vary from four to 13&mdash;again, a deliberate attempt to withhold information from a Deputy.  Under pressure, the Minister gave the total number as 332 although his own forecast many months ago for this scheme was 1,000.  This is another area where there has been absolute neglect of creating job opportunities for young people.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there are difficulties and that many areas had to be sorted out.  The trade unions, naturally and rightly so, had a very important role to play because of the large number of unemployed skilled people they had.  But why, oh why, has it taken so long to provide only 332 jobs?  I asked the number of people made redundant by local authorities and health boards.  Fifty-three was the figure given, not a large one, I admit, but 53 by public bodies at a time when we so badly need employment.  Not only that but there is so much work to be done by every public body in every single sphere of their activities.  There have been cutbacks in our health services. How can we have redundancies there too?  We were told two health boards had made people redundant.  There has been neglect in that respect&mdash;those are instances of it&mdash;and a lack of interest among some Ministers in regard to their specific responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour referred to the redundancy situation.  Last evening he mentioned that the figure this year <Col N="1030" /> would amount to only 70 per cent of the previous year's.  What did he think he was proving there?  Nineteen-thousand people were made redundant in 1975 and because approximately 70 per cent only of that figure would be made redundant this year he felt he was achieving something.</P>
    <P>This is an economic debate.  I know we will be criticised for being too critical of the men who should be responsible for the state of our economy, for not making positive statements, explaining what we would do and how we would do it.  But the reality is that we did introduce an economic document designed specifically to help our country back on its feet, to get the wheels of industry moving and our people back to work. The Government issued their Green Paper.  Although the power of the civil service was behind the Government, because agreement could not be reached around the Cabinet table, the mid-summer promise became an end-of-September one and then only rushed to overtake the document Fianna Fáil had issued.  There is no need for me to refer to the Government's Green Paper.  The Minister's colleague, Deputy Barry Desmond, a responsible member of the Labour Party and assistant Whip of the Government parties, regarded it as a worthless effort achieving nothing, saying nothing, and going nowhere.  It is not necessary for me to elaborate on that.  Suffice it to say that if Deputy Barry Desmond, such a strong supporter of the Coalition, can be so absolute in his condemnation of the Green Paper&mdash;about which we heard again this evening from the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;then there is somebody codding somebody.</P>
    <P>It was explained again to us this evening what benefits there were for us in that Green Paper.  I believe that the policies of the Government contributed largely to our present difficulties. There is the danger that the incentive to work is lost because of excessive taxation.  I remember making this point on the very first budget of this Government.  There is no incentive to a person today to work overtime, of benefit to himself and to the firm in which he works.  Personal <Col N="1031" /> taxation on the working person is excessive. Our Leader has gone to great lengths so often to point out that, at a time of recession and job losses such as we have at present, instead of adding the cost of employment to the company by way of an increased social welfare stamp at least portion of that increase could have been subsidised. The overhead cost of employment is high and certainly helps to reduce job creation or the possibilities of expansion.</P>
    <P>Profit was looked on as a dirty word by the people across the way; one should not have profit.  In places like Russia and some other communist or socialist countries they have another word for it and it is &ldquo;surplus&rdquo;.  I submit that, for the vast majority of people profits in this country basically were surpluses ploughed back into those companies to modernise machinery, buy additional machinery, improve the factory building and, above all, create more jobs.  I would have no objection to excessive taxation on profits if they were being used for reasons other than expansion and job creation.  But the attitude of the people on those benches over there was that profit was a dirty word, we must at all cost stop that company from making profit.  God knows it took them a long time to realise the mistake they were making, which was illustrated by the turnabout this evening by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  They realise it now. Let us hope it is not too late.  I believe that in regard to our economic level at present we need a good doctor.  We do not yet need an undertaker but unless the people there prove to be better doctors than I think they are the sooner they leave and hand over the reins of government to a party that has the courage, leadership, ability, concern and who are closely connected with the ordinary people the better.</P>
    <P>There is another item to which I want to refer in regard to job losses. We have seen a huge number of receiverships, liquidations, companies getting into difficulties and jobs being lost as a result.  I believe the day is <Col N="1032" /> long past when, as a nation, we could afford to see such companies wind up.  I know the number given in reply to a parliamentary question not too long ago was frightening.  There are other companies still in danger. I believe that the simple process that has operated up to now of a receiver being appointed merely to sell off the assets at whatever price he can make to satisfy his clients is gone.  That is not sufficient any more with regard to such companies.  The emphasis must shift from the repayment of the debt to increasingly seeking the revival of that company, or part of it.  The social conscience&mdash;and we hear an awful lot about social conscience from those benches over there&mdash;with regard to workers and the economy at large demands this shift of emphasis.  Many jobs could have been saved in the past, many jobs in so many different industries.</P>
    <P>In his usual meticulous way today Deputy Faulkner pointed out the way in which the building industry has suffered, the number of people unemployed in that industry, despite the empty claims from those benches. Deputy Faulkner, who ably handled the local government field, pointed out that the employment potential was enormous, if used, or if they could be advised how to direct the money properly with beneficial results for our people instead of making people redundant.  There is only one problem here and that is that every move of the Government's has been politically motivated.  Decisions were never taken on the basis of what was best for the country or our people but on how the Government could gain or regain or hold a few more votes. That is disgraceful but that is what is happening.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating a motorway plan because it is too soon for one, but we all saw the gymnastics performed by the Minister for Local Government a few years ago on the brilliant idea of his of providing motorways and then the complete somersault a week or two ago by the same Minister for the sake of cheap vote catching in parts of Dublin city.  I agree it is too soon for motorways <Col N="1033" /> but it is not too soon for a decent road network.  What has the Minister for Local Government done about this need?  Last year he cut back on the allocation of road fund grant to every county and I believe he will do that this year again.  The fall in applications of more than 50 per cent for SDA loans proves how negative Government policies are.  The Ministers who are members of the Labour Party are happy to see our young people unemployed; they are happy to see the seeds of discontent being sown so that they can, in their own devious way and in their own time, advance the marxist policies they never abandoned, as they stated publicly.  They will wait until the climate is more favourable to advance those policies.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the Taoiseach, a decent man in many ways, allowing himself to be trapped in this awful situation.  However, on his shoulders must rest firmly and squarely the criminal negligence of the Ministers I have referred to.  Another area where we see job losses is in the public service. At least one Department in recent weeks laid off 25 temporary workers. At a time when we need jobs so badly that is very bad.  Time is running out for the Government; the country dearly wishes to see the end of them but it appears to be impossible for them to do the only honourable thing left to them.  The damage to the economy is the fault of the Government. Their recent disgraceful shenanigans are to their eternal discredit but, like people who know they have done wrong, they are afraid to face the people who elected them on false hopes and promises more than three years ago.  The promises were not fulfilled; they are broken and shattered.</P>
    <P>The attitude adopted by the Minister for Labour last night, that the situation was not as bad as it might be, was adopted again tonight by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to inflation.  He referred to the fact that the rate of inflation had grown but on the shoulders of the Government rests the responsibility for the high rate of inflation we have experienced since 1973.  I would love to have had the time to go back over <Col N="1034" /> the many speeches made by that Minister when he was appealing for everybody to be responsible.  This party have always been responsible but the parties who make up the Government long ago shed that responsibility.  Unless we can persuade the workers, encourage them by easing the burden on their shoulders, and unless we can encourage business and industry by easing their burden, as spelt out in our paper, we will not make progress.  I look forward to the comments Deputy Colley will make on those matters because since the Government introduced their first budget he heralded the warning signs.  He repeated those warnings when other budgets were introduced and the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance cannot say but that they were warned in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally enough, this debate has centred mainly on the economic situation but it is right to note that the motion put down by the Taoiseach goes further than that.  It asks that Dáil Éireann express satisfaction with the Government's economic and social policies.  I suppose one should admire the Taoiseach's approach in this matter where he has determined that he is going to drag into the lobbies behind him, protesting loudly in public but going in to vote behind him, the various Labour Deputies whose hearts have been bleeding in public in regard to aspects of social policy.  If their public protestations are to be believed in all honesty they cannot express any satisfaction with the Government's social policies.  At the outset I should like to say something about the Government's social policies in respect of which the House is being asked to express its satisfaction.  We all know that the Government are under a great deal of pressure on many fronts but we also know when pinned into a corner what they will come up with whether from the Fine Gael or Labour Parties.  It is that at least they have done something worth while in the social welfare field.  I suggest that that is as untrue as all the other claims we have heard from the Coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> In this connection I have a table which was worked out by one of our Deputies, Deputy Ciarán Murphy, based on information received on foot of a Parliamentary question. That information showed that £1 in March, 1973, when Fianna Fáil left office, would now require £1.75 to purchase the same amount of goods here.  This is independent of the effect of changes in other currency values; it relates solely to the Irish púnt and the Irish consumer price index.</P>
    <P>This table sets out 16 items of benefit under social welfare; unemployment benefit, contributory widows' pension, retirement pension, contributory old age pension, injury benefit, unemployment allowance, non-contributory widows' pension, non-contributory old age pension, first qualified child's allowance, second qualified child's allowance, each additional child's allowance, deserted wife's benefit, blind persons' pension, maternity allowance, maternity grant and death grant.</P>
    <P>It shows the amount paid in respect of each heading in 1973 when we left office, the equivalent amount today that would be needed to be paid simply to maintain that value, and the actual amount being paid.  In every case, except two, the amount which should be paid now, merely to keep pace with 1973 Fianna Fáil levels, is below what is being paid.  In some cases the difference is quite substantial. In the only two exceptions where the present allowance actually paid exceeds the amount which should be paid to maintain Fianna Fáil social welfare standards, the difference is 20p per week.  In all other cases the actual amount being paid, according to the Government's own calculation of the value of the Irish £ over the period, is less than would be needed to maintain Fianna Fáil standards of social welfare.</P>
    <P>That is eloquent of how much trust may be placed in the claims of the Coalition even in this area which they have tried to take as their own.  But there is another aspect that bears a little examination, that is the shambles <Col N="1036" />&mdash;and that is the only word that adequately can describe what went on a little time ago&mdash;in regard to the necessity to increase the social welfare payments from the 1st November.  When the budget was introduced it was made clear that the social welfare payments being provided for would be reviewed later in the year.  For that reason they were not attacked, as they might have been, for being grossly inadequate in relation to the cost of living.  But the matter went much further than the Minister for Finance in the budget.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should like to quote from what was said by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, who is responsible for social welfare, speaking in this House on 11th March, 1976, as reported at column 1822, Volume 288, of the Official Report.  He said:</P>
    <P>The Government have also decided that those April rates will be reviewed in the light of the trend of inflation during the year and that appropriate adjustments will be made&mdash;as was the case last year&mdash; to guarantee the recipients against the erosion of the purchasing power of their benefits and allowances.</P>
    <P>That was quite clear and unequivocal.</P>
    <P>Some interesting questions arise. First, when the Parliamentary Secretary said that the Government had so decided, was he misleading the House?  Was he misleading the public? We are entitled to know if he was.  If, on the other hand, he was speaking in good faith and was not in any way attempting to mislead the House or the public, why did the Government decide to change and only under great pressure from this party, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and many others, eventually and half-heartedly give increases to approximately half the recipients of social welfare, leaving something over 400,000 people to survive as best they might in face of enormous inflation with no attempt made to keep pace even with the inflation which was largely induced by the Government.</P>
    <P>If the Government decided to change their decision, quite apart from the hardship created by that, one is entitled <Col N="1037" /> to ask why and if there is any basis of truth in what was being said here by members of the Government, such as the Minister for Labour who led off, the Minister for Finance who followed, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  They all painted a picture of an economy which has taken off.  The Minister for Labour said that &ldquo;a major recovery is under way&rdquo;. The Minister for Finance called Fianna Fáil Rip Van Winkles for not recognising that this had been going on since autumn of last year.  If that is so, what possible justification could there have been for the Government to go back on a decision which, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, they had made to review payments of social welfare and to adjust them in line with inflation?</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask that question and to expect an answer but judging by other and more recent experience, we may be left expecting an answer. However, the Taoiseach and the Government will learn soon enough, when the people get the opportunity to pass judgment on what they are doing, that it is not good enough to treat this House with the kind of contempt they have been showing, the contempt that is expressed by refusing to answer reasonable questions of this nature which are put to them and to which the public are entitled to an answer.  I could dwell at some length on other aspects of alleged social policies of this Government, but if we could get the matters I have raised clarified we might have achieved something in that regard.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the economic aspect of this debate.  It seems quite clear that the Government have taken an irresponsible decision to pretend that, as the Minister for Labour said yesterday, a major recovery is under way. Anybody who heard the Minister for Finance will recognise that he was not satisfied with that.  He had to go much further.  Maybe it is just the way he is made.  He does not seem to be able to say anything with any degree of moderation but other Ministers who took part in this debate have taken the same line.</P>
    <P>I thought, and most people thought, <Col N="1038" /> that we had at last reached the stage where there was at least agreement on how bad the situation was.  This Government decision&mdash;I say &ldquo;decision&rdquo; because clearly various members of the Government would not have come in taking the line they did unless such a decision was made&mdash;is irresponsible, because if the picture is as good as was being painted by members of the Government, with no real restraint having been exercised in the past few years, why should people agree to exercise restraint in the future?</P>
    <P>This is a fundamental question. How can the Government reconcile their stance in asking for pay restraint and for restraint in demands for services of different kinds from the Government and the Exchequer generally with the picture being painted by some of their members in this debate?  It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the economic picture as painted by Government members changes as an election becomes likely either in the fairly near future or in the somewhat longer term.  That situation may be understandable in terms that are purely party political in the worst sense of that phrase but it is not understandable in terms of a Government with any semblance of a claim to responsibility.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Finance claimed that we in Fianna Fáil were Rip Van Winkles because we had not noticed the great upsurge in our economy, an upsurge which according to him began in the autumn of last year.  If that is so, we are not the only Rip Van Winkles in the country. There must be many others, including the NESC, the ESRI and almost all economic commentators and not only those but the Government themselves. Speaking in Sligo on September 29th last the Taoiseach said that we are now generating most of our inflation here and that other countries have rates of price increases that are only half or a third of ours.  I am not disputing that statement.  But how can it be reconciled with the kind of picture we have been getting from the Government during this debate, a picture designed to suggest that, without any restraint or effort, a major recovery <Col N="1039" /> is under way?  How can people be expected to respond to claims for restraint when there is that kind of irresponsibility from those charged with the responsibility of managing our economy?</P>
    <P>In the Government's Green Paper we are told that it must be a cause for concern that, while other countries are now moving towards what could be a sustained return to growth, there is a distinct possibility that this country could fail to join them if the required action is not taken in areas that are within our control.  Again, that is a statement with which I would not disagree, but I am trying to place it in the context of what we have to listen to from the various Ministers who spoke during this debate.</P>
    <P>It is clear that an irresponsible decision has been taken by the Government for their own party political purposes so as to distort the picture of what is happening in our economy and without having any regard to the very serious consequences that can flow from that decision.  I suggest that this situation should be put in perspective. To this end we on this side of the House are prepared in the first place to acknowledge that there has been a slight improvement in some figures and some indicators; but those improvements have had no effect and of themselves will have no effect on the unemployment situation, on the inflation situation or on the Government deficit situation.  There are two main reasons for the improvements in some economic indicators.  First, there is the question of the sinking £.  This has an immediate effect on the ability of our industrial exporters to sell their goods abroad.  If that factor were not reflected in our industrial exports our position would be catastrophic, but to some extent it has been reflected.  The same factor and others have affected agricultural exports, too.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs was honest enough in dealing with this matter to acknowledge that the sinking £ has the effect of improving our industrial exports performance but that it also produces a problem in relation to inflation.  The Minister for Finance was claiming <Col N="1040" /> credit for the Government for the increase in industrial exports while ignoring the enormous problems that are building up for us as a result of the sinking £ in regard to inflation and the effect of imported inflation on our already enormously high inflation rate.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the major reliance by the Government on indicators showing an improvement in the situation was based on figures for industrial exports and on an increase in industrial exports this year compared with last year.  To put this matter into perspective it is necessary to recall that in 1975, for the first time since we embarked on our programme of industrialisation, there was a drop of 4 per cent in the volume of our industrial exports.  Consequently, the improvement that has occurred this year is an improvement on a situation which had deteriorated last year to a situation that was worse than any we had had since industrialisation begun here.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be misunderstood in this regard.  Any improvement in our industrial export situation or in any area of our economy is to be welcomed heartily, but it is grosssly irresponsible to take a situation like that and to play it up for all it is worth in order to pretend that a major recovery was under way.</P>
    <P>Another factor which is contributing to such improvement as has occurred is very interesting because it is due to action on the part of the Government in their second budget of 1975.  Speaking in another place on the 15th May last the Minister for Finance told the Confederation of Irish Industry that, due to the measures taken in the budget of June, 1975, to curb price increases and to boost consumer expenditure, the last four months of that year witnessed a dramatic recovery in consumer demand when the volume of retail sales increased by nearly 5 per cent on the corresponding period for 1974.  This, said the Minister, contrasted with the volume fall of 6 per cent recorded in the previous eight months.</P>
    <P>That is all very heartening, but what are the facts of the situation?  That budget involved substantial reductions in certain VAT rates and in subsidies <Col N="1041" /> on passenger fares, gas, and electricity. Was not this course urged continuously by us in the previous autumn? But the Government failed totally to respond to our urgings in the January budget.  Instead, they responded belatedly in June, 1975, and produced the dramatic results of which the Minister for Finance spoke.  Then, in January this year they undid the good work by going back to the previous policies he had been following in budgets, adding on more and more taxes, pricing more and more goods out of the home and foreign markets and pricing more people out of jobs.</P>
    <P>I suggest there is a lesson here for the Taoiseach if he is willing to learn it.  We put forward these proposals and the Government did not listen.  When eventually, belatedly, they listened after the national pay agreement had been concluded and all that involved implemented, we reached the middle of 1975 and got a dramatic recovery, to quote the Minister for Finance, in consumer demand.  The message is: listen to what we are saying now. Listen to the proposals we are putting forward and do not implement them too late.  The Taoiseach can rest assured that if our economic proposals are implemented quickly, which means no later than the next budget, he can confidently look forward to even more dramatic improvements in our economic situation.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, while dealing with the various strange statements made by the Minister for Finance, might I say that he repeated yesterday something I thought we had killed off but, apparently, not for the Minister for Finance? He claimed credit for the very satisfactory economic performance in 1973. He specifically claimed that it arose out of the budget introduced by him in 1973.  I have put on the record of this House a number of times, and I do not propose to do it again, both the facts and the economic indicators in 1973 and quotations from various independent economic commentators. What it all adds up to is that in the first half of 1973 this country had the greatest growth it ever experienced but tragically that growth fell off and, indeed, in some instances began to go <Col N="1042" /> back after the middle of 1973.</P>
    <P>There were very good reasons for this happening and not the least was the effect of the budget brought in by the Coalition for which the Minister for Finance was yesterday claiming the credit in regard to the results in 1973, results which can be clearly shown and have been clearly shown to have arisen in the first half of that year.  We have consistently since this Coalition came into office detailed our criticisms of what the Government were doing wrong and indicated what the consequences would be if they persisted.  It would be much too tedious now to reiterate these but the Taoiseach knows as well as I do that they are all on the records of the House.  However, it is no harm in this context to recall that we now have a public acknowledgment from the Government of how right we were, and I refer to the Green Paper issued by the Government.  I am quoting the first paragraph at the top of page 26:</P>
    <P>To sum up, the key features of the projection of existing trends are continuing high inflation, mounting balance of payments deficits, drastic cuts in public expenditure, a non-acceptable level of taxation, an impossible borrowing requirement and growing unemployment&mdash;in short an intolerable situation.</P>
    <P>That is a statement from the Government of what the present situation is and what is likely to happen if the Government persist in pursuing the policies we have consistently pointed out to them were leading to this situation. We were actually derided for doing so.</P>
    <P>One extremely important matter&mdash; in fact, the most important matter&mdash; in any consideration of the economy as to what is happening and what is likely to happen is the question of jobs.  I have noted that speakers on behalf of the Government like, when dealing with this matter, to take figures back over a long period.  They may go back to 1960 or even further. They will take the figures for unemployment and the figures for emigration and they will lump the whole period together and try to suggest that there was a great failure of <Col N="1043" /> previous policies in regard to job creation and, by implication, suggest that emigration had been going on until the present world recession.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from any question of party political advantage that may be involved in this, this is a very misguided approach because the facts are quite different.  If it can be shown that certain policies in the past were successful then it is only right that attention should be drawn to them and we should concentrate on continuing these policies and hopefully producing different and additional policies to meet the gap that arises in regard to job creation.  The facts are that emigration finished.  It had dwindled to almost nothing, according to the statistics, in 1970-1971.  Between 1961 and 1971 there were no fewer than 110,000 new non-agricultural jobs created.  There were more, of course, subsequently under Fianna Fáil in 1972 and 1973.  It is important to understand that from 1961 to 1971 no fewer than 110,000 new non-agricultural jobs were created.</P>
    <P>These were counterbalanced to a considerable extent by what we used to call, and still do, the flight from the land, but that has been dwindling and, towards the end of the period, it had dwindled considerably.  The figures for the last few years show it to be even lower than the projection in the Green Paper.  The projection up to 1980 is 3,500 per annum.  The loss has not been that high in the last few years.  The significance of this is that, if we are to continue the policies followed in the 1960s and the early 1970s, accompanied by, as everybody expects, a considerably reduced rate in the flight of people from the land, the net effect is the creation of a large number of new jobs and increased employment overall.  To quote figures back to 1960 and ignore the trend up to 1973 is to distort the position and mislead people into thinking the policies followed then will not do us any good now or in the future.  I think it is quite clear that had this Government followed the right policies the drop in the numbers <Col N="1044" /> leaving the land would be considerably reduced and there would be a considerable improvement in our situation.</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  Unfortunately in non-agricultural jobs, where we had been having this increase of 11,000 a year approximately, under this Government we find there has been a drop, a loss of 66,000 non-agricultural jobs between 1974 and the estimate to the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I am taking those figures from the Government's Green Paper, Table 1, in case there is any doubt about the matter.  Between 1974 and 1976 there was a loss of 66,000 non-agricultural jobs, industrial jobs broadly speaking, as against 11,000 new non-agricultural jobs every year for well over a decade. When I hear people on the Government benches, not least Deputy Halligan and the Taoiseach on another occasion, talk as though previous policies in the sixties and seventies were a failure in regard to job creation, I ask them to explain to us why they were a failure, having regard to the facts I have outlined and I ask them to explain to us how, during 1974 to 1976, 66,000 non-agricultural industrial jobs were lost.</P>
    <P>I am not now going back over all the Government's mistakes in the past that we pointed out to them.  I am dealing with the current situation which until this debate opened was agreed by everybody to be as bad as it was.  If we take the Government's voice from the Green Paper or statements from the Taoiseach as representing their real view of the economic situation, what efforts have they made to deal with it? There have been two major prongs in their approach to it.  One of those was the establishment of the tripartite talks and the other was the publication of the Green Paper.  In relation to the tripartite talks I want to quote something the Minister for Finance said in a speech which he delivered on the 15th September, 1976, addressing the chief executives forum conference in Killarney. He said as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to redoubling efforts to curb the causes of inflation generated domestically <Col N="1045" /> and are about to engage with the social partners in unprecedented crucial discussions to work out an economic package to meet the realities of our situation.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt from that statement by the Minister for Finance that the Government regard the tripartite talks as of crucial importance.  That being so, is it not surprising that we did not hear more from Government speakers about what has been the cause of the breakdown of those talks?</P>
    <P>I know that some people will say that those talks have not broken down. They are adjourned and there is no day fixed for their resumption.  In the meantime negotiations on pay are going ahead.  If one wants to quibble whether or not there is a breakdown, then the effect is a breakdown.  What hope can there be for a successful resumption of those tripartite talks having regard to this irresponsible decision of the Government to come into this debate and paint a picture of an economy in which a major recovery was under way.</P>
    <P>Those talks could have been of great importance&mdash;I certainly concede that&mdash; but they were doomed from the start by the Government's attitude, particularly as exemplified in the Green Paper.  One has only to think of the inordinate delay in producing the Green Paper and the mad scramble to rewrite it after the production of the Fianna Fáil economic proposals, which resulted in their producing copies of it to some people with the old table of contents, revealing in outline at least, what the rewriting had been, producing it on the Sunday before the talks began&mdash;they began on the Monday&mdash;supposed to be the basis for the tripartite talks.  When one looked at the content, after all the delay and promising of the Green Paper, it was such a vague and uncommitted document that the surprise is that the tripartite talks went as far as they did.</P>
    <P>We learned from newspaper reports, and eventually in this debate from what the Minister for Labour had to say, that in those talks the Government had, in effect, offered a cut in taxation of £50 million and an investment <Col N="1046" /> programme of an extra £50 million for job creation.  I suppose the Green Paper, its vagueness and its non-committedness is hardly a surprise since it is perfectly obvious that the Fine Gael and Labour parties cannot agree on a basic approach to the economy and they have to leave the whole thing vague.  At least we have heard something now of specific proposals put forward.  I will say a little more in a moment about those proposals in relation to the Fianna Fáil proposals.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, firstly, to spell out again something which has been obvious from the Government almost from the beginning but has now become a refrain from almost all members of the Government: that the responsibility for decisions, particularly major economic decisions, does not rest on the members of the Government but on the trade unions, the employers, the general public and sometimes even on Fianna Fáil.  We heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce recently elaborating on this thesis.  We have had it from a few members of the Government again in this debate.  I want to make it clear that, of course, a Government have to consult.  Of course, they have to try to get concensus.  If they are to get concensus the first condition is that they must give leadership.  They must be prepared to commit themselves specifically to saying that this is what they believe should be done and then try to induce people to do that, or, if people can come up with improvements or better ideas, accept them.</P>
    <P>The first condition is that the Government commit themselves.  The Coalition Government have failed to do that.  On every occasion the opportunity offered they ran away from it. The reason is obvious: inability to agree within the Cabinet on what line should be taken.  They then pass responsibility over to anybody else they can pass it on to.  I suggest seriously that in the light of the continued failure of the Government to take responsibility, to commit themselves to a particular course of action in regard to the management of the economy, there is a case for saying that the <Col N="1047" /> country would be better off without a Government of this kind.  At least the civil service would not have got us into the morass we are in now.  As far as the economic situation is concerned in regard to management of the economy, there has been none.  The Government and the Taoiseach must realise that the buck stopped with them, that is what they are elected for. They went on for the best part of four years talking about trying to get agreement from the social partners and now they have us coming to the end of 1976 in this terrible morass in which we are and still they have not committed themselves. We have speeches by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach and other people, in many cases making the right noises, but that is not commitment, that will not induce consensus. Real commitment where people know the Government mean it and are prepared to stand on something, will produce consensus.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil issued very detailed proposals designed to turn around our economy.  They do not purport and did not purport to be an economic plan; they are simply proposals which if implemented would get our economy out of the crisis in which it is and enable us to go on with long-term economic planning.  One can waste a great deal of time engaging in academic discussion about the role of the State, the role of private enterprise and so on, and all the time the economy is getting further and further into the morass.  We must first get the economy moving and then we can indulge in that kind of discussion. There are two major elements in the Fianna Fáil proposals, first, tax cuts for pay rises and, secondly, substantially increased expenditure on job creation.  The reaction of the Government to these proposals was predictable, particularly that of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not always predictable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case the Minister was fairly predictable.  The Minister gave us and the country to understand that it was a lot of nonsense. <Col N="1048" /> The interesting thing is, that when the Government got down to some discussion in the tripartite talks, they came up with tax-cuts in return for pay rises and increased expenditure on job creation, so our proposals could not have been all that silly.  What is the difference, if the general strategy of this approach is the same on both sides of the House? Part of the difference arises in relation to the amounts involved, the amounts of tax-cuts and the amounts of increased expenditure on job creation.  Our proposals spelt out clearly and specifically what was involved and we projected forward on those figures in national accounts terms.  It is very significant that the Government have failed to do this.  If the Government were to take the proposals they put to the tripartite talks of £50 million tax-cuts and £50 million extra investment in job creation and projected them forward in national accounts terms and had a look at the results, everybody could compare one with the other to see if our approach is more sensible than theirs.  They failed to do so and I venture to suggest that they will continue to fail to do so because they are not really trying to achieve a turn-round in the economy, they are trying to achieve something that will keep the wolf from the door, the voter off their backs and will keep the trade unions and employers from going into a revolution.  If they were serious, they would have approached the matter in the way that Fianna Fáil did in their proposals.  Incidentally, no Opposition in our history have ever attempted anything like the Fianna Fáil proposals with the degree of detail and precision with which they were worked out and put forward. Indeed, few if any Governments, with all the resources available to them, have ever attempted it, but we have put our heads on the block, we have not been afraid to commit ourselves as an Opposition.  It is the traditional prerogative of an Opposition not to commit themselves on difficult matters of this kind.  One of the reasons why we did so was that it was quite clear that you could wait until Tib's Eve for this Government <Col N="1049" /> and they would never do it.  Somebody has to get the country out of the mess.  So taking on the duty of the Government, Fianna Fáil put their heads on the block, spelt out proposals in detail and projected forward over the next three to four years all the consequences of their proposals.</P>
      <P>I suggest that faced with the alternatives to the Fianna Fáil proposals and the Government's Green Paper there is really no choice for anybody. If one throws into the scale, on the side of the Green Paper, the proposals subsequently put to the tripartite talks, in order to get any kind of comparison one still needs to see the Government's proposals projected in the same way as the Fianna Fáil proposals are.  It is worthwhile that people should note the difference in approach, the careless and, indeed, incompetent way in which the Government have approached this major problem, as compared with the way the Opposition have approached it, the degree to which the Opposition were prepared to commit themselves and the degree to which the Government have run away from any commitment. Even if the Government were to attempt to implement the Fianna Fáil proposals, what hope would there be of their making them successful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government half-heartedly accepted our advice much too late in regard to subsidies and VAT rates, and to quote the Minister for Finance &mdash;produce a dramatic increase in consumer demand at home.  They have now apparently adopted the main strategy of the Fianna Fáil proposals in a half-hearted manner also, in the tripartite talks.  On the one hand they are talking about taxcuts and increased investment, and on the other they are telling us that this cannot be done when Fianna Fáil proposes it.  We proposed it in the full knowledge, that doing it will increase the national debt and in the first year increase the deficit, but we have been honest enough to spell that out and project it forward and show that we can achieve a substantial reduction in the Government's deficit, and a substantial rate of growth and a very great reduction in inflation and, above all, an <Col N="1050" /> increase in jobs of 25,000 in our first year and, thereafter, another 50,000 over the next two years.  We spelt out how precisely this would happen.  We have provided also, in doing this, for a reduction on average of 20 per cent in the amount of income tax which would be paid by each taxpayer, a reduction in the employer's contribution to social welfare, in the second year abolition of rates on private dwellings, and a variety of other measures detailed in our proposals designed particularly to encourage enterprise and investment, especially in home Irish industry and to help small business people in regard to the simplification of VAT and various other proposals regarding tourism, and so on, which we have detailed.</P>
    <P>Despite what has been said in this debate on behalf of the Government for short-term political reasons, the facts are, and they are agreed in the Government's Green Paper, that the country is in an economic mess.  The real question that arises, apart from the question of whether we are in a mess, or how we got into it, is: how to get out of it?  We on this side of the House, in an unprecedented move have spelt out precisely how we can get out of it, how we can get the country moving again.  The Government, whose duty it is to do this, have run away from that responsibility, have produced this inane Green Paper, have set up the tripartite talks with a great flourish of trumpets.  According to the Minister for Finance, these talks represented unprecedented, crucial discussions.  And the talks have failed.</P>
    <P>Much too late the Government paid attention to us before when we told them about the VAT costs and the subsidies, and it had a dramatically good effect which they undid last January.  Clearly the Government have no ideas or they cannot agree on them, and they are certainly not prepared to make any commitment to any programme for tackling our economic crisis.  They have failed in the announced approach which they had to tripartite talks.  Given that situation, if they cannot bring themselves to get out and go before the people, let them at least adopt the Fianna Fáil proposals&mdash;not <Col N="1051" /> half-heartedly, but fully&mdash; and implement them as long as they can stay in office, and we will be then at least on the road to recovery.  Without an approach of that kind, without any worth-while approach spelt out in this important economic debate, what hope is there for the country as long as this Government remain in power?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened during the course of this debate to a variety of opinions and arguments.  I suppose it would be expecting too much to anticipate agreement either on an analysis of the problems which face us or the remedies necessary to solve them.  However, in concluding the debate, I should like to deal with a few facts and to get a few facts before the Dáil and before the country.</P>
      <P>This debate has centred a good deal on the rate of inflation, on prices, on unemployment, on taxation and welfare. Therefore, it is necessary to realise that, while prices have risen here, they have risen less in some cases than the prices of what we buy and sell abroad. While unemployment has increased, the percentage by which it has risen is considerably less than in other countries with which we trade.  If we compare the position in 1975, the Irish economy declined less than in most of the countries of Western Europe and the United States.  This year economic growth has been at a rate six or seven times higher than was forecast earlier in the year and, indeed, may I say, higher than was forecast only six months ago, or less, when we had a debate in this House and when the Opposition were critical of some figures I produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with a few of these matters because I think these achievements are considerable, despite a particularly unfavourable world situation and at home a difficult security situation.  What we buy from abroad is equivalent to approximately 50 per cent of our gross national product. What we sell to people from other countries comes to more than 45 per cent.  In effect, therefore, foreign trade together is equivalent to about 95 per cent of the gross national product. Given the size of these figures and their <Col N="1052" /> magnitude and significance, it is impossible for us to ignore the effects of international trade on our economy. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition made this point when he referred to the effects on us of sterling devaluation.</P>
    <P>As has often been said, geographically we are an island, but economically we are an integral part of the world around us.  Therefore, it is necessary to examine the effects of this contiguity and the effect particularly on prices.  Between 1973 and 1974, the price of what we imported went up by 46 per cent.  Between 1974 and 1975, it went up by 21 per cent.  The effect of these changes in prices in this country was both immediate and fundamental. They rose rapidly.  Similarly, the price of what we export enters into the domestic price structure.  Naturally, exporters will sell where they can get the best prices.  In this way, export prices serve to determine the price of goods sold here.  It is worth examining in what way they have gone in recent years.</P>
    <P>Between 1973 and 1974, export prices rose by 24 per cent.  Between 1974 and 1975, they rose by 19 per cent.  In this sort of international environment with the price of so much of what we buy and sell being determined abroad, we have to examine the way prices moved here.  Between 1973 and 1974, the consumer price index went up by 17 per cent.  Between 1974 and 1975, it went up by 21 per cent. In other words, the index rose by considerably less than the indices for both imports and exports.  In this economy, which in many respects is an uniquely open economy, we are deriving a great deal of our inflation from what is happening in the world about us.  The fact that the consumer price index rose by percentages which were smaller than the percentage increases in both export and import prices is a tribute to the way in which the economy behaved and was managed in these years.  It is important that we should recognise the point and accord credit where it is due.</P>
    <P>Often people, and indeed Deputies or others wanting to score a point, tend to ignore the effects of international influences on our economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> The Government cannot do this and the fact is widely acknowledged by experts.  In the course of this debate a number of reports have been referred to and quoted from.  I refer to a report produced in 1974 by the Economic Policy Committee of the European Economic Community where they estimated the extent of the adjustments required in the different member states up to 1978 as a result of the increases in oil prices at the end of 1973.  The report put the adjustment for Ireland at the equivalent of 15 to 20 per cent of GNP as it was in 1974.  This range represented about twice the burden estimated to fall on the next two member states most severely affected, Italy and Britain, and compared with much smaller burdens of about 1 per cent or less which would fall on Germany and the Benelux countries.  It was obvious, therefore, early in the period of increased oil prices that our economy was particularly vulnerable to its effects, and the report stressed this fact.</P>
    <P>This can be further amplified and emphasised by another assessment. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has estimated the changes in the export markets of different countries by weighting the growth of imports into the various markets into which the exporting countries sell according to their importance to the exporter. These estimates indicate that in 1974 the growth in the markets to which we sell was less, indeed less than half in most cases, than the growth in the markets of the United States and of all the EEC countries for which figures were given.  Again, in 1975 our markets declined more steeply than those of any of these countries.  In other words, we were trying to sell in markets which were contracting, stationary or expanding less rapidly than those markets to which many other countries with which we are often contrasted were selling.</P>
    <P>It is well, therefore, to examine what has happened to our economy over the period to which I have referred in the face of these difficulties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> When I spoke here with others in the Adjournment Debate last June I said that in 1975 national output had declined by 1 per cent, and I tried at the time to put this into perspective. It is important now to give the figures so that the picture can be understood and appreciated.  What we achieved in 1975 was among the best performance of countries of the European Economic Community.  In Germany, often held up as an example of efficiency and economic success, the decline was 3.4 per cent; in France, it was 2.4 per cent; in Italy, 3.7 per cent; in the United Kingdom, 1.6 per cent; in Belgium, 1.4 per cent; and in the Netherlands it was 1.3 per cent.  Only in Denmark was the decrease less than in this country and there it was 0.8 per cent. If we look further afield to the United States, we find that they suffered a decrease of 2 per cent in their GNP. The figures are published in the July issue of the OECD publication, <i>Economic Outlook.</i></P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that part of our achievement is due to the remarkable growth of agricultural output last year. However, if one examines the statistics of industrial production, the results are far from providing evidence of any unique ineptitude.  We experienced a fall of just over 6 per cent in industrial production, or about the same as Germany and Denmark, and a great deal less than the 9 per cent decreases suffered by France, Italy and the United States, the 10 per cent fall in Belgium or the quite remarkable special case of the 22 per cent decrease in Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>The figures for unemployment provide a similar picture.  Over generations the rate of unemployment here has been higher than in almost every country with which we deal.  This is a problem basic to our history and to the structure of our economy.  No Government have ever succeeded in getting our unemployment down to a rate comparable with other countries in Europe.  When the recession of recent years hit us our unemployment figures rose, but the percentage by which they rose was considerably less than in the countries with which we <Col N="1055" /> trade.  I mention this because it is important, and no one wants to minimise the significance of unemployment or to suggest that the situation here is not a serious one.  It is indeed probably the single most serious economic problem we face, and the purpose of our discussions on the economy is to maintain jobs on the one hand and to provide more on the other.</P>
    <P>So far I have been talking about what happened last year and the year before.  I would like to come now to matters of more immediate relevance. I think it is important to mention these things because, regarding some remarks made in the course of this debate and some of the concluding remarks made by Deputy Colley on behalf of the Opposition, it is well to see&mdash;I will be dealing with some aspects of this later &mdash;how effective were the Government policies we adopted in the budgets of recent years and to contrast these decisions which were taken with the advice given by the Opposition at the time.</P>
    <P>I want to advert again to what I said a few moments ago.  When I said in the Adjournment Debate of June last that I expected that the growth for the year would be in the range of 2 to 2½ per cent I was accused by Deputies opposite of misleading the country, of not knowing what was contained in a report published only that morning, or, if I did know it, of not disclosing the facts of the report by the Economic and Social Research Institute.  I wonder now will Deputies be as eager to quote that report in the light of the facts as they have now emerged and the growth that I said was likely to happen this year&mdash;and I did not exaggerate.  The report at that time forecast that the growth in GNP this year would be no more than ½ per cent.  Of course we cannot be expected to comment on every report or every forecast and anything I say now should not be taken as a criticism of the work of the ESRI. They do valuable work and I neither quarrel with their activity nor question their objectivity.  When they prepare forecasts they must, like others, do so with caution.  Indeed, the very issue to which one Deputy referred <Col N="1056" /> on that occasion said and I quote: &ldquo;In using the forecasts it should be remembered that economic forecasting is an exact science, subject to many uncertainties&rdquo;.  Perhaps he did not heed the caution.</P>
    <P>I quoted from the official statistics prepared in the Department of Finance. I am not suggesting that the other forecasts are necessarily inaccurate but I think I can claim that during the years the figures produced by the Department of Finance have been reasonably close to the mark. The official forecasts now show that the growth this year has gone up and will not merely reach the level I suggested in June but will exceed it.  I understand the Commission of the European Economic Community have made a similar forecast&mdash;I think it was 3½ per cent.  The British National Institute for Economic and Social Research in its August, 1976 <i>Economic Review</i> considered that the official figure of growth this year was realistic. At this stage I should say I have not seen the issue of the ESRI quarterly commentary that normally appears in August or September or the autumn bulletin of the Central Bank.  All of these will be awaited with interest.</P>
    <P>I suppose that Deputies are not so much interested in the varients in the different forecasts; their concern is with what has happened.  The figures will show that the growth this year has been more than was predicted and compares well with what we believed was a reasonable forecast at the time. It is important to examine the position that existed when the recession was at its nadir in many countries.  At that time we had a lower rate of decline; but now that the recession is, hopefully, ending we may not achieve the same rate of growth as that of other countries recovering from an even deeper recession than ours.</P>
    <P>I have listened to and read the accounts of the proposals of the Opposition to deal with the present situation.  Fianna Fáil are always good in Opposition at promising plans for this, that and the other.  A few minutes ago Deputy Colley said he did not think it was necessary to go back <Col N="1057" /> too many years and I suppose it is not, but I always have a recollection of plans and proposals made in opposition. On the occasions when Fianna Fáil were in Government these plans did not achieve the aims.  The only one that worked partially was one we left behind at the beginning of 1957.  They put that into operation but the other plans were dropped or abandoned in midstream&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let us consider the programme they have advanced and contrast that with what was said at the time of the last two budgets.  They said we were spending too much and borrowing too much but now, when there is a serious inflationary problem, they suggest that we borrow more.  They suggest that we cut taxes but they do not say how we can get the money to pay for the services they say should be provided.  They tried to misquote or to misinterpret a speech I made recently in Sligo.  The Leader of the Opposition referred to it yesterday. I said we could not sustain the increase in borrowing in recent years in conditions appropriate to a recession and I referred to the effects of inflation on the rate of increase in the cost of public services.  Fianna Fáil now suggest we should have more Army personnel, more gardaí and more public officials, even though they failed to provide for this when they were in Government and when circumstances were much easier.  They did not provide the gardaí or the Army personnel that were necessary. Therefore, one must ask: where is the money to come from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They want an extra £100 million for capital projects.  They say they would cut taxes by £100 million and transfer to the Exchequer the cost of derating private houses&mdash;at a further cost of approximately £60 million at the likely 1977 level of rates.  The policy with regard to the rates was produced on the eve of the general election in contrast to a report prepared only two months earlier in which, as part of a Government White Paper, they proclaimed that the rates system <Col N="1058" /> would have to continue for a long time, probably for the foreseeable future.  That policy is now being produced again.  It is somewhat like a promise made about housing rents during the recent election in Dublin South-West.</P>
    <P>What would this programme mean? It would mean a programme of additional money for welfare.  The proposals would cost an extra £50 million in addition to the £300 million by which the servicing of debt and other Government expenditure will rise in 1977.  In effect we have a programme of tax reductions and additional expenditure totalling perhaps £600 million.</P>
    <P>In the light of some remarks made by Deputies, it is no harm to refer to what this Government have done with regard to welfare.  Fianna Fáil expressed concern that there was some delay in announcing the October increases in respect of social welfare, but we must remember that under Fianna Fáil there was only one increase a year, never two.  When I give the House the relevant figures they will appreciate what I am saying.  In comparison with 1972-1973, the total provision for health and welfare services and payments from the social insurance fund has increased between 280 per cent and 290 per cent.  This is due partly to the introduction of new benefits and the widening of the categories of those eligible but the main factor has been the significant increase in the rates of benefits and assistance payable.  I will give a few examples.</P>
    <P>A person drawing disability or unemployment benefit has had an increase of 96 per cent.  A person in receipt of a retirement pension who has an adult dependant below pensionable age has seen his pension increase by 101 per cent and a widow with a contributory pension with three children has enjoyed a similar increase. The urban rate of unemployment assistance where the recipient has a wife and four children has increased by 117 per cent.  An old age pensioner and his or her adult dependant now has 212 per cent more than in March, 1973.  During that time the <Col N="1059" /> consumer price index has gone up by 76 per cent and, as Deputies will see, this increase is less than the increases for the social welfare categories.  All the benefits under Fianna Fáil were relatively lower; they were paid once a year and not twice as has been the practice in recent budgets.</P>
    <P>Where is this money to come from? We are told it will come from borrowing from home sources.  No matter how confident we are in the ability of home resources to supply the necessary funds, it is worth examining the proposal.  This means an extra £600 million next year.  This figure alone is between a quarter and a third of total Government expenditure at present, and if I may give a further comparison, in 1975&mdash;and this is a significant figure&mdash;the total savings of the country were estimated at almost exactly £600 million, the same as is now suggested by the Opposition can be raised from home resources.  It is reasonable to assume that the figure for savings next year will be greater than in 1975, but if it is greater, this would represent a considerable proportion of the total. This means that the State, through absorbing this, would withdraw money that is essential for all other areas of the economy; it would withdraw the money that is necessary for investment in agriculture, manufacturing, building and service industries by both persons and firms who are, on their own initiative, working without Government intervention.</P>
    <P>That is not the only consequence. This extra £600 million borrowed would require probably £100 million annually for the debt service in addition to the £340 million that it is now estimated to cost in the current year. When these facts are put before the Dáil, Deputies and the country can see how easy it is to produce paper proposals from the Opposition, no matter how detailed or exhaustive or how far they are projected, to use Deputy Colley's phrase, into the future.</P>
    <P>I think it is important to note that those who advocate higher public expenditure, usually at the same time as they recommend or promise&mdash;because <Col N="1060" /> it is the promise that is the attractive part&mdash;to reduce taxation, always advance the argument that it will create greater revenue buoyancy.  This is so to a limited extent, but in our economy much of the expenditure is directed into either imports or domestic inflation and while extra economic buoyancy will produce revenue, it must be hard for even the most optimistic to see how it would materialise when the State would be channelling through its own agencies and institutions almost every pound of the free savings of the people.  On the figures I have quoted&mdash;and these figures are based on the actual returns for 1975 &mdash;and giving a slight margin for an increase for this year, there would be no money left in private hands for investment into productive enterprise as firms and industries see it, and this is where so much of the real buoyancy comes from.</P>
    <P>We are not against borrowing.  In fact the criticism that was levelled against us in 1974 and in 1975 and even in the earlier part of this year, was that we were borrowing too much, that we were spending too much, that instead of restricting, as was advocated at the time by the Opposition, we spent because we believed that, however difficult this recession was, whatever problems it created, we had to gear our economy and channel as much as was possible into capital development, and that in order to do that it was sound in the circumstances or at least preferable to the large-scale unemployment that would be created if we did not borrow to the extent we did.  If we look back over the last three years there can be no doubt that what we did was beneficial and has been reflected in the outcome of the economy generally.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years we have increased public expenditure at a rate unparalleled in the previous history of the State.  We did this because we recognised that world conditions then required it.  We have tried to ensure that this increased expenditure went into areas which would strengthen our economy in the medium and long term.</P>
    <P>This is probably seen most clearly <Col N="1061" /> in the amount of money spent on building up our industrial capacity both in the public and private sectors. The capital provision for aid by the Industrial Development Authority, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and Gaeltarra Éireann has increased from £29 million in 1972-73 to £69 million this year.  This increase represents massive investment in plants incorporating the most modern technology.  It has strengthened and diversified our industrial base.  Last year alone the total investment on foot of which grants were paid by the Industrial Development Authority amounted to £106 million. Presented coldly or just in a debate of this sort, the figures probably do not convey the full reality of what has been happening.  There has been massive investment in textiles, pharmaceuticals, electronics, engineering and other industries by firms from this country, Britain, the United States of America, Germany, Sweden, France, Japan and even Australia.  These firms see the real advantages which this country possesses for investment and they have backed their judgment with their money.</P>
    <P>In the public sector, we provided £37 million this year towards the building of NET's fertiliser plant in Cork which will ensure self-sufficiency in our nitrogen requirements until well into the eighties&mdash;and could well provide the basis for substantial other industries of a highly technological nature.  This is in addition to the substantial additional capacity commissioned at Arklow over the last three years.  Other public companies have also undertaken or are undertaking to modernise and adapt their plant and equipment.</P>
    <P>There has been a remarkable quickening of the tempo in the provision of the infrastructure without which industrial investment cannot take place.  There is very little glamour in the construction of a main drainage scheme&mdash;or even a road, but these facilities and the infrastructure proposed are as essential as land, for modern factories and service industries. This year we provided £19 million for water supply and sewerage <Col N="1062" /> facilities for housing, industry and other developments.  This compares with just over £8 million spent on this vital service in 1972-73.  We have allocated £50 million for telephone development in the current year, an amount little short of treble that spent in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>The trebling of the capital provision for development by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and a continuing programme of major improvements at fishery harbours have been significant factors in the expansion and upgrading of our fishery fleet.  The investment aids provided under the EEC farm modernisation scheme have promoted the modernisation of our farming sector necessary to take full advantage of the expansion opportunities opened up by EEC membership.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have sanctioned projects under the scheme that will involve an investment by farmers of £100 million by the end of this year.  Funds provided through Bord Fáilte have assisted renewal and improvement of our stock of accommodation and recreational amenities which should help to put our tourism in a position both to attract and cater for increased numbers of tourists if the Northern Ireland situation and the cost factors become more favourable.</P>
    <P>Preparations are well advanced for the mining of the Navan orebody on a basis that will maximise the benefits to the country.  Off-shore natural gas will be flowing next year and arrangements have been made for extensive exploration over the next three years.</P>
    <P>In all this we have not overlooked the importance of providing our work force with the modern skills needed in today's industry.  During previous periods of growth and expansion in the economy there has been ample evidence of a lack of skilled manpower.  We are anxious to avoid a similar situation arising again.  This is shown by the amount provided for industrial training.  The State grant to AnCO has increased from just over £2 million in 1972-73 to £8.5 million this year. When the contribution from the European <Col N="1063" /> Social Fund is added to this the total amount at AnCO's disposal this year comes to about £14 million.  The increased financial allocation will enable AnCO to train over 10,000 persons this year compared with 7,500 in 1975 and 2,500 in 1972-73.  This figure represents about 1 per cent of the labour force and was originally a target for 1978 but was brought forward in the light of the current unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>I do not want anybody to imagine from what I have said that I regard higher public expenditure, in itself, as a good thing.  In some respects it is not, because it creates some problems. Unless the expenditure creates or fosters self-sustaining employment it is of no permanent benefit.  It is in this context that I want to give some figures, because I think it is important that this should be understood both by the Opposition and everybody else.  The total expenditure of Government and local authorities, together with the capital expenditure of semi-State bodies, is now equivalent to approximately £2 out of every £3 of the GNP.  It is obviously one of the most potent sources of our inflation because much of it must be financed by borrowing abroad, which does not represent or call into existence any increase in the total productive capacity of this country.  This borrowing must be critically examined and certain limitations are being suggested in the guidelines that have been laid down by the responsible authorities from whom we have to seek it.  This raises the question of our ability to increase our borrowing further.  The funds could not be obtained and we could not sustain the burden of principle and interest repayments.  Already this year these are costing us almost one-third of total tax revenue and, on some forecasts will continue to absorb this proportion of revenue until 1980.</P>
    <P>This borrowing was justified when it was incurred to maintain employment and services at a level which would not have been possible without it, but now that things are returning in some respects to normality we must move towards a more appropriate <Col N="1064" /> degree of balance in our public finances.  If we do not, there could be massive increases in unemployment and inflation at a rate far beyond anything we have so far experienced.</P>
    <P>One of the most urgent tasks facing us with the ending of the recession is to ensure that demand by the Government on total resources does not inhibit the flow of finance and other resources to productive investment in industry, services and agriculture.  The call of particular public services on resources, no matter how worthy in themselves, must yield to the overriding objective of getting our borrowing down, reducing inflation and so creating better prospects for employment. This means that we must also ensure that the level of public expenditure is not such as to accentuate already excessive levels of taxation which are a potent inflationary force in our conditions.  Central and local government taxation on its widest definition is now equivalent to over 35 per cent of GNP.  It is not an unreasonable figure by international standards, but the taxation is levied in a way that can contribute directly and indirectly to inflation and bears on different sections of the community with altogether disproportinate degrees of severity.  The proportion of total income paid in taxes by different sections is striking and it is one of the matters referred to in the Green Paper in which we have made certain proposals for discussion as to how the situation can be improved.</P>
    <P>What the Government have done over the past few years is protect the people from the full effects of the worst recession this generation has ever known.  In doing this we have strained our resources as shown by the facts I have quoted.  The facts are there. There is no use in quoting a mass of statistics or a plethora of figures and producing a battery of reports if the message does not get across, if people are confused or if they only hear the last report produced and do not look at each one and try to see the simple facts behind it. We have strained our resources to the utmost, and even with these efforts our present economic situation is a <Col N="1065" /> matter for considerable concern. Unemployment and inflation here are at unacceptable levels.  A great many jobs have been lost.  Some jobs have been lost as a result of lay-offs due to falling demand.  Many of these should be made good as the economic recovery proceeds.  Other factors, including management deficiencies, played their part in bringing about factory closures and redundancies. But the plain fact&mdash;and this is one of the issues not sufficiently adverted to&mdash;is that our high costs of production, primarily as a result of excessive income increases, was the main culprit over the period of the recession.</P>
    <P>There has been some discussion during this debate on the fact that modern, highly-expensive capital investment industries of an automative character, or with a high degree of technological development, are capable of producing vast quantities of goods without providing the employment that traditional industries that were labour-intensive did provide.  There is a lesson in this.  Those interested in establishing industries here go principally for this type of factory because of the advantages it gives in respect of costs over the older traditional types, and the fact that it is possible to increase production substantially if the market expands or if prospects improve or, on the other hand, reduce output without varying the numbers employed.  This is one of the matters that the social partners and all interested could with profit study.</P>
    <P>The development of money incomes was contrary to the national interest and to the real interests of all at work.  Between 1973 and 1975 nonagricultural money incomes increased by about 20 per cent a year on average while GNP in real terms stood still.  This indicates the problem that I have mentioned, that it is essential to examine this because in a number of cases it was the cause of putting people out of jobs and aggrevating the inflation situation. As a nation, we put up the money cost of producing goods, some of them by as much as 20 per cent a year, <Col N="1066" /> but continued to produce the same quantity.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that external influences had been responsible for a large part of the increase in prices.  We have been responsible to a degree and it is important to examine to what indigenous influences have pushed up prices or caused them to increase. In the first eight months of this year import prices went up by only 13 per cent but the consumer price index rose by 17 per cent.  This substantial difference was due to higher costs here for which we ourselves are responsible. We cannot, as has been repeatedly said in this debate and as has been stressed in a number of reports, continue to pay ourselves as a nation more for producing the same quantity of goods.</P>
    <P>We must also now pay the bills we incurred in earlier years to maintain the level of employment at a higher level than it would otherwise have been and to offset the effects of the recession and the consequential effects of the increase in oil prices to which I have referred.  This high level of public expenditure to meet commitments like the debt service we incurred in the bad years is now at a level at which it creates problems in two areas which affect the economy &mdash;incomes policy and public finance, both of which are central to the discussions we have had here during the past few days.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate some Deputies suggested that we should engage in more extensive discussions with the social partners.  I have a list of the occasions on which we had discussions between February, 1974 and May of this year, and some additions have been made to it since. Between the economic Ministers and myself and the different bodies represented, the ICTU, the IEC, CII, IFA, ICMSA, NESC, there was a series of 22 meetings.  I do not believe any Government in the history of the State ever consulted as regularly, as consistenly or in such detail and with such an anxiety to secure a consensus as the Ministers or the representatives of the Government did with the social partners.  We have probably <Col N="1067" /> spent more time than any Government in consultations and setting out the economic circumstances of the country and the financial position as we saw it.  The easy phrase that comes to everyone is that the Government must give a lead or the Government must do this or must do that.  Nobody suggests what the means are or how they can be put into practice.  If one were to listen carefully to what Deputy Colley said, he invited the Government to get into a state of confrontation with large-scale important interests in the community.  We do not believe in that approach.  We believe in consultation with the social partners, either jointly or separately as may be required, in order to get a consensus on the policy which we believe is in the interests of the community.</P>
    <P>A number of references have been made to the need to get an understanding of this.  We have taken this line because we believe that every section of the community is responsible enough to see that its advantage lies ultimately in national prosperity and in common accord and the means by how this can be achieved.  The latest of these developments which have been referred to repeatedly during the course of this debate led to the tripartite talks arising out of clause 22 of the interim national agreement.  That provides for the holding of discussions on economic and social strategy for the next two years and involves a conference which would discuss the availability of resources, employment, welfare, prices, public revenue and expenditure and all forms of income.</P>
    <P>There is a vital need to bring the terms of national agreements more closely into line with the true interests of our people, particularly our young people and, indeed, the country generally.  In the recent tripartite discussions the Government side have taken an active role in trying to quicken economic recovery.  We put forward certain proposals for reductions in taxation and increases in expenditure to promote employment. These proposals would have meant lower costs and prices and increases <Col N="1068" /> in take-home pay for all workers irrespective of the ability of firms to pay. They would have provided jobs for thousands now without them.  I want to emphasise this.  The proposals were conditional on a stay on further pay increases in 1977.  Those in receipt of payments under national agreements will, of course, see their incomes rise by about 4 per cent next year.  I want to emphasise now that if income increases in prospect in 1977 are excessive the Government will have no option but to resort to countervailing taxation and will be unable to provide the capital to reduce unemployment to the extent that we would wish.  Much as we would deplore this course, we could not contemplate&mdash; and the economy could not tolerate&mdash; the additional inflation and unemployment which excessive income increases would generate.  At the same time I should say that, while the Government could not accept any proposal involving an increase in the total of their offer, they could agree to minor modifications within that total.  The point is that the farther away that proposals for incomes in 1977 move from the conditions of our offer, the less the Government can put on the table and the less will be achieved of the country's fundamental objectives of stabilising prices and increasing employment.</P>
    <P>It is recognised by all responsible commentators, as well as by those who have discussed it here, that inflation is the greatest obstacle to the achievement of these objectives.  It destroys the prospects of full employment by making the goods and services we produce non-competitive.  If things cannot be sold it is obvious that no one can be paid or employed to produce them.  The effects of inflation are as immediate and real as this.  It also has other less distinguishable consequences. With an inflation rate of 15-20 per cent who will invest in an industry or project for a return yielding less?  Without investment here there can be no jobs.  In fact, inflation at its present level is not only inhibiting investment, it is diverting its flow.</P>
    <P>For instance, why should anybody put money into the construction or <Col N="1069" /> re-equiping of a factory, workshop or hotel when he can get as good a rate of return by buying land or property and watching it appreciate in value more than it could ever appreciate if a similar investment was made in industry or services?  The flow of money towards land and assets drives up prices without any increase in total production.  I am not talking about investment in agriculture.  This type of investment is contrary to the best interests of the country.  It is in investment in productive capacity that lies our best hope.  Probably more than most others this country needs investment from abroad if we are to develop our full potential. But there is no attraction for an investor if the rapid inflation to which I have referred continues unabated.</P>
    <P>Inflation used to work in favour of the State as a borrower.  Now it does not.  Most of our borrowing is done in foreign currencies and the more our inflation gets out of line with that of other countries the more expensive it becomes for us to service the borrowing.  This is an important figure&mdash;every 1 per cent by which the £ depreciates adds approximately £9 million to the cost of servicing our existing debt. Inflation not only destroys the prospects for jobs but also the value of savings and of pensions.  While it continues there can be no security, not only for those in jobs but for those on fixed incomes.  Over time, it destroys the value of welfare payments which cannot be maintained except by continual revision.  It gives to those who have and takes away from those who have not.  It destroys, in a real sense, all the values on which society prospers.</P>
    <P>Those are the reasons why the proposals we made at the tripartite talks were based so much on the objective of reducing inflation and restoring stability to prices.  It cannot be done in the short term or without effort.  The longer we defer the effort the greater it will be, the more difficult the task and the greater the sacrifice needed in the end.  In many respects&mdash;and we have said this before&mdash;as a nation we will not be <Col N="1070" /> consulted on either the nature or extent of the sacrifices that will be imposed one us.</P>

      <P>This debate has involved references to a number of reports, including one commissioned by the Bank of Ireland for the purpose of educating and informing the public and interested parties such as the social partners.  Reports of this sort are useful as a contribution towards a better understanding of the situation.  Indeed the bank interests themselves might benefit from such a process.</P>
      <P>I have listened with care to this debate.  A number of things struck me about it&mdash;the way in which Deputies quoted commentaries and reports. Indeed the media or the press, in fact almost anyone who wished to say so has commented on what is happening, and all agree on what is wrong. They say unemployment is too high; we agree.  They say inflation is excessive; we agree.  They say the rates of economic growth are not as high as they should be; we agree.  But, having said that, the difficulty arises in agreeing on what is right.  Everybody can point to the duty which devolves on the other fellow.  Unions will say that employers should do this; farmers say what urban people should do; and urban people will say where a farmer's duty lies; employers urge certain courses, maybe on the unions.  The Opposition see no contradiction in voicing all of these together no matter how irreconcilable they are.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 96 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of training facilities is a matter for the council of AnCO whose responsibility in the matter is enshrined in the Industrial Training Act.  I am informed by AnCO that it does not see the need for increasing the training capacity in Ballina and that it is not its intention, therefore, to establish a larger centre in the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>AnCO is currently investigating <Col N="977" /> how best to improve the training centre in Ballina, but no final decision has yet been taken on how this improvement will be effected. The views of the deputation which I met recently have been communicated to AnCO and will be taken into consideration by AnCO in reaching a decision in the matter.</P>

      <P>The scheme of painting grants was discontinued as from 31st December, 1974, on the introduction of the new scheme of capitation grants towards the operating costs of national schools.  Grants under the former scheme would normally be payable only in respect of cases in which the work could be certified as having been satisfactorily completed before 31st December, 1974.</P>
      <P>In the case of the school mentioned by the Deputy, an application for a painting grant was received in August, 1975, in respect of work completed in March, 1975.</P>
      <P>This application together with some similar ones is under consideration with a view to seeing whether payment can now be authorised as an exceptional matter.</P>
      <P>Grants have, of course, been paid in respect of this school under the new scheme with effect as from 1st January, 1975.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if the views of the parents were obtained prior to the decision to close Altymachugh national school, Foxford, County Mayo; and if adequate transport will be provided for all children including those from the catchment of Dereen national school which was closed some years ago.</P>

      <P>There was a meeting with the Altymachugh parents in September, 1975, which was attended by the district inspector of national schools, and it was decided after that meeting, in deference to the wishes of the parents, to postpone for one year the proposed amalgamation of the school with the schools in Foxford.  This was done on the understanding that amalgamation would then be implemented if Altymachugh school were to decline in status to a one-teacher school in the meantime.  Altymachugh school became a one-teacher school on 20th October, 1975, and the amalgamation is now, therefore, being put into effect. Adequate transport facilities are being provided for all the children concerned, including those in the Dereen closed school area.</P>
