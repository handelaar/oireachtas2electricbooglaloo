      <P>We had an interesting discussion yesterday on Second Stage and when I came to reply some time after 1.15 p.m. I did not close my contribution.  I want to take the opportunity to do so this morning.  I understand I have about five minutes in which to reply to yesterday's debate.  Obviously, it would be difficult to answer all the questions and reply to the points raised on both sides of the House and I shall not attempt to do so now.  I hope to have a better opportunity to do so on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>One of the provisions I shall be introducing on Committee Stage is a provision similar to that included in the Anti-Discrimination (Unfair Dismissals) Bill, 1976 now before the House at Committee Stage.  One of the features of that Bill is that a person who proves unfair dismissal may opt for either compensation or the retaining of his or her job.  I propose to make a similar provision in this Bill in the case of the dismissal of a person who pursues a claim for equal treatment. I propose to give such a person the same option as in the other legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income and Capital Gains) (United Kingdom) Order, 1976,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid on the table of Dáil Éireann on 15th day of November, 1976.</P>
      <P>The present convention was signed on behalf of the respective Governments on 2nd June last.  A protocol to the convention was signed on 28th October. White Papers containing the texts of both the convention and the protocol have been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Copies of the draft order containing the text of the new convention and the protocol were laid before Dáil Éireann on 15th November.</P>
      <P>Section 361 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 provides that an arrangement entered into with a foreign Government to afford relief from double taxation shall have the force of law here if the Government makes an order accordingly.  Before such an order can be made, a draft of the order must be laid before Dáil Éireann and a resolution passed approving it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> Deputies will find the text of the convention and the protocol scheduled to the draft order now before the House.  A separate memorandum has also been circulated with the draft order explaining the effect of the provisions.</P>
    <P>The convention and the protocol set out revised arrangements for the avoidance of double taxation on profits, income and capital gains between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The new procedures are to supersede all the existing agreements between the two countries which date back to 1926 for income tax and to 1949 for company taxes.  The convention follows the general principles of the model convention prepared by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a body of which both States are members.</P>
    <P>These earlier agreements do not reflect the recent changes made in the fiscal laws of the two States and also those in the international field since they were concluded.</P>
    <P>The convention and the protocol continue certain exemptions from income tax by confining the charge to tax to the country of residence, as in the Residence Agreement of 1926, but otherwise provide for relief from double taxation by means of a tax credit for foreign tax.  The treatment is in line with the double taxation agreements which Ireland has with other countries.</P>
    <P>I will now briefly outline the main features of the new convention and the protocol with particular reference to those provisions which involve changes in existing procedures.</P>
    <P>The existing rules in regard to residence under domestic law will continue to be applied in the two countries to determine residence for tax purposes.  Where, however, residence in both States is established under this procedure, a series of tests has been introduced in accordance with the OECD fiscal domicile article, which will result in the allocation of residence to one of the States, thus eliminating the present double resident concept.  The residence of a company will, however, continue to be determined by the place of its effective management and control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1217" /> Income from immovable property is to be taxable in the country in which the property is situated, irrespective of residence considerations (Article 7).  Likewise, capital gains from the alienation of immovable property and certain related movable property of a &ldquo;permanent establishment&rdquo; of an enterprise may also be taxed in the country where the capital gains arise (Article 14).  Charities and tax-exempt pension funds will be allowed full exemption from tax on income and capital gains from immovable property in the two countries. These exemptions were not provided for in the convention as signed on 2nd June, but following consideration of the results which could follow any change in the existing tax exempt position of income from property owned by United Kingdom pension funds with income from Irish properties, I decided that an approach should be made to the United Kingdom authorities to seek reciprocal exemption from tax on rents arising to approved pension funds and charities of both countries.  The Irish representations were accepted by the United Kingdom authorities and the exemption, which also extends to capital gains receivable by those bodies from the alienation of immovable property, has been included in the protocol to the convention signed on 28th October.</P>
    <P>Under the previous arrangements, the income tax charge on profits arising from a branch or a permanent establishment in one country of a company resident in the other country was confined to the country of residence of the company.  The revised proposals secure that profits of a branch or permanent establishment of a company resident in the other country will be liable to corporation tax in both countries.  The country of residence will, however, allow a tax credit against its own tax charge on the same profits to relieve any double taxation arising.  This procedure follows generally the treatment of profits under the 1949 Agreement (as amended) between Ireland and the United Kingdom relating to corporation profits tax in Ireland and profits <Col N="1218" /> tax and corporation tax in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>In regard to dividends, the new provisions alter substantially the previous position under the residence agreement. In the case of portfolio investments, they provide for payment of the full tax credit relating to the dividend in place of the existing residence exemption, subject, however, to a withholding tax not exceeding 15 per cent of the aggregate of the dividend and the tax credit.  The tax withheld will be available as a credit against the recipient's tax liability in his country of residence.  Irish charities and approved superannuation funds will effectively be in a similar financial position under the new as under the current arrangements.  In future they will be paid the full United Kingdom tax credit but will be free from withholding tax.</P>
    <P>An individual taxpayer who is a resident of one State and who receives dividend income from the other State and whose total income from all sources is less than the aggregate of the personal reliefs available in the source State of the dividend income will be entitled to reclaim the withholding tax in full.  Marginal relief against the tax withheld may also be available where the total income would attract a liability to tax in the country of source, depending on personal circumstances.</P>
    <P>A direct investor (that is, where a company holds, directly or indirectly, 10 per cent or more of the voting power in the company paying the dividend) will not be paid the tax credit on dividends arising on investments in the other State.  The country of residence will, however, allow a credit for the tax borne in the source country.</P>
    <P>There is no change proposed in the existing treatment of income from interest and copyright royalties.  The charge to tax on income will be confined to the country of residence.</P>
    <P>In future, income from employments will be taxable in the country of residence and in the other country also if the employment is exercised in that other country.  Any relief due for double taxation will be given by the country of residence.  This position will <Col N="1219" /> apply from 6th April, 1977 and the existing exemption available under the residence agreement to non-residents will continue for the year 1976-77. Pensions from private sources will continue to be taxable only in the country of residence.</P>
    <P>There are special provisions relating to income from employments and pensions receivable from governmental or local authority sources, which change the existing rules of allowing exemption to non-residents.  From 6th April, 1977 onwards, such income will, normally, be taxable only by the paying State.</P>
    <P>Article 25 of the draft Convention follows the lines of the corresponding article in the OECD Model Convention. It provides for the exchange of information where it is material for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the convention.  There are similar articles in all Ireland's double taxation agreements, with Switzerland as the only exception.  The new provision would not enable the revenue authorities of one State to seek information from the other revenue authorities which cannot be looked for under the laws or administrative practices of the latter State.</P>
    <P>The convention provides that it is to enter into force on the exchange of notes confirming that the necessary steps have been taken to give it the force of law in the two countries.  It will then have effect from 6th April, 1976, except in relation to income from emoluments and Government and local authority pensions, when it will apply from 6th April, 1977.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the new convention brings our double taxation arrangements with the United Kingdom into line with our arrangements with other countries and with international practice generally.</P>
    <P>I recommend that Dáil Éireann approve the draft order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain comments I want to make on this under the various headings but there is one major issue which I will deal with at the end of my remarks, as the Minister has, in fact, left it to almost <Col N="1220" /> the end of his remarks.  That is the question of exchange of information under Article 25.  It is of some interest to note the taxes that are covered in this convention and to note the omissions.  One significant omission is the wealth tax.  There is, of course, no wealth tax in Britain.  Proposals for it have been dropped by the British Labour Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Australian Labour Government dropped it too.  It is worth pondering on the fact that this country in its present economic state nevertheless finds it necessary and desirable to impose a wealth tax.</P>
      <P>The situation in regard to the taxes covered raises certain questions.  For instance, why do we find that corporation profits tax is dealt with in Article 2 (a) (ii) as one of the taxes covered by the convention in Ireland?  Corporation profits tax is so mentioned but if we refer to Article 28 dealing with the entry into force of the convention with different dates for different taxes there does not appear to be a reference to corporation profits tax.  On the face of it the convention is said to cover corporation profits tax in Ireland but there is no provision for its entry into force in relation to this tax.  Perhaps the Minister would explain this.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in Article 28 we find it is proposed that the convention would enter into force in Ireland as regards corporation tax for the financial year 1974 and subsequent financial years.  Perhaps the Minister would explain why that is so and relate it to what he said in his speech when he stated that the convention would have effect from 6th April, 1976, except in relation to income from emoluments and Government and local authority pensions when it would apply from 6th April, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the Minister to the provisions of Article 10 related to associated enterprises.  Since the Minister has said that this convention is modelled on and contains the principal provisions of the OECD model and <Col N="1221" /> conforms generally with international practice, I wonder if the provisions of Article 10 were to be applied on a general basis between various countries, particularly developed countries, it might not ensure a proper system of taxation in relation to multinational companies?  I know this is an old chestnut but one should pay some attention to the possibility whereby this could be tackled with a degree of international co-operation. It may be that the definition in relation to associated enterprises could assist in this matter.</P>
    <P>In the case of the provisions relating to dividends, the Minister referred to portfolio investors as distinct from individuals and this is also mentioned in the explanatory memorandum. Perhaps the Minister would indicate where in the text this distinction is made and, in particular, the reference in the text which is deemed to be a reference to portfolio investors.</P>
    <P>While I understand that the provisions in regard to dividends have to be made in the way set out, it should be understood that there are problems arising with regard to this matter.  In the case of an Irish resident if the Irish rate of tax for which he is liable, that is the effective rate, is less than 15 per cent because of personal allowances, the credit available is reduced accordingly with the result that there will be some unrelieved British tax.  It has probably been pointed out to the Minister&mdash;if it has not I am doing so now&mdash;that an adverse feature of what is in effect a new part credit system being introduced in relation to dividends is the real loss to certain shareholders in British companies.  I am speaking solely of shareholders resident in this country.  That kind of loss will arise where advantage cannot be taken of any of the 15 per cent UK credit by reason of there being no Irish liability or insufficient liability with which to offset it.  I would draw the attention of the Minister to the situation of an Irish company which is not liable to tax here because of losses or capital allowances.  It appears such a company would be unable to <Col N="1222" /> take advantage of the UK tax credit. It should be understood by those concerned that there are possibilities of individuals or companies being in the position of being unable to obtain full tax credit as envisaged in this convention.</P>
    <P>It appears that one can find as a result of the implementation of this system, which admittedly has certain advantages, that there will be a considerably greater volume of administrative work with increased costs as a result particularly with regard to dividends.  Irish shareholders will be adversely affected in some cases because they will not be able to get the full credit to which they would otherwise be entitled and even if they are the cash flow will be affected.  We should recognise that there are these adverse features in what is a new system.</P>
    <P>The major matter to which I wish to refer relates to Article 25 and the question of the exchange of information between the two countries which, in effect, means between the Revenue Commissioners of the two countries. There is a widespread fear that the consequences of this article will be a very large outflow of money from this country and there is considerable evidence that a substantial outflow has taken place already as a result of this.  As I see it, the wording of Article 25 permits, authorises or even envisages the exchange of information between the two sets of Revenue Commissioners in relation to taxpayers within their own jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain the Minister has received representation in relation to the matter.  I am sure that is why he made the reference to it in his speech. He stated:</P>
    <P>The new provision would not enable the Revenue authority of one State to seek information from the other Revenue authorities which cannot be looked for under the laws or administrative practices of the latter State.</P>
    <P>Surely that it no saver?  After all, what can be looked for under the laws or administrative practices of this State as between the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1223" /> and the taxpayer is one matter but the disclosure of that information to the British Revenue Commissioners is quite another matter.  We should be realistic about this.  The fact is that there are very many people resident in Britain, many of them of Irish birth, who have invested substantial sums of money in this country.  I do not want to put a tooth in it.  In many cases the British Revenue are unaware of the existence of those investments.</P>
    <P>Let me make it quite clear that it is no part of the duty of this House or of the Minister for Finance to protect the British Revenue as indeed it is no part of the British Revenue to protect the Irish Revenue.  The Minister is well aware that traditionally the courts in this country and, indeed, in Britain have refused point blank to enforce the revenue law of another country to the extent that where such an offence has been wrapped up and camouflaged as a criminal offence and extradition sought in respect of it the courts have consistently refused to order extradition or to enforce in any way the revenue laws of a foreign State.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable approach from the point of view of any State.  Our concern should be with the liability to our Exchequer not with the liability to any other Exchequer.  Therefore, if there is anything in Article 25 which would in any way cause our Revenue authorities to enforce or assist in enforcing British revenue law we should not accept it.  We should have regard to the consequences to this country. By its very nature it is almost impossible to get adequate details of the kind of money that is involved in this situation. It may be contended that it is a swings and roundabouts situation and that what we should lose on the money withdrawn from here we would gain on the money withdrawn from Britain and the North.  Information which has come to me indirectly from banking sources, who are probably in the best position to know, suggests that the flow of money of the kind we are talking about is in our favour by anything between three to one and five to one. If that is so we will stand to lose more <Col N="1224" /> than Britain under this arrangement by anything from three to one to five to one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister is inclined to approach the matter in the way he seems to be because it suggests, first of all, they he may not be aware of the damage already done or, secondly, if he is, he is inclined to blame mischief mongers, to quote himself.  Let us be realistic about this.  The Minister glossed over very neatly in his speech a basic fundamental error that was made in <Col N="1225" /> the negotiation of this convention by whoever was involved in it which had to be corrected by further negotiations and the addition of a protocol.  Since the Minister has said what he did we cannot ignore what happened, which is that when this convention was concluded we would be left in the position that we would be deprived of enormous investment in this country by British pension funds and superannuation funds. Great pressure and representation had to be brought to bear in order to get anything done about this.</P>
      <P>The net effect was that the agreement had to be renegotiated and a protocol added to the convention.  That situation does not inspire confidence in the Minister or in those who were directly involved in the negotiations that they knew precisely what they were doing or that we can take it they were aware of the possible consequences of Article 25.  I did not intend to put the matter quite so strongly but when it is suggested that the mischief is being created either on this side of the House or outside of it, or both, it is time we realised the mischief that was caused by that grave error that was involved in the negotiation of this convention, which has had to be corrected.  If that kind of error was made and if the basis for confidence in the manner in which this convention was negotiated is undermined in that way then we are entitled to ask very specifically to what extent was the risk involved in Article 25 contemplated and to what extent is the Minister simply trying to justify another possible error in the negotiations? The fact is whether or not the interpretation of Article 25 is such that it will result in disclosures many people already believe that this is so and as a consequence have taken their money out of this country.  My objective is to try to reassure such persons and to try to ensure that further money does not flow out of the country and, hopefully, that the money which has gone will be brought back again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to try to achieve this, I put down an amendment which was not acceptable for procedural reasons. <Col N="1226" /> It is not open to us to amend this motion.  We either have to accept it or reject it.  That is all the House can do. I should like to refer to the amendment because it makes clear what we were trying to achieve.  The amendment proposed to add to Article 25 a new paragraph as follows: In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 or 2 be construed so as to impose an obligation or confer a right on the competent authority of either contracting State to alter the practice or procedure relating to exchange of information in force on the 1st day of June, 1976.</P>
    <P>In other words, what we wanted to establish was that there would be no change whatever in the practice and the procedure heretofore followed by the Revenue authorities of both countries.  I know the amount of disclosure which is permissible by law, and which has been permissible by law in the past, is considerably greater than the amount of disclosure which took place in practice.  The assurance I was seeking, and the only assurance, in my view, which will make certain that no further money flows out of the country and hopefully may cause money which has flown out to come back, is that there will be no change whatever in the practice, the procedure, the manner and the circumstances in which disclosure between the two Revenue authorities in this country and Britain has been conducted heretofore.</P>
    <P>I want to urge the Minister to put on the record of the House a clear and unambiguous undertaking that there will be no change whatsoever in the practice and the procedure adopted by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to disclosure of matters concerning the financial and fiscal affairs of any tax payer to the British revenue.  I would have preferred, of course, to have it spelled out and written into this agreement but, since that is not possible, the only thing in my view which will successfully ensure that there is no further doubt is a specific and unambiguous undertaking of the kind I have mentioned on the record of this House.  I cannot guarantee that such an undertaking will repair <Col N="1227" /> the damage done, but it would appear it is the best we can do in the circumstances, and certainly the best we can do from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I should not like anyone either to underestimate the importance of this matter or to imagine it is only the concern of people many of whom, though not all, are, perhaps, evading their tax liability in Britain.  The real concern is not with those people at all but with the effect on our economy of the withdrawal of the funds concerned. Those funds are invested in a very wide variety of avenues.  The most obvious area is, of course, the banks, but there are many other areas.  The building societies are certainly the recipients of substantial sums of this kind.  There are many other areas of great importance to our economy.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that our real concern is to ensure that damage will not be caused to our economy, or to the banks, or to the building societies, or to any other sector of our economy as a result of a lack of thought in the terms agreed on in this convention.  I repeat that our concern is highlighted and heightened by the lack of thought shown in regard to the provisions originally agreed to concerning investment in this country by pension funds, charities, and so on, with the appalling consequences which are likely to flow from that, which were eventually recognised by the Minister and eventually something was done about them, but only after a great deal of agitation and pressure.</P>
    <P>So far as we can, we want to ensure that the mistake made there is not repeated in Article 25 and, in any event, whatever the correct interpretation of Article 25 and whatever the correct interpretation of the income tax Act, 1967, that there will be a clear, unambiguous and incontrovertible statement on the record of this House that there will be no change in the circumstances in which disclosure will be made between the Irish and the British Revenues from what operated heretofore up to 1st June of this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be ill-advised if he were to follow the line he has half embarked on of trying to talk about mischief makers.  He should recognise <Col N="1228" /> where the trouble occurred, and why it occurred.  His efforts ought to be directed, in so far as he can do anything about it, to closing that gap, to ensuring that the persons concerned are under no misapprehension whatever and to reassuring them that there will be no change in the procedure. In my view, that task rests on the shoulders of the Minister in the interests of our economy.  I trust that when he is replying to this debate the Minister will discharge that obligation so far as he can.  It is the most important aspect arising in regard to the motion before the House.  Unless we get the kind of assurance I have mentioned on the record of this House, grave damage will have been caused to our economy and will be caused in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Colley has said in relation to Article 25 of this convention.  I will not say I am not concerned with the rest of it but the rest of it is somewhat beyond me in many respects and does not create major problems for the community. Article 25 does in spite of what the Minister for Finance has said.  Since July of this year approximately ten people&mdash;without having counted them accurately&mdash;have come to me to know what was in this Bill, as they describe it, coming before the Dáil to catch English money here and Irish money in the North and in England.  I said: &ldquo;There is no such Bill that I know of&rdquo;.  I was assured there was and when I made inquiries I discovered that in June a double taxation convention had been signed. It was published some time later.  All I could see in it that related to the topic worrying a very large number of people was Article 25.  I discovered in October that it had not come before the House.  I then discovered at the end of October that a further major protocol was entered into between the Irish and British Governments because a fundamental and serious error had been made by those who negotiated on the Irish side in the original convention signed in June, a fundamental and serious error which would have cost this country tens of millions of pounds. Because they and they alone made that <Col N="1229" /> mistake this country stood to lose tens of millions of pounds.  On the 28th of October last they had to go back with their tails between their legs and ask the British Government, for God's sake, to sign an amending protocol to cover the error made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley has suggested&mdash;and is entitled to suggest&mdash;that, perhaps, an equally serious and fundamental error was made in Article 25 of the original convention of June, equally serious to the terrible mess made in relation to charities and other tax exempt institutions.</P>
      <P>The obligation is on the Minister for Finance and those who negotiated these protocols to prove to the satisfaction of this House and to the country, at present in great doubt about this matter, that no such error was made in Article 25, to prove beyond doubt that the traditional protection the ordinary citizen has had from the extra-territorial application of another State's revenue laws will be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even within the past 12 months there have been cases brought by the citizens of the United Kingdom before our High Court when extradition orders were made against them in which they claimed that what they were allegedly extradited for were not criminal offences in the accepted sense of the words but were in fact revenue offences dressed up for the purpose of seeking extradition from this country.  It was well known by the British Revenue authorities that if they went about the matter in a straightforward way and sought to extradite someone for a revenue offence that would not be enforced by the courts of this country.  On investigation, our High Court, on a number of occasions in recent years, has examined in some detail the alleged offence which was the subject of the extradition application and satisfied itself that there was at least an element or colour of an effort to enforce revenue law and accountability. And because there was an element or colour of that in it, they decided that such persons should not be extradited to Britain for fear there would be any attempt on the part of our courts or authorities to enforce <Col N="1230" /> British revenue law.  I refer to that fact, as Deputy Colley has already referred to it, to show that it has always been the tradition in this and other civilised states that we will not seek to enforce one another's revenue laws and very properly so.  We had discussions lasting months in this House about the propriety or otherwise of trying to enforce extradition for political or allegedly political offences.  We saw the unhappy and useless compromise the Government arrived at and put before this House, ultimately passed by this House six months ago, and which has never been used on a single occasion since.</P>
    <P>Because of the huge volume of representations I have about Article 25 I deeply suspect that there is something similar afoot on this occasion. I might add that some of the huge volume of representations being made to Members of this House, and no doubt to the Minister, are not just from simple, ordinary citizens who, like myself might be excused for having difficulty in interpreting some parts of this convention but from accountants.  In some cases at least those accountants are advising their clients that the old exemption for British money here or Irish money over there seems to be at an end. That is the advice being given by financial advisers to individual taxpayers on both sides of the Irish Sea. As Deputy Colley has said, if this practice of many years standing is to come to an end, this country will be the losers in the proportion of approximately four to one because there is four times as much British and Northern money here as there is Twenty-six Counties money in Britain and in the North.</P>
    <P>That British and Northern Ireland money which has been here traditionally has been of tremendous benefit to our economy.  At a time, unlike the present, when people were prepared to borrow money for productive purposes, the availability of that money to our banking system, building societies and so on was a great boon to us because it constituted a capital inflow of tremendous benefit.  For every miserable £ that we get back from England or the North now we lose £4.  I wonder even <Col N="1231" /> how many of those £s we will get back. I have seen, and I understand my experience is shared by others, the panic caused from the summer onwards by the interpretation accountants have put on this proposal, the panic already has caused a tremendous flurry of activity in the two markets related to this money.  I met somebody who went to Belfast for his money and foolishly brought it back in large denomination notes.  I am told that quite a number of people have come from Britain in similar circumstances, withdrawn their money from here, bringing it back with them, as they are free to do, in large denomination notes.  The amounts involved in some of those transactions were not very large, perhaps in the region of £10,000, £12,000 or £15,000. They are serious enough when they accumulate.  The ones that are really serious are those where there is, perhaps, £100,000 or £200,000 involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that in the past three months or so there has been this panic as a result of Article 25 of this convention.  Instead of availing of an earlier opportunity, or even this one, to make a statement about the matter, he leaves Article 25, which is the one causing all the trouble to the very end of his short speech today and devotes merely one paragraph to it.  That paragraph to say the least of it is ambiguous.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's duty to spell out at greater length and in greater detail what the net effect of Article 25 is in relation to money held in either of these two jurisdictions by people who are resident in the other jurisdiction. The Minister referring to Article 25 in his speech today said that &ldquo;it provides for exchange of information where it is material for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the convention&rdquo;. I would take that to mean that it is material only where tax is actually being paid and where relief from double taxation becomes necessary. I ask the Minister to confirm that that sentence means that where tax is not being paid and is not payable at present, because either the Irish citizen is not resident in the United Kingdom jurisdicton or the United Kingdom citizen is not resident in the <Col N="1232" /> Irish jurisdiction where his money is, that tax is not payable and for that reason it is not material for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the convention and it is therefore not necessary to use the powers in Article 25 to exchange information.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept some further ambiguity or further effort to slide over this matter from the Minister. This will have to be spelled out precisely and in detail in this House, if further damage and further mischief of the kind the Minister has done by not making any comment on this article until today is to be avoided. The Minister also said &ldquo;the new provision would not enable the revenue authorities of one State to seek information from the other revenue authorities which cannot be looked for under the laws or administrative practices of the latter State&rdquo;.  That sentence needs to be further analysed. It appears to me to presuppose that exactly the same provisions in relation to this or other similar provisions apply both in the United Kingdom and in Ireland, that the relevant provision here is section 175 (4), that there is a similar provision in Britain and that neither of the revenues will seek to change the practice that exists under section 175 (4).  That will have to be spelled out by the Minister.  Why it should be necessary to try to drag these assurances from the Minister I do not know, particularly as very considerable damage has been done already which can be measured probably in terms of millions of pounds, and this is the last opportunity that the Minister has to stop this damage getting very much worse by reassuring people who are very frightened and very amazed at what they read in Article 25.</P>
    <P>In order that people will not be misled into thinking that this is a storm in a teacup and that the ordinary citizen should not think that there is something frightening about it, I will refer briefly to Article 25. The first paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for the carrying out of this Convention and of the domestic laws of <Col N="1233" /> the Contracting States concerning taxes covered by this Convention insofar as the taxation thereunder is in accordance with this Convention. Any information so exchanged shall be treated as secret and shall not be disclosed to any persons other than persons (including a Court or administrative body) concerned with the assessment or collection of, or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes which are the subject of the Convention.</P>
    <P>That second sentence means that the information shall be treated as secret and shall not be disclosed to anyone except a court dealing with the case or persons concerned in the assessment, collection or prosecution in respect of or determination of appeals in relation to the taxes, in other words, the Revenue Commissioners.  It will be kept secret from everyone except the Revenue Commissioners and the relevant court.  There is not much point in providing that it will be secret when the only people that one would not want to know about it are the Revenue Commissioners.  It is little wonder in these circumstances that people are frightened and that there has been a serious reaction over the past number of months that the Minister for Finance must have been made aware of, and has steadfastly refused to do anything to prevent that reaction leading to a serious outflow of money from here.  The Minister used two sentences today which are veiled and which need to be spelled out in far greater detail.  Our attitude to this agreement and to the motion to approve of it will be determined entirely by what the Minister will say in his reply which is something that we will listen to with great interest.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The law of this land as introduced by Fianna Fáil when they were in Government, are the Finance Acts of 1963 and 1965 and confirmed in the Income Tax Act, 1967, section 175 (4). This remains the law of the land and it is not affected by this convention. Section 175 gives the Revenue Commissioners the right to obtain information about payments which are made or credited without deduction of tax.  It enables the Revenue Commissioners to obtain from any person carrying on the trade or business of banking information about interest paid or credited without deduction of tax.  The exception in respect of that right of the Revenue Commissioners is contained in subsection (4), undoubtedly for the reasons which Deputy Colley and Deputy O'Malley have advanced, because it would not be desirable that deposits in this country belonging to persons in other countries should flow out of this country because of the use of section 175 which is intended for the benefit of the Irish revenue.  Subsection (4) provides that where the person who was beneficially entitled to the interest was not ordinarily resident in the <Col N="1235" /> State, the person paying or crediting the interest, at the request of the person beneficially entitled to the interest, is not required to include the interest in any returns to the Revenue Commissioners. Any person who has received advice from any quarter, be it bank, accountant or lawyer, to the effect that the adoption of this convention will change this position would be well advised to change his source of advice because there is no basis in law or in fact or in any reasonable interpretation of the laws either of this country or of Britain or of the convention to justify malicious scare-mongering of that kind.</P>
    <P>The convention between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the UK is the standard model of the OECD of which Ireland is a member.  That membership confers certain obligations and for this country to seek to derogate from those obligations would be tantamount to advertising Ireland as an unhealthy tax haven.  While that might lead certain speculators to pump hot money into this country for the purpose of monetary gain, it is not at all certain that at the end of the day Ireland would benefit materially from that sort of situation.</P>
    <P>The necessity to revise the double taxation arrangements between Ireland and Britain arose when the British introduced the imputation system in 1973.  Since then it has been necessary for us to extend, with the agreement of the British authorities, the existing arrangements, adapting them in the best way possible pending the introduction by us of the Corporation Tax Act. Once that Act went through and once our Capital Gains Tax Act was on the Statute Book it was time to negotiate the new convention in detail.  All persons skilled and experienced in tax matters have known for several years that this convention was about to be renegotiated.  What is interesting is that while various matters were put forward in representations to the Department of Finance and to the Revenue Commissioners, representations were not received on the question of rents from properties in Ireland and <Col N="1236" /> accruing to charities or to pension funds in Britain until after the convention was negotiated in June last. Further studies of the matter disclosed a position which would not be favourable to the Irish economy and to investment here and which, also, would be unfair to British pension trusts which were investing money here.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that the British authorities were well disposed to adjusting the convention in Ireland's interests.  In this regard I wish to place on record my appreciation of the speed with which this highly technical matter was renegotiated.  We are now in the position of being able to complete these very intricate and involved renegotiations in our efforts to ensure that people in Ireland who have invested money in Britain and <i>vice versa</i> are not taxed doubly.</P>
    <P>Listening to the remarks of the Opposition one would suspect that new onerous obligations were being imposed by reason of the convention whereas the position is that the renegotiated convention will operate to the relief of taxpayers by ensuring that they are not caught in a system of double taxation.  That is the whole purpose of having these double taxation agreements.  There is hardly any reasonable person who believes that an agreement negotiated first in 1926 is entirely relevant to the circumstances of 1976 particularly as there have been a number of differences in the fiscal laws of both countries in the meantime. Deputy Colley asked why the question of wealth tax was not provided for in this convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask that. Rather, I commented on why it was not included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it was a query or a comment, I shall deal with it.  We are dealing here with the changes that have been necessitated by income and company tax laws and by capital gains tax.  Provision is made in section 361 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, for the renegotiation of the convention to take account of such matters.  Under section 361 there is no authority for the completion of a convention in respect of wealth tax. <Col N="1237" /> As the Deputy will recall, there is a separate provision in the Wealth Tax Act for such a convention.</P>
      <P>I would not share with the Deputies opposite the view that Ireland should not move on any fiscal matter until such time as Britain, Australia or some other country take steps in that area. The meaning of independence is that one takes decisions in the best interest of one's own country and does not wait until somebody else moves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have little patience with the attitude that nothing is orthodox or respectable for us until after the relevant provision has been made in Britain.  Ireland can be proud of the fact that among the common law countries she was the first to move in an area in which all sensible countries have moved since, that is, the area of wealth tax.  The Deputies opposite might like to justify their stand by arguing that we should not have abolished death duties until after they had been abolished in other places.  But we made that move ahead of others and as a result we have saved many families from having their property confiscated which was what happened under Fianna Fáil. That was the way they thought we should operate our laws.  Properties were confiscated unless people were wise enough and timely enough to receive advice from accountants, solicitors or other people who could point out that in fact death duties were a voluntary tax and paid only by people who were not wise enough to avoid them or who hated their relatives more than they hated the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <P>Deputy Colley asked where in the text is there a reference to portfolio investors.  There is no such reference as such but the phrase &ldquo;portfolio investors&rdquo; is a general description for persons holding less than ten per cent of the voting power in a company paying a dividend.  It was in that context that I used the phrase. Deputy Colley, too, commented on what he referred to as the adverse <Col N="1238" /> features of a credit system where advantage cannot be taken of the 15 per cent tax credit by reason of an insufficient Irish liability.  Individuals will be able to get tax credit in respect of the withholding tax. There is provision under Article 22 for relief in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that section 175 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which gives the Revenue Commissioners certain rights to information in respect of interest payments that are made without deduction of income tax and to interest paid or credited on bank accounts, does not entitle the commissioners to information in respect of interest on building society deposits. I wish to underline that in the hope that it will get as much attention from our friends in the Fourth Estate as they gave to the suggestion from Deputy O'Malley that deposits in building societies could be in some way caught by the operation of the convention or by existing legislation. Section 175 of the 1967 Act does not entitle the Revenue Commissioners to information in respect of deposits in building societies and that position is not affected in any way by this convention. I hope that the remarks of Deputies opposite are not related to the desire or practice of some people here to avoid or evade their liability for payment of Irish tax.</P>

      <P>No, but I suspect that some of those who approached the Deputy may have been people who have deposits outside this country for the purpose of evading tax.  Nothing should be said in this Parliament to provide comfort or encouragement to people who are engaged in the evasion of their Irish tax liability.  Certainly, we have no obligation to assist other revenue authorities in the collection of their tax; that is an acceptable international convention but all Deputies and all patriotic Irishmen have an obligation to ensure that every person in Ireland who is enjoying the benefits of the Irish community should contribute, as the law requires him to contribute, to the revenue of this <Col N="1239" /> country.  I am prepared to accept that Deputies opposite have no desire to assist people in the evasion of their Irish tax liability.</P>

      <P>I had in fact made a note to reply and I have it here. Under section 173 (1) of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976 the charge to Irish corporation tax on the branch profits of United Kingdom companies does not commence until 6th April 1976.  Accordingly, the profits of such companies chargeable to British corporation tax in the case of accounting periods stradling that date will include Irish profits which arose before that date and which were charged to corporation profits tax. It is therefore necessary to include in Article 2 (1) (a) a reference to corporation profits tax to ensure that credit for that tax will be given against British corporation tax chargeable to Irish profits which bore corporation profits tax.</P>

    <Title>Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1976: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1976.</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before the House on 16 June, 1976.</P>
      <P>The Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, defines the investments in which trustees may invest trust funds unless expressly forbidden by the instrument, if any, creating the trust.  Equally the trust deed may confer wider powers of investment but many trusts and analogous funds are restricted to the investments authorised under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance may vary the authorised investments by order. The draft order before the House for approval would add Allied Irish Banks Limited loan stock 1985 to the list of trustee authorised investments. This stock was issued in 1975 to raise additional capital to provide for the future growth of the bank.  It will be repayable at par on 1st August, 1985. In addition to interest at 10 per cent per annum, it carries the right to convert into shares of Allied Irish Banks Limited in any of the years 1977 to 1985.  The shares of the bank were granted trustee status in 1969 by the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1969 (S.I. No. 241 of 1969).  The new loan stock is quoted on the stock exchange and I am satisfied that it is suitable as regards both security and income for addition to the <Col N="1242" /> list of authorised trustee investments in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is obliged under the Act to consult with the following persons in regard to the terms of any order he proposes to make to vary the list of authorised investments&mdash;a judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice, the governor of the Central Bank, the Public Trustee, the chairman of the Irish Banks' Standing Committee, the president of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland and the president of the Stock Exchange&mdash;Irish.  I have consulted these persons and they have raised no objections to the proposed order.</P>
    <P>Under the Trustee (Authorised Investment) Act, 1958, &ldquo;securities guaranteed as to capital and interest by the Minister for Finance&rdquo; are included in the list of authorised trustee investments. The question has been raised in some quarters as to whether certain interest-bearing deposits which are guaranteed by me, as Minister for Finance, come within the scope of this definition.  In order to remove any doubt, therefore, I am advised that investment in interest-bearing deposit accounts with the Agricultural Credit Corporation Limited and with the Industrial Credit Company Limited should be specifically added to the authorised list.  I propose to do so by means of this order.</P>
    <P>As Deputies may be aware, I have been considering some further widening of the investment powers of trustees.  My Department have been engaged in consultation with the Irish Building Societies Association regarding the terms on which trustee status should be extended to building societies.  The Building Societies Bill will provide the necessary framework and I intend, as soon as possible after the enactment of the Bill, to bring a draft order before the House for approval.  The other main area where change is desirable concerns banks authorised under section 1 of the 1958 Act to accept trust funds on deposit. Since 1958 there has been a considerable increase in the number of banking institutions operating here and as a result of the 1971 Central Bank Act, <Col N="1243" /> there is now in force a comprehensive system of bank licensing and supervision conducted by the Central Bank.  I am satisfied that in principle the list of banks should be widened and my Department are examining the matter with the Central Bank.  I hope it will be possible to deal with the banks and the building societies together.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, I am satisfied that it is desirable that trustees should have power to invest trust funds in Allied Irish Banks loan stock 1985 and that it should be added to the list of authorised investments and also that interest-bearing deposits with the Agricultural Credit Corporation Limited and with the Industrial Credit Company Limited should be specifically added to that list.  I commend the motion for the approval of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House have no problem in agreeing to the addition of Allied Irish Banks loan stock 1985 to the list of authorised trustee investments.  The only thing I want to say in regard to what the Minister has said is to refer to his stated intention of widening the list of banks that would be involved as trustee investments and of bringing in an order in due course, perhaps, in conjunction with a similar order relating to building societies.  I welcome this and I trust that what the Minister has in mind is to ensure that there will be no discrimination in future between different institutions.  There are at the moment certain institutions which are on exactly the same basis as far as the Central Bank is concerned as regards licensing, the kind of business they carry on and so on, and some of them are on the list of authorised trustee investments and some are not. I take it that what the Minister has in mind is to put them all on the same footing.  If that is so I would certainly <Col N="1244" /> support it.  If it is not we will hear about it in due course.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister recalls what I am referring to.  I did have some correspondence with his Department in this connection, but I am not asking him to comment on it at the moment.  I am simply putting down a marker that this is a problem which for quite reputable banking institutions is considerable, not just because of the immediate consequences of being on the list, so to speak, but also because failure to be on the list when their competitors are on the list may suggest a certain lack of confidence in official quarters in these institutions, a lack of confidence which in fact does not exist.  I am merely putting down a marker in that regard and reminding the Minister of this problem, trusting that that is what he has in mind to remedy when he says he intends to bring in a further motion.  If that is not what he is doing I will be talking about it when the motion comes in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have liked to anticipate at this stage what specific organisations or institutions I would be adding to the list.  One has to ensure two things, first, total security and, secondly, an adequate return on the investment of the investor.  This means that you cannot give blanket approval to a description of institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem is likely to arise in relation to building societies.  What we will be doing in that connection is laying down criteria which will have to be met to qualify for trustee status.  It is highly desirable that all building societies would conform to the criteria which will be laid down.  If they do not they will not get trustee status and undoubtedly investors will then have to make their decision as to whether they wish to remain with a society which has not trustee status, which does not fulfil the criteria, or to transfer to a building society which has trustee status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trustee status is a guarantee that the State will meet any default if it <Col N="1245" /> should occur, and so it is something worth while in its own right and not something which should be lightly conferred because it imposes a risk on the State which the State would have to meet and to meet out of its own resources.  Those who enjoy trustee status have an important obligation that they have to fulfil both to their own investors and to the State.  I think we can, as ordinary, practical, pragmatic people of the world, knowing something possibly about commerce and financial matters generally, recognise that there are some financial institutions at present who do not enjoy trustee status and who are admirable and secure and do not give cause for any worry.  I will consider it appropriate that the people would have the widest possible choice of investments enjoying trustee status.  This will be the way in which we approach further consideration of this matter.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 (ten pounds) be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st December, 1976, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health including Oifig An Ard Chláraitheora), and certain services administered by that office, including grants to health boards miscellaneous grants and certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for £11,484,000, which was passed earlier, will increase Exchequer non-capital health expenditure to £253.967 million in 1976.  This compares with an Exchequer expenditure of £207.561 million in 1975 and represents an increase of 22.4 per cent over last year's out-turn.</P>
      <P>It will be seen from these figures that Exchequer non-capital expenditure on health care has increased faster than inflation in the present year.  This represents a significant achievement in our current economic circumstances.</P>
      <P>In introducing the main Estimate for the Department of Health earlier this year I said that my aim in 1976 was to maintain 1975 service levels.  I believe that this Supplementary Estimate will enable that objective to be substantially met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> Early this year, I explained to health agencies that the economic conditions facing the country made it essential to maintain very tight control over health expenditure in the current year.  I informed them that it would not be possible to continue the rapid growth in health services which had been achieved in earlier years and that a temporary period of belt-tightening was required.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that all of these agencies responded to my request. They have all undertaken close scrutiny of their expenditure patterns and they have all exercised economy in the use of the financial resources allocated to them.</P>
    <P>As a result of their efforts, we have come through the present difficult year with relatively few problems.  We have not, of course, been able to expand our health services as we would have wished in more favourable circumstances, but we have been able to maintain service levels substantially in line with my stated objective.</P>
    <P>The present Supplementary Estimate is accounted for mainly by additional costs which must be met by health agencies and which were not provided for in the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>These include increases in welfare allowances, in pensions, in social welfare contributions and, in pay under the national interim agreement and following awards made following decisions of the Labour Court.  In addition, provision is made in this Supplementary Estimate for increased services provided under the General Medical Services scheme and for unavoidable costs which accrued in a range of other health services, particularly residential services for the blind, the deaf and the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>In distributing the additional funds which will be available to my Department, my objective will be to direct additional resources as far as possible to those areas of our total services which have come under most pressure in the current year.  We will not, inevitably, be able to meet all requests for additional funds, but I am satisfied <Col N="1248" /> that we can alleviate the problem considerably and, in so doing, ensure the retention of our present high level of health service provision throughout the remainder of this year.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I made it clear to the House and to our health agencies early this year that 1976 would be a year of economy in health expenditure. I explained that this year health services would have to stand still to enable the Government to maximise their efforts in getting the economy back on the road to recovery.  That policy, which was the only rational one in the circumstances which faced the country, has been adhered to and is succeeding.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the year, however, I did detect some limited areas of our health services which clearly required additional resources to enable that policy to continue to be met.  For example, some residential institutions were clearly in difficulty and I am making more funds available to them as I have said.  In addition, it became clear towards the latter part of the year that, in a small number of isolated instances, temporary difficulties in the provision of chiropody services and the supply of spectacles for adults did occur.  Steps have now been taken to remedy these unforeseen difficulties and to resume services at normal levels.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Supplementary Estimate for £11,484,000, together with the original Estimate, will ensure that our health services are ready to move forward again as overall recovery takes place.  I am conscious that we have not been able to initiate any new developments in services in 1976, but I am pleased that we have been able to carry our health services intact and undamaged through what has been a year of profound crisis for our society in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this Supplementary Estimate by the Minister for Health at this stage represents a classic case of bad administration. It is a clear example of how not to conduct government business, of how not to administer a public service such as the health service.  The Minister, in pursuance of the usual practice, <Col N="1249" /> in the early part of the year introduced an Estimate for his Department.  Many of us pointed out to him, as clearly and as strongly as we could, that the allocations we were making were inadequate and would not enable the institutions concerned to get through the year and provide the level of services available in previous years.</P>
      <P>It was obvious to everybody at that stage that the provisions being made by the Minister were inadequate and the fact that he is now bringing in this Supplementary Estimate for approximately £12 million proves we were absolutely right in what we said to him at that time.  However, let us look at what has happened to the health services during the course of the year.</P>
      <P>There have been dislocations and cutbacks, some services have been terminated and others run down, all because of this unreal economy by the Minister who endeavoured to push it through, presumably at the request of the Minister for Finance.  It was obvious that the economies the Minister was attempting to impose on the various institutions would not succeed and they have not succeeded.  The Minister has now to come along and provide the money he should have in the original Estimate.  In the meantime, the time and energy of the health board executives and the hospital managements have been taken up with trying to do the impossible, trying to meet the stringent economies laid down by the Minister and at the same time carry on some level of service.</P>
      <P>On the 30th March last we were discussing the Health Contributions (Amendment) Bill, 1976 and as we came to the end of the Second Stage discussion I asked the Minister very specific questions.  I want to quote from the Official Report, Volume 289, No. 4, column 522 of the 30th March, 1976:</P>
      <P>Mr. Haughey: Before we take a decision on Second Stage I want to know from the Minister are the allocations made to the different Health Boards final and can they be increased under any circumstances.</P>
      <P>Mr. Corish: They are final.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> Mr. Haughey: Will they not be increased under any circumstances?</P>
    <P>Mr. Corish: They are final.</P>
    <P>On the 30th March, 1976 the Minister for Health indicated to the House clearly and categorically that those allocations would not be increased under any circumstances, that they were final and conclusive.  The unfortunate executives of health boards, the management of the hospitals and all the people throughout the health services at the different levels took that statement by the Minister at its face value.  They took his word and they proceeded to cause disruption and chaos throughout the administration of the health services.</P>
    <P>I want to go a little further and point out that at that time of the year also during the course of the same debate on the Health Contributions (Amendment) Bill on the 24th March, Volume 289, No. 2, columns 270 and 271 of the Official Report I said:</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for anyone outside the official establishment to quantify what additional amount is required to finance our health services this year.  From my own limited knowledge and using whatever information I can assemble, I believe that the regional health boards between them would require an extra £8 million this year if they are to maintain their services at a satisfactory and adequate level.</P>
    <P>Mr. Corish: Each health board.</P>
    <P>Mr. Haughey: No, between them. That is the calculation I made to the best of my ability.  I have taken them all together and put particular emphasis on the Eastern Health Board and have looked at the others and the difference between their budgets and what has been allocated to them.  I believe that the eight regional health boards between them would require an extra £8 million this year to provide adequate health services at the same level as existed during 1975.</P>
    <P>I believe that another £7 million to £8 million would be required for the voluntary hospitals and the general medical services payments <Col N="1251" /> board.  This means that in the region of £15 million would be required in the Estimate for the Department of Health to enable our health services to get through this year without serious disruption....</P>
    <P>I went on to say that it was difficult for somebody in my position to try to calculate exactly what the short-fall was but I gave that £15 million as my best estimate.  I further said:</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should try to get it across to the Government, where the ultimate decision in these matters lies, that that additional money must be provided by the Exchequer.  I also want to make it clear that it is not my responsibility to propose how those funds should be provided as I have not the details of budgetary policy and the different demands and pressures which would enable me to decide where that £15 million is to come from.  That is the responsibility of the Government.</P>
    <P>I want to submit that what I said at that time was as near to being accurate as it could possibly be.  We now have the Minister coming before us looking for an extra £12 million approximately.  I said in March that he should have added an extra £15 million.  I submit that the case I made at that time has been fully borne out by events.  If the Minister were to put the matter on a proper footing at this stage, he would probably make this Supplementary Estimate £15 million as I stipulated at that time.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in any event, is now looking for an extra £12 million.  Why did he put the general public, the health boards and all the people concerned to all this agony?  Why did he subject them to all this disruption throughout 1976 when everybody knew that sooner or later he would have to come along and make this money available.  It is a classic example of bad administration and a short-sighted approach to this crucially important aspect of Government administration.</P>
    <P>There is a further thing about this that we must take account of.  Will <Col N="1252" /> anybody ever again take the Minister for Health seriously when he comes along with a particular Estimate, puts it before the House, the institutions and the agencies and says: &ldquo;That is the allocation for this year&rdquo;?  He has done a very serious, far-reaching dis-service to the administration of the health services by the way he has carried on this year.  He came before the House and said: &ldquo;This is the allocation.  It is final.  Under no circumstances will anybody get any more money.&rdquo;  It could not have been more categoric.  Under tremendous pressure from this side and his own side of the House and from all round the country he stood fast and said: &ldquo;Under no circumstances will there be an extra penny granted.  You have got to live within these allocations.&rdquo; We now find that was all bluff, that it was some sort of exercise he was going through.  He is now making the money available in spite of those categoric statements he made.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in exposing that particular piece of deceit by the Minister but I am concerned about the lasting impression this conduct will have on the situation in future years.  When the Minister for Health comes to the Department and the Dáil and puts forward an Estimate and says: &ldquo;That is final, that is it for the year&rdquo; nobody will believe him.  The health boards will say that it is only an exercise and he has to go through this formality because the Minister for Finance is slashing all the Estimates.  They will tell people not to worry, to carry on as they are, to spend whatever they feel like spending, that the Minister will bring in a Supplementary Estimate at the end of the year and that everything will be all right.  That is a very unsatisfactory and unhappy situation to which the Minister is now committing us.  I suggest that by his behaviour in this regard this year he has seriously undermined the credibility and the future of the departmental Estimates process. The different bodies, the different institutions, the different individuals concerned in future will not take seriously the Estimates as put forward by the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not comment in detail&mdash;in fact he hardly commented <Col N="1253" /> at all&mdash;on what happened to the health services during 1976.  We all know what happened.  We know 1976 was a bad year for our health services. It was a year of confusion, a year of dislocation, a year of deterioration.  I do not think any sensible objective commentator could suggest there has not been a deterioration in the health services in every area during 1976.  A number of very important and very valuable services which were being brought along and built up over the past four, five or six years were suddenly set back, terminated or reduced in scope.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to say there was no development during 1976.  There certainly was no development, no improvement, no expansion in our health services.  More than that, because of the Minister's approach to the financing of the health service there has been a serious deterioration in many areas.  I would have thought the Minister, in introducing this Supplementary Estimate, would have commented in some way on how things developed during the course of the year.  Every Deputy knows the damage done in particular areas.  I suppose the hardest hit area was the area of community services.  The very valuable progress which was being made in the building up of these services received a very traumatic set back.</P>
    <P>Anybody engaged in social work knows the extent of the damage done. Meals on wheels, home help and a whole variety of these essential basic community services were seriously interfered with, cut down and emaciated. Quite a considerable amount of hardship was caused throughout the community as a result.  On a number of occasions we have discussed in this House the question of the school inspection scheme.  There again very serious disruption has been caused and very serious cutbacks inflicted by the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to over-emphasise the importance of that scheme.  Admittedly some of our medical men in the House argue cogently that they would prefer to see all the inspection and examination which need to be done, done before <Col N="1254" /> the child goes to school.  I suppose in an ideal society that is the way we would like things to be, that we should not have to wait until our children are at school before having this inspection carried out and having whatever defects or ailments exist identified. Whatever about that counsel of perfection, it is certainly essential at this stage that the school inspection scheme should be fully, completely and comprehensively administered every year.</P>
    <P>Apart from the health of the community and the happiness and welfare of the individuals concerned, it is good economics to detect ailments and defects at that stage so that the necessary corrective treatment can be applied.  Ultimately this must redound to the health of the community and to reducing the cost of the health services to that extent in the future. That is one area in particular which has been seriously affected by the approach of the Minister to the financing of the health services this year.  Everybody connected with the services knows there has been a deterioration in the administration of that scheme.  I suppose at this stage all one can do is urge that in the Estimate for the coming year the matter will be put right.  As I say, it is not just good welfare policy but also good sound national economics.</P>
    <P>The dental service is another area related to schools where the situation is appalling.  Every Deputy knows how bad things are and how long the waiting lists are.  It is an inadequate skeleton service at this point.  Whatever attempts were being made to improve matters down through the years were suddenly rudely set back this year and the situation is now worse than it ever was.  The same applies to ophthalmology.  I understand the waiting period for glasses for those who need them has lengthened very considerably, up to three months now and over three months in some cases.</P>
    <P>Another very false economy was the cutting out by many of the health boards of the transport service provided for patients who have to get to hospitals or clinics.  Again, every Deputy has first-hand knowledge of <Col N="1255" /> the hardship this caused throughout the community.  As we always do at these times, we heard a lot of scare-mongering stories about waste and inefficiency in the administration of this transport service.  There will always be some element of waste and inefficiency in the administration of any public service.  The brutal approach by the health boards, at the instigation of the Minister, to this transport service caused untold unnecessary hardship in those areas of our community where it should not be caused, and where we should go to any length to avoid causing hardship.</P>
    <P>Sometimes it is difficult not to become cynical about this sort of thing. One has the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Cluskey, coming in here lecturing us, talking of schemes to combat poverty, going through a whole rigmarole of pilot schemes to root out poverty and combat it.  Does this not all become a bit sickening when, on the other hand, we see the same person doing these sort of things to basic, humanitarian community services?  A mentally handicapped child living in a Dublin suburb or in a remote rural area is being deprived of transport to the clinic or hospital to receive the attention he needs. What is the point in talking hypocritically about combating poverty when we have this sort of thing?  Before we start on any textbook, pipedream type of activities, let us deal with the simple services we have available to the community.  Let us make the necessary finance available to ensure that they operate with a reasonable degree of efficiency and comprehensiveness.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to understand why the Minister for Health permitted himself to be walked into this type of situation this year.  I do not know who is at fault.  It is not fair to blame the Minister for Finance for everything; he has his job to do and is subject to various budgetary pressures. Naturally he endeavours to keep all the departmental Estimates as low as possible.  But the Minister for Health should not have accepted this situation. <Col N="1256" /> As we asked, he should have indicated to the Minister for Finance that this would not work, that this extra money was needed.  In my amateurish, outside way, with no access to any figures, I see that what was estimated at £15 million has turned out to be £12 million.  He should have told the Minister for Finance he would have to get the money at some point during the year. He did not and he must be held culpable for that.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this discussion to mention one or two matters of pressing importance in the present administration of the health services.  Admittedly these are difficult times from the point of view of financing all of our public services. Because of the serious mismanage-of our finances over the past four years the Government now find themselves in a position in which it is difficult to obtain the necessary resources for the most essential services amongst which, of course, health would rank as a top priority.  Nonetheless I want to draw the attention of the Minister to some matters which should be under consideration at present. Not all of them involve additional finance.  One I want to mention does&mdash;it is the question of the EMI scanner.  This matter was raised here on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister, or his Parliamentary Secretary, to give very serious consideration to the situation which has arisen in regard to the provision of a scanner.  Everybody engaged in medicine and the administration of the health services is convinced that we must have at least one, and possibly two, of these magnificent new machines and that they would result ultimately in very considerable savings.  I do not think a decision in ths regard can be postponed much longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might be allowed to make one remark in that respect.  The Minister, or the Parliamentary Secretary, never said that they would not be prepared to make money available for the purchase of this scanner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1257" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Did they ever say that they would make it available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, one.  The hospital authorities came up with some proposition, not for buying four, but for one at £250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree that it is a situation that must be dealt with by the Minister.  We cannot have everybody in the country who wants an EMI scanner going off and buying one.  That would be ridiculous.  These are very valuable pieces of equipment and relatively expensive.  Certainly the situation must be assessed in the national interest and whatever number we are going to buy, one, two, three or whatever they must be strategically placed so that we can reap the best possible advantage.  If the Minister is prepared to make the money available&mdash;and it comes as a pleasant surprise to me to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary that he is&mdash;the next step is for him to take this by the throat and insist on a rational approach to the provision of this equipment.</P>
      <P>One of the major areas of neglect in our health services is that in regard to the mentally handicapped.  Most people would agree that this has reached a crisis stage.  I am not being party political in this regard but we simply have not made the necessary provision for the adult mentally handicapped.  Some people might argue, perhaps with some justification, that we have done fairly well in regard to juvenile mentally handicapped persons.  Certainly when a mentally handicapped person reaches the age of 18 we have not made the necessary provision on a national basis. Of course, this is bound up with our whole approach to the psychiatric services. In many instances what is happening now is that mentally handicapped patients are being placed in psychiatric institutions where they should not be.  Certainly in the Eastern Health Board area there has been a lamentable deterioration in this regard during the year in the approach both to the mentally handicapped and psychiatric services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some progress was being made in the process of de-institutionalising <Col N="1258" /> both of those services.  That is the way we must progress in the future.  We must ensure that, to an increasing extent, the large central institution for psychiatric patients is dispensed with and that both the psychiatric patient and mentally handicapped person are placed out in the community in suitable circumstances. There can be no question of going too quickly in this sphere, no question of merely closing down institutions and putting patients out on the streets.  That would be disastrous and totally unacceptable.  But there is a right way of doing it.  It is something on which we must make progress, providing amenities, facilities and accommodation in the community, getting a very high proportion of psychiatric patients and mentally handicapped people back into the community.  That is the sensible way of proceeding in this area.</P>
    <P>I mention this because there has been a serious degeneration in this whole area in 1976 as a result of the Minister's approach.  Programmes and plans which were going satisfactorily have been held up and dislocated and in many cases the situation is much worse now coming to the end of 1976 than it was at the beginning of the year and now we are making money available which could have prevented all those things happening.  What is happening about the consultancy services?  What is this review body doing or is there any progress in that area?</P>
    <P>Another matter which will become critical soon is the question of medical registration.  There is no doubt that we need a new Act in this area.  The requirements of the European Community have to be met.  We have a new situation where there is freedom of movement by professional people throughout the countries of the Community.  We have to face up to that and make appropriate provisions for it.  I understand that it is accepted that we will have to have a new Act dealing with medical practice, registration of doctors and so on. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us something about that, the time scale involved and when we <Col N="1259" /> can expect this Act, and if he can, to give us some indication as to how comprehensive this new legislation is likely to be.  Medical education is an area which has to be comprehensively re-examined and legislated for.  Some rationality must be introduced into the situation, so that we will produce the right amount of doctors and not produce doctors for export.</P>
    <P>Allied to that is the question of the recruitment into the nursing profession. Deputies are constantly approached in this area.  The present situation is chaotic and something will have to be done to rationalise it.  Every girl who wants to become a nurse has to apply to every possible institution in the hope that she will get into one of them eventually.  Some procedure should be devised whereby the right number of suitable girls will be recruited and trained to man our services.  While on that question I would press the Minister to sanction the arbitration award for clinical teachers and nurse tutors about which we all have been approached by the Irish Nurses Organisation. That is an injustice and the Minister should get on with sanctioning that arbitration award.</P>
    <P>The national hospital building development programme which the Minister announced is another area in which there is a great deal of doubt and where there is a considerable lack of knowledge about what is happening or is going to happen.  The general impression seems to be that nothing is happening, that the Minister just announced the programme and then left the whole situation in the air.  I do not want to go deeply into this question at present but the aspect of planning must be mentioned.  If capital money is not available for a hospital building programme we should at least get on with planning hospitals.  The planning of a modern hospital is a long drawn out business.  It takes a very great amount of time from the moment a decision is taken to build a hospital until the construction work can commence. At the moment we have very considerable underemployment of professional people in this field.  Architects, engineers and other people in <Col N="1260" /> this category are finding it very difficult to carry on and get enough work to keep their offices going.  Many are going abroad looking for work and they are undertaking work in other countries, particularly in the Middle East.  Many of them I understand are providing services for the building of hospitals in other countries.  In that situation I want to emphasise the importance that only Irish professional persons are employed in the hospital building programme.  We have the competence, skills and knowledge to do any type of planning that is necessary in regard to hospital building.  I want to make this point strongly.  The Minister will be doing a good day's work if he gets on with the planning of these hospitals, because the spare capacity is there in the community. Engineers and architects could be put to work on this, so that when money becomes available we do not have to incur the delay of waiting for the plans. The plans will be there and it will only be a matter of taking them down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have some evidence that it is happening.  It is simply common sense that to the greatest extent possible planning should be proceeding in these areas, even if the actual starting of building and construction is not in sight at the moment.  It is absurd in our present circumstances to go outside the country to bring in professional people to do this work, when we have people at home who can do it.  It should be obvious to everybody that this is common sense.  These are just a few points which seem to be of importance and I want to avail of this opportunity on this Supplementary Estimate to direct the attention of the Minister to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say again that the way in which the Government are dealing with the health services is very unsatisfactory.  At the commencement of the year they introduced an Estimate and endeavoured to force it through.  Its implications were imposed on everybody concerned so that there were restrictions, economies, cutbacks and the elimination of <Col N="1261" /> certain services.  Then, at the end of the year, when it is too late, the Government decide to provide the money that everybody knew would have to be made available anyway.  In the meantime all this dislocation has been caused.  It is a bad day's work on the part of the Government and brings into disrepute the whole question of the financing of our health services.  It will be very difficult in the future to get a rational and sensible approach to this question which is vitally important from the point of view of the whole area of public administration.  In every modern community the cost of health services is increasing and there is a need, in our case in particular, to have some long-term national approach to the amount of the community's resources that are to be made available for the field of health.  That would have been a difficult task in any event.</P>
    <P>There was some suggstion that an all-party committee would be set up to consider this matter.  I do not know what is the latest situation in that regard but if such a committee is set up, we shall be very glad to participate in it and to co-operate fully in regard to it.  In any event, there is a need nationally for an approach to the whole question of the level of health services that are to be provided, to the question of the cost of these services and of how these costs are to be met.  We must decide, too, what proportion of community resources are to be allocated in future to the health services.  It will be difficult to put the whole situation rationally on a long-term basis but the behaviour of the Minister this year has made this task all the more difficult with the stop-go policy of saying at the beginning of the year &ldquo;That is all you are getting; the Estimate is final&rdquo; and then at the end of the year saying, &ldquo;I did not really mean that and I am now making available the money that was needed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are agreeing to the Supplementary Estimate because we recognise the need for it.  It is necessary to keep the services going to the end of the year and to that extent we facilitate the Minister in putting it through the House.  All we can say about it at this <Col N="1262" /> stage is that the money should have been voted at the appropriate time, which was the beginning of the year so as to avoid the chaos and dislocation that have been caused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to avail of this opportunity to say that we consider the amount being voted in this Supplementary Estimate to be inadequate by far to service the needs of the hospitals. In introducing the Supplementary Estimate the Minister compared the figure this year of £253 million with an expenditure last year of £207 million and told us that the increased figure represents an increase of 22.4 per cent on last year's figure.  This is not something about which the Minister should be proud.  The Government are responsible for the huge increase in the cost of servicing hospitals.  Apart from wages and salaries which this year have practically been held, one of the biggest factors in the increased costs relates to lighting and heating.  The increase, too, in the price of petrol has meant very high delivery expenses and the hospitals need delivery services for laundry, food supplies and so on.  For some time I have been maintaining that if the Government were to reduce the cost of fuel generally the cost of hospital services would decrease considerably. This week I visited the Hospitals' Joint Board establishment at Rathfarnham where laundry is undertaken on behalf of about 67 hospitals.  I was impressed with the efficient manner in which the establishment is run and also with the very good staff relations that exist there.  A very efficient job is carried out but the cost of transporting the laundry to and from the various hospitals is exorbitant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and in particular the Minister for Health seem to be out of touch completely with the reality of the whole situation in regard to the cost of living.  Not so long ago I was talking to a doctor from a hospital who told me that at the hospital's board meeting those in attendance were informed that if they politicised the situation in any way or made any noises their place for priority might well be in jeopardy when funds would become available for equipment and so on.  On <Col N="1263" /> the other hand, there are hospitals where members of boards boast of the vast savings that have been effected as a result of the cutbacks, implying that there had been a high degree of wastage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That was so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There will always be some wastage.  Regardless of what savings may have been effected, there is a great shortage of money in all the hospitals.  The position is such that when funds become available the log jam will be so great that it will take years before the medical services are really moving again.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey spoke of the plight of handicapped adults because of the lack of facilities for them.  He referred to the fact that younger people, mentally handicapped children, were better catered for, but the situation exists in which young children when they reach adulthood have nowhere to go from these institutions which are designed for young people. There are insufficient adult institutions with the result that many adults are being retained in institutions which are primarly for young people. This results in many young mentally handicapped children being unable to gain admission to these institutions and a backlog of applications is building up.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is well aware of the pressure to open up Bawnmore in Limerick so that the backlog can be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the difficulties at present prevailing in the medical services we are very much aware that some great opportunities are being lost by health boards.  In my own area, for example, the Eastern Health Board was offered an acre of land worth £40,000, free. A religious order offered this land and there is planning permission for building houses.  This offer could not be taken up by the health board because the money was not available. It was to be used as a welfare home for elderly people.  This is sad because it is very difficult to retain this land for a welfare home.  When houses are <Col N="1264" /> built in an area people want any available space immediately used as an amenity area and it is hard to get them to realise that the land has been earmarked for a welfare home when funds become available.  This home would have cost about £150,000.  I think about five or six similar buildings are held up at present for lack of funds.  Problems are not becoming any easier.</P>
    <P>Although I have not yet had a direct complaint from a constituent, I have been told that in the case of the free drugs scheme which applied up to now for expenditure over £3 per month the figure is to be raised to £6.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary say if this is correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Between £5 and £8. Anything over £8 is fully recouped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>As against £3 at present.  When will the increase operate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is operating at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It must have only started because I have not got the feedback yet.  There are and always will be abuses where free services are provided but the number of abuses is minimal in relation to the vast majority of people who really need these services.  People may say that an increase from £3 per month to £8 per month is not very great in times of inflation, but the fact is that money values have deteriorated so much that increases in welfare benefits have not kept pace with inflation and people are constantly finding themselves worse off than they were previously.  Most of those availing of what was virtually a free drug service will suffer a considerable set-back by this increase.  They would be mainly elderly people with very small incomes. There are also very many younger people availing of the scheme but the vast majority are the elderly who also have to pay more for fuel and electricity, even if they have 100 units free, if living alone.  They can see nothing but a bleak future ahead. I do not know where this will end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> I sometimes feel that consultants should from time to time be subject to the Prices Commission as regards fees.  Only a week ago a constituent of mine who was beaten up went to a hospital and was treated in the accident department.  The Garda wanted him to prosecute his attackers which he was willing to do but the Garda said he would need a medical report. He asked for this in the hospital and apparently they declined to give it to him.  I spoke to the hospital secretary and he said a report would be sent out.  In due course, the man concerned did get a report, not by the doctor who had examined him but by a consultant who composed a short letter on an ordinary quarto sheet running probably to 15 or 20 lines. The report stated what the doctor who had examined the man found.  This was sent to the man involved with a bill for ten guineas.  I think that is wrong&mdash;ten guineas for copying out a few lines of a report and sending it out.  I know the cost of running a Rolls Royce is increasing daily and I have not very much sympathy with the owners, but this man had the cheek to send a bill for ten guineas for writing out a report that some houseman had prepared and which, in all likelihood, would not even be admissible because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that the consultant did not even examine the patient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he did not examine the patient at all.  He said in the letter that he had studied the report of the doctor who examined the person and that his findings were as stated. For that, he sent a bill for ten guineas. I told the man not to pay it under any circumstances.  I think the public should be told that when they are faced with this kind of charge they should send it to the Department of Health who could deal with it in their own way, refer it to the Prices Commission for examination.  I think this type of charge is immoral.  It is absolutely wrong and I do not think any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary would stand over that.</P>

      <P>This is what sometimes brings members of the medical profession into disrepute.  There are members of the medical profession in my own family and I know how hard such people work and how much effort they put into every day.  Most of them have a very short life-span. They are very prone to coronaries, and I do not begrudge them at all making a good living.  However, where this kind of abuse does take place there is an obligation to stop it.</P>
      <P>One of the services that has suffered recently in Dublin is the home help service because of cutbacks.  Recently our local health board had a visit from one of the people who operates one of the home help services.  They cannot pay the people to come to visit the homes because of the big cutback and the Eastern Health Board does not have the money.  My attitude all along, and I have expressed it to the members of the Eastern Health Board, is that no-one should die for lack of treatment and if all the money allocated for this was spent the health board can go to the Minister and say &ldquo;We have not got a red cent left. What are we going to do?&rdquo; The Minister is the man with the responsibility and the Minister will just have to come up with the money.</P>
      <P>I do not think this money that has been voted here today is adequate at all to meet the needs.  No Members of this House knowing the short-fall of their own health boards will disagree when I say that.</P>
      <P>One last point I would like to make is in relation to the treatment of disabled patients.  I sometimes feel that if I were Minister for Health one thing I would like to do would be to call personally to every hospital in the country.  I do not know how many hospitals there are in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably I will never achieve the situation of being Minister for Health and never will have the opportunity of visiting all those hospitals, <Col N="1267" /> so it will be a dream unfulfilled. Recently, a case came to my attention where a man who was physically disabled in a very bad way was impatient to get home because he was not too happy in his surroundings.  He asked the doctor if he could go.  The doctor said &ldquo;You can go any time you want&rdquo;.  At six o'clock in the evening the matron came along and said to him &ldquo;Pack your things, you are going home now&rdquo;.  It was a wintery evening, freezing cold. There was nobody living in his house; neighbours had to be called in to light a fire, air his bed and various things like that.  I think it was a shocking thing.  The doctor said &ldquo;You can go any time you want, now or tomorrow&rdquo; but this person was told at six o'clock on a very cold and wintery evening &ldquo;out&rdquo;.  The man is back in hospital again.</P>
      <P>Another matter is the number of cases which are being taken against people for non-payment of bills.  I know there are legal problems in my next suggestion but for people who are in the VHI scheme the hospital rather than the patient should be paid directly.  We know there are people receiving the money and not paying the hospitals.  If the VHI were to issue a letter or a form to their members to the effect that &ldquo;I authorise VHI to pay the hospital on my behalf&rdquo;, I for one would be quite happy to sign it. People may be short of money.  They have all sorts of problems.  They come out of hospital, get a cheque for, perhaps, £200 or £300 and they think &ldquo;I will use that for a few days or a week&rdquo; or something like that.  There are wealthy people who owe large sums of money to the hospitals.  I have no sympathy for such people.  There are others who are hard-up.  People generally would accept, and it would be a worth-while exercise, if the VHI would use a form such as I have suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One case recently was amusing and tragic&mdash;tragic in that a person was in a hospital because of his&mdash;to use that popular word&mdash;&ldquo;nerves&rdquo;, a nervous disorder.  He was let out of hospital and he had not paid the bill.  He received a letter from one of those firms <Col N="1268" /> like Stubbs stating that if the money were not paid within seven days the matter would be put in a solicitor's hands.  That man is back in that hospital again, a complete nervous wreck after that letter.  The hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;will still not be paid.  They have created another problem for themselves and another large charge.  When hospitals put the collection of bills in the hands of bill collectors they should know whether the people they are billing are liable in the first instance.  It is sometimes to relatives or in-laws who are liable so, therefore, the first thing they should do is find out the people personally liable.  When a person who is not liable in law to pay a Bill gets a letter from a firm like Mercury House saying that if the matter is not settled within such and such a period he will be in the gazette and brought to court, if he comes to me directly and says that this money is owned because the in-law, nephew, niece or whoever it was is liable, I will make some arrangement to pay it, but when the hospital seeks this remedy they can go and whistle for the money.  It is very important when they give these cases to these debt collectors that they are aware of the background of the case and whether or not the people are in law liable.  If the person's financial circumstances are such as not to allow payment of the lump sum they should be able to say to him: &ldquo;Will you make a monthly payment to us, so much a month?&rdquo; At least the hospitals will be getting something, whereas the other way they get nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are ways and means, I know the hospitals in their desperation for money resort to this.  There are cases where I would advise them to put the matter in the hands of debt collectors because the people concerned are obviously wealthy and known to be, and I would have no reluctance at all about bringing these people to court. In fact, I would not even bother to warn them.  I would simply bring them to court.  If a few possibly well-known names were published in the newspapers perhaps these bills would be <Col N="1269" /> paid a bit more speedily.  We all know that if any of our family go into hospital we would sell the very houses that we live in so that they would recover health.  You do not very often hear of undertakers, for example, taking their clients to court because people do not argue the price and they pay most times there and then. In the country it may be different but in the city they all know one another and that there is that call in relation to that aspect&mdash;I was going to say of life but I say&mdash;of death.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make funds available for certain pieces of equipment. I am a member of the board of a certain hospital and some equipment is required.  It is a children's hospital and one always feels more emotional about young children.  Even a young adult of 20 years has had 20 years of life but a new-born infant may be dependent totally on up-to-date intensive care.  I think most adults would be prepared to make sacrifices so that proper equipment might be available for those young children. The hospital I am referring to is the children's hospital in Crumlin which is an excellent one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a marvellous, dedicated staff there but I know that the intensive care unit could be improved. I am picking my words very carefully and I am making a special appeal to the Press who may be noting this that this part of my speech should not be reported.  People may get alarmed if they read that an intensive care unit in a children's hospital is not all it should be.  It is bad enough to have a child in hospital but it could be sheer hell to a parent who thought the facilities were not what they should be.  I have spoken to the Minister about this matter in the past but nothing has been done.  I appeal to him to ensure that this matter is rectified.  Last year the amount of money involved was in the region of £46,000 and this is a very small sum in relation to the figure of £254 million for this year.  I would ask that the matter I mentioned be given top priority.  Let us ensure that children <Col N="1270" /> have a 100 per cent chance of life.  A rate of 99.9 per cent is good but I should like the extra percentage, even at the expense of other matters if that is necessary.</P>
      <P>I hope there will be an improvement in the new year.  I should like to pay tribute to the hospitals who have worked so hard to keep down their costs.  I can understand the pressures the Minister is under from the various hospitals for the much-needed equipment, for the scanner which Deputy Haughey mentioned and for various other pieces of modern machinery.  All of us want to see these items of equipment made available.  Perhaps the Minister would consider as the policy of his Department having an A.1 list which would cater for the care of children. We should not stint on that item.</P>

      <P>At the beginning of his speech the Minister stated that his aim was to maintain the 1975 service levels.  He thinks this Supplementary Estimate will enable that objective to be met substantially. Later on in his speech he stated:</P>
      <P>We have not, of course, been able to expand our health services as we would have wished in more favourable circumstances, but we have been able to maintain service levels substantially in line with my stated objective.</P>
      <P>At the end of his statement the Minister said:</P>
      <P>...I am pleased that we have been able to carry our health services intact and undamaged through what has been a year of profound crisis for our society in general.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister really believe that?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What has happened has been atrocious.  There have been enormous cutbacks and even making money available at this stage cannot undo the pain, hardship and damage caused to sick people and those in need of physiotherapy, chiropody and so on.  Can this money now help the needy children for whom milk supplies were cut?  Can the <Col N="1271" /> damage caused be undone with this money now?</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister can honestly say that services have been maintained at the previous level.  I know of cases where the provision of physiotherapy services were curtailed severely and the same applies to chiropody services.  People suffered mental anguish because of the cutbacks. Even the money now available will not undo the damage caused.  It will not restore the confidence and morale of those in need.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would like to comment on the number of people awaiting various aids and treatment provided by the health boards.  On 17th November, 1976 I asked the Minister for Health a question concerning health aids and I received a tabular statement in reply. From that statement it appeared that in the Eastern Health Board area the number of children awaiting dental treatment on 1st November, 1976, was 6,996; the number of adults was 6,757 and the number of adults awaiting dentures was 1,458.  That is a very bad record.  In the Western Health Board area the number of children awaiting dental treatment was 13,739.  Yet, the Minister has told us that we have come through a year with health services intact and undamaged.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the waiting lists have grown enormously.  This applies to those people requiring spectacles or ophthalmic treatment.  If after a school medical examination a parent receives word that a child must be referred for some form of ophthalmic treatment or further examination, naturally that parent will expect that the treatment will be available within a short period. The parent is quite entitled to expect this service.  I hope the Minister in his reply will indicate if the waiting lists have extended enormously.  Have more people been added to them or is the delay occasioned by the cutback in services?  I cannot understand how the Minister maintains that service levels have been maintained substantially in line with the stated objectives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the GMS.  I anticipated that the eight CEOs would have come up with a review for the GMS and increased the guidelines around last August but this review has not yet been completed. The cost of living is still increasing. My post is full of letters from people whose medical cards have been withdrawn. My clinics are also visited by such people.  The Parliamentary Secretary is correct when he speaks about the number of people with medical cards but we must examine the basis for this.  It is because of increased numbers of people unemployed, adverse economic circumstances, and young people especially who are entitled to medical cards because they have no work.  This means that other people who anticipated continuation of those medical cards have been cut off. The people who are there to administer the health services and whose minds should be focussed on health and what is good for the people have instead been focussing their minds entirely on finance.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board especially have been used to borrow money for the Government.  The Government were not in a position to borrow it themselves so they used the health boards to obtain overdraft accommodation. On the 2nd September, 1976 the Eastern Health Board consented to the temporary borrowing by way of overdraft up to an overall limit of £7.5 million during the quarter ended 31st December, 1976.  Why are they borrowing that money?  They are doing it because the money is not coming through from the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Supplementary Estimate does not deal with capital allocation.  Let us look at the number of units throughout the country that have been built out of money provided in capital allocations during the <Col N="1273" /> last few years which are now lying empty because the staff cannot be provided to man them.  There are still difficulties in relation to the limited eligibility scheme.  People make annual contributions to the Revenue Commissioners. They receive back a receipt for this and they consider that this entitles them to some form of service during the period of time for which they have paid.  If those people become ill and have to go into hospital, they are presented with bills afterwards and told that when the review of their income took place they were deemed to be over the figure. The Revenue Commissioners then refund that year's subscription.  Why can an acknowledgement of such a payment not be valid for the 12 months immediately following the date of the demand?  Why can the person not be eligible for those 12 months? Is it possible that there are people still making those annual payments but not finding out until they are hospitalised and their circumstances are examined that they are ineligible?  I hope when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health speaks he will deal with that point.  Could things not be arranged so that cover will extend for 12 months after a payment is made to the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">

      <P>My information is that <i>prima facie</i> that is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Prima facie</i> that is true but it needs a lot of tightening up.  I spoke about this previously when we dealt with the eligibility clause.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will tidy this up because it is causing a lot of anguish to people. There are many magazine articles and radio programmes at the moment which deal with depression and people feeling low.  Many people because of this go around feeling they ought to feel low.  I hope the Health Education Bureau, which has been doing very good work, will take cognisance of this and try to stop it.  There is so much about this depression and feeling low that people are coming around to believe that they ought to <Col N="1274" /> feel that way.  I would like to see the Health Education Bureau taking a positive stand about this and come up with a campaign for better health and more involvement.  This would make people feel better and want to be involved in things.  This goes back to the adage that prevention is much cheaper than cure.</P>
      <P>I believe we are having too much centralisation.  The idea of setting up directors of community care and health services in various counties is an excellent idea but I do not know if those people have any powers. They should have more say in the administration of the GMS card system because they are in close contact with people.  I regret to see the introduction of computers in this area in the city.  I find that when people in Wicklow apply the matter goes to Dublin and weeks elapse before a reply comes back.  Could this matter not be put under the aegis of the director of community care for the county?  He could deal with the things more effectively because he would have a better knowledge of the matter in his county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The money provided in the Supplementary Estimate is very welcome but it is a pity that the advice of our spokesman on health, Deputy Haughey, was not taken.  This would have avoided a lot of the cutbacks and the hardship involved.  We cannot undo the damage that has been done by services that were required and have not been rendered in physiotherapy and chiropody but we also have interest charges which will now have to be paid.  It is important to consider what some health boards are paying out in bank charges and interest charges on money borrowed. Many health boards, when they look at a programme on community care or a capital programme say: &ldquo;If only we did not have to pay those huge sums and if only some money came through in time we could have embarked on those programmes&rdquo;.  Why is it that money voted for medicine must go to pay interest charges?  I still maintain the Minister is not correct in saying we have been able to carry our health services intact and undamaged.  Too <Col N="1275" /> much money voted for health is now going to pay off interest charges.</P>
    <P>I sincerely regret that the original estimates of the health boards were not accepted and payments made based on those estimates.  It now appears that the health boards will require a little more than they thought, and the estimates of the Department for Health were much too low.  Money has gone astray and the services have been cut back seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he wanted to maintain the 1975 health service levels.  He also said he believed the Supplementary Estimate would enable that objective to be substantially met.  I am glad he used the word &ldquo;substantially&rdquo; because, even with a Supplementary Estimate for £11 million or more, the 1975 levels will not be met.  We all agree on that. He also said it was only later in the year he became aware that certain institutions and certain health services could not carry on until the end of the year.  In fact, these points were put to him six, seven or eight months ago and he refused to listen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate covers various allowances and increases granted by one Department or another for social welfare pensions and welfare allowances, and the national wage agreement.  It does not add ½p to the general administration of the actual health services.  Directions were given to the health boards at the beginning of the year to exercise economy and all the health boards did that.  The only areas in which they could effect economies in the eight health board areas were, by and large, by cutting out transport facilities such as the hiring of taxis and hackney cars and the use of private operators to bring patients to and from clinics and hospitals. These were replaced by the use of health board ambulances, very costly items of equipment.  Usually those ambulances were replaced every three years on average.  Now, because of their extra use as a result of the non-employment of private operators they will have to be replaced more frequently, thereby <Col N="1276" /> effecting no economy or saving and just putting off the day of reckoning.</P>
    <P>Another major item which was cut back in the health services was the purchase of supplies.  Stocks have been reduced in every health board area.  This shows we are only fooling ourselves by thinking the health services can be operated within a particular financial allocation.  In each health board area, in every hospital and institution stocks are lower now than ever before.  In certain circumstances the necessary stocks and supplies for the treatment of patients are not available, or are not as freely available as they were in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that substantially the levels of the 1975 service had been maintained.  This is not the case. Because of the financial restraints imposed on the health boards, members of staffs could not be replaced when they retired, or were on holidays, or on sick leave.  This caused a substantial increase in the waiting lists for almost every kind of treatment throughout the health services.  That is another example of a major cutback and another decision by the Minister to put off the day of reckoning.  This caused hardship to many people. People who should have been treated for various ailments during the course of the year will have to wait until next year, or perhaps, the year after, because of the non-availability of the additional staff required to treat them.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am pleased that we have been able to carry our health services intact and undamaged through what has been a year of profound crisis for our society in general.</P>
    <P>I question that statement, bearing in mind the points I have made.  There is no doubt confidence in our health services has been damaged enormously by the attitude adopted by the Minister and the Government to the finances required to run what were very efficient and effective, improving and expanding services.  People have lost confidence in the ability of the Department to provide the necessary funds. This is a tragedy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> People at large were just becoming used to the changeover in the administration of the health services from the county councils to the health boards. Then the axe was dropped and the moneys were cut off.  Now there is a general feeling throughout the country that the administration of the health services should revert to the county councils.  A short while ago, Deputy Coughlan asked the Minister to abolish the only real contact between the man in the street and the administration of the health services through the health boards, the local advisory committees. Surely it is not the thinking of the Labour Party that the say the local advisory committees have in relation to the administration of the services should be eliminated?  That would be a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>The amount of money sought in the Supplementary Estimate is supposed to maintain the health services at the 1975 levels, which it will not.  Not only do people on this side of the House realise that, but it is evident from the contributions from the far side that they realise it too.  The Minister spoke.  He had no Member of the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party to back him up because they know he is not telling the truth when he states that the 1975 levels will be maintained even with the additional resources. We all know that is not the case.  We all know the cutbacks will have to be compensated for next year in relation to the provision of transport, the purchase of supplies and, we hope, a reduction in the waiting list for treatment of patients in various levels of the services.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Deputy Haughey made the very relevant point as long ago as 30th March last, when Deputy Haughey put forward the view, that approximately £15 million would set the situation aright and, at the very least, maintain the 1975 service levels. That remains correct today but the Minister finds that he is £4 million or £5 million short.</P>
    <P>The Minister said today that it was towards the end of the year he detected some limited areas of health services requiring additional resources to enable his policy to be maintained.  It <Col N="1278" /> is sad that we have to admit that the Minister found this out only towards the end of the year while, as far back as March last, Deputy Haughey was able to tell him that £15 million would be required.  How right he was.  The many cutbacks implemented are causing hardship in many areas and, in the long term, will do nothing to reduce the cost of administration of the health services.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will learn from experience and the mistakes he has made in the allocation of funds this year and, hopefully, restore the confidence in the administration of the health services which obtained prior to the hardship imposed by him this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, frankly I am disappointed with the Minister's speech on this Supplementary Estimate.  I am disappointed in it under a number of headings.  No matter what the Minister may say to the contrary, earlier in the year he was aware that whilst he was bringing an Estimate before this House health boards were engaged in dumping large slices of their programmes overboard. This leads me to believe that, far from the tidy administration the Minister would claim to have accomplished, the administration was second-rate, as were the calculations and, in general, fell far short of the targets he presented in this House.  I doubt if it is fair to come to the House at the eleventh hour and present a Supplementary Estimate for £11,500,000 to complete the year's work.  Those of us who have any interest in health know that the services have suffered during the year, not merely the general medical services part of the scheme but the hospital end also.  No matter what the Minister may maintain we contend that the services have fallen short of what we expected under many headings.</P>
      <P>Even allowing for the fact that these are stringent times, that money is tight and inflation has run away with the estimates proposed earlier in the year, the Minister or the Government have made no attempt to put a bridle on this runaway horse.  It is a runaway horse; it is still galloping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not merely in regard to health but in respect of other matters such as <Col N="1279" /> social welfare, statements were made here by various members of the Government to the effect that certain things were happening in the economy. Whilst such speeches were made no attempt was made to back them up. Therefore, it may be said that all the shots were falling short of the target, in the sense that no realistic stand was taken to stop this galloping horse of inflation.  As recently as this morning it was announced on the radio that Italy led in the European context with the greatest increase in inflation and that we were tight on their heels.  Now Italy is a large country; it takes up a large slice of the map.  If one compares it with our economy and the size of our country one will soon see that we will find it much more difficult to stop the horse at this stage than will the Italians.</P>
    <P>Therefore we may take it that the money being voted in the House today to enable the Minister for Health to complete his year's work will again fall short of what would be necessary for the targets we set earlier, which were a more comprehensive, coordinated, better general medical services scheme together with a better hospitalisation scheme.  Let us leave out hospitalisation altogether for the moment.  Going through the Minister's speech one finds little hope that the position will be any better, in the year ahead.</P>

      <P>As far as I can see, nobody.  That is the most regrettable part of it.  The galloping horse has reached a stage now where he has thrown off the saddle.  There is nobody in the saddle.  If there was somebody in the saddle putting a rein on the galloping horse those of us interested in health and indeed in other spheres could hold out some hope.  Regrettably that is not the case.  I am merely repeating some points made last year by some members of the Government warning of the danger signals.  Here is a dangerous signal on the floor of the House.  We had warning of it as far back as last spring when the <Col N="1280" /> health boards, perforce, dumped large slices of their programmes overboard.</P>
      <P>Neither I nor any other Deputy&mdash; not even the spokesman on Health who always tries to be helpful rather than harmful&mdash;wants to injure the health services, the estimates, calculations or administration.  But what is one to think when the Minister comes into this House with the weakest statement I have ever heard presented here, containing no hope of a betterment of the services, of even a reorganisation or reorientation of them to meet present pressing needs?</P>
      <P>The real expenditure for this year apparently will be £254 million according to the statement.  This is roughly about £47 million up on expenditure last year.  This is only calculated to keep pace with conditions in 1975 so that we are on the losing end everywhere.  If we continue on this trend our conditions in medical matters will worsen.  Is it not time that some realistic thinking was done at Government level in order to stop this trend and bring it under control?  I am not a prophet nor do I pretend to be one but if this is not done the position will be a good deal worse when the next Estimate comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister informed the House that non-capital expenditure increased faster than inflation.  The Minister did not attempt to justify that, he did not refer back to it or say what he would do about it.  All that that conveys to me is that we had a rapid rate of inflation affecting our monetary system and we had an even more advanced rate affecting our health system.  When the Minister comes looking for money he should tell this House what he proposes to do about this matter.  It is no wonder, if non-capital expenditure is increasing at a greater rate than the rate of inflation that we have Supplementary Estimates of this size.  It is not realistic and it does not denote any sound thinking in regard to health.  Health is the one Department which requires a sound system of calculation based on realities in order to lead the personnel of the Health <Col N="1281" /> Department, which is a labour intensified unit.  The display in this direction is very poor.</P>
    <P>I will not harp on this fact throughout my speech.  One would love to be able to dwell on other aspects of the Health Estimate.  It is apparent that if this trend of current expenditure for the GMS part of the scheme continues to increase at its present rate this sort of expenditure will probably have doubled by this time 12 months.  Is this any way to give confidence to the people who are working in health or to the poor patients who are ever present for treatment in and out of hospital?  No attempt was made to calculate the cost in order to ensure that the various health boards would be in a position at the beginning of the year to budget for a sum which would take them through to the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are in public life know of the long waiting lists at present for entry to some hospitals. We know of patients having to wait 12 months and in some cases 18 months before they are able to enter hospitals even for elective surgery. How much worse is it in the case of patients who may be on the waiting list for high surgery?  How is it that doctors continue to send maternity cases to hospitals if beds are that scarce?  If bed accommodation is so poor as to indicate that there is a waiting list of the length I have just described, how is it that the doctors are passing the maternity homes and sending maternity patients to hospitals to take up beds which could otherwise be available for surgical cases?  How is it that they are permitted to do so if we are in a period of such stringency?  Their answer to that is the old one that the hospital is a safer place.  We invested a good deal of money in nursing homes in the past in the hope of having a competent maternity scheme and we now find quite a high number of nursing homes with under-used beds.  I would like the Minister to say whether or not there is a scarcity of beds in surgical hospitals and how is it that a patient in need of surgical treatment finds it so hard to enter one of these hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not wish to argue with the Parliamentary Secretary. He and I are very good friends. We have invested a good deal of money in building up good nursing homes and I suggest to the Minister that he take steps to regularise the position.  This would have the result of relieving our hospitals of much pressure.</P>
      <P>There are many other factors to which one could refer but one in particular which I should like to mention relates to the situation whereby there is a reluctance on the part of our young doctors to work at home.  It is difficult to understand this since the rates of remuneration here are better than those which apply across the water.  The health boards have much difficulty in recruiting young doctors. If it were not for the fact that we have quite a number of doctors who are public spirited enough to be prepared to work longer hours than normal, the health boards would have great difficulty in continuing to operate. Not only are the rates of remuneration here good when compared with other places but the conditions, too, are relatively better in terms of housing and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Medical students should be given to understand that they can gain experience at home without going away.  It is regrettable that after all the money spent on them in their own country they give the benefit of their training to other countries.  In some cases the experience they can gain at home is superior to any they might gain in other places.  I know of good provincial towns in which a young doctor could have up to 2,000 patients on his panel if he were prepared to put up a plate.  It is understandable to some extent that young doctors would wish to gain experience in other countries but every effort should be made to ensure that they stay at home for at least some time.  They should have some regard for the country of their birth and in which they received their <Col N="1283" /> education.  I expect that about 40 per cent of our health services are manned by doctors in the upper age groups. We want these people in our services but we need also the younger men.</P>
    <P>I have been endeavouring to put across this point of view for a long time but, apparently, without success. It will be very important during the next ten or 12 years to have a much larger portion of young doctors in the service at home, not merely as general practitioners but engaged also in other branches of medicine.  Otherwise the system in the eighties will fall far short of what was visualised for those years when the Health Act was being discussed in 1970.  It will be too bad if this trend is allowed continue. Regardless of how hard times may be, we should endeavour to make good use of the circumstances but we will not be successful if we continue with the methods that have been adopted so far.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have commented, too, on the GMS side of the scheme but if one leaves that question aside for the moment and turns to the area of greatest expenditure&mdash;hospitalisation&mdash;the future looks fairly bleak.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with the Deputy.  There are, of course, a number of areas in the country which could make a special claim.  Some system of priorities has to be observed.  In the case of Inishbofin a call office telephone in the post office is available to the public from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and at all times in emergencies. There are on average only two to three calls a day and creditable revenue for the 12 months ended 31st December last was £39.60.  A kiosk could, of course, be provided in Inishbofin under a guarantee by the local authority against the loss, if any, involved in its provision and maintenance and I would suggest to any Deputies interested that that course is open.</P>

      <P>The licences issued by my Department require cable television operators to ensure that their systems meet certain technical standards laid down under the Wireless Telegraphy (Wired Broadcast Relay Licence) Regulations, 1974. Reception from a cable television system depends primarily on the strength and consistency of the signals available at the masthead and, secondly, on the efficient relay of these signals to subscribers.  My Department have, of course, no control over the quality of the BBC and IBA signals available off-air at any cable television masthead.</P>
      <P>My Department have received no complaints about the quality of cable television reception in Waterford city and have no reason to believe that the company operating the cable television system there are not complying with the technical conditions attached to their licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" /> When the question of granting an exclusive licence for the provision of cable television service in Waterford was under consideration my Department had serious doubts about the reliability of the available BBC and IBA off-air signals there.  The following is an extract from a Press statement which my Department issued through the Government Information Services on 11th June, 1974, on the matter:</P>
    <P>The Department cannot guarantee that reception of the signals from British TV stations will be sufficiently reliable to provide a satisfactory multi-channel cable television service in Waterford.  Nevertheless, because of the strongly expressed wish of the local community that a <Col N="1288" /> cable television service should be established, the Minister is prepared to grant the necessary licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he had an inquiry carried out into the fishing tragedy when the <i>Evelyn Marie</i> sank off the Donegal coast in January, 1975; whether he received a report; and the use he made of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher  Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Gallagher</b> asked the Minister for Transport and Power if a report on the <i>Evelyn Marie</i> trawler disaster off the Donegal coast in 1975 has been compiled by his Department; and if so, why it has not been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>Pursuant to the provisions of section 465 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, I directed that a preliminary inquiry be carried out by a marine surveyor of my Department into the loss of the <i>Evelyn Marie.</i> The statutory purpose of such an inquiry is to enable me to establish the circumstance of the casualty and determine whether the circumstances are such as to warrant the holding of a formal investigation under section 466 of the Act.</P>
      <P>The surveyor who carried out the inquiry inspected the scene of the casualty, interviewed and took sworn statements from the skippers of other fishing vessels who were in the area at the time of the casualty, from members of the Garda, and had available the statements given at the inquest.  He also had reports from the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre, the Meteorological Office and Malin Head radio station.</P>
      <P>Having considered the inspector's report and the available evidence, I decided that the holding of a formal investigation would not elicit any further information with regard to this casualty.  The report of a preliminary inquiry is confidential to me and it is long established practice not to publish such reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not consider making available some of the more useful sections of the report, <Col N="1290" /> which would undoubtedly reveal the necessity for certain precautionary measures?  Surely the report must have found something wrong in relation to the type of accident which occurred and that would be useful for future shipping in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The chief marine inspector of the Department carried out the investigation and any recommendations he would have made I have either implemented or I am in the process of discussing with other Departments the desirability of implementing them.  It is not the practice to publish the reports and I think the Deputy understands why the reports are not being published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>One can understand the need for confidentiality but in relation to a disaster of such proportions there would certainly be some elements of the report the Minister may have found useful in regard to future precautionary measures and does he not feel constrained to make known in the proper manner, without revealing the entire report, the more useful elements in the report to the people concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there were no survivors of that tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even knowing the report revealed anything could be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The report, of course, went into, as I said, all that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I will not.  The surveyor interviewed everybody in the area, the fishermen, the Garda Síochána, the Meteorological Service, the Malin Head radio station and, on the information he gleaned, he did not recommend a formal investigation should be held into the tragedy and I accepted that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say when this report was finalised in his Department and when the information was passed on to other Departments which might be involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I said had there been anything in the report that warranted such action I would have taken it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it then that the Minister did not find it necessary to take any action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy could not take that.  The report was compiled on 18th June, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say the person who carried out the report made certain recommendations and that some of these recommendations had, in fact, been implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not.  I said that in any report were such recommendations included, if they were within the scope of my own Department, I would have them carried out, or if they involved other Departments I would be in process of having consultations with those Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The person who wrote the report did not make any recommendations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if any consultations have taken place with any other Department as a result of this report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not as a result of this report, but generally there have been representations made to my Department about the provision of lights and the radio frequencies in the Donegal area.  Lights are a matter for the Irish Lights Commissioners, and there are discussions going on between my Department and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, who would be the installing Department, and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries under whom fishery boats come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state if the report contained anything that might prevent a similar tragedy occurring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1292" />
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Unintentionally, I am sure, the Deputy is endeavouring to put words into my mouth.  As I said in reply to Deputy Brennan already, there were no survivors from this tragedy. Anybody who was there at the time of the tragedy was not available to the inspectorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, in view of the large number of people who were interviewed at the time by the surveyor in question it gave rise to a certain feeling that there would be a report, and the fact that there was no promulgation of a report led to some anxiety amongst the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy has said, but going back to when this law was enacted&mdash;it is an 1894 Act&mdash;there have been relatively few formal investigations as a result of such a report.  In fact, the last one in this country was in 1954, 22 years ago, in spite of all the preliminary inquiries that have been made in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister or his Department satisfied that the navigation charts available to fishermen are up to date and adequate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us some hope that he will have a similar survey carried out and that if there is anything in it that can be of benefit to shipping, it will be made available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to the more recent tragedy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In the same waters&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an inspector from my Department conducting that inquiry at the moment.  I will not publish that preliminary report when it comes to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this not a futile exercise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think the Deputy will understand that these are reports to the Minister for the Minister to make up his mind whether a <Col N="1293" /> public investigation is necessary or not.  If something in that report warrants the holding of an investigation, then the publication of that report would tend to incriminate somebody between the time of the publication and the time the investigation has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined this very closely and I am satisfied that this is the correct procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the report is finalised on the Carrig Una disaster, would the Minister follow it up with a public inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not necessarily. The Deputy is asking me to make a judgement on a report I have not yet received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree it would be well worth while if it resulted in the saving of even one life in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>These are hypothetical questions, and I will not make any decision on this report until I get it.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Nuclear Waste Hazard.</Title>
    <P>11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware of the planning permission granted for a £600 million expansion programme at Windscale in North West England for the reprocessing of nuclear waste from atomic power stations all over the world; if he is concerned about the dangers of seepage from ships carrying nuclear waste in the Irish sea and the alleged piping of radioactive waste from Windscale in the Irish sea; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of proposals by British Nuclear Fuels Limited to invest some £600 million in an expansion programme at their nuclear fuel reprocessing complex at Windscale, North West England for which I understand planning permission has not, in fact, yet been granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that irradiated fuel&mdash; that is, spent fuel, being transported <Col N="1294" /> for reprocessing, is contained in thick steel flasks.  These flasks are designed according to international regulations to be leak tight and to withstand any credible accident so the risk of seepage in a marine accident is extremely unlikely.</P>
    <P>I am also advised that the increase in reprocessing capacity should not lead to a proportionate increase in release of radioactivity to the environment. All releases of radioactivity to the environment in the United Kingdom are subject to strict regulation under United Kingdom law which conforms to recommendations of the International Commission for Radiation Protection and directives of the EEC for the protection of members of the public from the dangers of radiation. Authorised release limits are fixed for the site overall, not for the individual sections of the plant and I am further advised that there are no indications that the release limits for the Windscale reprocessing complex will be increased when British Nuclear Fuels Limited expansion proposals are being considered by the United Kingdom licensing authorities.</P>
    <P>Highly radioactive waste or solid low active waste are not discharged into the Irish sea from the Windscale plant.  Liquid effluents of very low activity are produced in the final stage of fuel reprocessing.  These effluents are collected in tanks for monitoring before discharge into the Irish sea. The resulting radiation levels in the Irish sea are constantly monitored by the United Kingdom authorities and by the Irish National Radiation Monitoring Service.  In addition, the Nuclear Energy Board which was recently set up to advise my Department on nuclear energy matters, has established close liaison with British Nuclear Fuels Limited and the relevant regulatory agencies to ensure that we are kept fully informed both of the current situation and on any future plans particularly such as Windscale that might affect radiation levels in the Irish sea.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Nuclear Energy Board that the dose rate arising from current radioactivity levels in the Irish sea is well within the safe limits <Col N="1295" /> recommended by the International Commission for Radiation Protection and that it does not represent a hazard to the public in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister state if he or his Department have had discussions with the British authorities on this matter in order to be satisfied as to the safeguards that the British propose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The safeguards the British have are international safeguards and would be laid down under the EEC, under Euratom or under the International Commission for Radiation Protection.  There have been no direct discussions with my Department, but the chief executive officer of the Nuclear Energy Board has been in England for discussions with British Nuclear Fuels Limited on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister appreciates the anxiety of people living, for example, in my constituency, which is not all that far away from Windscale.  Do I take it from his reply that he feels there is no need to worry about this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Deputy for the question and for the way he has put his supplementary now.  I give him an assurance in this regard that we are satisfied.  I would say also that one of the things that has been concerning me for some length of time is the necessity for some form of education of public opinion on the safe levels of radiation discharge and on all matters relating to nuclear energy.  I have had discussions with the chief executive officer and the relevant officers in my Department on this matter.  I am meeting the Nuclear Energy Board some time within the <Col N="1296" /> next week&mdash;not for this reason, it was not set up for this&mdash;and I propose to put that point to them also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is <Col N="1300" /> satisfied with the progress of the &ldquo;Guaranteed Irish&rdquo; campaign; and if he will examine the profit margins allowed by home manufacturers in comparison with those allowed by manufacturers outside this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Independent research had indicated that the Irish consumer was experiencing considerable difficulty in identifying Irish-made products at shop level.  The &ldquo;Guaranteed Irish&rdquo; programme was introduced primarily to overcome the problem.  Since its introduction in October, 1975, the symbol has been adopted by more than 500 companies who between them account for approximately 70 per cent of the consumer goods produced by Irish manufacturers for the domestic market.  In the same period these companies have directly and voluntarily contributed a sum in excess of £120,000 to the campaign&mdash;a strong indication of Irish industry's satisfaction with the concept. Consumer research undertaken within four months of its introduction indicated 76 per cent public awareness of the symbol and its meaning.  I am satisfied that the &ldquo;Guaranteed Irish&rdquo; campaign is making real progress towards the achievement of its objectives.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked whether the profit margins allowed by domestic and foreign manufacturers would be examined.  There would be major difficulties in carrying out such an examination; these difficulties concern the number of manufacturers involved, the problem of obtaining the necessary information especially from foreign manufacturers, the fact that profit margins fluctuate from year to year and the variety of discount practices in the distributive trades.  I could not justify having a task of this magnitude undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has noted a recent proposal by companies providing motor insurance cover to introduce special forms for completion at the scene of an accident; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is involved here is the introduction to Ireland of the European Accident Statement by the Irish motor insurers.  The statement is a motor accident report form which is completed at the scene of the accident by the parties involved.  Completion of the form is voluntary.</P>
      <P>The statement which is in use in 11 European countries has distinct advantages for drivers in that standard insurance questions are listed and for insurance companies, acurate information is confirmed at the scene of the accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Irish motor insurance companies have begun circulating copies of the statement to new policy holders and will enclose copies <Col N="1304" /> of the statement with renewal notices over the next 12 months.  Copies of the statement will be sent by the companies to policy holders on request.</P>
    <P>I have certainly taken note of this development in the motor insurance market and have already publicly welcomed it as an initiative to speed up the settlement of motor accident claims and to help contain the increasing cost of settling these claims.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it was intended to cater for the pupils of Dunderrow national school in new schools to be built in Kinsale.  The situation has recently been complicated by the unwillingness of the Dunderrow parents to participate in these arrangements. <Col N="1305" /> The position has been clarified in the case of the proposed new school for girls in Kinsale and it is hoped that it will soon be clarified also in the case of the new school for boys in Kinsale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, it was made clear in this House in October, 1973, that grants would not in future be made for extensive reconstruction or improvement of one-teacher or two-teacher national schools. It is accordingly not possible to allow a grant towards the cost of the central heating which I understand has been installed in Rathaniska national school.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if, in view of the fact that students from the Twenty-six Counties attending the New University of Ulster may be faced with a prohibitive increase in fees next year, he will make representations to the appropriate Minister in Great Britain to ensure that these students will not be discriminated against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understood that the fees charged in the New University of Ulster, Coleraine, have general application to students from any part of <Col N="1306" /> Ireland.  It would not be considered appropriate to make representations as suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that the situation is that a common fee increase is being introduced.  The problem is that grants are being increased in the UK for students from the UK to compensate for the increases that are taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that it is reliably reported that there will be a higher rate increase for foreign students, apart from the offsetting effect of any increased grant, and that this rate may be applied to the few students from Donegal who attend the University?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>I appreciate that they are responsible people and that they are anxious to do the best they can for their own school.  It is the Minister's responsibility to ensure that there is a fair distribution of resources between all schools.  I have already indicated that this school is doing as well, in the matter of allocation of teachers by comparison with the number of pupils, as similar schools in the country. Indeed, they are doing somewhat better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney, Mr. Barrett, Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Wilson</b> asked the Minister for Education whether his attention has been drawn to Press reports (details supplied) regarding the manner in which a teacher who is a GAA All-Star had been penalised by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The long-standing arrangements which have been authorised in this matter are as follows:</P>
      <P>Teachers who are playing members of teams or officials authorised by the Central Council of the Gaelic Athletic Association are permitted to absent themselves from their schools for the purpose of taking part in the annual American tour of hurling and football matches on the following conditions:</P>
      <P>(i)  the teacher to be paid his full salary and allowances for the period of absence;</P>
      <P>(ii)  the teacher to be required to employ and pay an acceptable substitute;</P>
      <P>(iii)  the teacher to obtain the prior permission of the manager of his school for his absence; and</P>
      <P>(iv)  the GAA to refund to the Department the actual amount of salary and allowances paid to the teacher for the period of absence, plus 15 per cent in respect of pension, minus the amount actually paid at the regulation rate to a substitute.</P>
      <P>It cannot be accepted that these arrangements represent any penalising of the teachers by the Department as has been suggested by the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether the news which appears in today's paper is correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy be more particular?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary say whether the player in question has been guaranteed that there will be no break in service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1312" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to service is this: there was an impression that a whole year would be lost whereas in fact for pension purposes the time lost would only be the precise length of time that the man was absent, not the whole year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary happy to tell us that in circumstances where a teacher got national and international recognition, he proposes penalising to the extent that he will deduct certain pension rights from him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>These arrangements which are exactly the same as the arrangements which operated in the tenure of office of the previous Government, are being operated on this occasion by the Department of Education. There is no change whatever in policy on this matter and I should like to assure all concerned on that score.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A similar case never arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in this case appears to be that whereas I indicated that under condition 4, the GAA would refund to the Department the actual amount of salary and allowances paid to the teacher for the period of absence plus 15 per cent in respect of the pension, minus the amount actually paid at the regulation rate to a substitute, in a letter dated 12th August, 1976 the GAA informed the Department that the teachers were notified before leaving on the tour that it would be necessary to make a refund to the Department and that the teachers would be personally responsible for such refund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not accept that it is ludicrous that we should be discussing here a situation where a teacher in the Department which is responsible for the development of sport and recreation is being subjected to this treatment by him on the premise that such was the case years ago?  Could he not do better?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1313" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear the Deputy was not listening to the reply I gave.  The position in the past was&mdash;and I understand this was the policy then adopted by the GAA&mdash;that they would agree to the conditions operating to the effect that the GAA would refund to the Department the actual amount of salary and allowances paid to the teacher for the period of absence plus 15 per cent.  On this occasion the GAA decided they would not do so and that it would be a matter for the teachers themselves to make the refund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary exercise his own discretion in the matter particularly when he is dealing with a man who is engaged in physical education in a comprehensive school as big as the school in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has he discretion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no discretion in cases like this.  These are standard arrangements which were agreed with the GAA early in the fifties and they are observed in this case.  Whereas in the past, apparently, the GAA were prepared to make the refund as I indicated in my reply, in this case they decided that they would not do so and that it would be the responsibility of the teachers.  There is no change on the part of the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Were there any All-Star teams in the fifties when these regulations were made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is widening the scope of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that it is time to review these regulations in view of what has happened to this young man?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy probably knows better than I do, the GAA have been sending teams abroad under these arrangements, approved by the Central Council of the GAA, for many years.  They may not have been designated &ldquo;All-Star&rdquo; but they were representative teams which went <Col N="1314" /> abroad and were approved by the GAA.  These arrangements were operated on those occasions by the GAA.  They have changed their situation somewhat on this occasion.  I repeat: there has been no change of policy in this matter on the part of the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a question of being penalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to put this in the form of one question because I am personally involved in this.  I should like to know the date of the agreement to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred and I should like to ask if he is aware that players from the Six Counties are paid their full salaries and do not suffer in their pension rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements made in regard to leave of absence for teachers in Northern Ireland are a separate matter for which their Department of Education have responsibility.  Presumably they apply&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>They are more liberal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to organisations which are in contact with the Department of Education and Science in Britain.  Our arrangements are our own affair.  The date of the agreement is 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Department got sums of money from the GAA in the intervening period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that they have, that these arrangements have been operating with the GAA in the past in accordance with the conditions outlined in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary's heart bleed for me if I told him that they did not apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary accept that there is no exact precedent for the position which he now has to consider?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a separate question.</P>

    <Col N="1315" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he said it happened before.  There is no exact precedent.  I had that responsibility for some time and I cannot recall the matter coming before me.  In view of the absence of an exact precedent would the Parliamentary Secretary not now deal with it <i>de novo?</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge the arrangements for the payment of teachers have never been the responsibility of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education. This is a question of teacher's pay, not of sports policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say how much money was involved in the refund referred to, plus the auctioneer's fee of 15 per cent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to evade the Chair.  I want to make one little point in regard to the superannuation. Is the Parliamentary Secretary sure that it would not involve in certain circumstances the loss of one full year's recognition of pension service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The break in service of 14 days from 18th May to 1st June means that his increment date is deferred from 3rd September to 17th September.  It also constitutes a break of 14 days for pension purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The child in question is under ten years of age and resides just over two miles from the nearest school.  He is, therefore, eligible for <Col N="1316" /> free transport and can be conveyed to Manor Kilbride national school from the nearest pick-up point to his home on the existing route of the transport service to that school.  I understand that the child has not availed himself of that facility because his parents consider that the pick-up point is too far from home. The cost of an extension of the route to bring the service nearer to his home would not be warranted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice when it is proposed to introduce legislation for the purpose of amending the law in relation to adoption and bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is that Bills proposing amendments of the Constitution in relation to the matters referred to will be introduced as soon as possible. The precise content of the Bills will require very careful consideration and I am not in a position to indicate how soon they will come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what the Minister has said, am I right in assuming that there will have to be two Bills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that would be my understanding, but I would have to be guided by the Attorney General on the technicalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>His thinking at present is that there are likely to be two Bills.  Could I ask the reason for the delay in the introduction of the Bill dealing with the adoption question, seeing that this matter was raised by the Minister and some of his colleagues here last May or June, that is four or five months ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in the course of that debate when the matter was announced first, it is a most complicated question.  The complications arise from the form of amendment required and also, having regard to the scope and extent of the amendment, from the complexity of the problem.  The Deputy will recall that <Col N="1317" /> during that debate what came out was that we were trying to ensure a position that will be closing off any constitutional challenge in this area in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Can he appreciate, and say, that there is a widespread anxiety amongst the parents of adopted children with regard to what is in their eyes a seemingly long delay from the time the announcement was made here by the Minister for Justice, and I think by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, up to the present time; that we have heard nothing further on it and we have no idea or timetable as to when this legislation for a proposed amendment to the Constitution will be initiated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of anxiety in this area generally as a result of the case which gave rise to this development.  However, the Deputy knows that the amending legislation introduced some time ago has allayed that anxiety to a very large if not a total extent.  What is involved now in the constitutional amendment is to put the matter beyond any doubt whatever. I am conscious of the need for as speedy progress as possible and I can assure the Deputy that there has been no delay behind the scenes in the analysis of the work that is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say in relation to the second part of the question, that is the question of amending the law in relation to bail, whether or not he is satisfied that the Supreme Court at present cannot have another look at the situation as it is, in view of the change of circumstances which occurred on the question of bail since the Supreme Court gave its decision on the Callaghan case of 1966?  Perhaps the Minister might consider that if this were possible there might be no need whatsoever for an amendment to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking me in effect to give an opinion on what is a legal matter, that is whether the Supreme Court has an inherent right to overrule itself.  This is a matter of major constitutional implications <Col N="1318" /> and I would go so far as to say that the law is not entirely clear in that regard.  I would not like to go any further because I would be involving myself in offering a legal opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Supreme Court held that they can have a second look at a question and if the circumstances so warrant it their decision could be modified or reversed?  If this is so perhaps the Minister might consider referring the question of bail to the Supreme Court to examine it in order to avoid the possible necessity of an amendment to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

Is the Minister saying that, when that does not suit the Executive, the Executive propose to take from the Supreme Court the very important judicial function which they have as guarantors of fundamental rights?

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the disquiet caused by the recent direction of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána given to members of the force in the course of tours of inspection that a minimum number of prosecutions should be brought annually by each member; and if he is aware that this direction will have detrimental effect on investigatory work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Commissioner that no direction such <Col N="1322" /> as that referred to in the question has been issued by him either generally or in any district.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the long-established practice, I am not prepared to comment on&mdash;nor indeed would I normally even disclose&mdash;the content of instructions given by the Commissioner to members of the force on matters of internal Garda administration. In the particular circumstances, however, and bearing in mind the circulation of misleading assertions, I think it right to say for the information of the House that the Commissioner, in the course of tours of inspection, has been seeking to secure a higher standard of crime prevention and of law enforcement, with particular reference to offences that may not have been receiving sufficient attention, including traffic offences and especially those traffic offences which have a bearing on the safety of human life and limb.  He has also drawn attention to the evasion of road tax which, apart from the loss to the Exchequer, is unfair to those who do pay the tax, and to various other matters that are of growing public concern to many people such as serious breaches of the licensing laws, especially those that involve drinking by young people.</P>
      <P>There is no question of any member of the force having to meet a specific quota of summonses.  In fact a decision to issue a summons does not rest with the individual garda who makes a detection.  On the other hand, for the record I must add that this does not mean that the record of detection by individual members in any particular area is irrelevant or of no concern to their superior officers. It is one pointer, even though not the only one, to their level of interest in and commitment to their job and I take for granted that it is a matter that is referred to frequently by all supervising ranks, and not just by the Commissioner personally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

The so-called petty prosecutions can be relevant to the collection of tax for the Revenue; they can be relevant to the enforcement of the licensing laws, particularly with regard to the abuse of young people drinking, and they can be relevant to the safety of citizens on the roads.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the circular is to enable the public to be given the best possible service from the available resources, especially to release men for additional foot patrol and beat duty and, while the new system is, I understand, similar to that operated in many areas in England and elsewhere, its operation will be monitored with particular care in the first few months so that any problems may as far as <Col N="1325" /> possible be ironed out.

      <P>For example, the exceptions are when engaged in Border patrols and security duties when the local Garda officer considers it necessary to have two men in a vehicle and specifically when it is considered necessary during the hours of darkness when an element of risk is anticipated or when the patrol is in areas where crime, vandalism or rowdy conduct is prevalent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of persons granted bail by the courts since the 1966 Supreme Court decision on bail; and the number of such persons who were subsequently convicted of offences while on bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the ordinary course, statistics are not compiled in a way that would show the information sought by the Deputy.  However, in the aftermath of the 1966 decision of the Supreme Court which is referred to in the question, the Garda Síochána maintained special records for a number of years, after which they asked to be relieved of the chore of keeping them as the work was exceptionally time-consuming and the figures they already had collected were sufficient to indicate what was happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The records in question covered the period 1st January, 1967, to 31st December, 1973, and show that in that period a total of 2,391 persons were found to have committed a total of 9,229 offences while on bail.  These offences include cases in respect of <Col N="1327" /> which there were formal convictions, cases which were proved but no formal conviction was recorded pursuant to the Probation of Offenders Act, and cases &ldquo;taken into consideration&rdquo; by the courts when passing sentence.</P>
    <P>What may be even more significant than the total numbers for the period is the trend that showed itself.  In 1967 the figures were 183 persons on bail committing 590 offences.  By 1973 the annual figure had jumped to 513 persons committing 1,775 offences.  Deputies will no doubt have noted that all these figures relate to a period before there was any dispute about legal aid fees and cannot be explained by suggestions that the problem was a side-effect of that dispute.</P>
    <P>No figures are available showing the total number of persons released on bail nor is that figure of any relevance to the proposal to recommend a constitutional amendment since there is no question whatsoever of any proposal to introduce a general restriction on the right to bail but only a provision that would enable the courts, in deciding whether to grant bail, to have regard in any particular case to the likelihood that the person will commit offences if allowed bail.  It would, of course, still be a matter for the court's discretion.  This was the accepted practice in this country up to 1966 and it is still the practice in Britain and in many other countries.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to make a statement about the meeting of the European Council in The Hague on Monday and Tuesday last, 29th and 30th November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was the sixth of these meetings attended by myself and the Minister for Foreign Affairs since the series was inaugurated in Dublin in March of <Col N="1359" /> last year.  The meetings take place without any formal agenda and conclude without any formal communiqué. However, it has become usual to issue statements or declarations on some of the subjects discussed and I am arranging to have those issued on this occasion laid before the House.</P>
    <P>At the outset, we agreed to discuss the following subjects, though not necessarily in this order:</P>
    <P>The economic and monetary situation;</P>
    <P>Relations with Japan;</P>
    <P>The North/South dialogue on relations between the developed and the developing world;</P>
    <P>The Tindemans Report on European Union;</P>
    <P>International terrorism; and</P>
    <P>Monetary Compensatory Amounts.</P>
    <P>I will deal with these items shortly but first I should like to make a few general comments on the more important issues.  The Hague Council was useful for two reasons.  First, it enabled us to get a good view from the heads of Government of the countries of the Community, which, with the United States, are responsible for about half of total world trade, of the prospects of economic progress in 1977.  I can summarise these views quite simply.  They are sombre, with a prospect of a further rise in oil prices, continuing instability in currencies and the probability that inflation in many countries will not be reduced to the extent that had originally seemed likely.  References to unemployment, due now more to deep rooted structural changes taking place in the economies of Europe than to cyclical causes amenable to remedy by ordinary demand management policies, were notable.  What I thought was especially relevant to our circumstances was the reference to a more widespread understanding by both sides of industry as to just how serious current problems are and to the degree of agreement in many countries on the measures necessary to solve them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> The implications for us&mdash;depending more than most countries of the Nine on external trade for the maintenance of employment and standards of living&mdash;are obvious.  They are of immediate importance to those engaged in the current negotiations on incomes in 1977.  When some of the most powerful countries in the world are deeply worried about the prospects, we cannot go blindly along as if the problems of unemployment, inflation and possible stagnation in trade did not exist.</P>
    <P>The Council was also useful in that it enabled me to raise at the highest level the effect which the present system of monetary compensatory amounts is having on our economy. This point has been made time and again by the Ministers for Finance, Agriculture and Fisheries, and Foreign Affairs at different Council meetings and some amelioration has been obtained.  But the present disorder in exchange rates has raised the issue to a different level.  It is no longer a question affecting any one group or sector but a distortion warping the entire economy.  The system itself is of great complexity.  Correction of the present difficulties will involve large sums of money and affect many countries of the Community.  It may even affect some fundamental financial mechanisms.  We did not expect the issue to be resolved at the European Council.  These Councils, as Deputies know, do not take formal decisions but give orientations or instructions which facilitate decisions by the relevant institutions of the Community. The Hague Council heard our views with understanding.  They agreed that the question of monetary compensatory amounts should be discussed by the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture and Fisheries at an early meeting. These were the two major issues as far as we were concerned.  I will go on to deal with the other items.</P>
    <P>The trading successes of Japan have been attributable in some measure to restrictive measures of various kinds affecting imports.  From a Community point of view, the Japanese have been too successful to the extent that the Community's deficit on trade with the <Col N="1361" /> country this year is expected to be £2,350 million&mdash;having risen perhaps fifteen fold since about 1970.  The Community had called on the Japanese Government to take measures to redress this imbalance and their response was received shortly before The Hague meeting.  The subject was discussed by the Council which issued a statement.  <i>Inter alia,</i> this noted with satisfaction that the Japanese Government were willing to co-operate with the European Community on the basis of a mutual understanding in solving the problems which have arisen.  It also indicated that particular attention was required to the need for a rapid expansion of Japanese imports from the Community. I would hope that the measures to be taken will lead to a further rapid growth in our own exports to Japan which have already shown a remarkable increase this year.</P>
    <P>Under the heading, North/South dialogue there was a wide-ranging discussion of a whole range of matters relating to international economic co-operation, including trade negotiations in the GATT, discussions on commodities in UNCTAD and, in particular, the state of play in the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris.  One of the major difficulties here is the size of the indebtedness of many developing countries and the question of how they are to be helped in meeting their liabilities.  I intervened in the debate to emphasise the necessity for a positive and constructive approach to the problems of developing countries.  In return for this approach we would expect moderation in the more excessive demands of developing countries.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Tindemans Report I again expressed my appreciation of Mr. Tindemans's work which provided a major signpost on the way to European integration.  In commenting on his report, I said that, in some areas, we would have been happier if there had been a greater will to make progress: for example, if it had been possible to accept more clear-cut commitments to arrive at common decisions in the areas of external <Col N="1362" /> policy as Mr. Tindemans had proposed.</P>
    <P>I also expressed some disappointment that the Foreign Ministers' discussions on the report had not led to a real and substantive exchange of views on economic and monetary union, and on the important issues arising in relation to social and regional policy, and to the scale of Community action needed to counteract the centripetal effects of economic and monetary union and to narrow the economic and social disparities between member states.  Obviously a real improvement in the decision-making process of the Community is a prerequisite for any further enlargement of the Community.  Finally I indicated our agreement with the statement which has been issued on the report.</P>
    <P>While this statement does not go as far as we would wish in a number of respects, I think the important thing now is to make practical progress in realising European Union within the framework which has been agreed. Progress towards this goal and the further steps which could be taken will now be considered regularly each year by the European Council on the basis of reports which the Foreign Ministers and the Commission have been invited to submit to us.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that at the July meeting of the European Council we made a declaration inviting Ministers of Justice to draw up a convention&mdash;to be open to ratification by non-member states of the EEC&mdash;under which the member states would undertake to extradite or to bring to trial terrorists who take hostages.  As part of the follow-up to this declaration some questions were referred to the European Council for clarification at this meeting so that the drafting of a convention could go ahead.  These questions related to such issues as whether or not the proposed convention should be opened to other countries at the present stage and whether it should cover other offences as well as the taking of hostages.</P>
    <P>After a short discussion it was agreed that the Foreign Ministers should be asked to consider and <Col N="1363" /> clarify these points.  This decision was taken on the explicit understanding that the terms of the European Council declaration of 14th July last are to remain unchanged and, in particular, that the provision that the convention must allow states to opt for trial as an alternative to extradition is not called into question.</P>
    <P>There were the main issues discussed at The Hague Council.  It is easy to criticise the outcome of some of these meetings on the grounds that they do not produce a definite conclusion or result.  This is probably to misunderstand the nature of the meetings. European Councils enable heads of Government to get together in a more or less structured way for an exchange of views on the more important questions affecting Europe and their countries.</P>
    <P>The meetings are arranged in such a way that they will often take place when there is no crisis or dramatic issue affecting the Community. Obviously, therefore, to expect concrete conclusions on all occasions is a mistake.  This approach does not take into account the benefits in mutual understanding which can develop simply because the Council exists and the meetings take place. Heads of Government meeting formally or informally like this cannot but get a better grasp of the problems of their counterparts; and relations cannot fail to develop which are to the advantage of the European Community and to the countries which it comprises.  I may add that while this is generally true there may well be features of the Council, in particular, in its organisation which could be improved. This is an aspect which is naturally receiving continuing attention.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach was expected to make a statement about the Summit but his announcement about the changes in the Cabinet took most people by surprise.  Normally appointments or assignments or designations of this nature are the subject matter of debate in this House.  On behalf of my party, I should like to <Col N="1364" /> reserve our right to such a debate, and to reserve our right to debate the reasons which gave rise to these Cabinet changes, not just because of the appointment of the Minister for Education as the European Commissioner but other events as well.  On the eve of the inauguration of the President which is not unassociated with these other events, it would be wrong for me, and inappropriate certainly on this day, to raise these matters.</P>
      <P>Certainly these appointments are entitled to come under discussion in this House.  It has been not only the practice but the right of the Opposition to discuss appointments of this nature.  I am giving that indication to the Taoiseach.  I might say in respect of the appointment of Deputy Peter Barry, the former Minister for Transport and Power, to the Department of Education, I rather anticipated such a change because of the hurried nature of his Press conference in his own home last weekend when he announced Government sanction after three-and-a-half years for the Cork harbour development plan.</P>

      <P>That is fair enough comment I think and Deputies will hear more.  Cut the &ldquo;tut, tuts&rdquo; and wait for it.  They will get a lot more if necessary.  I could go on to other appointments but I am not doing so for the reason I have stated.  I could be drawn.  In respect of the former Minister for Education, now Deputy Burke, as everybody knows, strong reservations were expressed about his anticipated appointment, not by members of this party, even though we might have shared some of those reservations but perhaps, reservations made more particularly by a spokesman on the Government benches. Now that he has been appointed he can be assured of our wholehearted co-operation in his assignment.  Obviously, henceforth he will not be subject in any way to the dictates of or influenced by the Irish Government. To that extent his position must be absolutely independent.  I would hope that he will have a position of responsibility, authority and influence within <Col N="1365" /> the Commission itself.  I shall come to that later.  But I can assure the now former Minister for Education that he will never be referred to by us as the Fine Gael Commissioner in Brussels.</P>
      <P>The statement just made by the Taoiseach can be summed up by saying that the meeting in The Hague was a sombre one and the outlook gloomy generally.  I know that the Taoiseach cannot be held responsible for that.  Nevertheless, there are spheres in which the Taoiseach and his Ministers might have exercised a greater degree of pressure on the Community.  The record of this Summit was one of no progress whatever on the burning question of monetary compensatory amounts or, to put it a different way, taxes on farm imports severely hitting the Irish economy at present.  In effect, the Irish taxpayer is now subsidising the British consumer of food products. That is an intolerable situation and one the Government should not allow to continue very much longer.  The Taoiseach referred to the fact that it was one of the important matters discussed at the Summit and said that, while they did not expect any solution to that problem to be reached at the Summit, nevertheless they did very little else except pass it on to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Of course, the Taoiseach did say that one of the functions of the Summit was to issue orientations and instructions.  It seems that, on this important issue, no orientation, instruction or direction whatever will be given to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or the Minister for Foreign Affairs when they meet in Council next week.  It seems to me that we are as far away from a solution as ever.  Obviously, the Commission must at present be giving it their attention.  The absence of monetary discipline within the Community is having a serious adverse effect on the one area in which there has been good progress made, on the one, solid achievement of the Community, that is, the common agricultural policy. That affects us more acutely than any other member of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" /> There are other general problems that seem to me not to have been properly tackled by our representatives in Brussels.  During our negotiations in 1972 we established a special protocol, Protocol No. 30, which surely must have some meaning&mdash;to recognise the special position of the Irish economy.  That position is now more acute than ever.  We have the highest inflation rate in Europe and unemployment rate as well.  Nevertheless, we seem to have to haggle and bargain on every aspect of Community funds at the disposal of member countries.  We have to haggle about FEOGA, the regional fund and about the social fund on occasion when it arises.  In the case of a country like Ireland, the weakest member of the Community, there should be, over and above institutional funds, a special fund that we should have negotiated under Protocol No. 30 made available for difficulties such as Ireland is experiencing at present.  We believe that these difficulties should be treated not through the institutions when they are special difficulties relating to special cases.  In passing, I believe that the MCAs should be adjusted at regular six-monthly or three-monthly periods, if possible, and not wait for a situation to develop and then post haste try to catch up when the damage has been done in the meantime.</P>
    <P>On the question of North/South dialogue I believe progress has been limited as well, not because of any problems arising within the European Council but mainly, I understand, because the Prime Ministers of the southern countries have not yet met and given any indication of what they require in these deliberations.</P>
    <P>On the Tindemans Report the Taoiseach rather whitewashed over what is the real situation.  It seems to us that Tindemans is being let quietly drop.  Obviously, there is a lack of political will in the Community at present to make any progress whatever not so much on political union &mdash;even though that is desirable&mdash;but on monetary and economic union as well.  It is unfair that Mr. Tindemans should have been given a commission to draw up a report which the <Col N="1367" /> Taoiseach himself said was an excellent exercise but now obviously has been forgotten.  A year after that report was submitted nothing has been done again, except submit it to successive meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers.  It illustrates what is endemic in the whole Community at present, a lack of political will to make the Community work and to justify the purposes for which it was set up in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The only other point I should like to make is that I gather one decision was come to, that the names of the Commissioners were approved by the European Council, by the Heads of Governments.  I should like to know from the Taoiseach whether any attempt was made to ensure that the special commission to be given to the Irish Commissioner would be an important one and that we will not be fobbed off with a minor one.  It is very easy to say here that that would be a matter for the President of the Commission, Mr. Jenkins, but we all know that, behind the scenes, these things can be and are done.  If the bargaining is tough enough and the muscle strong enough, member countries can get their way and we should not be fobbed off because we are the second smallest country in the Community in this respect.  I should like to hear from the Taoiseach whether any attempt was made to ensure that the Irish Commissioner will be given a commission of substance, authority and influence.  As I have already indicated, he must act independently of his own Government. Nevertheless, in an important assignment within the Commission, he certainly can, quite independently and openly, influence Commission policy in the sphere for which he is responsible; he can influence Commission policy in favour of his own country.  There is nothing partisan about such a development.</P>
    <P>I shall not make any further comments on the Taoiseach's statement except, again, to reserve our right to a debate, if we require it, on the assignments he has just announced and <Col N="1368" /> to wish the former Minister for Education well in his new assignment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time, I was dealing with our aims in promoting a good health system.  Perhaps I was inclined to harp back to the 1970s when this House implemented the Health Act and to dwell on the then aims of the health system.  We are falling short of our targets in regard to the general medical services scheme and we are falling far short on the hospitalisation end.  Any scheme dealing with health must visualise for the future a good hospital service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> Regrettably, for a long time past we have been talking of regional hospitals which we had hoped it would have been possible to establish in each health board area.  Not merely that but we had hoped that such hospitals would be backed up by a proper information service and by personnel from the faculties in universities. Furthermore, we had hoped that our medical school would be updated and a better training system established. We hoped that more young doctors would remain here and elect to work in their own country.  These were all targets and the shots we are firing now are falling far short of those targets.</P>
    <P>In regard to the general medical services, it looks as if the unbridled horse of inflation is seeing to it that we will not be able to accomplish the aims which we set out to achieve in 1970.  If we continue on present trends and if expenditure on the health services is going to outrun the rate of inflation, we will not be able to accomplish them within the next ten years.  I mentioned these matters to try to gain some perspective of the vast amount of work yet to be done in the Department of Health.  Due to the present-day trends, there is no hope of achieving the hospital programme we set out to achieve.  We have to settle for a lower target in the health services.  Our aim was to have at least a 300 bed surgical hospital for each health board area.</P>
    <P>In my health board area we find ourselves being forced back to the position whereby we have to amend our targets and settle for less.  We find ourselves in the position of reconstructing units which are there already and of adding extensions to them in order to try to update them and to bring them into more accord with present day medical demands.  It is a pity that we should have to amend our aims.  It denotes that we are not going to achieve the high level of hospitalisation or hospital services that we had hoped to achieve in the 1970s.  I dwell on this part of the scheme because hospitalisation calls for about 80 per cent of the total expenditure on health and demands the largest share of the Health <Col N="1370" /> Estimate.  If we have to settle this year for the same terms obtained last year on the general end of the scheme it indicates that we are not going to make any progress on the hospitalisation side.  It is a sombre picture not calculated to enthuse one with the aims we had even six years ago.  We now find that we cannot make further progress either on the GMS side of the scheme or on the hospitalisation end.  Let us make up our minds to co-ordinate our plans and if we have to settle for less, we should set aside the funds at the start of the year which will ensure that at least we shall be able to build one or two hospitals in some health board areas, or if we are not able to do that, to extend and update some of the units which are already there.</P>
    <P>If we in the House want to make a contribution and if we want to provide leadership for the community, we must be seen to be doing this unless we intend to become irrelevant. We will become irrelevant if, having made our estimates at the beginning of the year, we have to come back to the House looking for large Supplementary Estimates.  Unless we can check inflation we shall continue to go down hill.  It is not enough for the House to be satisfied with last year's performance.  Whilst in the past we have had a relatively low growth of population, we know that we now have the highest birth rate in the Community although we are the smallest unit in it.  If this continues, our population will have crossed the divide and will have started to grow rather than reduce as in the past.  Hopefully the rural population will increase and there will be an end to the trend of drifting from rural parts to the urban areas.  People put more emphasis now on the quality of life but this factor is taken in conjunction with the standard of living.  In the past people found it necessary to emigrate and this was responsible to a large extent for the decline in the population in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Each generation has its own difficulties and improved standards of living do not necessarily bring the <Col N="1371" /> contentment that people hope for. The greatest problems of our time relate to the absence of a sense of respect and to the trend towards violence in the community.  Contentment is closely related to health so one might well ask what we are doing in the context of the health services to make our community more content. The maturity of our citizens is an important factor in all this and the degree of maturity that we attain depends on the progress we make in relation to the operations of the various Departments of State.  We must ensure that we get the best returns possible for money spent but I submit that at present the results we are getting are not the best possible.</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which we could effect savings in the Department of Health but the one area that springs to mind first in this regard is that of the prescribing of drugs.  The extent to which our bill for drugs has increased is a scandal.  The best doctors that I have met would not prescribe drugs unless it was absolutely imperative to have recourse to them.  The general practitioner to day is over-prescribing.  Since the health scheme was implemented a few years ago there would not appear to be the same control in this area as there had been previously.  If we wish to be realistic in our approach to curbing the use of drugs we must take positive steps to achieve control and this is the place where those steps must be taken in the first place.  We should legislate for a rigid control in the field of the dispensing of drugs and, if necessary, provide for strict disciplinary action in respect of those who are regarded as over-dispensing. In regard to effecting savings there are many other subheads I could mention but suffice it for the moment to concentrate on the area of drug prescribing.</P>
    <P>Ours is a small country but if the present birth rate trend continues we can expect a greatly increased population and this would necessitate a rigid examination of expenditure under every subhead that comes before us.  However, the experts tell us <Col N="1372" /> that for some time our high dependency rate will continue.  It is regrettable that we have such a high rate of dependency, the highest in Europe, perhaps.  In the past we ascribed this situation to a high degree of emigration which left an imbalance in population make-up because those who emigrated were the able bodied while those who stayed at home were the older age groups and the very young. However, that trend is being reversed and in about ten years' time there should be no question of any such imbalance. In arriving at these views I am applying the rule of thumb, as the late President Roosevelt would have said, but I am convinced that an examination of present trends would confirm my opinion.</P>
    <P>As Members of this Parliament it is our responsibility to suggest ways and means of effecting savings especially when money is scarce, instead of sanctioning expenditures for some Departments to a degree where the moneys become totally irrelevant.</P>
    <P>To return for a moment to the question of drugs, I wonder if steps could be taken here similar to those taken in England.  I am not sure how the situation in England is working out in practice but it was designed rigidly to control the movement of drugs.  It is not very long ago since serious consequences could have arisen as a result of the use of a drug which was being used in hospitals and which also was being prescribed by vets.  The drug in question was as a specific against typhoid fever and was used only sparingly in our hospitals. It was also used by veterinary surgeons.  Now it would have been all right were it only used by veterinary surgeons but it was available to farmers and, that being so, there could have been very serious consequences were it not for the fact that this freedom of use was detected and the drug was quite rightly brought under rigid control.  I make the point in relation to one drug.  How many other dangerous drugs are available without control?</P>
    <P>I do not want to outstay my welcome. I have made a number of points <Col N="1373" /> and I have tried to summarise the position in regard to the general medical services and hospitalisation. We have on record all the information we need about hospitalisation.  In view of our income and the way we spend it, in view of the fact that the Department of Health is an intensive labour unit, in view of the fact that we have an increasing birth rate and an increasing demand for better hospitalisation and so on, it would be well to have another look at our plans for health over the next decade and, if necessary, adjust those plans in line with our income.  We should temper the wind to the shorn lamb.  It does not make for good management here or in the Department to make Estimates at the beginning of the year and then find we are short on our targets and unable to meet our commitments. That means coming back again for more money.  We should find ways and means whereby we could arrive at a more accurate estimate within which to work.  I suppose that would be the ideal.  For a number of years now we have been coming back regularly to discuss Supplementary Estimates.  Our objective should be directed towards saving and towards attempting to curb the erosion of our money so that it will do better work and go further.  If the House could give a lead in this direction we would be taking a substantial step forward in bringing about a balance and providing more up-to-date hospitalisation and better general health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to make a proper assessment of our health services and what is happening in the structure of those services.  It is difficult to make a worth-while contribution to this debate other than pinpointing the anomalies that exist in certain areas of our health services. In the last few years there have been adverse changes especially where medical cards are concerned. Thousands of medical cards have been withdrawn from people who are really entitled to them.  There was a time some years ago when borderline cases were given consideration.  I recall many Ministers for Health <Col N="1374" /> emphasising hardship cases.  How is a hardship case defined now?  A tremendous number of people need medical attention but because the medical card is withdrawn they and their children are deprived of this essential service.  The health boards and the executive officers can no longer plan to bring about some degree of perfection in the structure of our health services.  They are disheartened. Every day there is a cut in some particular service.  One thinks immediately of the transportation of the physically handicapped.  They are now deprived of transport to clinics for treatment.  If there are to be cuts those cuts should occur in areas where the incidence of hardship is lowest.</P>
      <P>Sufferers from coeliac disease are undergoing a good deal of anxiety and frustration because of the failure with regard to the EEC directive on the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs.  I am sure every Member has received representations about this.  There is a failure both in the case of imported foodstuffs and the case of home manufactured goods to display clearly the contents of the particular foodstuff.  This is of tremendous importance where gluten is concerned.  The Minister must be aware that gluten content has been shown to increase the risk of cancer in patients with coeliac disease.  I understand that the joint committee set up by this House has recommended that a directive on the packaging and labelling of foodstuffs be made mandatory. However, to relieve the anxiety and frustration of the people concerned, I hope the Minister will indicate his stand and the stand of the Government on this important issue, or are we to be dictated to from Brussels?  This is urgent and I hope the Minister will convey to the Minister for Health forthwith that a statement must now be made by the Department in relation to safeguarding people suffering from coeliac disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to make a worth-while contribution or make any suggestions to improve our health services because of the appalling lack of finance.  We must look at the areas of urgency, <Col N="1375" /> one of which is mental illness.  There is a lot to be desired in this area.  This disease is on the increase.  When people undergo treatment in a psychiatric hospital and are then discharged, there is no follow-up whatsoever to help those people to readjust themselves in the community.  The result is that these patients are being discharged and, after a short period, because of this lack of follow-up they find themselves back in the mental hospital.</P>
    <P>We should consider the idea of employing psychiatric nurses and training them specially for work outside hospital to help these people to readjust in the community.  We should also establish more clinics in our general hospitals rather than having people going to the large mental hospitals. I have no doubt that many a person in urgent need of treatment is prevented from receiving it because of the ordeal of going to a large mental hospital.  Therefore, it would be important for the Minister to establish out-clinics in general hospitals.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious that more consideration be given by the Minister to involving people in that service.  Here I am talking about the voluntary contribution of the many community service councils throughout the country who can help by inviting people who are suffering from mental illness to their homes, to community centres or other places of recreation.  This is a part that the community can play and it would be a worth-while involvement for the people in the community associations.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister some time ago what he or the Government are doing about the report of the committee on non-accidental injuries to children. There are many people inquiring about this report and still children are being battered.  I asked the Minister at the time if it was possible for hospitals to establish registers so that there would be some record of the number of children that are being abused.  This is an area that does not require big finances.  If a parent arrives at a hospital with her child and it is established that child has <Col N="1376" /> been abused, there should be some follow-up whereby some social worker or professional person would make contact with the home in question and, failing that, prosecution should be instituted.  This phenomenon is on the upward trend, brought about by drunkenness, bad temper or other reasons, but it is the unfortunate child who suffers and little or nothing is being done to prevent such abuses. The report on this is with the Department and we on the health boards who have been calling for the implementation of this report should know what the Minister is doing in this matter.</P>
    <P>There is another report where children are concerned.  It is very easy to set up a commission to investigate something, have them report back and then bury the report in a file in some Department.  I would inquire about the interim report of the task force on children at risk, which was submitted to the Department.  I am aware also that the final report is with the Minister for Health.  I would like to know what is being done about it.  Is the Minister providing the moneys for the implementation of this report?  Is there any hope that at least some of the report will be implemented next year?</P>
    <P>It is easy to talk about the amount of vandalism around the country but I should like to know what the Government have done about this problem. It is their responsibility to combat it.  There are many young boys and girls who are deprived of security in their homes and they are brought daily before our courts.  We have district justices throwing their hands in the air and saying to the individual charged: &ldquo;There is little or nothing I can do for you; I cannot put you into an institution because there is not one for you nor can I recommend you to a voluntary organisation that might help you&rdquo;.  Voluntary involvement is dealt with in this report and there are people who are prepared to help by the establishment of day schools.  The people of Cork have submitted a plan to the Department of Education for the establishment of such a school.  It is envisaged that this school would be attended by boys and girls who cannot <Col N="1377" /> cope with the national school curriculum.  Absence from school is the first indication of a young person going wrong.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Department of Health is mainly responsible for the task force report, but I believe that the Departments of Justice and Education are also involved.  I should like to know if the Government are coordinating the efforts of these Departments. Would information be made available to us as to what should be done in this regard in the new year? I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will convey to the Minister my views on this.  There are many people willing to help in this field and I would not like to see them being discouraged at this stage because of the failure of the Minister to make a statement on this report.</P>
    <P>Another matter that needs careful consideration is the question of the mentally retarded.  Many of them are placed in institutions for training but, unfortunately, when they reach 18 they are discharged.  There are no services available for them with the result that they are admitted to a mental hospital.  It is sad to see a young person being admitted to a mental hospital.  I know of hundreds of young people who, after leaving a training institution, are asked to spend the remainder of their lives in a mental hospital.  Surely we could help such people.  Our main aim should be to prevent them entering mental hospitals where they would be kept for the remainder of their lives.</P>
    <P>Here, again, we must talk of voluntary community involvement but one could go overboard on voluntary involvement. The people involved in this kind of work need backup services; they need social workers and specialised teachers to help them provide essential services for such people. The Government should devote more money to voluntary involvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this and it proves my case.  Young people are becoming involved in helping their own community.  I know of the involvement and the anxiety of the Parliamentary Secretary in this regard but, unfortunately, this year the contributions to a number of community services, such as meals on wheels, were cut.  We all realise the value of meals on wheels.  That service is keeping old people out of institutions.  We should realise that to keep an old person in an institution costs in the region of £43 per week and they are getting a meal at their door for as little as 20p. Old people are anxious to end their days at home, no matter how humble it might be.  The voluntary involvement necessary in this regard cannot be effective unless we have the backup services, the doctors, nurses and social workers.  I believe voluntary workers are saving the Southern Health Board a considerable amount of money at present.</P>
      <P>I should like to know how many geriatricians we have.  They are very important because they assess the health of old people on admission to hospital and they assess the conditions at home.  After the condition of the person has been assessed, he is discharged and referred to the voluntary community services.  People like that are needed if we are to keep our old people out of institutions.  I believe that there are only three such people in the country and I should like to know how many there are.  Geriatrics is a specialised field.  We should give more attention to the employment of such people in our institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am talking about areas which are not costly but which are vital to the community, such as the pre-school service, which is the responsibility of the Department of Health.  Pre-school groups are necessary for many reasons.  Some women have to work in order to maintain the home and others have to visit clinics.  These women should have somewhere to place their children during their <Col N="1379" /> absences.  I welcome the development of pre-school groups but one must use a certain caution in regard to developments of this kind.  I applaud the people who provide pre-school services but such services have a dangerous element.  How many people realise that children may be placed in a building which is a fire hazard?  It is all too easy for a person to start a pre-school group.  All buildings chosen for this purpose should be inspected.  I condemn the people who provide such a service for a quick cash return.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health should direct the issuing of licences for the establishment of pre-school groups.  It is always best to take action before it is too late.  I have mentioned this subject on a number of occasions and I have experience of some places in which I would be most reluctant to place a child.  I remember questioning the Minister on this matter.  His reply was that this matter was being investigated. The Department should issue directives in regard to the buildings used for pre-school groups and the qualifications of the personnel who are in charge of the children.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is that it is an area where it is possible to detect physical handicaps in children and that is why it is necessary to employ qualified personnel to take care of the children.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary has a great interest in this subject.  The position at present is that children are medically examined once a year.  They are again examined on admission to school.  When the late President Childers was Minister for Health he placed great emphasis on this subject. I maintain that children should be medically examined every six months over a two year period.  Members of the medical profession who are involved in child care will agree with this.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the State has no control over private nursing homes. An obligation should be placed upon doctors attending private nursing homes to record the examinations of children over a two year period.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1380" /> to stress the importance of this matter to the Minister.  There is no point in spending a great deal of money on our health services without thinking about a return for it.  Therefore, a proper health service must start with the care of children.</P>
    <P>Last year I spoke about the commission that was established to combat poverty.  I have great respect for the people who were appointed to that commission but, unfortunately, their work repeats what has been done by the various community associations and the National Community Service Council in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the transfer from the premises at Orchardstown to Marian Road is in no way a political matter.  There is no such thing as a clash of personalities between the people involved.  I have been asked to raise the matter of the suitability of the premises by the residents of the area.  This post office has been located at Orchardstown for approximately 15 years.  The premises in which the post office is located is considered to be suitable by the people in the area.  The premises concerned changed hands on one or two occasions and the post office remained.  This shop changed hands some time recently and it is as a result of this that the post office is now being transferred to Marian Road.  As a person who knows the area pretty well I think that the premises to which it is being transferred are in no way suitable for a post office.  The premises in which the post office was located over the years were ideally suitable.  It is one of the few post offices in the city or county where no robberies have taken place&mdash;not that that should be any recommendation&mdash;but from the <Col N="1381" /> security point of view the premises in which the post office was located were ideally suitable.</P>
      <P>The person who purchased the premises applied for the post office and one must be concerned about and be critical of the manner in which he was notified that he was not being given the post office.  It is a reflection on the Department.  This man was notified by a person who came into his office having seen an advertisement in the papers for a post office assistant.  He asked was this man looking for a post office assistant or was the post office being transferred. As a representative of the area in this House I think that reflects on the Department; there should be a better means of communication.</P>
      <P>This is my first time speaking on a matter like this and I do not say that the same type of procedure was not followed, perhaps, when another Government was in office.  I am dealing with the present instance and I am raising the matter at the request of the local residents from a business point of view.</P>
      <P>There are two other post offices in the Rathfarnham area, one in Rathfarnham village and one in Ballyboden. Geographically the site of the present post office, apart from the premises, was ideal.  The new location of the post office will leave one section of the Rathfarnham area without any post office premises.  From time to time I put down questions to the Minister regarding the setting up of new sub-post offices in the Tallaght-Walkinstown area and the reply has always been there are not sufficient houses or sufficient people in the area. In view of the development of the area and of a section of Firhouse which adjoins it, one feels there is need for a second post office, not to speak of changing the present premises. The Minister may say that he has not heard very much from the people in the area but it is only the past few days that it became known that the post office was being changed.  I understand that a number of people were in touch with his Department today and possibly others will be in touch with them tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> I appreciate the opportunity of being able to raise the matter here but I do not wish to use the full time available.  I am satisfied no politics are involved in the transfer.  I only recently came to know the man who has purchased the premises.  I barely know the man who owns the premises to which the post office is now going. Both are equal to me.  There is no question of a clash of personalities.  I believe business has been very good in the present location and the premises were ideally suitable.  If the manner in which this man was notified of the change is the procedure normally adopted, as a Member of the House I consider that it is a reflection on the system and I would ask the Minister to do something about it. Finally, I am satisfied that the premises to which the post office has been moved are not in any way as suitable as the premises from which it is being transferred.</P>

      <P>The Deputy indicated that he would not use all the time at his disposal.  I also propose to be brief.  I appreciate the Deputy's concern for his constituents and his interest in particular in the postal services in the area.  I also appreciate his acknowledgment that the appointment was, as he put it, in no way political and that no clash of personalities is involved.</P>
      <P>He raised another matter concerning what he called the method of notification.  I am informed that the normal method of notification in such cases was used, that the applicant, in whom I understand the Deputy to be interested, was written to on 23rd November last in this form: &ldquo;I am sorry to inform you that your application for the position of postmaster at Orchardstown post office was not successful.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy spoke about the location of the premises and that is one, but only one, of the circumstances taken into account by the postmaster selection board which made the appointment.  That board considered that the new premises are in fact as centrally situated in relation to the four adjacent sub-offices, Templeogue, <Col N="1383" /> Rathfarnham, Nutgrove and Ballyboden, as the premises in which the office is at present located.  Briefly the position is that (1) the vacancy occurred through the resignation of the former postmaster, (2) the vacancy was advertised in the normal way, (3) there was a number of applicants for the appointment, (4) the board made recommendations and (5) I appointed the candidate recommended by the board as the most suitable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> I think the Deputy will understand that in a matter of this kind it is appropriate for me to be guided by the postmaster selection board who have great experience in this matter. In particular I could not appoint any candidate not recommended as suitable by that board.  I appointed the candidate recommended by the board as the most suitable.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 7th December, 1976.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that a deciding officer assessed means at £10.65 per week against a person (name supplied) in County Kerry who is an unemployed school leaver who did his leaving certificate this year and cannot find any work; how the figure of £10.65 was calculated and the reasons for the discrepancy between this figure and other figures assessed <Col N="1332" /> as means against persons in a similar position throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>The means of the person concerned were assessed by a deciding officer for unemployment assistance purposes on the basis of the estimated value to him of the benefit or privilege of free board and lodging in his father's household.  The latter has a business and a holding and the assessment took into account the net income of the parents and the number of non-wage earning members of the household.  As will, no doubt, be apparent to the Deputy, assessment of means in cases of this kind depend directly on the circumstances of the individual households concerned, and accordingly the question of there being any discrepancy between the assessment in this case and those in the case of other persons in a similar position throughout the country does not arise.</P>
      <P>The applicant was advised of his right to appeal against the deciding officer's decision if he was dissatisfied with it but so far he has not done so.</P>

      <P>The implementation by Kinsale Urban District Council of the new national differential rent scheme has resulted in rent increases above the normal in a number of cases.  This has been due to the failure of the tenants concerned to return the appropriate income certificates to enable rents to be reassessed at regular intervals. The result is that rents have now been calculated on current incomes which have increased considerably since the tenants last submitted the appropriate income certificates.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 to 83, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the beef regulation the operation of the safeguard clause, under which cattle and beef imports into the Community may be suspended, is a function of the Commission.  While imports with some minor exceptions, have been suspended since July, 1974, the Commission has recently indicated that it proposes to lift the import ban <Col N="1357" /> with full effect from 1st April next.  It is envisaged that at the same time new trading arrangements with third countries should be introduced.  Under these arrangements, which are still being considered by the Council of Ministers, Community producers would be given greater protection.  The levy on imports would be increased progressively according as the Community market price fell below 98 per cent of the guide price and, in addition, the former special import regimes for young cattle and for manufacturing beef would be made more restrictive.</P>
    <P>I have already advocated in the Council of Ministers that all imports of cattle and beef should be subject to licensing control and I will continue to do everything possible to ensure that the new import arrangements will be adequate to safeguard the interests of Community beef producers.</P>
