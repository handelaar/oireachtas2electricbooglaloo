      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan (for Tadhg O Murchadha)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state when the scheme for road improvement to be carried out, out of the Road Fund, will be undertaken and the nature and extent of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The grant of £1,000,000 for work on roads will be allocated on the basis of the extent of unemployment throughout the Free State.  Steps have been taken to ensure that reliable unemployment returns are available and facilities are being provided to applicants by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to register at the exchanges, where necessary through the post offices, sub-post offices, and the Civic Guard stations.  When the figures are obtained in the course of a week or so my Department will consider schemes appropriate to each locality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if, when considering the question of unemployment, he will consider especially unemployment in the Gaeltacht which has resulted, particularly in my own constituency, from the inability of men who habitually went to Scotland to get any work there now. I do not think they are technically unemployed in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The unemployment grant will be distributed on the basis of the registered unemployed.  If the unemployed in the areas the Deputy refers to see to it that they are registered, through making proper use of the facilities now being placed at their disposal in the post offices and elsewhere, they certainly will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>Can men who were insured labourers in Scotland only register as unemployed in this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in Donegal the employment exchanges are very few and far between, and the unemployed men there have not been in the habit hitherto of registering?  It will take some time to inculcate that habit, and therefore, when the Minister is considering the Donegal returns, will he bear that point in mind, as probably for some time the returns may not be correct&mdash; they may be an under-estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Extra facilities are now being afforded, and I hope, within the next few days, that wide publicity will be given to these facilities.  Unemployed people will be asked to register, where there are no exchanges, in post offices and Civic Guard stations.  They will be given every help in registering and in filling up the necessary forms.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is prepared to consider extending the scope of the School Meals (Gaeltacht) Act, 1930, to Gaeltacht areas not yet included, and, if for this purpose he will have this matter referred to the County Medical Officers of Health for their views on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Customs Duties (Maize Meal) (Provisional Imposition) Order, 1932, which was made on the 29th day of April, 1932, by the Executive Council under Section 1 of the Customs Duties (Provisional Imposition) Act, 1931 (No. 38 of 1931), and a copy of which was laid on the Table of Dáil Eireann on the 3rd day of May, 1932, be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago a duty was imposed on maize meal imported into the United Kingdom in consequence of which there was reason to anticipate <Col N="2230" /> increased imports of maize meal into this country as well as other undesirable reactions on the industry here.  A number of maize mills in certain parts of the Free State which had an export trade to the United Kingdom, averaging over 50,000 cwts. per annum, lost that trade, and in some cases there was reason to anticipate that these mills would go out of business.  Under the circumstances, the Executive Council decided to impose a duty on maize meal imported here.  The position of the industry is that we have always been able to supply by far the greater part of our requirements from our own mills.  Only a very small proportion of them had to be imported. Eleven-twelfths of the requirements of the country were produced at home, and only one-twelfth imported.  The existing mills here were and are more than capable of supplying all the requirements of the country.  The imposition of the duty has given the industry considerable assistance.  It has already resulted in the establishment of a number of new mills in the Saorstát, and has not had any detrimental effects on the farmers who purchase the meal.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil last week we had certain allegations made that merchants, particularly in Donegal, had availed of the imposition of the duty for the purpose of charging exorbitant prices.  I stated on that occasion that no increase in price on the part of a merchant to a consumer was justified as no increase in wholesale prices had taken place.  I have since ascertained that, instead of an increase, the wholesale price of meal in Donegal has been reduced by 5/- per ton.  That reduction applies to all mills now operating in Donegal and as, since the imposition of the duty a number of Derry millers have commenced operations in the county, the competition there now is particularly keen.  In a few small districts along the Border where the farmers were accustomed to draw their supplies of meal from towns on the Six County side, certain temporary difficulties have been experienced, due in some cases to the absence of merchants selling Saorstát meal, and in other cases to the fact <Col N="2231" /> that the Saorstát meal had to be transported a somewhat longer distance.  But these difficulties are disappearing now, and will shortly have disappeared altogether.</P>
    <P>In one or two areas in the County Monaghan increased prices prevailed for a time.  There was no justification for these increases, and when they took place millers from outside the county went in, and competition had the effect of bringing prices down again.  Altogether, it can be said that the result of the imposition of the duty has been highly satisfactory.  Over a great part of the country which was always supplied from the Saorstát mills the price position is the same.  In one part of the country the price has come down.  Considerable additional employment is being given, and the danger of an adverse situation arising in connection with the industry has been removed.  I confidently recommend the Resolution to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to protest most vigorously against the passing of this Resolution.  To my mind the frame of mind which drafted this Resolution has proceeded on a basis which is absolutely insane.  I do not say that the mind is insane, but I do say that it has proceeded on a basis that is insane.  I say that for this reason, that everybody admits that agriculture is the foundation of this whole State.  I have never heard anyone to contest the proposition that if you tax the raw material of an industry you must injure that industry.  Everyone knows&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture must know&mdash; that Indian meal is the foundation of the whole pig trade in this country, of a great part of our egg trade, and that it is the foundation largely of the in-feeding of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the price has not risen.  It could not rise because the world cost of maize has fallen, but what I want to know is, has the price of meal fallen as much as it would have fallen if the tariff was not put on? It certainly has not, and our farmers, who are in competition with other farmers who have world supplies and world prices available to them, are <Col N="2232" /> paying more for Indian meal now than they would have had to pay if this tariff were not on.  As the Minister has said, we import only one-twelfth of our total requirements in a perfectly free trade market for Indian meal. Outside competition kept the Irish mills down to the world competitive price for Indian meal.  There was never any necessity to put on a tariff.  As a matter of fact, our mills were supplying virtually the entire market, and would continue to do so if a tariff were never put on.  But what they will do in the future is, they will deprive our farmers of what our farmers are entitled to, and that is the benefit of world prices for maize meal, because maize milled outside the Twenty-six Counties cannot be brought in here to compete with the maize milled inside the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
    <P>The Minister has entirely overlooked the question of freight charges on Indian meal.  He does not seem to realise the possibility that the difference in freight rates on Indian meal may result in the price of Indian meal rising appreciably in certain areas. That is a very complicated question and one that it would be very difficult to go into fully here.  I mentioned it here a couple of days ago, and if the Minister looks into it he will find that with the new distribution of these small mills that have sprung up since the tariff was put on it will result in Indian meal getting dearer as a consequence of less favourable freight rates being available to the small mills than were available to the large mills formerly.  I oppose most strongly the motion to approve of this Order, because I am convinced that it is based on a most disastrous policy for the agricultural industry of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Dillon has the sow by the wrong ear when he refers to Indian meal as the raw product. I think that the raw product in this case is maize and not maize meal. I know that a considerable amount of employment, ranging from £1 to £2 a ton, will be given in milling the maize in this country.  I think most Deputies will agree that a tax on maize <Col N="2233" /> meal will redound to the advantage of the home mills.  Of the one twelfth of our total requirements that we import, could the Minister say what proportion of that comes across the land frontier of the country, and how much of it is sea borne?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to question the full meaning of Paragraph 4 of the Order.  It states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The duties imposed by this Order shall not be charged or levied on any goods which are shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been consigned from a country within the British Commonwealth of Nations, and produced entirely in a country or countries within the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
      <P>I am assuming that the last phrase is designed to get at the grain grown in the Argentine or the Danubian countries, and that meal made from grain grown in either the Argentine or the Danubian countries would be subject to the tax.  If that is the case, I would like to have some indication from the Minister as to what he considers the likely difficulty of those who have to deal with this Order, in identifying meal when it comes in, as most of it does come in, across the land frontier in the country.</P>
      <P>There is the further point which arose here at an earlier stage, and to which Deputy Dillon referred to-day&mdash; the question of price.  The Minister states that the position is now entirely satisfactory for a reason that did not commend itself as entirely satisfactory to Deputy Dillon, and will not commend itself as entirely satisfactory to anybody who knows the trend of prices for the raw material, that is, the grain itself, in recent months.  The Minister, however, appears to be satisfied on that, but he appears not to be satisfied on the other point raised by Deputy Dillon that freight charges would make a difference, and if the Minister is going to take these drastic powers he spoke of, of even putting people in jail where there is an increase in price, will he take such things as the freight question into his consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2234" /> The other day we mentioned this by way of supplementaries to questions asked.  It did not appear as if the Minister had clearly before him the ordinary charging methods of railway companies, that is to say, that you cannot take a freight charge, examine it and declare it to be reasonable or otherwise, simply on the mileage over which a particular thing has to be drawn.  It did not appear to be clear that the Minister understood that railway companies, in general, favour the long haul, and consequently give a correspondingly lower rate, and that even where there is a short haul it will often have, over the same distance in different parts of the country, quite different rates, dependent on whether, or not, there is competition.  In the old days it was entirely of the sea type, and now it will be either sea or road.  I mention these points because they show the difficulty of getting a clear view as to the effect on prices of any tariff.  The Minister appears to think it is clear, but I do not regard it as entirely clear, on that point. The Minister appears to think he will have no difficulty in checking prices, but, on the other point, I agree with Deputy Dillon that an increase is bound to occur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister satisfied himself that the powers sought in this Order will not increase the cost of maize meal to such people as pig producers and others?  Within a few miles radius of Cork City there are numbers of cottiers, market gardeners and others who feed and produce pigs. They are a very industrious section of the community, and I want to know if the Minister has satisfied himself that the cost of production for these people will not be increased, and that, consequently, the cost of the ultimate product, namely, bacon or pork, will not be increased to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if there is any possibility of exercising any stop to the control of the distribution of the raw material, maize.  I understand that combines, more or less, control the market in the raw material, and will only distribute it on condition that certain prices are <Col N="2235" /> maintained.  The Minister is probably aware that such a condition exists and I think it is far more important to stop that particular side of the evil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware also, apart altogether from the question of foreign combines referred to by Deputy Brasier, that there are within our own country, persons who are prepared to exploit the position?  A whole lot is said about the foreiger&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are the people to whom I am referring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy means the foreigner within our country.  I will hand to the Minister sufficient evidence to convince him that, when this tariff is put on, the ordinary producer will be exploited, and, ultimately, the consumer will be exploited, because when the tariff was put on oatenmeal, invoices, which I have here, prove that oatenmeal ordered before the tariff was put on was quoted at 17/6 per cwt. for flaked and pinhead oatenmeal.  These prices were not quoted by the foreigner, or by any person alien to this country, but by some of our own people who are both saints and scholars.  Immediately after the tariff was imposed, the same merchants, or the same producer, if you like, said that all previous orders were cancelled, and he immediately raised the price to 20/6 per cwt.  That is a difference of 3/-, and it was not inflicted by the foreigner, the Sassenach or anybody else, but by our own Irish people, and I want to know if the Minister would be able to safeguard the position in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The date is 20th October, 1931, when a Cork firm sent an order to a Free State firm.  I will hand the document to the Minister if he requires it.  This firm stated &ldquo;We quote flaked and pinhead oatenmeal at 17/6 per cwt. railway carriage paid,&rdquo; and subsequent to that, on 24/10/31, <Col N="2236" /> we had the order cancelled, and on 30/10/31, the communication reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Dear Sirs,&mdash;Yours received; the present price of flaked and pinhead oatenmeal is 20/6 per cwt., railway carriage paid.  All previous prices cancelled.</P>
      <P>I will hand the document to the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Anthony possibly remembers that the duty on oatenmeal was imposed a considerable number of years ago by the late administration, and it did not result in an increase in price.  Quite the contrary. As a result of the imposition of the duty, the oat millers of this country were able to build up, and did build up, a very substantial export trade. Last year the duty on oatmeal was increased, but the increase in price to which Deputy Anthony has referred, I suggest, took place because, at the same time, a duty was placed on oats, which raised the price of oats, and which was designed to raise the price of oats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that represent 3/- in the cwt. of a difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not questioning the figures.  On the other questions that have been raised, Deputy Dillon has given some valuable contributions to various debates in this House from time to time, but to-day, I think, is one of his off-days.  He talked about taxing the raw material of the farming industry.  We are not taxing the raw material of the farming industry.  We are stopping the imports of maize meal manufactured outside the State.  There is no tax on maize meal bought by the farmers of this State and available for them.  The Deputy also talked about outside competition keeping down prices which Irish millers secured for their products.  I suggest to the Deputy that if that were the situation, then the maize millers would not have built up and maintained over a long <Col N="2237" /> period of years a considerable export trade in maize meal, and an export trade which was taken from them when the British Government decided to impose the duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that there is milling capacity in this country much more than adequate to supply our requirements.  There is competition, and very keen competition, between the different producers for the available market, and so long as that competition exists prices will be kept down to the minimum.  The complaint of some millers is that because of that competition they are not getting an economic return.  That competition has, in fact, been increased, because a number of new mills have been established since the tariff was imposed and because of the desirability of maintaining competition we took no action which would have hindered these people establishing mills.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a considerable quantity of meal was being exported into Northern Ireland, and in the case of Donegal alone that one balances the other at the present moment?  You impose a greater hardship on the farmer in the North-East portion of Donegal.  The millers, who have gained, are in the South.  At the same time they have lost their total export trade, as I have pointed out already.</P>

      <P>We had to deal with that situation.  Some mills have been started in the northern part of Donegal, and in due course the situation will right itself, and the existing mills will supply the market.  The point raised by Deputy McGilligan concerning Imperial preference is one that I do not think will concern us very much.  It is a fact that there are no means of identifying maize meal produced out of South African meal from maize meal produced out of South American meal.  It is not anticipated that there will be any substantial import free of duty on account of the preference given.  The same preference exists in the British duty.  It is there in any case.  If any such situation did arise, it would be a matter of the reliance which the Customs authorities were prepared to place on the certificate of origin produced.</P>

The point is that there is not sufficient home competition to make sellers keen about cutting prices.  Until you get to the point that there is sufficient home production to meet home requirements, then there is not sufficient room, there is not a sufficient chance of getting prices reduced.  There is also the further point that in a small country like this there is always a likelihood of rings and of zone arrangements. We know that there have been several of these ring arrangements made even in tariffed industries when established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Customs Duties (Bedsteads and Furniture) (Provisional Variation) Order, 1932, which was made on the 2nd day of May, 1932, by the Executive Council under Section 1 of the Customs Duties (Provisional Imposition) Act, 1931 (No. 38 of 1931) and a copy of which was laid on the Table of Dáil Eireann on the 4th day of April, 1932, be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April, 1925, there was imposed upon furniture imported into this State a customs duty of 33? per cent.  The first result of the imposition of the duty was that the furniture-making industry made very rapid progress here.  The numbers of firms engaged <Col N="2242" /> in it increased from 16 to over 100, and the number of workers employed, on the basis of full-time employment, rose from 310 to 1,545 in September of last year.  The progress made by the industry was all the more remarkable in view of a certain prejudice which existed on the part of certain large retailers in the State against home-produced furniture.  The Department of Industry and Commerce, under the late administration, on several occasions, made representation to those large retail houses with a view to inducing them to place more of their orders with Saorstát firms.  As a result of continuous representation of that kind the position eased somewhat.  But considerable importation of furniture, despite the duty, prevailed, the value of such imports last year being £109,000.  The existing industry is of course quite competent to supply all the reasonable requirements of the country.  But prices had been falling continuously.  The general position is that the factories are almost, if not entirely, in a position to produce furniture at the same price as the much larger factories in England which have the advantage of a much larger market available for them.  That is a very creditable achievement in view of the short period in which the industry has been given an opportunity of development.</P>
    <P>There is one firm which has reached the point of building up a substantial export trade in certain classes of furniture.  The industry is one which it is very desirable to assist and develop because of the nature of the employment given.  The average wages for a skilled worker in the trade is over £4 a week and there is the opportunity provided in the industry by which young people can become apprenticed to a skilled trade that will give them an opportunity to secure their livelihood in after life.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, however, there are a number of foreign firms which have recently begun operating in the industry, and which are not observing the prevailing standard in respect of hours of labour and wages of workers.  While that is a matter of course primarily to <Col N="2243" /> be dealt with by the trade union and the employers' organisations concerned, it is giving the Department of Industry and Commerce some concern, and it may be necessary to take action in the matter if the position is not remedied.  The design in increasing the duty was to secure for the factories here the remaining part of the market for this State.  The duty will be effective to that end and a fair amount of additional employment will be given in consequence.  And the ability of the factories to improve their methods, and to reduce their prices and possibly to build up an export trade in a certain specialised class of furniture will be increased.</P>
    <P>As far as the need for acting by Provisional Order is concerned, the situation developed that some abnormal importations of furniture were reported, and there was reason to believe that if the duty was not imposed by Provisional Order on the date it was imposed large stocks of furniture would be brought in which would have held up the development of the industry, and, in fact, cause unemployment in some of the existing factories for some months to come. The Executive Council, therefore, on my recommendation, decided to act by Provisional Order, and this Resolution asks the Dáil to approve of the duties imposed by that Provisional Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot to be said for this Resolution, but I am wondering how does the Minister envisage an export trade in furniture. I would like to get some further information with regard to that aspect of the position.  How can he envisage an export trade of Irish made furniture if he puts a tariff against imported furniture?  I think this is one of the good things in the Budget.  It is a tariff with which I agree very largely.  But I want to ask the Minister one or two questions. I want him to satisfy me that furniture will be available to the ordinary working class people of this country at a fairly reasonable price.  We do know that a certain trade in furniture <Col N="2244" /> has grown up and has been done mainly by auctioneers and others. These people could not at any point indicate the place of origin, because these articles of furniture may have passed through two or three hands. That kind of furniture was available for middle-class people, farmers and others, who availed of the opportunity of getting well-made furniture at reasonable prices.  There is a demand in this country for cheap furniture&mdash;I mean cheap and good furniture&mdash;I know also there is a traffic in this country in cheap and what I may call shoddy furniture.  If this duty puts a stop to the cheap and shoddy furniture I shall be satisfied, but I want to ensure that furniture will be available at reasonable prices to people of moderate incomes, and in those I refer to the fairly comfortable artisan and the skilled labourer.</P>
      <P>I am intrigued by the Minister's suggestion that we are going to develop an export trade, but I should like him to develop his argument.  His statement did not satisfy me on that point.  How does he propose to build up this export trade? Does he think that by antagonising other people &mdash;and tariffs do antagonise other people&mdash;he will be able to do so?  Is he so childish as to think that people are going to take our goods if we have tariffs against them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a very substantial case can be made for conserving the home market in the production of furniture for manufacture by the Irish people who are engaged in the industry. I believe that any steps the Government may take in that connection are steps that deserve the support of this House.  The skill and craftsmanship of Irish woodworkers are world-famous. It is a test of inherent ability for a woodworker to be able to say that he acquired his skill under conditions <Col N="2245" /> obtaining in the Irish woodworking trade.  I am glad the Minister has indicated that it is the purpose of the Government to endeavour to conserve the whole Irish market for Irish producing firms.  While I like the sympathy of the Minister towards maintaining wage standards and decent standards of living for the workers engaged in the industry, I would like to have something more definite than mere sympathy.  The Minister indicated that certain foreign firms that came here are not observing the wage standards associated with the industry, and not observing decent conditions.  It is a notorious fact that woodworking and joinery work are carried on in Dublin and elsewhere under conditions which are a reflection upon the industry.  In his reply I hope the Minister will indicate that if we are going to protect Irish manufacturers against foreign competition the Government will not allow the wage standards to be pulled down by foreign firms who come here and impose low rates of wages through economic pressure&mdash;to set up conditions which would be a reflection on the whole industry.  The sooner the Minister states definitely that the Government is standing for a fair wage standard and decent conditions of living for workers engaged in protected industries, the sooner will the workers of the country give wholehearted support to the policy of conserving industry for Irish manufacturers. At a later date on the relative motion I hope he will indicate that the Government is prepared to do something beyond the extension of sympathy to the workers in the industry. If the Minister can give that assurance I think the workers will be glad of it, and we can look forward to a still more rapid development of the furniture industry.</P>

      <P>I approve of this motion and my comments will be in the nature of a question to the Minister. I would like to know if he would consider the advisability of taking power on behalf of the Department so that his officials could enter workshops where these articles are being made to see that the quality is up <Col N="2246" /> to a decent standard.  I got a complaint some time ago from a representative of this industry that people had started small workshops in back lanes and did not recognise trade union conditions, in fact, that the surroundings generally were not suitable to employment. Complaint was also made that the material&mdash;the stuffing and padding generally&mdash;was not of a type that should be used.  The material was second-hand cloth or sacking which was covered up with a nice outer cover to deceive purchasers.  I think the Minister should take power to see that the public generally are not imposed upon by the class of goods to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>We have had a tariff of 33 1-3 per cent. on furniture for the past five or six years.  The Minister now proposes to raise it to 75 per cent.  It seems to me that if an industry in this country, especially one which Deputy Norton says is famous for its craftsmen, could not compete with the outside world with a tariff of 33 1-3 per cent. it is not worth bolstering up.</P>

      <P>With regard to the statement made by the Minister and by other Deputies as to conditions in the factories and workshops, I always understood that the factory inspectors here were very efficient at their work. I know from my experience they are hard to get over.  A notice is served on the first occasion and on the next occasion, a summons.  I think that if there are complaints about conditions someone is not doing his duty.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a lack of information from the Minister for increasing the tariff of 33? per cent. to 75 per cent., with one-third remission in the case of Great Britain <Col N="2247" /> and Northern Ireland imports.  The Minister based his case on the increased manufacture already done under the 33? per cent. tariff, but I was rather amused to find him putting forward as one of the arms of that contention the fact that the number of firms increased from 16 to over 100.  To say that firms had increased from 16 to 100 would give a picture of industries springing up on a grand scale.  Although I hold this tariff has been successful, to an extent, it has not been so successful as this grand scale of increase from 16 firms to 100 would lead one to think.  I remember that a couple of years after the imposition of the tariff there was a complaint made that 50 per cent. of the home manufacture was made in what were called back kitchens and stables, a contention that I hold was wholly absurd, but the complaint was made.  The contention ran further that good factories were being despoiled of their most competent workers because after getting a certain amount of training in goodish firms, workers were snapped up by certain people who came from outside and settled in kitchens and back lanes.  They took away, it was said, some of the best skilled tradesmen. Any time you want to damage people who are making an industry, if you cannot use the word dumping with regard to them, you will certainly say that they are foreigners, who have come from outside and are living in a back lane or a stable.  That is part of the ordinary contention that has to be expected in any of these businesses.</P>
      <P>However, there were great complaints about these people.  There was considerable investigation of complaints which, if true, would have brought firms very definitely within the scope of the Factory Act inspectors. So far as I remember, no cases were discovered which could have got firms within the control of the factory inspectors. In so far as the limited detail into which factory inspectors were allowed to go was concerned, these factories, in the main, if they did not get first-class certificates, were passed by the inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2248" /> We are told that it is necessary to increase this tariff from what it was&mdash; 33? per cent.&mdash;to 75 per cent., with the remission I have spoken of, and that, although the Minister told us the number of firms had increased from 16 to over 100, and the number of workers from 300 to over 1,000.  When he spoke about the £109,000 worth of imports last year, he could have said that that showed a decrease on the previous year's figures and on the figures of the year before.  The figure was somewhere in the region of £150,000.  That decrease has been fairly continuous so far as I remember, and it seemed to indicate that the tariff had been quite scientifically adjusted and was doing quite well, notwithstanding all the complaints about these kitchens and stables and the dearth of competent workers.  It was definitely asserted in 1927 that the dearth of competent workers was such that it imposed upon one manufacturer the necessity of importing cross-Channel workers.  There has been an increase in the home manufactures, but one point was not adverted to by the Minister in his opening speech.  There was a pretty well grounded contention that certain grades of furniture of the very highest class were only being made here by one firm.  That one firm&mdash;it was an individual more than a firm&mdash;was renowned outside the country and was not in a position to cope with orders given him outside the group that he had around him.  A submission was made that if the duty on the highest-grade furniture was reduced and the duty on the lower-grade furniture increased, there would be better employment for the manufacturing end and for the trading end.  That point seems to have been neglected.  We have now an impost of 75 per cent. intended to crush out any possible importation.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding what has been said about those people who work in kitchens and stables, Deputy Norton raises a question, from the Labour point of view, as to taking care of the workers.  I never could understand why the workers and the trade unions, who are very well organised in this particular line, were not able to look after their own interests.  The excuse <Col N="2249" /> mainly given to me was that these small firms employed no trade union labour whatsoever and were, consequently, able to evade trade union pressure in some way I could not understand.  Apart from those people, I understood that one of the disadvantages the home manufacturer suffered was that the worker here worked shorter hours and got higher wages than the worker for the competing firms across Channel.  Deputy Norton wants the workers more definitely protected than they have been, and I think that cry is going to be raised whenever you have a tariff raised suddenly, without excuse given, from 33? per cent. to 75 per cent.  You are going to have, more or less, Australian conditions piling up here.  If the manufacturers have been doing pretty well up to the present, in the sense that they have got more trade, why should not the worker, with the increased tariff, get a little more?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Internal competition in an industry which has not even managed to stop an import of £109,000 worth, which was £150,000 worth the year before.  So far as I understood, the contention of the manufacturers up to the end of the year 1930 was that the stress of competition at home had not enabled them to bring down their costs to anything like the figures on the other side.  There is a distinction to be made there.  The retailers would require something more on the tariffed articles here than the retailers would expect on the other side, because they do a bigger trade on the other side.  As late as 1930 there was an admission by the manufacturers here that, although they had cut prices considerably, their production costs and wholesale prices had not been brought down, to anything nearer than 15 per cent. on the average to their competitors' figure.  Some things like kitchen chairs had been brought down to the lowest price on the other side.  Costs had been brought down also in respect of four or five other articles but, in the main, there was a 15 per cent. differential admitted in the general rates for furniture. The keen competition that Deputy Moore thinks there is in every industry did not bring them to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the contention that the tariff is not sufficient, I do not remember any tariff which was ever put on in relation to which you could not find some manufacturer to contend that the benefit of the tariff had not been wiped out by something else.  As late as three years after the imposition of this tariff there was at least one manufacturer in a biggish way who held that the whole 33? per cent. tariff had been wiped out by the difference between wages and conditions here and on the other side.  If this 75 per cent. tariff lasts long enough, I am sure that there will be somebody going to the Minister to urge that it is not sufficient and to suggest that there should be prohibition of imports. This is the first occasion any explanation has been given as to the use of this anti-dumping legislation.  I should like to have some further <Col N="2251" /> particulars regarding the Minister's statement that &ldquo;some abnormal importations had been reported, and he believed that large stocks would have been built up.&rdquo;  I wonder if we could have, at a later stage, information as to the amount of these abnormal importations.  Was there one boat load, what was the value of it and how was it divided between high grade furniture and the type of furniture made here?  Perhaps the Minister would also explain what was the likelihood of large stocks being built up against the then 33? per cent. tariff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a tradition in this country in regard to the inherited skill of our workers in the manufacture of furniture.  I do not think more beautiful furniture could be found than was turned out in the Marsh, in the City of Cork, many years ago.  It is in existence still, and is quite as good as when it was turned out of the workshops in that city.  It is the most magnificent stuff that any man could desire to have in his house.  It is beautifully strong, and probably would have to be broken up before it could be got rid of.  There is no question about it, that this is an industry that should command our sympathy.  It is one that I think can be very easily developed, but I very much question the necessity for such a high tariff as 75 per cent.</P>
      <P>There is another factor that has to be taken into consideration with regard to the industry and that is the change in fashion that has taken place in regard to certain articles.  Take, for instance, bedsteads.  There is a certain firm in this country manufacturing iron bedsteads and the tariff of 33? per cent., which was put on some time ago, did not improve their trade in the slightest degree.  The change of fashion more or less made iron bedsteads a back number.  We may possibly have other changes in fashion taking place in regard to certain articles manufactured here.  The tastes of people differ very much with the passage of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the factors that I think we should take into consideration is, are <Col N="2252" /> there the necessary skilled workers in the country to carry out the large increase in output that is hoped for? When any change is made in an industry that is a fact that should be taken into consideration&mdash;that the people in that industry would be able to supply the demand.  I feel that the tariff imposed is far too high, that it will have the effect simply of increasing the prices very materially to the purchaser and that there will be a consequent decrease in the demand for furniture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the figures given in regard to this tariff are in the first place a sure indication that the Minister is on the right road.  The finding of employment in this country for 1,200 extra persons is not a matter to be despised.  As regards the danger suggested by Deputy Brasier of there not being sufficient skilled workers, we know that the technical schools are now turning out highly trained young men capable of manufacturing these articles.  We had a suggestion from Deputy McGilligan that we reduced the tariff on high-grade furniture and increased it on the low-grade furniture. It is admitted that there is one firm in this country that is producing furniture of a sufficiently high-grade for the highest-graders.  I cannot see any reason whatever why we should favour a particular class in this country because that is what it means. If anybody is entitled to be considered it is the poor.  I think anybody who went through the Dublin Show here or the Cork Industrial Fair will have to admit that you can get first-rate furniture to-day at a very reasonable price, but there is a class in this country&mdash;and that is why I like to see the tariff going up to 75 per cent.&mdash;who would not buy Irish furniture no matter what tariff is put on imported furniture.  I am sorry the Minister could not make the tariff 100 per cent. and let the class who will not buy Irish furniture, no matter what tariff is put on, pay for it, and it is about time they did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise the significance of Deputy Anthony's point as regards furniture brought in here by auctioneers.  We <Col N="2253" /> all know that at auctions generally the price of articles is put up in many cases beyond their original cost.  I know very well from my experience both in Cork and Dublin that many people go into these auctions who know absolutely nothing about the furniture, but they say when buying an article: &ldquo;We are only a couple of shillings over the last man who bid and we are safe.&rdquo;  I for one welcome this tariff in the belief that it will undoubtedly give more employment to a big number who are now on the unemployment list.  Anything that is done in that way should be welcomed.  I sympathise with Deputy Good's interjection in regard to the longer hours we heard about and the bigger wages of people in other trades besides the furniture trade.  He does not look like one of these distressed, broken-down men who have suffered so much from high wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister inform the House from what source this demand for the higher tariff came? As already pointed out, we had a tariff of 33? per cent.  Why was it necessary to make it 75 per cent.?  What object did the Minister hope to achieve by that particular addition? Another point that was referred to, and which was something new to me, was the fact that trained tradesmen are being turned out for this particular industry by our technical schools. I do not know whether the Deputy who has just spoken was quite well-informed on that point.  I certainly would not accept him as an authority. To me, as having some knowledge of the work of our technical schools it is news to know that trained tradesmen are being turned out by the technical schools.  In that connection I would like to know, seeing the increased demand there is for furniture made in the home factories, whether any restrictions <Col N="2254" /> are imposed by the furniture trades on the number of apprentices because, if that were so, it might create a very serious difficulty.  You might, on the one hand, have orders which the local factories are unable to meet, and, on the other hand, you would have a duty which prevented the importation of furniture.  Between these two millstones certain people might suffer.  I would like to know from the Minister whether there are any restrictions of this particular type imposed by these trades on apprentices.</P>

      <P>I would like to impress on the Minister the desirability of investigating the point raised by Deputy Anthony.  I am not altogether satisfied that second-hand furniture is deserving of very extended consideration, but I think there are snags and difficulties involved here.  I imagine that if this tariff is applied in its present form to the second-hand furniture trade, particularly in the City of Dublin, it will work great hardship to a deserving section of the people, and it will practically break up a large number of auctioneering firms who give a considerable amount of employment.  I am informed that there is great danger of grave hardship eventuating in that direction.  I would like the Minister to look into the furniture tariff with special reference to auctioneering firms and people who deal in furniture in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a few questions.  Does the Minister expect that this tariff will wipe out the revenue from the importation of furniture altogether? Secondly, I would like to ask is there any real check on the invoiced price of furniture coming into this country? I am informed that there is wholesale swindling with regard to the invoiced price of certain furniture.  To attempt to check this would be a very difficult and costly process, and the average officer has no means of judging whether the value declared on the invoice is correct or not.  Very often consignments of furniture of exactly the same quality, to two different <Col N="2255" /> houses, are given altogether different values, and the duty paid on these consignments is quite different.  I know it is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, but in so far as it relates to the effectiveness of the tariff it is of interest to this House.</P>

      <P>In connection with this particular industry one hears complaints from time to time of manufacturers wishing to introduce certain modern processes in connection with the work and of definite and successful objection being taken by the workers to the introduction of these new processes. One hears of that from time to time.  In the discussion of this matter with the manufacturers, I wonder if that aspect of the case&mdash;the reduction of the cost of production&mdash;has been discussed with the Minister.  A very big increase in the tariff would, I submit, make it necessary, particularly in connection with the cheaper classes of furniture, that nothing should be left undone to reduce the cost of production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In this matter Deputy Mulcahy is misinformed.  In fact quite the reverse, according to the information supplied to me, of what he has stated is the truth.  A number of factories engaged in this industry in the Saorstát are very up-to-date and have recently installed the newest machinery available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As regards the other points that have been raised, Deputy Moore referred to the matter of checking the invoiced prices.  Complaints have reached me relating to second-hand furniture, and they have been numerous, particularly from Cork, and very strong representations have been made that second-hand furniture is coming in valued at prices which are ridiculously low and consequently to some extent evading the duties payable upon it.  The matter is being looked into.  But it is obviously difficult to fix a standard by which the <Col N="2256" /> value of second-hand furniture can be checked.  Deputy Anthony referred to another matter relating to second-hand furniture and that is the difficulty of procuring a certificate of origin from the manufacturers such as is usually required by the Revenue Commissioners in order that they might get the benefit of the preferential rate of duty.  I have received representations from the Auctioneers' Association and others who deal in second-hand furniture on that point, and an arrangement has been made by which, if the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the furniture is of British or Dominion origin, it will be admitted at the preferential rate.  I am informed that anyone who is familiar with the furniture business has no difficulty in knowing at sight furniture of British make and furniture of Continental make.  So that the particular point, upon which representations were made to me by those who deal in second-hand furniture, has been met.</P>
      <P>We have heard some discussion about the conditions of labour, and comparisons were asked for between the conditions existing here and the conditions existing in Great Britain. That is not such an easy thing as may appear at first sight.  One of the reasons why this heavy duty became necessary was the fact that there was developing in Great Britain an industry for the manufacture of furniture on somewhat similar lines to that which has been complained of here, namely, what Deputy McGilligan called back kitchen industries, and furniture was being produced not in factories but in yards and places where no overhead charges operated, and under conditions of labour which would not be tolerated if known; and that it was furniture of a type which to a large extent was being imported here, and imported at such very cheap rates that it could be sold in competition with the products of our own factories despite the 33? per cent. duty.</P>

    <Col N="2257" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think mainly from London, if my recollection is correct. As far as the position here is concerned, I have discussed the matter which has been mentioned with representatives of the Labour unions and with the representatives of the employers' organisation, and, although, like Deputy McGilligan, I am not quite clear why these organisations between them could not have remedied the position of which they complained before this, I understand they are making a special effort now.  If they fail in that, or whether they fail or not, it may be necessary to secure for the Department of Industry and Commerce more extensive powers.  In the majority of cases the actual terms of the Factory Acts are complied with, but at the same time, the conditions of labour are in many cases unsatisfactory. Where a saw is left unprotected, or something of that kind occurs, a prosecution can follow.  But there are many ways of avoiding and evading the legal obligations of the Factory Acts, and these have been resorted to in some cases.  And the extent to which it may be necessary to extend the scope of these Acts to deal with these cases is at present under examination.  Deputy Anthony asked how we propose to build up an export trade.  I do not propose to do it.  I mentioned the fact that at least one factory was succeeding in doing it to some extent.  I hope it will succeed in that effort.  It is a matter for the manufacturers.  But on the general point I should like to say this: That the surest way in which you can make it possible for a manufacturer to build up an export trade is by securing him a sure footing in the home market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, I am certain, in no country in the world any industry with a substantial export trade that did not, as a preliminary to building up that trade, secure itself in its own market first.  And if we are going to get an export trade for goods of any kind in this country&mdash;and I believe that in certain classes of cases it is possible, and we are starting in on it at the moment&mdash;I believe that we can do that only by securing for the manufacturers in the home market a return <Col N="2258" /> which will ensure a reasonable profit on the capital invested in any particular case, so that the export market can be attacked under the most favourable circumstances.</P>
    <P>The matter raised by Deputy Alfred Byrne concerning the quality of the material which is used in some of the small furniture factories in certain parts of Dublin, is one that will arise for examination under certain legislation which it is proposed to introduce relating to prices, because, as I said before, price has no significance unless related to quality, and whereas no objection may be raised to the material used if the price reflects the type of material, yet if an attempt was made to pass off as of good material, furniture which was of that description, it would be desirable that we should have power to take action, and it is intended that we should get that power.</P>
    <P>These are the main points raised by those who have participated in the discussion.  It is not anticipated that there will be any increase in price.  On the contrary, we anticipate that the increased output from the various factories will permit them to reduce prices in certain cases.  If certain people, as Deputy Corry said, insist upon importing furniture, they will have to pay the increased duty, and I think it is only reasonable to expect that those people should contribute to the revenues of the State in that connection.  The industry here is quite capable of supplying all the reasonable requirements of our people in furniture of every grade.  In circumstances of this sort we propose that the home market should be preserved to them. Deputy McGilligan said the next thing is that there will be prohibition.  We intend it to be something of that nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Doubtless the Minister has overlooked the question I put to him.  Will he inform the House from what particular section of the community this demand for an increased duty came?  Also, in view of the increased demand for labour, we find, in regard to the training of labour, there is amongst juveniles an <Col N="2259" /> increasing difficulty in getting employment, particularly in the furniture trade.  I am anxious to know in regard to this trade which, as the Minister states, has a bright outlook, whether it is capable of employing a considerable number of juveniles&mdash; training them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give the Deputy any precise information regarding the number of apprentices engaged in the industry. There are, however, some, and there are certain technical schools in which pupils are trained for this particular trade.  I deliberately avoided the question regarding the source from which the demand for a tariff came.  I do not think it necessary there should be a demand from any source before the Government should take action, if the Government is satisfied that action is desirable.  Generally speaking, the case for an increased tariff was discussed with the representatives of the employers engaged in this business and with representatives of the workers.</P>

      <P>No.  I want to make the Deputy quite clear as to what happened. When the change of Government took place the trade associations connected with all these industries were invited to come together at Government Buildings, where I had an opportunity of discussing with them the conditions prevailing in relation to their industries, the prospects of assisting them in various ways, and the measures that might be taken in order to secure development.  A discussion took place with the representatives of the furniture manufacturers.  Various matters were touched upon, such as second-hand furniture and certain types of factories.  Reference was made to an increase in the measure of the protection afforded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

      <P>One very important allegation was made here in the course of this discussion.  The allegation made was that the skilled persons employed in the furniture making trade, particularly, have a higher rate of pay and work a shorter number of hours than prevails in similar trades across the Channel.  If that is the case, the cost of production here must <Col N="2264" /> necessarily be very much higher and furniture must be dearer to the buyers in this country.  If this 75 per cent tariff is put on, this industry becomes a completely sheltered one.  In those circumstances, will the Minister tell us if he will be able to take sufficient steps to see that these alleged facts will not be an incentive to the employees to look for a still higher rate of pay and still shorter hours and so still further increase the cost of furniture made here?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not give the information in reference to this abnormal importation, say, in this way:&mdash;Last year, £9,000 worth of furniture per month was imported and the year before £12,500 worth of furniture a month.  Is there any information as to what percentage of increase was taking place or if there was a possibility of two months' supplies within the short space of two or three weeks?  Taking the proposed imposition at 75 per cent. as against 33? per cent. formerly there is a very grave danger that we may lose the export trade that the Minister mentioned.  The Minister shakes his head, but that does not really answer the question.  There are several industries here which do not get anything like a big sale for their goods <Col N="2265" /> here in the country and which export extensively.  Any industrialist can see that a certain amount of export trade with an internal trade is very good business.  But to go at once from 33? per cent. to 75 per cent. on the mere assumption or assertion that a certain amount of dumping has taken place or that a certain amount of dumping is anticipated is scarcely a sound enough argument to put to the House for such a change in our fiscal policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>From the replies of the Minister himself.  I gathered it from his replies to the various questions put to him, from his failure to say anything definite about the abnormal importations, from his attitude in regard to the wage question, and in fact from all the other matters that were put before him.  That is what I gathered.  I should imagine that a case might have been made or that it might be possible to make a case for increasing the already high tariff of 33? per cent. to 40 per cent., but it would require an extraordinary set of circumstances to justify increasing it up to 75 per cent.  The Minister has said that a 75 per cent. tariff is meant to be a prohibitive tariff.  It is meant to be the same as 100 per cent. tariff or a 200 per cent. tariff, something that will completely shut out the imports of furniture.  On general principles I think it is undesirable to impose any tariff whatsoever of that particular sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There might be some key industry where some very high tariffs would be justified, but even in a key industry it is doubtful that there should be no external competition at all.  We have heard and it seems not to be denied that wages are higher and the hours shorter here in some branches of this trade than at the other side of the Channel.  Well, that means that the <Col N="2266" /> consumers here whose own conditions are not too good in many cases are already paying something beyond the ordinary level.  If we are to have no outside competition it is probable that that will be carried further.  We are providing the temptation to the furniture manufacturers to join together and fleece the consumers.  It is not always easy to form rings even when it is possible to form them.  But we should not put a special temptation in the way of any particular trade to have manufacturers forming themselves into a ring because there is absolutely no foreign competition against them.  Then they could charge prices altogether excessive.</P>
    <P>I think that this is a prohibitive tariff and the Dáil ought to consider it very carefully.  I think it is one of the tariffs that the Dáil ought to reject.  I do not know what extra employment it will give, but considering the amount of the imports and the extra employment given it cannot be very large, not as large even as would be found by estimating the average proportionate labour costs in the prices of the article of furniture, because though prices are put up, the consumption is going to go down. Furniture is one of the things in which consumption can be substantially reduced.  People can manage to go along and patch up without buying new furniture, as they possibly will if prices are put up very substantially on the consumer.  I would say that if a prohibitive tariff is put on, and that prices are going to go up, these special conditions- that we find in industry may, to some extent, become more general in it.</P>
    <P>Certainly, if we have very special conditions of labour in the industry here, shorter hours and higher wages than in England, there is going to be a very strong incentive to the manufacturers to group themselves together and to take full advantage of this 75 per cent. tariff. If it was a 33? per cent. tariff, the extent to which the public could be exploited would be limited, because some effort would be made from outside, even if it was not <Col N="2267" /> successful, to get over the 33? per cent. tariff.  There does not seem any possibility of outside producers coming in to any extent, and getting over the 75 per cent. tariff, and because of that the people inside are going to have it all their own way.  Therefore, we are going to have here a process which will have tremendously evil effects on those producers who cannot put up their own products, the producers who must export.  I think resistance should be given to this.</P>

I do not think it is fair that I should be asked to repeat the case made for the tariff because the Deputy was not here.  If he had been here, he would have heard another member of his own Party, Deputy Alfred Byrne, complaining in relation to this industry, not that wages were too high and hours too short, but that wages were too low and hours too long.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the industry as a whole, the situation is that they are able to produce, despite the different circumstances prevailing here, a certain class of furniture as low as it can be produced in England.  In respect of a number of ranges, the costs of production here are 2½ per cent. higher than in England, and in respect of some items, the costs of production here are higher by 10 per cent. than <Col N="2268" /> in England.  I think that is a very creditable achievement for an industry which, a few years ago, was only supplying 20 per cent. of our market, which has grown rapidly during that period and which has to contend with all the disadvantages which an industry of that kind has, in the limited market, such as is available in this country, vis-a-vis similar firms engaged in the same industry in the much larger market available in England. I think they have done very well, and I think they deserve from this Dáil protection against the products of sweated labour now coming into this country, to the extent of £100,000 a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

We propose to secure for the Irish manufacturers that £100,000 market which they have not yet got, and to give the labour involved in supplying that part of the market to the Irish people here, who are paid decent wages and who are working under decent conditions, instead of to people in London, who are working under sweated conditions.</P>

Now, I suggest that, in the furniture retail trade, as in every other retail trade, prejudices are unknown, with regard to manufacture. The retail trade have to hand out the goods that the public demand, and I suggest that if the public were to demand furniture from below, the retailer would produce it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a completely new case that the Minister is now making, in comparison to that with which he started.  This is an anti-dumping order, a provisional imposition order, and the Minister told me that it was because there had been abnormal importations&mdash;the phrase was &ldquo;some abnormal importations had been reported&rdquo; and it was believed that large stocks would have been built up.  On that, I asked would he tell us, say, month by month, or for six months before the order was made, what was the amount of these abnormal importations that were reported. I asked for these figures, because, if we had them, we could, then, <Col N="2270" /> have some view as to the credibility of the beliefs that the Minister said the Executive Council had with regard to the stocks that were going to be built up, and built up, as I said before, against the 33? per cent. tariff.</P>
      <P>Now we get a new case.  We have got no answer to the question put as to what the Executive Council had before them on the report of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Minister goes off on another point.  He talked of three types of people who have to be considered in this connection: first, the individual who is so prejudiced that he will not buy anything except what comes from outside.  I do not believe that you will force that man into buying stuff made at home.  There is still a certain amount of furniture to be picked up at auctions in the country, and if that individual is still so prejudiced against taking home-made stuff, he can get articles from time to time, as they change hands.  Then, there is the retailer. The Minister ought not to talk with such vehemence about the retailer until he has had some better contact with him than he showed today that he has had.  It has been very limited.  The prejudice in the Minister's mind is that the retailer will not stock home-made stuff.  The retailer was appealed to by the Department in 1927, and month by month, or quarter by quarter, as meetings were held, there was a growing appreciation, on the part of manufacturers, of what the retailers were doing.  The Minister should not be talking of stuff as out of date at the end of 1926, or early in 1927, when he begins vehemently to criticise the retailer.  Thirdly, there is the sweated product.  Part of the allegations made by the trade is against what they would describe themselves as sweated furniture, furniture produced under sweated conditions in this country.  If that is going to come in, then it is going to come in against sweated furniture here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation, so far as this trade is concerned, used to be&mdash;I do not know whether there has been any change&mdash; that so far as low-grade furniture was concerned, the tariff has almost completely wiped it out.  So far as the <Col N="2271" /> medium stuff is concerned, at least 50 per cent. of the requirements were made at home.  It was in the higher grade furniture that very little was being made, and I do not know what the reactions of the 75 per cent. tariff are going to be on that.  There is no question about low-grade furniture at all.  I think the people here have got hold of that.  Further, the Minister says with regard to the conditions under which stuff is manufactured here, that it is very creditable indeed to the trade that they have got into the position they have, that in certain lines they are able to manufacture certain classes of goods as low as 2½ to 5 per cent. above the English wholesale price.  Do not get the retailer into this.  He is completely out of it, when, on the firms' own admissions, as late as some part of 1930, they were still lagging 15 per cent. behind the cost of production, or the wholesale price on the other side.  I would say that in certain parts of the trade that is very creditable, undoubtedly, but where is the case for the 75 per cent.? Remember, as Deputy Good has stated, this position has been reached after seven years' experience of the working of the 33? per cent. tariff.</P>
    <P>I come back again to the first question, the question of dumping.  Where is the case for it?  We have got no figures of it.  We were told that the Executive Council &ldquo;have reason to believe&rdquo;&mdash;we do not know what it is, good, bad or indifferent, because we have not got the figures which led, in the first instance, to the imposition of the order.  &ldquo;Some abnormal importations,&rdquo; the Minister said, &ldquo;were reported.&rdquo; We should hear about these. This 75 per cent. is said to be intended as a prohibitive tariff, and Deputy Blythe talked about the danger of rings forming.  Does the Minister not know, from his investigation of the files, that this was one of the trades in which a definite appeal was put up for a licensing system for what amounted to a statutory ring?</P>
    <P>In other words, these people were so concerned about the cheaper end of the furniture and the attack made on what was manufactured in what were <Col N="2272" /> called the tenements and back gardens, that they came forward with a proposal which amounted to certain people being put into the position of determining who should get licences to manufacture furniture in this country, and that system was not going to include every national even, of this country, who was manufacturing at that time.  So near were we to a ring, and zoning and all that type of thing, that would spring up under the artificial conditions of a very heavy impost, that these people&mdash;some of them, I think, the best of them, disclaimed the suggestion&mdash;put forward the suggestion of a ring, to be formed under statutory conditions in this country, and some of the manufacturers were to be given control of admission to that ring.  The Minister is now laying the way open very definitely for it.</P>

Come on to another point the Minister made, in my absence.  He made a specific net point in the discussion here on the question of sweated labour, and he has made the statement now that furniture is made by young girls working under impossible conditions. The Minister knows perfectly well that that is not so.  There is cheap furniture coming into this country, and good value coming into the country. There are tradesmen, skilled men, artists at their own job, making furniture in other countries, in their own workshops, as they do in Paris and elsewhere, who are willing to work hard, and for long hours, in order to make a decent living, and I want to put it to the Minister that a little sweating of that sort in this country would do more for the country generally, and for this particular trade, than all the protection he is giving under this order.  What have we here?  The Minister is not in a position to deny that there are longer hours with lower wages earned in other countries under the conditions I mention, under conditions by which a man works in his own workshop and turns out a good article.</P>

      <P>I suggest that all this excitement is so much cant and humbug. A man is free to go into his own workshop and work as hard as he likes, and as long as he likes.  What does the small farmer, who is paying most of the taxes, do?  Has he any hours?  He is there on his own farm, working from dawn to dark, with the one consolation that he is his own <Col N="2274" /> master and has no boss.  Why should not the furniture maker, in the same conditions, be allowed to work as long and as hard as he likes?  What does the French furniture maker work? He turns out some of the best inlaid furniture in the world, and some of the best value.  Anybody in France, or anybody with any experience of French furniture making, knows that. Do you call him a slave?  He is far less a slave than the trade unionist working shorter hours and for higher wages.  He has his own workshop, and he is working hard, and he makes more money at the end of the year, because he is working harder, and for longer hours, and yet, the Minister gets up and decries that, and says: &ldquo;We cannot have these standards; we must have higher standards.&rdquo;  Look at what that amounts to.  What is the problem of the world at the present moment, and I put it to Deputies Davin and Curran, two Deputies who are much concerned with unemployment, that it is to find employment, and not so much to find better conditions for men who are in employment. The conditions are generally good, as you have trade unionism operating legitimately, for a long time, but the problem is not so much to improve conditions of work, as to find work for the unemployed.</P>
      <P>Yet, what do we find from the Minister here?  He says we must be concerned, not only with the unemployment and getting every man into work, but we must improve the conditions of the people at work, and we must improve them to such an extent, that the hard-working man, the skilled workman, the tradesman, is not allowed to go into his own workshop and work hard for long hours and for small wages.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can speak when I am finished.  Every time you do anything here in the way of high protection and sheltered trades which makes it possible for people to turn out bad value, what are you doing? You are making more unemployed, and you know it.  Deputy Traynor, who has just spoken, and who, I assume, has some knowledge of the actual conditions of work in Dublin, knows well that to allow goods to be produced under conditions where the purchaser has to pay more than the goods are worth, in the long run so far from lessening unemployment, brings about more unemployment.  He must know that.</P>

      <P>What is the condition in this and other countries at present? The real problem is the unemployed. What are we trying to do here on the Minister's admission?  So far from dealing with the position of the unemployed, <Col N="2276" /> we are trying to better the conditions of the people actually employed. Quite legitimate.  But in what direction?  We are to make it impossible for people who are working hard in their own workshops, turning out a special type of goods, to compete with goods sent into this country.  That is what the Minister is after.  Does the Minister really think he can do that?  Does he not know well that there is no Government in Europe at present but would be delighted to get the unemployed into employment on the conditions which exist in these workshops where these goods are produced, which he is now preventing by this 75 per cent. tariff?  He knows it well; Deputy Davin knows it well; Deputy Curran knows it well, and so does Deputy Traynor.  They know that in England, if they could get work for people under these conditions they would get it.  They know that France has solved her unemployment problem by getting people to work hard for themselves, or for their employers; to work long hours, and to accept short wages in bad times.  They know that that is the way they solved the unemployment problem.  They know that in Germany, England, America, in every country in the world, they would be glad to solve unemployment by this means.  Yet what do we find here? We have this cant of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who comes along and says that, not only is he going to get work for the unemployed, but that he shall improve the conditions of the employed here, so as to make them better than in any other country in the world.  It will end in one way only&mdash;bankruptcy and more unemployment.</P>

But Deputy Hogan has, conveniently for his own sake I am sure, forgotten that in this particular case he was a member of the Ministry when the tariff of 33? was imposed upon imported furniture.  If the Deputy speaks again, will he give us reasons to justify his support for the tariff when originally imposed? Will he tell us also why in spite of the imposition of a 33? per cent. tariff, the industry, so far as there was an industry <Col N="2279" /> in this country, went down and down, and with it the men who were engaged in the industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Because furniture was allowed to come into the country, over the tariff wall, which was made, not by skilled tradesmen in their own homes, but by people whom I could not describe in Parliamentary language&mdash; made under intolerable conditions. Should we allow into this country, if we can keep it out, furniture made under the most intolerable conditions in places like Houndsditch, in back streets in London, not by skilled men, but by semi-skilled men, and by that means allow workers engaged in Irish industries to be thrown out of employment, as they were here?  I am not competent to argue as between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the ex-Minister as to whether the tariff wall is being built high enough <Col N="2280" /> in this case.  But I believe the intention is to revive industries that existed here and to provide employment for the people hitherto employed under decent and reasonable conditions, and not under the conditions which exist on the other side of the channel where this imported furniture is manufactured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am waiting for an answer to a question I asked an hour and a half ago: what were the abnormal importations which led to the making of this Order on foot of which the Executive Council were led to believe that there were going to be stocks built up here from imported furniture?  That is the question I asked.  If the Minister complains about obstruction he has been obstructing himself in refusing to give that information, if it is in his possession. The other matter that has been mentioned is this question of the sweated workers.  Deputy Davin unfortunately had not the advantage of listening to what was said here to-day and he comes in at the end of the debate with a complete misunderstanding of the whole position.  I have not heard in the debate the point I made negatived, that as far as the cheaper end of the furniture trade was concerned the tariff had been effective; that as far as the medium end was concerned it had been effective to 50 per cent, at least; that the home manufacturer is getting at least 50 per cent. of the business.  But, it was in the higher-grade furniture that is not made under the sweated conditions we have heard described, that our manufacturers had failed.  In proof of that I gave a statement that I am pretty certain was made at one of these committees to the effect that if the retailers and manufacturers had been brought together there was a belief that in the end there would be a heavier tariff on the lower grade and medium furniture, and a lesser tariff on the higher grade, and it was indicated that the probable result would have been more employment in the home furniture manufacturing side and a great deal more employment in the furniture trading side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this point about sweated wages is <Col N="2281" /> going to be talked about we shall have to take it up.  There were criticisms here with regard to the furniture trade founded upon two points: (1) that certain establishments were such as would never be sanctioned if there was proper factory inspection carried out; (2) whether the establishments were right or not, the wages paid could be described as sweated.  On the first point, a detailed examination was made, and in the end the Committee who made that complaint had to admit that the factory inspection was being carried out properly and that the premises could not be caught under factory inspection.  There was even an offer made to these people who made that complaint that if they thought the Factory Acts were not sufficiently rigid, and if they put up suggestions for their amendment, these suggestions would be favourably considered.  I heard nothing more about that.</P>
    <P>On the wages end, the point was put up to some trade union representatives who were present at the meetings: why could not trade union activity, which could show itself very vehement on certain occasions, start about remedying these sweated conditions? There was no answer returned to that.  There was an indifferent answer at one time, that the difficulty was that these establishments being small did not employ any trade union labour, and that the trade unions had no control, as if the trade unions had no control over the goods produced by people who were not in their organisation.  I have seen it operating many a time.  The Minister himself said he was not satisfied that the trade unions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not advocating it, but just pointing out what often happened.  I cannot understand why it was not even threatened in this case, and the fact that it was not even mentioned shows the hollowness of the whole contention about sweated conditions.  The Minister himself stated openly that he was not satisfied with the trade union's attitude in this.  He could not see why, if conditions <Col N="2282" /> were so bad as that, trade union activity had not taken place long since.  The debate has gone on on the basis that the whole furniture trade was ruined by the small shops. I never heard the figure for the amount of furniture that is produced by what is called non-union labour, in the wildest extravagance, put higher than one-third of the entire furniture manufactured in the country.  I never heard any contention made about the sweated stuff coming in from Houndsditch, which is a delightful description to use.  I never heard any contention about Houndsditch furniture.  It may be made under healthier conditions than is some of the stuff manufactured in certain back streets in Dublin.  I should like to have information about that.  What are the prospects that even the 75 per cent. tariff is going to save that portion of the industry which Deputy Davin seems to think is the whole industry, namely, the bit of it located in his constituency?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephByrne" hpid="Mr. J.J. Byrne Mr. J.J. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of the question which is very important. I wonder if the Minister knows that the people engaged in the furniture trade have very grave objection to the way furniture is coming in and has been coming in, even under the 33? per cent. tariff. Certain very respectable firms engaged in the furniture trade have informed me, on more than one occasion, that if they were prepared to stoop to a certain low procedure with regard to the declaration of the value of imports they would be in a position to sell furniture much cheaper than competitors who are now underselling them.  Is it not well known to those who have a technical knowledge of the furniture business that under the old tariff furniture was coming in at declarations much below its real value.  I know that to be a fact. There is not a single thing in this Bill that would prevent such furniture coming in in the future as it has come in in the past.  In my opinion this tariff of 75 per cent. will considerably accentuate the malpractice that has existed and exists at present.  I have seen furniture imported and declared at <Col N="2283" /> £10 value that I know could not be purchased under £20.  I know that the better class of people engaged in the furniture trade have complained bitterly of that malpractice.  Now we have this tariff of 75 per cent.  Is that going to cure the malpractice that existed in the past?  Is it going to improve the position of the workers in any way?  I, for one, do not stand for sweated labour.  When the Minister stated that there is a certain section of retailers in this country who will not buy Irish furniture the first thought that flashed into my mind was about the dishonest section of people who are bringing in the foreign furniture and having it declared at a price far below its real value.  I do not want to say a word against the officers engaged at the port in connection with Customs duties, but it is a most difficult service and requires men who understand the value of the goods they are handling.  I know that men handling these goods have not the technical knowledge necessary.  If you are going to enforce tariffs effectively you must have men who understand the business.  Do you think you have such men?</P>

I am drawing the attention of the House to the matter and I suggest to the Minister that these high tariffs will not stop that traffic.  I think the Minister should consider the matter <Col N="2284" /> carefully.  No matter on what side of the House Deputies are sitting, whether the Government side, the Cumann na nGaedheal side or the Labour side, there is one motive we are all actuated by, and that is to do our best for the workers.  I suggest that the men who are dealing with these imports have very difficult duties and are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  Some of the new tariffs deal with certain items in my own trade. Take the tariff imposed on paints.</P>

I am not wandering from the point, I am pointing out the difficulties existing now.  Surely nothing could be more germane?  If tariffs are imposed, they must be effectively carried out.  I suggest that this tariff is not going to be effectively carried out.  Surely I have had some training in the subject I am dealing with.  I say that it is almost impossible for the officers concerned to function effectively.  Within the last few days, I saw that a new tariff was imposed on paint and on distemper in liquid form. Does the Minister know that there is no such thing as &ldquo;distemper in liquid form?&rdquo;  If that is so, why impose a tariff?</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan, having wrong information, naturally arrived at the wrong conclusion.  The bulk of the furniture imported into this country is a low grade type of furniture and not a high grade type, and it is to secure a market for that low grade type from Irish factories that the increased duty is imposed. The position concerning the making of the Provisional Order is that, having reason to believe that abnormal importations of furniture had taken place, and were about to take place, for various causes, I reported the matter to the Executive Council.  It was the intention of the Executive Council to impose this duty in the Customs Resolution, and if the Budget statement had been taken on the date on which it was originally intended to take it, this duty would have been contained in it.  Because of the postponement of the Budget and the necessity for protecting our market and to secure that damage would not be done to those engaged in the furniture industry the Executive agreed to the imposition of the emergency duty. The Resolution before the Dáil will make the emergency duty permanent. <Col N="2286" /> If it is rejected, the emergency duty ceases to operate.  I suggest to the Dáil that, apart altogether from any special consideration existing this year, it is a good thing to afford this additional protection to the furniture industry, to secure that there will be made in Irish factories by Irish workers who are paid decent wages, the £100,000 worth of furniture now imported.  If Deputies think otherwise, let them oppose the Resolution. That is the policy of this Party and it is to give effect to the policy enshrined in that view that this Party was elected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Customs Duties (Cocoa Preparations) (Provisional Variation) Order, 1932, which was made on the 2nd day of May, 1932, by the Executive Council under Section 1 of the Customs Duties (Provisional Imposition) Act, 1931 (No. 38 of 1931), and a copy of which was laid on the table of Dáil Eireann on the 4th day of May, 1932, be approved with and subject to the modification that the said Order shall not apply to cocoa powder imported before the 3rd day of November, 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duty imposed was, as Deputies are aware, a prohibitive one and applied to cocoa preparations, that is chocolate confectionery and other things of that kind.  There are a number of firms engaged in the production of these goods in this country and it is considered that they are a class of goods which we are quite capable of making for ourselves.  The importation of such confectionery in the past year was value almost for £300,000 and very considerable additional employment would be afforded by the imposition of this duty.  The price and quality of the products of the home factories compare very favourably with the price and quality of the products imported. There can be no question that we are in a position to supply from our own factories cocoa preparations just as <Col N="2289" /> good and just as cheap as they can be imported, but because of trade connections over a long number of years, credit facilities and things of that kind, certain English and other firms have been able to maintain a substantial foothold in our market despite the duty imposed and maintained by the late administration.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noticed that it is intended for a period of six months to vary the duty imposed by the original Order by removing it from cocoa powder.  That variation is made while examination is being given to certain proposals for the erection of new factories here and is designed merely to ensure that the position will not be changed to any considerable extent until that examination is completed or until any consequences of the examination have been realised, but cocoa powder imported in consequence of this modification will of course be subject, if imported in tins, to the new package duty.  If it becomes noticeable that abnormal quantities are being brought in, that is quantities over and above those imported on the average of previous years, it may be necessary to vary the duty again.  It is not anticipated that such will happen.  I cannot imagine what case can be made for allowing foreign workers to make our requirements in chocolate confectionery for us.  Therefore, I presume, the motion for imposing the prohibitive duty will have the unanimous consent of the Dáil.</P>

Can the Minister give us the imports for any one month of the four, five or six months before the Order?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are items in the case which has been made up and if they can be put forward by the person responsible for making the case and if they have not been put forward, I am entitled to call for them. As a matter of fact, the chocolate industry is going to have an increased protection by the difference between 6 3/5d. and 3/-, the full rate, or 5½d. and 2/-, the preferential rate.  In regard to that whole industry, I must say that it is the least satisfactory of all the industries on which tariffs were put in 1924, 1925, and 1926.  The excuse for these tariffs changes, of course.  Sometimes it is dumping.  Sometimes it is what the Minister so vehemently declaimed against the last time, a spirit of prejudice on the part of retailers.  Now we are given prejudice on the part of the consumer, added to that the contention that there are better terms given by the English manufacturers, and finally you have got it down to this, that shop girls have more interest in pushing English chocolates on consumers who were indifferent in the beginning as to what chocolates they would buy, in such a way that the sale of foreign chocolates goes up. Analysing the situation, we find the case emerging in this way: that the lower grade chocolate of home manufacture has collared most of the market, but that in the case of the higher grade chocolate, the home chocolate does not appear to shine. Then you get the contention further made that some people who normally would buy the lower grade chocolate seem to prefer to eat the higher grade English chocolate than buy the cheaper low-grade Irish chocolate.  Why that should be so, I do not know.  There is one explanation that leaks out&mdash;and it is almost unpatriotic to say it&mdash;that the quality of the stuff made at home may not be as good, and people who buy chocolate, as they sometimes do in a benevolent way in theatres and other places, prefer to pay an extra sixpence or a shilling and get good stuff rather than be patriotic at the expense of a pleasant life. <Col N="2291" /> I do not understand why chocolates should not be made in this country when you have the main firm engaged with not merely protection at the back of it but also the accumulation of every benefit that a manufacturer could ever have.  Yet that particular firm does not appear to be able to get ahead.  There was the Trades Loan Act, there was the old tariff, there were premises which were certainly given at less than what could have been obtained in the open market. There was a changing backward and forward of the Trades Loan Guarantee conditions according to that man's own scheme.  There was the fact that he got compensation for loss of his previous office, the fact that he has since got compensation as a distressed Loyalist, added to the fact that he is a director of the &ldquo;Irish Press.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an attack upon an individual who is not here&mdash;a low, mean, scurrilous attack, in my opinion.</P>

      <P>There should be no indication given in this place as to who a particular person referred to is.  I said that on another occasion, that this place should not be used to make that kind of attack on anybody.  There should be no indication given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mentioning a firm.  I say there is all that accumulation of benefits in the hands of that particular firm and yet they cannot make chocolates, except of a lower grade, in competition with the chocolates that come in from outside.  Why is it?  I never heard here any question of sweated conditions outside.  I never heard anything except these intangible matters put up from time to time, the question sometimes as to the preference which is a thing I think the consumer has a right to have.  The question of the retailers' prejudice <Col N="2292" /> will always occur.  It was not alleged with any show of reason and there was no argument put forward about it, that it was a retailers' prejudice which brought about the sale of English chocolates.  The only thing I ever heard in that regard, when scrutinised, turned out to be something in the nature of the fact that when a big consignment of English chocolates was ordered there was a bigger discount given on it but it had to be a big order&mdash;such an order that nobody outside a Dublin retailer could avail himself of the discount.</P>
      <P>I understand again that the chocolate business is to a great extent a Dublin business.  Dublin is the greatest consumer of chocolates in the country.  Cork is a very poor second, and the rest of the country comes almost nowhere.  Dublin firms can sometimes avail themselves of the conditions that are offered by English manufacturers, but that will not hold with regard to these other consumers throughout the country. Yet we have the same position apparently holding there.  I do not know what case there is for the increased duty.  We are told that it does not seem to be the right thing that our chocolates cannot be made at home.  <i>Prima facie</i> that is so.  Why are they not being made at home?  Is it that there is something in the way of technical capacity required on the manufacturing side to produce a better type of chocolate than we have got here?  Is it that there is not a proper appreciation that the public taste is something to cater for?  What attention is going to be paid to that end of the business if you raise the duty from something about 6½d. to 3/-?  If there is a slovenly manufacturer, in the sense of not making a proper attempt to cater for the ordinary taste of the public, taste which the public have a right to have, what is the likelihood of any proper attempt being made to cater for that taste when you increase the tariff by adding the difference between 6½d. and 3/-?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I say that this is an anti-dumping Order.  It is founded on the statement that &ldquo;Whereas the Executive <Col N="2293" /> Council is satisfied on the report of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the immediate variation in the manner hereinafter appearing of the Customs duty chargeable under Section 9 of the Finance Act, 1931, is necessary to prevent an expected dumping of articles liable to that duty arising out of financial or other events in other countries and occuring in circumstances which would occasion industrial injury.&rdquo;  Let us have some indication of the dumping that ever took place or was apprehended leading to the imposition of the Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The information as to whatever dumping took place will probably be available to the Deputy when the Trade and Shipping Statistics for the month of April are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Have you got them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was satisfied that abnormal importation&mdash;I prefer to use that phrase rather than the word &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; although dumping means the same thing&mdash;I was satisfied that certain importations in the sense of the word used by the Deputy had taken place, were taking place and would have taken place if the Order was not made.  I made representations to the Executive Council to that effect, and the Executive Council, on my advice, made the Emergency Order which the Dáil is now asked to approve of.  We have had Deputy Hogan talking to-day about the honest, hard-working Englishman and the lazy, thriftless Irishman and we also have had Deputy McGilligan talking about the foreign chocolate, the good stuff, and the Irish chocolate, the low-grade as if the terms were synonymous.  It is not so.  Not merely is it true that grade for grade the Irish chocolate is, in many cases, much better than the imported chocolate, but it is also true that in the case of one line of chocolate in which a very world-famous firm specialises, an Irish factory has beaten it here out of the home market on quality alone.  It is true, of course, that in the higher grades of chocolate because of the fact that the duty imposed by the late Government was a <Col N="2294" /> flat rate and not an ad valorem rate, and that therefore the degree of protection diminished as the quality increased&mdash;it is true that because of that fact the Irish firms have not been able to establish themselves in the market to the same extent that they have been able to with regard to the cheaper lines.  But they are going to do it now, and in fact they are doing it now. They are in a position and always have been in a position to supply the requirements of the trade in the higher classes of goods if the demand were available.  But the fact is that because of habit and because of the long association of the trade with the products of one or two particular firms, the Irish firms were not given the orders in the higher-grade lines which would enable them to go in for production in respect of these higher lines to any substantial extent.  They are doing it now, and additional plant, additional equipment is being installed to ensure that the factories will be adequately equipped with the most up-to-date machinery to enable the production of these goods to be undertaken.  I do not think really that there is any other point that I need meet.  It seems to me that the essential question that we should ask ourselves is that which I proposed to the Dáil originally: Are we competent or are we not to supply our own requirements in chocolates, and should we not, if necessary, be prepared to do without certain well advertised brands of chocolates in order that Irish firms may get into that end of the business, and that employment may be given to Irish people?  I think the answer to that question is so obvious that it is difficult to see how anybody except a doctrinaire free trader could bring himself into the position of saying that this duty is one which should not be imposed.  No hardship has been inflicted on anybody, no increase in the cost of living is likely to arise in consequence of it, the additional employment which it will give is very considerable indeed, and there is no question of the competency of the Irish firms to supply in quantity and in quality all our requirements. These are the main considerations <Col N="2295" /> that anyone should care about in considering a question of this kind, and consequently I recommend the Resolution to the Dáil. It is not true that the Resolution had to be amended as the Deputy suggests. When the original Order was made it was made deliberately and with the intention of maintaining it, but subsequent to the making of it certain representations were made and certain proposals were submitted for the establishment of factories here, which proposals must be considered.  The modification is intended to give time for the proper consideration of these proposals and to ensure that in respect of certain classes of goods the position would be left unchanged until the examination is completed.</P>

      <P>The gentle art of misrepresentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>People do not usually make up their minds in this way, that further modifications in tariffs are necessary if certain other things occur, and the psychological effect of confidence in business is a thing that may be destroyed in the light of the chopping and changing that takes place.  I wish to protest here against the gentle art of misrepresentation. Deputy Hogan did not talk about the lazy or thriftless Irish. He did talk about Irish people <Col N="2296" /> who were so hard-working that certain tender-hearted people described them as being sweated.  The Minister will find himself driven deeper and deeper into the mire if he talks in that way of sweated conditions in industry, if he takes upon himself the task of being the great trade union organiser and leader in the country and talks of the value of trade union conditions in industry. If I said anything about low-grade Irish chocolates&mdash;the two terms of low-grade and Irish being looked upon as synonymous&mdash;I have said exactly what was the representation of the chocolate manufacturers in this country during many years.  That is, in the low-grade end of chocolates&mdash; and you have to describe chocolates in some categories,&mdash;the high-grade, the lower high-grade and something lower, and then even in the second standard they said they had got the better part of the business.  That is all I ever said.  I do say that they represented to me very recently that on high-grade chocolates they had not been able to capture the market.</P>
      <P>It went to the point that on one occasion when they were asked for a certain written proposal, their belief was that if that written proposal was accepted with regard to certain grades of chocolates the result would be that certain people would be driven out of the low-grade chocolates and would have to go off to the dearer end and it was hoped that to that extent they would get rid of that much competition. That was their own contention. The Minister's line is &ldquo;Are we competent to manufacture chocolate or should we try to manufacture chocolates?&rdquo;  I put the other side of that question.  In the years in which this tariff has been on, have we shown ourselves competent after trial under favourable circumstances to make certain grades of chocolates in the country?  We have got no answer to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He tells us that very considerable added employment can be got.  I suppose statistics on that will have to be got somewhere else, but I would like to know when the Minister says considerable employment, how much does this amount to&mdash;what is the amount of <Col N="2297" /> this added employment?  Surely it is an item that should be announced to us by the responsible person in the Government who is making the case for a tariff.  What were the abnormal importations that were actually threatened before the Minister was induced to put on this tariff?  I put the Minister already another question as to statutory rings.</P>
    <P>There never was a more brazen proposal put up by any group of manufacturers than the proposal for a statutory ring put up by a certain group of manufacturers in this country.  They had not the case that could be alleged in the case of the furniture manufacturers. They have not the same ground for the statement as to sweated conditions or that their competitors were small firms working under unhygienic conditions.  They simply said this: &ldquo;We have reached the saturation point and gone beyond it.&rdquo;  The only way out of the difficulty put up to me was to pass legislation saying that nobody would be allowed to take up the manufacture of these chocolates unless they got a licence from a certain committee, that certain committee being a self-selected group of manufacturers.  They did not intend even to give licences to all the manufacturers in the trade even though some who would be put out were nationals of this country.  They could carry on their trade if they were given that privilege.  So they could, if the consumers were driven to eat what they produced.  They could carry on for a while, but probably not for very long.</P>
    <P>These were the conditions that were put forward.  There are much better conditions for statutory rings in this country when the duty has been raised in the way it has been raised.  We shall hear about that later.  Before even these preliminaries or the early stage of this Resolution is passed, we should hear from the Minister what were the imports of an abnormal type threatened or what imports had actually taken place prior to this Order going on, or what was the very considerable added employment that was going to come in the country by reason of this.</P>
    <Col N="2298" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give anything like an accurate estimate in the matter of employment, first, because, or mainly because, the method of production is changing in the country and new machines are being installed.  The change in the machinery involves less labour than heretofore.  There have been, in fact, some reductions recently in the industry in the matter of labour of that kind.</P>
      <P>The position is roughly this: that the chocolate imports in 1931 were valued at £300,000.  The output of the various Irish factories for that year was £167,000.  The output in 1929 was valued at £167,000.  I do not want the Deputies to draw any wrong conclusions from these figures.  The output of the Irish factories was mainly of the cheaper grade of chocolate. The imports were of the higher grade of chocolate, so I assume from the point of view of employment that the number of persons might be increased by from 50 per cent. to 75 per cent.  These figures will depend on the type of equipment used in the production of chocolates under the new circumstances in the Irish factories. On the question of abnormal imports I have only this to say: that such abnormal imports were taking place and were likely to have taken place in much greater quantities if the Order was not imposed.  Having satisfied myself of that, and having succeeded in satisfying the Executive Council on the matter, the Order was made. That Order now goes before the Dáil for approval, and if approved it becomes a permanent duty in operation.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied they are not merely of different quality, but they are entirely different in blend, taste and everything of that kind.  I forget the names of them.  The position as regards cocoa is that the duty is being maintained at the level at <Col N="2300" /> which it has always operated, for a period of six months.  We intended to make it a prohibitive duty by the Order, but in consequence of certain proposals made, which are now under consideration, this six months postponement of the prohibition has been decided upon.  At the end of six months the prohibition comes into operation, but the circumstances existing in this country in relation to the industry and the number of firms engaged in it may, and probably will, have changed substantially by then.</P>

You can eat confectionery but you cannot eat furniture. I will state, without fear of contradiction, that there are plenty of ladies whom you could blindfold and they can put the different kinds of chocolates into their various grades. In this country we have a demand for all kinds of chocolate manufactured in England.  I do not want the House to think that I am contending that there is nothing like the English chocolate. I do know there is a demand for the various grades of chocolate that come from England.  Of course I admit that the Irish manufacturers are supplying two, and, at most, three, of these <Col N="2301" /> grades.  One will find, however, that the rest of the public taste is not being catered for here at all.</P>

    <Title>In Committee on Finance. - Sugar Confectionery Provisional Variation Order.</Title>
    <P>That the Customs Duties (Sugar Confectionery) (Provisional Variation) Order, 1932, which was made on the 2nd day of May, 1932, by the Executive Council under section 1 of the Customs Duties (Provisional Imposition) Act, 1931 (No. 38 of 1931), and a copy of which was laid on the Table of Dáil Eireann on the 4th day of May, 1932, be approved, with and subject to the modification that the said Order shall not apply to sugar candy.</P>
    <P>I do not think any Deputy who knows anything about this industry can have any doubt about the advisability of imposing this Order.  The existing factories in the Saorstát are in a position to supply not merely the requirements of this country, but half the requirements of Europe as well. There is very intense competition between them, and the usual complaint is that none of the factories is working at a profit and that the prices of sugar confectionery of various kinds are lower here than in most countries in the world.  The modification suggested is made in consequence of various representations that have been submitted.  The sugar candy referred to in the Resolution is a commodity not sold retail; it is used as a raw material in the making of certain classes of sugar confectionery.  It is subject to a duty on its sugar content, in any case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan should not blame me if I place him with the smaller fry, among the minnows, in a party where every dab considers itself a dolphin, since the Deputy a week or two ago likened himself to a sprat, a poor sort of fish, I understand.  I said on the last day that in the course of the three days' debate we did not have one useful constructive idea from the Opposition. They obstructed, they distorted, they disported themselves on the thin ice of misrepresentation and Deputy McGilligan's speech was an excellent example of what I mean.  After a preliminary canter for half an hour on Wednesday evening, he spent the better part of Friday morning running around the subject of the Budget like a white mouse in a cage, but he never once got to the centre of the argument.  He never once knit the issue upon the central, vital fact, what sort of a Budget would Cumann na nGaedheal have produced in the same circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a discussion from the Deputy about minor poets, an uninteresting subject at any time.  We had a seascape of the Spanish Main painted laboriously in midnight oils. And we had a juggling feat with three sixpences.  But what else had we?  I am sorry the Deputy is not here.  It is not often I pay him a tribute, but I wish to give him every credit that is due to him.  His speech, like the ragamuffin that has just been bathed, presented an unwonted aspect.  It was a little cleaner than usual, but outside this pleasing innovation, what else was there in Deputy McGilligan's speech?  Like every Opposition speech which preceded it the Deputy exhibited the same callous outlook, the same utter disregard of the necessities of the unemployed.  Could anything better exemplify the outlook of the Opposition than Deputy McGilligan's adoration of the three sixpences? He was panegyrical about the three sixpences which we were putting on the income tax, but he was dumb, dumb as a dead-head, about the four sixpences that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, if it had been put in power by the last general <Col N="2304" /> election, would have taken off the old age pensions.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Blythe, Deputy McGilligan twitted us about economies we are proposing, but he was silent about the economies which would have been undertaken by a Government of which Deputy Cosgrave would have been the head, of which Deputy Blythe would have been the Minister for Finance, and of which Deputy McGilligan, if they did not determine to shift him from the Department of Industry and Commerce because of the mess he had made of the Shannon Scheme, would have been Minister for Industry and Commerce. After all, the Opposition are just as strictly pledged to economies as we are.</P>
    <P>When the Supplementary Budget was introduced last autumn, Deputy Blythe promised that certain economies would be secured which would enable them to avoid a deficit at the end of the last financial year.  Cumann na nGaedheal had ample time to secure economies.  They had ten years to think over them, a familiarity with the administrative machine which the two short months that we have been in power would not have permitted us to acquire.  Why did not Deputy Cosgrave and why did not Deputy Blythe make other economies before they went to the country?  Let the House and the country have an answer to that question.  Deputy Cosgrave did not give it in his speech.  Deputy Blythe did not give it in his speech and Deputy McGilligan, who was prating about two million pounds in economies, did not give it in his speech.  Why was it that we did not hear of the economies that Deputy Cosgrave's Cumann na nGaedheal Government would have made if it had been in office, and if it had to present a Budget in the present circumstances to this House?  Because those economies were of a nature that could only have been made after a general election had returned them securely to office for another four years.  Cumann na nGaedheal dare not face the country on the economies which they had in mind.  They were afraid to submit them to the judgment of the people because the people are not so cold <Col N="2305" /> and so callous as they would have been in regard to the hunger and suffering which unemployment is causing throughout every one of the Twenty-Six Counties to-day.  The people would have had small welcome for Deputy Cosgrave and for Deputy Cosgrave's Government if they had had the courage to carry out the economies which they contemplated when Deputy Blythe made his speech last autumn.  It would have been better for them to at least have had the courage because if they had been defeated, some people might have had some respect for them.</P>
    <P>The hypocrisy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party disqualifies them from attacking the Budget because the economies adumbrated in it are insufficient, and I am not denying that they are insufficient, but unlike the late Government we are not budgeting for more than we can possibly hope to achieve in the twelve months before us.  If we have not come to this House and said that we propose to secure two million pounds in economies in order to balance this Budget after we have been ten weeks in office&mdash;two million pounds that Deputy McGilligan, a member of the last Government which had been in office for ten years, told us they could not secure&mdash;it is because we are in earnest and because we mean what we say and meant what we said when we went to the people. We knew that nobody would believe that having to take over the machine from the late Government, having to run this country on the basis of the estimates for services prepared by the late Government, we had to find the means to keep that machine going or else shut down the Government of the country altogether.  But inside the life of this Dáil, before we go to the country again, we will have shown the people that economies could have been made and not economies by way of a reduction in salaries or allowances to any officer, but economies by a complete reorganisation of the services, and these economies will justify the pledges which we gave to the people before the General Election.  And it is because that, just as their hypocrisy should have kept them silent in regard to the economies, so their incompetency <Col N="2306" /> to criticise this Budget has left the members of the Opposition devoid of material that we have had the speeches which we did have from the two Deputies, Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy McGilligan.</P>
    <P>It is because of that fact that last week we had the most scandalous and shameful innuendoes and suggestions attacking, as I have said, the personal honour of every member of the Government. When he was head of the last Government Deputy Cosgrave posed as a pillar of discretion and responsibility. If any member, particularly if any Front Bench member of the Fianna Fáil Opposition as it then was, had ventured to make the vile suggestions which Deputy Cosgrave made in his speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <P>&mdash;how the unctuous Deputy would have rent his garments and declaimed in horror at the damage which was being done to the credit of the State if the personal honour of the Government was being assailed. There never was an attempt so despicable, or so malevolent, or so deliberately and intentionally malicious as that made by Deputy Cosgrave, and there never was an attempt so cowardly.  Not merely did the Deputy shelter himself behind the privileges of this House, but he even referred to some imaginary people outside this House in an endeavour to disclaim responsibility for charges which no man's mouth but his was suited to utter.  I say that the charges were shameful and that they are as baseless as they were shameful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I challenge Deputy Cosgrave to divest himself of his privileged position as a member of the Dáil and to repeat on a public platform or in the public Press what he said here in this House.  I challenge him to make those charges against me personally outside this House because I am the person <Col N="2307" /> whose honour is being impugned by the Deputy, and I will stake that honour, I will stake my own poverty, against the honour of Deputy Cosgrave and against Deputy Cosgrave's wealth, because Deputy Cosgrave is a wealthy Deputy.  He has often boasted of that fact in this House.  A Dublin jury&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of twelve men will give a verdict in my favour and against him.  What I have said in regard to Deputy Cosgrave applies likewise to Deputy McGilligan.  In the course of his speech on Friday Deputy McGilligan used the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Are there any Ministers or any members attached to the Government who carry on a profession of a private type and use the Government offices for private work?  If so, will civil servants be allowed to engage in other work of a professional occupation and to use their offices and even their staffs in the same way?</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan has taken refuge in flight.  Deputy McGilligan's tactics during the last Dáil were to sit and to have the last word.  I likened him then in debate to a hermit crab whose first concern was to protect his own rear.  He has had to divest himself of his shell and make himself scarce.  If Deputy McGilligan were here I would challenge him to say who is the member of the Government who used a Government office and the Government staffs to do his own private work? Since we came into office every Ministerial post has been a full-time post, a post occupying not merely eight hours of the twenty-four, but sometimes more than sixteen.  Every minute of our day, every minute of our week&mdash;and every week one of seven days&mdash;has been occupied by Government work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For myself, because of the manner in which I was asked to become a member of the Government I was not able to divest myself of certain professional <Col N="2308" /> responsibility to my clients. I am carrying on my own office winding up those undertakings, and the only interest I have in it now is to find the weekly cheque that provides wages for my staff.  But our posts have been just as much full-time posts as they were in the last Government when the then Minister for Agriculture continued as a member of the firm of Shiels and Hogan, or Deputy Eamon Duggan continued as a member of the firm of Duggan and O'Reilly or Deputy McGilligan who, whilst pretending to have responsibility for two Ministerial Departments had himself called to the Bar, or Deputy Fionan Lynch who was in the same position as Deputy McGilligan, or as would have the remainder of the Cabinet if they had any other business outside politics to attend to.</P>
    <P>Why were these personal attacks made?  Because, I repeat again, the Opposition had no case against the Budget.  When you have a bad case, slander your opponent, vilify him, drag his personal honour in the mud, and make the Government as despicable, if you can, as the Opposition.  That is why Deputy Cosgrave told us here in the House, of what certain unnamed people were saying outside; that is why Deputy McGilligan made his attack, unctuously and full of self-righteousness, this man who, because of his base and shameless neglect of the interests of Irish industrialists, during the time he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, is going to set himself down in ease, in the Chair which is being prepared for him as a solatium for loss of office, by an English industrialist who has provided £20,000 to secure for him a pension for the rest of his life.  The only thing I will say in that regard, is that, we who know Deputy McGilligan will say that that industrialist had a sardonic humour when he decided to christen that Chair a Chair of international peace.</P>
    <P>I say that the Opposition and their tactics during the debate have shown that they have no case against the Budget.  Barren of argument, void of any alternative, they came to this <Col N="2309" /> debate, armed with pins to scratch and squirts to bespatter, but, despite their attack, the Budget stands to-day as an advance in the economic reconquest of Ireland for the Irish.  Again, think of the circumstances in which this Budget was introduced.  In this House, we have comparative quiet.  Deputy McGilligan may jibe and may jeer, in the role of the King's jester, and we are slightly amused.  Deputy Cosgrave plays the knock-about comedian among the figures, and we laugh, and it is one of Deputy Cosgrave's more engaging qualities that he is easy to laugh at, but, outside this House, there is hunger and want and desperation amongst the people.  There are children whose only provider is the garbage tin of the rich.  How long could this position endure under Deputy Cosgrave's Government; how long could it endure under any other Government that would be so neglectful, so regardless of the position outside this House, as Deputy Cosgrave's Government was, and would have been, if they had been here on these benches to-day?</P>
    <P>Let those who jeer, let Deputy McGilligan who jeers, listen to what was said by a clergyman who lives and works among the people, a clergyman who for the last four years has not driven through the people closed up in a tin box, as the members of the late Government have:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unless the unemployment menace is stemmed, I believe that within five years the ordered state of the community will be upset and that a social and economic revolution is inevitable.  That is not only my own belief.  I think it is well-founded, and the national economic policy which has been declared in this Budget is a genuine effort made by one country to rid itself of the terrible danger hanging over it in common with many other countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the justification for our Budget. Those are the circumstances in which this Budget was prepared.  Those are the facts to which we had regard when outlining our scheme of taxation.</P>
    <P>To come back to the kernel of this debate, to the question which has gone <Col N="2310" /> unanswered, and which has been left unanswered during the last two weeks almost.  In the same circumstances, what would the Opposition have done? If we can judge them by their past, we can answer that question.  They would have shut their eyes to the plight of the people.  They would have disregarded every sign that unpleasantly reminded them of the unemployment menace.  They would have continued their merry social round, posturing as leaders of fashion, patrons of sport, converting themselves into a new aristocracy, with all the faults and none of the graces of the old.  And if, in the midst of these, born out of the desperation of the people, the menace of revolution appeared, they would have been quite content in the name of established order to crush it out ruthlessly with their army and under the authority of the special legislation which, taking time by the forelock, they put on the Statute Book last year.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy McGilligan is not here, because I was going to say something about him which I know, not from any confidential document, but which I will say, and he can answer me later if he dares.  Deputy McGilligan jeered at what he describes as a hair-shirt Budget.  I am quite sure that a hair-shirt would not appeal to the Deputy who, as a member of the last Government, refused, in connection with journeys which he took upon Government business to London, to accept the same subsistence allowance as his own colleagues in the Cabinet did.  When he was in the Government. Deputy McGilligan's lot was cast in pleasant places.  The luxury of the Lido, the opulence of London, the routs and masquerades of Geneva, have made the Deputy's skin so tender that he shuddered at the thought of a hair shirt.  But which is the greatest safeguard against revolution? Which is of the greatest service to the people in the present crisis?  Our hair-shirt Budget or Deputy McGilligan's night club diplomacy?</P>
    <P>Last year Deputy Cosgrave told us that the social order was in danger. This year the warning is repeated, not by politicians but by priests and social workers who see the unendurable <Col N="2311" /> misery of the people around them. Which will afford the strongest assurance that the menace will pass and that our people will remain law-abiding and peaceful?  Deputy Cosgrave's slanders, Deputy McGilligan's jokes, or the relief of the unemployed which we are providing in this Budget?</P>
    <P>This Budget, as Deputy Davin said, will stand as a Christian Budget, and as a humane Budget.  It will stand also as an honest Budget.  The people know what they are paying and what they are paying for.  They know what is being raised in taxation and what is being raised by borrowing. They can see how the normal Budget is being balanced and how the special provision, which has to be made to meet the abnormal depression, is being secured.  Could that have been said of any one of my predecessor's Budgets?  Deputy Blythe is not here, but let Deputy Cosgrave, in consultation with whom Deputy Blythe's Budgets were prepared, and who himself was at one time Minister for Finance, ask Deputy Blythe what is on the records of his own Department. Could it have been said of any single one of Deputy Blythe's Budgets that the people in this State, or any person outside this State, knew what the true financial position of the country was?  Every artifice that a dishonest book-keeper could use to disguise that position, to cover it up, was employed by the late Government.  But we have put before the people a plain honest balance sheet.  We have concealed no loss; we have concealed no difficulty; we have concealed no debt, and no contingent liability.  The people know what they are up against and we are asking them to make sacrifices in order to avert the peril which Father Ryan said yesterday hangs over this country; in order that things may go on in their daily ordered round; that men may not be turned into wolves by hunger; and that Christian principles may still prevail in this land.</P>
    <P>Not only is this an honest Budget, it is a soundly-constructed Budget. The burdens have been fairly adjusted, and the proof of that is that no serious attempt has been made to attack <Col N="2312" /> the Budget in detail.  Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Cosgrave did try to criticise it in some respect, but their criticism was so ill-informed as to be ludicrous.  Take Deputy McGilligan's criticism.  He quoted a passage from a speech of mine, the whole point of which was that an increase in the income tax should be accompanied by a revision of the reliefs and allowances.  Deputy McGilligan apparently thought that I had failed to observe that principle. What are the facts?  The incidence of the income tax has been so wisely re-adjusted that even to-day a single person with an unearned income of £250 pays less than he would have to pay in Great Britain with a 5/- income tax, and married couples who have an income of £300, even under the 5/- rate in this Budget, will be paying less than they were paying under the last Budget with the 3/6 rate.  A married couple with an earned income of £300, under Deputy Cosgrave's régime and with his 3/6 income tax, would have paid £3 18s. 9d.  Under this scale, the same couple, with a 5/- income tax, will only pay £3 2s. 6d.  Again, as compared with the position in Great Britain, our married couple, with no children, with an income of £350, will pay just a little over half of what they would pay in Great Britain with a 5/- income tax, for they only pay £8 6s. 8d. here, as compared with £16 5s. 0d. in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sir James Craig was mournful at the lot of the people who will have to fly from this country, by implication either to Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  All I can say is that before they go let them study the income tax scale very carefully, because they will find that if they are leaving the Free State to go to Northern Ireland it is a case of jumping out of the frying pan into a much hotter fire.  It is only when the income of this married couple gets above £700 that there is any difference at all between the two scales.  If the income is £600 on a married couple they pay £58 15s.  In Great Britain they will pay £60 12s. 6d.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2313" /> But the comparison is much more favourable when we come to those with whom we are really concerned.  Married people in this country who have young children whom they are bringing up, the hope and the future of this land, will find the discrepancy as between their treatment under Deputy Cosgrave's Government and ours is much more pronounced.  With his 3/6 income tax and with his scale of relief devised to give relief only to the rich, the married couple with three children and an income of £400 would have paid £3 18s. 9d. income tax. Under our 5/- income tax they will pay nothing.  With an income of £450 they had to pay an income tax of £7 17s. 6d. under the late Budget; under ours they will have to pay nothing.  With his 3/6 income tax a couple with an income of £500 per annum would have to pay £11 16s. 3d.  With our 5/- income tax they will pay less than half that&mdash;£5 12s. 6d.  An income of £550 under the Cosgrave régime and the 3/6 income tax would have to pay £15 15s.; under our 5/- income tax the same income would pay £11 5s.  And so on up the scale.  And even as compared again with the British at £800 our married couple with a family of three children would have to pay £66 5s. as compared with £68 2s. 6d. which they would have to pay in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Again I repeat if there is any income tax payer in this State who thinks he is going to have a better time in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, he had better examine the scale and let him see what he is letting himself in for before he decides to go.  That is the case in regard to income tax.  I do not suppose there is anyone here in this House who will get up and say that if he had prepared the Budget this year he would not have had to increase the income tax.  Does anybody believe that Deputy Cosgrave would have been able, if he remained at the head of the Government, to balance the Budget this year without increasing the income tax, and without making 5/- the standard rate.  I am perfectly certain that Deputy Cosgrave himself does not believe it.</P>

      <P>I am rather sorry Deputy Cosgrave has now gone, because I have a few more kind things to say about him.  I was going to talk about the surtax.  Deputy Cosgrave is a great financier.  He is fond of figures.  But when Deputy Cosgrave starts talking about figures in this House he reminds me of a man in hobnailed boots trying to walk upon ice. He does not merely trip; he simply sprawls, and Deputy Cosgrave sprawled all through his criticism of our surtax proposals.  He talked first of all about an individual, and there is not, he admitted, even one such individual in this country, with an income of £100,000.  Now it is a poor case which you cannot prove by taking a typical example.  In the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties there is not one individual domiciled in this State who pays the full tax in this State with an income of £100,000.  Yet that is the imaginary individual for whom Deputy Cosgrave here pleads, the gentleman with an income of £100,000.  He has to take gilt-edged examples when he comes to attack our Budget.  He has to take an imaginary example&mdash;a creature of his own imagination&mdash;and he proceeds to deal with this hypothetical individual in these terms.  He says he pays 5/- in the £ income tax; 6/3 surtax, and 2/6 which is not called income tax.  I agree about the 2/6 which is not called income tax. But will Deputy Cosgrave tell me what the 2/6 is to be called? Was it simply thrown in as a make weight in order to arrive at his figure of 13/9 in the £, the rate at which he said this individual will pay taxation to the State?  I am sorry the Deputy has gone.  I would like to see where that 2/6 came in.  I cannot understand how it does come in.  It could not possibly have come in in reference to the corporation profits tax, because the standard rate of that tax is 1/6 in the £, and not 2/6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Cosgrave is going to make a case in figures so far as 1/- is concerned, it does not matter to him in the slightest where he gets the shilling, he will bring it in in order to round off an argument which could not stand up on the facts.  How did Deputy Cosgrave, who was one time a <Col N="2315" /> Minister responsible for the finances of this State, arrive at this figure of 6/3 for the surtax?  I think the first office which he held in the Government was that of Minister for Finance, and then possibly his colleagues found him out and turned him out.  Does the Deputy who got up and talked in millions, and told us how the market value of a certain industry had shrunk from forty millions to 25 millions, who was so glib and so apt in cross-talk where figures were concerned&mdash;know how this surtax is assessed?  Does he know the difference between the scale and the effective rates at which surtax is assessed?  I said that we had not an individual with an income unearned of £100,000 per year in this State.  I had that case examined to see what that mythical individual would pay if he ever took concrete shape and form in this country.  I find that he would pay 10/10 in income tax and in surtax&mdash;not even 11/3 which Deputy Cosgrave assumed, and certainly not 13/9, which the Deputy used in order to make a false and a fictitious case against the Budget.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the Corporation Profits Tax.  Deputy Cosgrave was eloquent in defending the big corporations. What was the record of his own Government in this connection? He alleges that the additional impost which we are putting on is a crushing one, that it is going to make it impossible for certain of these concerns to compete in Great Britain, that it is going to make it impossible for the soundest banking corporation in the world&mdash;the Bank of Ireland&mdash;to carry on.  What was Deputy Cosgrave's own record in regard to the big industry which he says finds a large share of its market across the water? He gave effect to the same principle of discrimination and regard to that concern as we did, and did it for the same reason.  He did it for the reason that because of its refusal to maintain a register of its shareholders here this State and the people of this State lose a substantial amount in estate duties whenever an Irish shareholder in that concern dies.  It was Deputy Cosgrave who in 1928 in order to <Col N="2316" /> secure for this country some compensation for that loss introduced this principle of differentiation.  The rate of corporation profits tax was five per cent. before 1928.  Deputy Blythe in the Finance Bill of 1928 brought in a section whereby foreign companies operating and carrying on business in this country, which did not maintain a register of their shareholders here, were to be charged an additional 2½ per cent.  We were compelled to take this course by nothing except dire necessity, without any desire to discriminate against any section of this community; we had to balance our Budget; we had to provide for the needs of our people, and when we came to consider the increase in the corporation profits tax we were compelled to follow the precedent set by our predecessors.  In order to recoup to our Exchequer some part of the loss which is occasioned by the policy which this company, for its own convenience, thinks it necessary to follow, we were compelled to increase the rate in that case from 1/6 to 2/- in the £.  Deputy Cosgrave says that that additional 6d. was a crushing impost.  That is an accusation against his own Government. It is a verdict of guilty against his own Government, because to make that charge, and to substantiate it, means that that 6d. was the last straw which broke the camel's back.  Deputy Cosgrave does not believe that any more than I do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave became eloquent in his tears when he came to consider the case of another corporation, a banking corporation, which for the first time has been brought within the scope of this tax.  It is the one bank which never paid corporation profits tax until now.  If discrimination in taxation is an unjust principle, if it is a principle to which effect should never be given, why did Deputy Cosgrave's Government for ten years discriminate in favour of that bank?  I am not attacking the bank. It has rendered very valuable services to the Government during the past ten years.  But why, if every other bank had to pay corporation profits tax, was this bank privileged?  Deputy Cosgrave talks about the widow's mite <Col N="2317" /> and about the widow's investments. Are there no widow's investments in other banks?  Why did he not play the weeping walrus in regard to the widow's investments in other banks just as well as he did in regard to the bank in whose shares he admitted he advised his own friends to invest? Was that why Deputy Cosgrave was so annoyed?  Was that why this bank remained privileged always?  Because it was the stocking into which Deputy Cosgrave's friends put their savings. He was indignant about a tax which for some time I could not quite understand&mdash;a tax, he said, on the Currency Commission.  Deputy Cosgrave got up and made a speech attacking the Budget and he did not even know what was in the Budget.  There is no tax on the Currency Commission. The Currency Commission is not being used to collect a tax.  Deputy Cosgrave who filled columns of the newspapers with a speech about the Budget did not know that.  There is stamp duty upon consolidated bank notes. Our predecessors levied a tax also upon consolidated bank notes, only they called it a fee.  But it goes into the Exchequer and is used as ordinary revenue to defray ordinary expenditure during the year.  The fact that that fee is imposed is an admission that this consolidated bank note issue is a taxable article.  I do not wish to say that that tax will remain always as a permanent impost.</P>
    <P>I frankly recognise that the conditions in which the banks were allowed to make that consolidated bank note issue were outlined in the report of the last Banking Commission, but I do say that, in the present circumstances&mdash; this Budget must be related to the present circumstances and we must not think of it as if we had normal economic conditions&mdash;when we have to impose an income-tax of 5s., when we have slightly to increase the surtax throughout the range, when we have to increase corporation profits tax, when we have to put a duty on tobacco, when we were putting indirect taxation on every section of the community to the tune of almost £1,000,000 and when we were still short, where else could we more fittingly turn than to this concession <Col N="2318" /> given by the community and the State to the banks and ask them, in our present circumstances, in our desperate need, to forego some share&mdash;even a large share&mdash;of the profit which that consolidated bank note issue brings them?  If some of the plutocrats who form the backbone of the Independent Party, if some of the wealthier men who sit on the back benches were here, I would ask them whether they would prefer to have that £90,000 out of the consolidated bank note issue left untouched or the income-tax increased even by a threepenny piece. Even if there had been a certain implied agreement in connection with this consolidated bank note issue&mdash;I am not prepared to accept that, but I am putting the case against us at its very worst&mdash;in the whole of the circumstances, when we had no other place to go, and even if we had other places to go&mdash; even if we could have increased the tax on tea or any other tax&mdash;to meet the present situation, any Government would be justified in asking the banks to forego in this year some portion of their profits and to come to the aid of the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan sometimes says funnier things than he knows of.  The same may be said of Deputy Cosgrave. The biggest joke in the speeches of these two Deputies, who are apparently the financial experts on the Opposition Front Bench, was the statement that this &ldquo;savoured of inflation&rdquo; and that the only reason they could conceive for imposing this tax was that the Government had decided to &ldquo;embark on a policy of inflation.&rdquo;  That statement shows how much either of these gentlemen knows about the currency position.  The bulk of our currency is not legal tender notes or consolidated bank notes but the cheque money to the tune of £114,000,000 per year which circulates through the State.  The total amount of the consolidated bank note issue allocated to the banks is £6,000,000 and the amount they have already put in circulation is £5,750,000.  Add that £5,750,000 to the £114,000,000 of cheque money and&mdash;I speak now merely from recollection&mdash;to the 6½ million pounds of legal tender note issue and you get about <Col N="2319" /> £126,000,000 of money in circulation. According to Deputy McGilligan, if there is to be any inflation at all, we are going to inflate that huge volume by something less than .02 per cent. or 1/500th.  Deputy McGilligan calls that &ldquo;embarking on a policy of inflation.&rdquo; When he is so hard driven in his attack on the Budget as to be forced to rely on an argument that is a burlesque, we can understand how sound this Budget is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave, in attacking the motion which proposes to make certain incomes, derived from rents, chargeable under Schedule D, said that that was a tax on business rents.  He even went further and said it was a tax on house rents and on dwelling houses. Once more Deputy Cosgrave's silly criticisms indicate that he does not understand, and that he is not competent to understand what the Budget is about. He did not read the Resolution.  The Resolution has no connection with house rents at all.  It refers only to premises occupied for the purpose of business or a profession.  Deputy Cosgrave was filled with solicitude for the poverty-stricken rich, but he was perfectly callous in regard to the poor. He condemned this tax, root and branch.  What is Deputy Cosgrave defending in this House?  This is the sort of thing that is going on in Dublin while Deputy Bennett is so doleful about the lot of the unfortunate bachelor.  I sympathise with the Deputy.  There is one cure for him, and that is to become entitled to the marriage allowance.  There is, I suppose, a husband of sorts, and perhaps, the father of a family lost in the Deputy, and we are giving him every encouragement.  We are making bachelorhood less attractive, and by putting a tax on cosmetics we are lessening the risks of the Deputy's courtship.  I hope that, between the income-tax and the tax on cosmetics Deputy Bennett will take the plunge, and that before the close of the year we will see him marching blushing down the aisle, thick with confetti, to the tune of the Wedding March.  Does Deputy Cosgrave or Deputy Bennett or Deputy MacEoin or Deputy <Col N="2320" /> Mulcahy stand for this sort of thing which is going on every day in Dublin &mdash;business premises, with a valuation of £205, let at a rent of £1,000 per annum, plus rates?  The Opposition, I suppose, hard-driven by their Whips are going to vote against this Budget. If they vote against it, one of the things they are going to vote for is, that the person who owns property valued at £205, and who lets it at a rent of £1,000 per annum, plus rates, shall escape scot-free off £795 on assessment?  While they were letting that man get off with £795 of income tax last year they put a tax of 4d per lb. on sugar, and they could have got quite a little bit out of the change which we are making this year.</P>
    <P>Again, we had the wail about the tax on tea.  Deputy McMenamin was particularly concerned about the tax on tea.  He told us&mdash;and he is not over-painting the picture&mdash;about little children in the Gaeltacht who are reared on black tea from the moment they are weaned.  I said that he is not over-painting the picture.  That is quite true.  To my own knowledge of the Blasket Islands, it is quite true. To my own knowledge of parts of the Kerry Gaeltacht, it is quite true.  It is quite true in Connemara.  It is quite true in Tirconaill, which Deputy McMenamin represents; but let Deputy McMenamin and any other Deputy on the Opposition Benches who is concerned about the fate of these children, let him know that when he goes into the Division Lobby against this Budget that he is going to cast his vote against a Budget which for the first time in our history provides something which, at any rate, will enable these children to be brought up on milk, instead of on that poisonous decoction of black tea that is the staple diet throughout many parts of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I have been assailed by Deputy Sir James Craig because I am taking something out of the Sweepstakes.  It has been suggested&mdash;it has not been said here, but said outside&mdash;that I am robbing the hospitals.  It is quite true that I did indicate to the Hospitals Committee that it would be necessary for me to get about £650,000 out of <Col N="2321" /> the Sweepstakes, and I did propose to take it in a way which would have reduced the burden on the hospitals to about 6 per cent.  I did propose to take it off the whole pool, and when the Emergency Committee heard of this they came to me and made representations, and because I am not like Deputy McGilligan, because I am prepared to change my mind if a case is put up to me, because I was not going to say that the members of the Emergency Committee of the hospitals were not better or more competent judges in this case than I was, I accepted their suggestion that, instead of making a levy on the whole pool, I should restrict myself to the hospitals' share.</P>
    <P>If I had done it my way, the hospitals, it is true, would have suffered, but they would have suffered very much less than in the way in which I have done it at the instigation and at the request of those who are competent to speak for the hospitals.  I have on my files a letter telling me that rather than have it done my way, they would prefer I should take the whole of the money I required out of the hospitals' share, and Deputy Bennett, Deputy Doctor Myles Keogh, and a number of other Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies who went to the hospitals' meeting and tried to make political capital out of that were as well aware of the fact as I am.  I do not believe that because we have done that, it is going to injure the future of the Sweepstakes one whit, and those who are running the Sweepstakes do not believe it either, and they are as good judges on this matter as those who are trying to make political capital out of it.</P>
    <P>If you ask me is it right to take this money from the Sweepstake I have no hesitation in saying &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  For a considerable time there has been a public demand to devote some part of the proceeds of the Sweepstakes to other public uses of a humanitarian character. We have had meetings called at which resolutions were adopted asking that a share of the funds should be allocated to the purpose of housing. It was even suggested that some part of it might be utilised for the provision of relief.  I am not going to explore <Col N="2322" /> one form of charity more than another, but I take the liberty to remind the House that the divine injunction to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to harbour the harbourless takes precedence over the injunction to tend the sick.  It takes it for this reason, that when you have removed the causes which fill the hospitals, which fill them to overflowing, when you have removed the evils, relieved malnutrition, when you have cured the unhealthy living conditions, the burden and the strain upon your hospital accommodation will be very much less and, therefore, on the grounds that prevention is better than cure, I have no hesitation in taking the share of the Hospitals Sweepstake which I am taking and in using it for the purpose for which we are employing it, to relieve hunger, to relieve distress, to relieve want in our midst.  It is no violation of the precepts of charity and it is no dishonest act to do that. I have said that I do not think that what this Government is doing will injure the Sweepstakes one whit because the big thing will still remain, the big thing that attracts plungers in every part of the world&mdash;the glitter of the prizes and the number of prizes which are beyond comparison with what is done in any other country.  No matter what is said now, I still believe that when it comes to taking a chance our friends across the water will be ready to take that chance if they see the prize is quite worth while.</P>
    <P>Of course the Budget has its defects. Any Budget which imposes taxation must have its defects, but we shall remedy them as far as possible.  In the Committee Stage if any proposition is put up in a reasonable way which will meet the convenience of the public and will not eat into the revenue which we must secure, we are perfectly prepared to consider that in a non-Party spirit.  It used to be a great cant with the Opposition when they were the Government, that they were holding the middle of the road. The Opposition, regarding this Budget, complain because it imposes direct taxation on the rich, and the Labour Party because they think it imposes indirect taxation on other sections.  I deplore that I had to tax <Col N="2323" /> anybody, but what was the alternative? We were faced with an expenditure of £26,794,000 and we had an estimated revenue of £23,310,000. To meet that deficit it was a case of balancing or borrowing.  And because borrowing costs twice as much as balancing, because it mortgages the future, because it eats into the reserves for the social services, I balanced.  Would the Opposition have balanced?  It would have been new if they did.  In the whole ten years that they have been in office they had never balanced their normal Budget.  In a part of his speech here in the House and in speeches elsewhere Deputy Cosgrave made much play of the estimate of £1,395,000 which I made of the deficit. I say and I repeat, an estimate, because it was only an estimate made under extreme pressure.  When I checked the figures I found that a certain <i>ex gratia</i> payment in respect of death duties in a certain estate amounting to £200,000 had been classified as abnormal revenue, and I gave my predecessor credit for that.  And I said: &ldquo;This is normal revenue&rdquo;; and I reduced the estimate of the deficit from £1,395,000 to the actual figure of £1,195,000.  And that figure has gone unchallenged during this debate.  Why did Deputy Cosgrave draw public attention to the £1,395,000 which he knew was an estimate and which he knew could have been nothing else but an estimate?  Because he was afraid to challenge the £1,195,000.  That figure has gone unchallenged by the Opposition because it is unchallengeable.  That was the heritage into which we entered on the 9th March last, with the prospect of an additional deficit of £3,410,000 for the current year.  What would the Opposition have done with that problem before them?  I again come back to the opening of my speech.  I again come back to the kernel of this whole discussion, to the centre of the whole problem, to the root that cannot be overlooked.  What would the Opposition have done if they had a deficit of £3,410,000 staring them in the face?  How would they have met that deficit&mdash;this Government of stucco-business <Col N="2324" /> magnates?  Deputy Cosgrave described the present Government as a Government of non-business men. What was the last Government?  If the decay and the decline of Irish industrial concerns, of Irish agriculture under their Government is any indication of what they were, it is that they were a Government of kill-business men.  There they are sitting in that front bench, cast your eye along it.  There is Deputy McGilligan who sits in the corner.  He has ruined a few businesses.  Did he ever make one or did he ever run one?  There are Deputy Lynch, Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, Deputy Blythe, Deputy Cosgrave.  Except blunders, did any one of them ever make anything?  Except hair, what did any one of them ever grow?  And except to sell two public houses and buy some Guinness shares, what commercial undertaking did any one of them ever undertake?  How would the kill-business men have dealt with this deficit?  They would have increased the income tax and the corporation profits tax, and they would have taxed the banks.  They would have had to do every one of these things in some measure, and then they would have decreased the old age pensions, stopped housing, decreased unemployment reliefs, and in this year when the wells of private charity are drying up they would have allowed starvation to balance their Budget.</P>
    <P>Let the Opposition not prate about economies.  As I said in the beginning, they had ten years to make them. Last October they promised them. When we came into office where were the economies?  That was an admission that so far as they were concerned they were powerless to do anything to relieve the burden upon the people.  The Opposition would have had to tax heavily, and to tax as heavily as we, or else they would have been compelled practically to dispense with the social services.  And in that regard no mere cut would have sufficed.  Even a cut in the old age pensions&mdash;and that it was under consideration is clear&mdash;even a cut in the old age pensions from 10s. to 8s. per week and even the wiping out of the 2s. a week pensioners altogether would <Col N="2325" /> have only brought £500,000 to them. But it would have meant a great deal of hardship and a great deal of want and a great deal of suffering to the great mass of the aged poor of this State.  They could have taxed, they could have cut the social services, but there is one thing that the last Government could not have done, strange as it may appear&mdash;they could not have borrowed.  We heard a great deal about the credit of the last Government.  But I repeat that there is one thing that the last Government could not have done&mdash;it could not have borrowed again to meet its Budgetary deficit.  When we were on the Opposition Benches we used to criticise the Budgetary methods of the last Government. Of course little attention was paid to that criticism outside, but there was a quarter just as concerned as we were with the queer way in which Deputy Blythe and Deputy Cosgrave and the rest of them used to balance their books.  Last year I drew attention in a speech to the fact that certain elements in this State were not satisfied with the Budgetary position.</P>
    <P>Not satisfied with the way the Government was handling the public finances Deputy Cosgrave or President Cosgrave as he then was came out with one of his most unctuous denials. Again I was told that I was injuring the credit of the community.</P>
    <P>I know now and I have evidence here to substantiate it that when a loan of £800,000 was being negotiated in September last, the whole question of the Budgetary position of the Free State was brought into examination and was adversely criticised.  That is why I say that there is one thing Deputy Cosgrave's Government could not have done.  The one thing possibly that was driving them was that their rich friends and their wealthy supporters would not let them increase taxation.  The one thing that was driving them to cut the social services was that they could not borrow any more.  Their credit as a business Government was gone and would disappear.</P>
    <P>We can borrow for sound constructive national purposes because we <Col N="2326" /> have let everybody see that we are prepared to pay our way and to meet our recurring obligations out of revenue.  The fact is that after ten weeks of this Government the National Loan is standing higher to-day than it was when we came into office, and, notwithstanding the criticisms which the Opposition has launched against this Budget, the National Loan has gone up.  That shows that the thinking people in this State are satisfied, with Fianna Fáil in power, that, at least, public finances will be honestly, conservatively and carefully administered, and that there will be no attempt by dishonest book-keeping and by the cooking of figures to hide the truth from the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I suppose Deputy Cosgrave's speech is what is known in American politics as the key speech.  His speech was one long wail for the plutocrat.  The Fianna Fáil Government and I are enemies neither of the rich nor the poor.  All members of the community will receive the most careful attention and consideration according to their necessities.  I should like that we had many more rich in this country provided that we had many fewer poor.  If the rich give wisely, give generously, and encourage enterprise, enthusiasm and talent within the State, there are some things they can do better than the State itself can do.  But in the hour of necessity I shall not hesitate, and the Fianna Fáil Government will not hesitate, to tax the rich so that it may spare the poor. Would Deputy Cosgrave have done that?  Would anybody listening to his speech, or the speech of Deputy McGilligan, or the speech of Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan, believe that they would do it?  Deputy Cosgrave, in his speech, was raucous about income tax, hysterical about surtax, and almost diddering about corporation profits tax.  But he was dumb and silent about the poor.  And there is no man more responsible for the position in which the poor and rich in this community find themselves to-day under this Budget than the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Cosgrave.  Had it not been for him there would have <Col N="2327" /> been a considerable amount of money available in this country at this moment to have balanced our Budget and to have relieved the whole community of the burden of taxation which in the discharge of our public duty we have had to impose upon it.</P>
    <P>We have been twitted by Deputy Blythe that we promised to do everything out of the land annuities.  We did not promise to do everything, but we did undoubtedly promise to do a great deal and we will do a great deal because we are honest men.  If we find ourselves in present circumstances unable to do everything that we expected to be able to do and that we hoped to be able to do when we asked the people to make us responsible for the government of the country&mdash;if we are not able to fulfil those pledges to the letter at this moment, why?  I am sorry Deputy Blythe is not here.  I would like to pay a tribute to him, one which he deserves, a tribute to his sense of comradeship and Party loyalty.  For five years at any rate, Deputy Blythe has borne the odium of having put his hand to the document known as the Ultimate Financial Settlement.  We find now that he was not primarily responsible for the thing at all and that the man who made him a stalking horse, the man who sheltered behind him, the man who talks about pacts, agreements, treaties and honourable obligations, who did sign that document was Deputy Cosgrave, the man who, in his first flight as an international statesman, hied himself across the water and, in some sort of secret huggermugger with his allies, and with his masters there, gave them a pledge of his affection, a love child, which he brought home and buried deeply in the archives of this State, and kept there until Mr. Thomas disinterred its dishonourable bones and held it up as the one claim which Great Britain has to the £3,000,000 which we pay every year into her Exchequer.</P>
    <P>When this issue was being fought on the hustings and in the Dáil we heard nothing about this agreement.  We heard a great deal about the other things but when the cupboard was opened up the British did not rely on <Col N="2328" /> the law of 1920, or on anything which preceded the Treaty; they did not rely on the Treaty, and they did not rely, like the hypocrites opposite, on the Ten Commandments.  They relied on a certain agreement to which Deputy Cosgrave put his hand when he was Minister for Finance for this State in February, 1923.  The sole claim the British ever could advance to take these annuities from us was that document, and was nothing which is on the Statute Book of this House, or on the Statute Book of Great Britain; nothing which is written into the Treaty.  It was something which was written in secret and kept secret by Deputy Cosgrave for almost ten years.  If we are not able to do everything in regard to the land annuities at this moment, I am not despairing that we will not do it, because if certain statesmen act like John Bull in the Canadian china shop, this problem, and this difference, may find a settlement in a speedy and satisfactory way.  If we are not able to do everything that we hoped to do out of the land annuities, again, I repeat, whose fault is that, and why?</P>
    <P>It ill becomes Deputy Blythe, Deputy Cosgrave or Deputy McGilligan to refer to this question.  Deputy Cosgrave is good at telling us what people are saying outside.  He is one of these politicians, one of these gentlemen whose motto is &ldquo;nothing for nothing.&rdquo; I would like to know from Deputy Cosgrave whether it was the Earldom of St. James's or the Dukedom of XX, or maybe a reversion to the Phoenix Park, if that has not been already hypothecated to Deputy Alfy Byrne, that was held out in return for this same agreement?  At any rate, there it was kept secret, and since the question of the land annuities is still in suspense we had no alternative, if we were to balance the Budget and put the finances of this State upon a sound basis, except to provide the money that was required out of taxation.</P>
    <P>I say again that the Budget stands to-day as a Christian Budget, as a humane Budget, as an honest Budget. Deputy Blythe admitted that at this moment, when unemployment is the greatest menace that confronts the <Col N="2329" /> State, this Budget would give employment in many directions.  He did say there was a rise in the cost of living. There may be for the few, but there will be employment and a living for many who, up to now, have only had death by slow starvation.  It may be <Col N="2330" /> some people will be deprived of their luxuries.  It may be some opulent folk will have to curtail their expenditure, but, at any rate, under this, the first Budget introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government, there will be bread for the people.</P>

      <P>I formally move amendment 1: At the end of the section to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;This Act shall continue <Col N="2333" /> in force until the 31st day of March, 1934, and shall then expire.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move as an amendment to that amendment: To delete the figures &ldquo;1934&rdquo; and substitute therefor the figures &ldquo;1933.&rdquo;  The members of this group are as anxious as the members of any other group or party in this House to assist the dairying industry to maintain production, and by any and every means possible to maintain our position in the export market. We believe, however, that every other channel available should be carefully investigated before butter consumers are called upon to pay the charge which, as a result of the passing of this measure, they will have to pay in order to find the necessary money.  It is quite true, I readily admit, that almost everybody has been taxed by the Minister for Finance in his Budget which we have been just discussing.</P>
      <P>If I had been taken into the confidence of the Minister for Finance before he submitted his Budget proposals to the House I would certainly have run the risk of advising him to find the necessary money by further taxation on luxuries and amusements before calling upon the poorest section of the community to pay the increased prices they will have to pay for butter as a result of the proposals contained in this Bill.  I do not see why people with dependents and having family responsibilities should not pay for the food that is to be consumed before patronising picture houses, and especially the highly-priced seats.  I am certain there are many other channels whereby this money could be found without imposing the burdens contained in this Bill on the poorest of the poor.  In my opinion, one of the results of this Bill will be to drive many people who are now in a position to eat butter to the consumption of margarine, thereby reducing the consumption of butter in the home market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment is put forward for the purpose of limiting the life of this Bill for the shortest possible period. I dare say that nobody in this House or even in the country is in a position <Col N="2334" /> to prophesy what the exact financial position of this State will be twelve months hence.  I think it is true to say that.  But if the prophecies made by the Minister for Finance can be relied upon there should be, and I am sure will be, some channel other than that outlined in this Bill in which to find this money at the end of twelve months.  The Minister for Finance, in his reply this evening, stated quite definitely that he believed, and he has more information than the ordinary Deputy, that the Government would be able to prove their case as regards the claim already made to withhold the land annuities.  I hope the Government will be able to prove their case and that they will succeed in retaining the money in this country.  If they do, I submit that there is no better source from which to find the money required for the financing of this Bill than by setting aside some of the money thus saved for the purpose of subsidising the dairying industry. The land annuities come from the farming community, and a considerable percentage of the annuities is being found by people engaged in the dairying industry to-day, and if the dairying industry is in the same perilous position twelve months hence, in which we all admit it is to-day, the Government could justifiably come to the House and say: &ldquo;We must set aside whatever money is necessary to give further assistance to the dairying industry from the money we succeed in retaining in the form of the land annuities.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>But I am glad to share with the Minister for Finance the hope <Col N="2335" /> he expressed this evening, that money will be available twelve months hence. I do not believe that Deputies could justify any raising of money by taxation, or by the method proposed in this Bill, to help an industry which will not organise itself on proper lines.</P>
      <P>It has been admitted&mdash;there may be a few exceptions in the House&mdash;that the reduction in the quantity of butter exported to our only market, is mainly due to keen competition in the British market from Denmark, New Zealand and Australia, and the 20 per cent. reduction that has taken place in our exports has been more than captured by these countries, by reason of the method of organisation through which they have put that butter on the British market.  The farmers of Denmark, Australia and New Zealand are highly organised for buying and selling on cooperative lines, and the Deputy who believes that individual creameries in this State can stand up against the organised competition in the British market from Denmark, Australia and New Zealand, should be placed in a padded cell in Grangegorman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The individual seller in the British market to-day is completely out of court, and unless the Minister, either by his eloquence, or whatever other methods he may adopt, takes action within the coming twelve months, to persuade or, if necessary, coerce the creameries of this country into setting up a marketing organisation, this Bill is not going to achieve the purpose for which it was intended.  It will cost this State a certain number of hundreds of thousands of pounds, which the butter consumers will have to pay, and I prophesy that, without that marketing machine, the creameries, at the end of twelve months, will be in a worse position than they are to-day.  Why, therefore, should not the Minister be given reasonable time&mdash;and I submit that twelve months is a reasonable period in present circumstances and with the international situation as we know it to-day&mdash;and during that twelve months, persuade or convince or coerce, if necessary, the people engaged in the dairying industry to organise their business on proper lines, and if they <Col N="2336" /> fail to do so, and he refuses to coerce them, if necessary we should be allowed to review the whole position at the end of twelve months.</P>
    <P>Our trade with Great Britain is going to depend very largely on the persuasive influence of, perhaps, the Minister for Agriculture, who, with his colleagues, will represent this State at the Economic Conference at Ottawa.  I would like to have, at the end of a twelve months' period, an opportunity of seeing how far the Minister and his colleagues will be responsible for improving our position in the British market, or how far they will have responsibility for failing to improve or even maintain our position.  I think that this House, for the reasons I have given, is making a fair request to the Minister in asking that the life of the Bill be limited to one year, and that at the end of that year&mdash;an eventful year, I am sure, in the history of this State&mdash;the people's representatives in this House be given an opportunity of investigating what other means may be adopted, for the purpose of securing the money necessary to finance the dairying industry, and to put it on a firm financial foundation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quarrelling at all with Deputy Davin, as to the duration of this measure, but I think if we are accepting it at all, it should get a chance.  It is useless to waste the time of the House in discussing the measure, unless it gets a reasonable chance.  I think that Deputy Davin will admit, as a business proposition, that here is a new scheme applied to the creamery industry, for the purpose of relieving it, in its hour of stress, and surely no business man will suggest that it is a business proposition that, at the end of six months, we should ask whether or not that scheme is a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>From now until the end of the year means six levy months. At the end of November next the levy <Col N="2337" /> period expires for the current year. That is provided for in the Bill and there in no use in discussing it.  The creameries are asked to adopt a new scheme which we all hope will be of material benefit to them, and we are asked to confine it to a period of substantially six months, that is as far as the levy is concerned.  That is not a fair chance for the scheme or for the creameries.  This scheme is a new one and the creamery managers do not know how it will work.  They will have to get into it.  Then we should give them another year.  The scheme will get into working operation during this year, and when they begin the next levy year, then they start with a clean sheet to test the scheme for what it is worth.  I would say that at the end of that time it should have got an ample and reasonable opportunity to test whether or not it would succeed.  I am not tied to anything, but if this House is adopting this scheme, and putting a tax on the public in order to benefit the creameries, I say it should have, at least, a fair chance, or do not do it at all.  With regard to extending it longer than 1934, it might be injurious both to the creameries and to the public.  I am not saying it will happen, but there is a possibility, and perhaps a probability, that this scheme will be injurious to the creameries and that they will be very glad to get clear of it.  I think the House and the Minister should accept as a reasonable and practicable proposition that of giving this Bill two years to test its efficiency.  I think that would be fair and reasonable both to the public and to the creameries, if the Bill is to be accepted at all.  I move my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House agrees that this is a temporary measure to deal with an unprecedented and specific condition of affairs.  We are now dealing with two amendments, as to whether the Bill is to be in operation for one or two years.  I think the Minister himself will realise that it is a temporary measure, and perhaps he will indicate what he thinks would be a fair time to give it a trial, so <Col N="2338" /> that we might be able to come to an agreement and get on to the consideration of the more material parts of the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is, we hope, a very temporary measure.  As the Bill is arranged, and as far as our intention goes, if the export price of butter were to reach 123/- the provisions of the Bill would automatically cease.  We are hoping that that time will come within a few years, because we do believe that some of our foreign competitors must be finding it just as hard to compete as we are.  I might mention that the title of the Bill says it is a price stabilisation Bill.  I think it would leave very little hope for the dairy farmer if we were to announce that the Bill is only to operate for one year. We admit in the Bill that the dairy farmer is not even getting the cost of production so far as we can help him by the Bill.  We are only holding out a little hope to him that we will meet his losses, as it were, for one or two years until prices improve, in order that he may remain in production until the export price goes up again and he can take advantage of it.  If we were to say that the Bill would only operate for one or two years I believe that the sort of despair that has got hold of the dairy farmers for the last three years, in connection with butter prices, would take effect, and that they would go out of dairying altogether, and we would lose the whole object of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that we are only, under the Bill, giving the cost of production to the farmer.  That would be quite evident to anybody who has noticed the price of butter in Dublin to-day.  We hoped when bringing in the Bill that we could keep the retail price of butter at 1/5 per lb. That would mean about 142/- per cwt. to the creameries.  Since that time, the retail price has gone down to 1/3 in the city of Dublin, which means that the creameries are only getting 122/- or so, per cwt. for butter.  If you take the average between that and the export price, and deduct the twopence for the levy, you will find that the price they are getting now for butter is practically nothing more than they <Col N="2339" /> were getting last year.  Deputies from creamery districts have stated that if we were to have another year like last year we could not remain in the industry.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that if we do not give an undertaking to the dairy farmers that we shall continue the Bill for a reasonable period anyway, I am afraid that they will not remain in the industry, and it would be just as well to drop the Bill altogether. I do not see any use in asking the consumer to come to the help of the dairy farmer for the sake of this year. Unless it was going to help us to remain in the dairying industry until the good times come again, I could not see any use for the Bill.  Therefore, we should give it a reasonable time.  I also think that if we were to put the Bill through for one year and spend a considerable time upon it, and probably spend a good deal of time upon it next year again, it would be hardly fair to the Dáil to ask for so much time.  I think that the matter of putting some limit to it might be considered, but that one or two years would be unfair, I would be prepared to consider putting a limit of, say, five years, and of bringing in an amendment to that effect on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>

      <P>I rather favour the idea suggested by Deputy McMenamin. The Minister in the Bill, after the words &ldquo;in the year 1933,&rdquo; has the following, &ldquo;and every succeeding year.&rdquo;  While there is a good deal in what Deputy Davin suggests in his amendment, I feel that if we are to commit ourselves to the Bill at all the dairying industry should get a chance, as the Minister suggests.  As representing a very important community, the City of Cork, I feel it is going to be a tremendous burden on the poor people, a very big burden indeed.  I am at considerable loss, however, to <Col N="2340" /> understand what construction the Minister puts on sub-sections (2) and (3).</P>

      <P>I shall not deal with that; I shall hark back to Deputy Davin's amendment and to the suggestion made by Deputy McMenamin, which is, if you like, a compromise. Deputy McMenamin suggested the year 1934.  I think that is a reasonable amendment which the Minister might accept.  With regard to the amendment in Deputy Davin's name, I think if the Bill is to be adopted at all one year is too short.  I think there would be no opportunity of a try-out so far as the dairy farmers are concerned if Deputy Davin's amendment were accepted.  I favour the amendment of Deputy McMenamin if the Minister will accept it, although I am against the principle underlying this Bill and the machinery contained in it. I feel if it is to be operative at all the more chastisement our people get the better for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister might be glad himself later on to have a relatively short period of duration fixed for the Bill.  It could be renewed comparatively easily if it were working satisfactorily.  A simple amendment to Section 1 could alter the date.  I would not like to make the first period so short as that suggested by Deputy Davin, but if the Minister accepts the amendment of Deputy McMenamin, even if he added one year to it, I <Col N="2341" /> think that would give a period after which it might reasonably be expected that the matter would be specially brought before the Dáil again.  I would not be so keen on having a Bill like this renewed in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, which comes in at the end of the Session, and cannot be discussed at any length, but I think that after a period of two or three years from now the Bill might very well be brought before the Dáil and the whole policy of the duty during the period reconsidered.  Before that time so many things might have developed under the Bill that the Minister himself might be very glad to have the chance of letting it drop without having to repeal it.</P>

Although I supported the Second Reading of this Bill on the chance that it may be an incentive to keep us in production I must say I am in doubt about it.  One point made by Deputy Davin in moving his amendment was when he said the Bill would hit the poorest of the poor. If a year was put in as an amendment we might all be very glad because at the end of twelve months I think we will be all very poor and we may be very glad to have a reconsideration of the situation at the end of that time.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy McMenamin's amendment for this reason that there would be no possibility of the Bill getting a fair chance if it was to terminate in 1933.  It must be taken into consideration that we will be in competition with countries like Australia in their winter exportation. That has got to be remembered, and I think that unless at any rate you give the period mentioned in Deputy McMenamin's amendment the Bill would have no possible chance of success. If we are to have the Bill let us try to find out what its merits are like. It will be very much in the nature of an experiment, and if people are to be taxed let us try and see what can be got out of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with Deputy Davin for the simple reason that I am fundamentally opposed to this tax on butter, for many reasons, the principal one being that it is about time to face up to the facts. If the farmers of this country cannot hold their own in an industry in the production of which nature has endowed us with abundance of raw material, in the way of green grass, then I cannot see, even with the widest stretch of imagination, how this country is going to succeed in any industry. Again I agree with Deputy Davin that this Bill will not be any advantage to the farmers engaged in the industry.  In fact I go so far as to say that it might be better for this country if all the creameries were blown up altogether.  I do not know that they have been much use so far as the trade of the country is concerned. And again I am in favour of Deputy Davin's amendment for the reason that this Bill savours of class legislation.  It is only going to be of advantage, if it is an advantage at all, to about ten counties.  The Free State is composed of twenty-six counties.  The other counties have suffered much in the past six or seven years owing to the depression in the farming industry and have received very little consideration from the legislation of the past six, seven or eight years.</P>
      <P>Take the County Louth that I represent. The farmers there have suffered very much from bad prices for barley, oats, potatoes and other agricultural products and the people of that county and especially the poor in the towns and villages situated in the county are to be asked to pay 4d. a lb. more for their butter.  Another thing I would like to ask the Minister is this.  How does it come about that we are the only people who did not increase our butter exports to Great Britain during the past year or two?</P>

For that reason I think my question is very relevant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I asked why it is that our exports of butter to the British market have fallen off, have decreased instead of showing any increase.  Our exports have shown a very notable decrease when we compare them with the exports of Denmark to the British market.  For these reasons I would like to support Deputy Davin's amendment to limit the Bill to one year, because I am convinced now as I was convinced when the tariff was put on by the late Government that no improvement will be shown in that industry. After all the proof of the pudding is in the eating. There is no use in imposing an unnecessary burden on the people of the country unless some good results can be shown from it.</P>

      <P>This Bill is really a desperate remedy for dealing with a desperate situation.  It does not matter whether it is to continue in operation for two years or for five years.  I agree with the Minister that long before two years have passed the price of butter will go to 123/- per cwt. or otherwise farmers will have gone out of dairying.  I see no great harm in the Minister accepting Deputy McMenamin's amendment.  In order to end the debate might I suggest that the Minister would make the date 1933?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To accept the amendment would entail consequential amendments <Col N="2344" /> with regard to the terms of the Schedule.  I would undertake to bring in an amendment on the Report Stage and it would probably be to make it operative for three years.  There will be nothing to prevent Deputies Davin or McMenamin putting down their amendments again.  I very much dislike the suggestion that the Act could be brought in under the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill.  Deputy Blythe's suggestion that we should have an opportunity of discussing the whole measure within three years is a good one.  If the price goes down at the rate it is going down now I think there will be no bounty on exports because there will be no exports.  Deputy Coburn asked why had exports gone down during the last few years.  The reason is because prices were so bad. We are now getting practically the same price as last year.  If it goes down further our exports will decline and there will be no such thing as a bounty in question.  If the price takes a turn for the better the Bill will not be operative when it reaches 123/-.  In any case I think it will be necessary to revise the Bill after three years.  I will undertake to bring in an amendment on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The matters raised by Deputy Davin will be referred to later on.  One is in connection with central marketing.  It is not feasible to compel central marketing under this Bill.  It cannot be done.  We may create a spirit that will lead to central marketing, but that is all we can hope for.  I do not like to go into the question now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise the necessity, and I would like to see it done, but I do not think it is possible in present circumstances. I hope that with this Bill we may create the spirit of co-operation which would be necessary to get central marketing going.  Having gone that far, we might by other means do something for central marketing. Another matter raised by Deputy Davin was the suggestion that next year we might be in a position to put a certain amount of money into the fund, that is, to subsidise it out of the Central Fund instead of from the consumers' pocket.  If that is possible next year it can be done under the Bill as it stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister why such a divergence of opinion exists amongst the managers as to how the business should be conducted? We are to subsidise an industry in which those interested do not seem to know their own minds?  They appear to be divided amongst themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose creamery managers are individuals who think that they can do their own business better than by central marketing. Some of them gave convincing proof that they had done so.  That, generally speaking, is hard to believe, but individually they had a very good case to make for their own marketing as opposed to central marketing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hassett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the suggestion of the Minister that this Bill should get a trial for three years.  I think there is no use in introducing the Bill unless there is the guarantee that the producers will get at least the cost of production to enable them to continue in dairying.  I got a letter from a creamery manager in my constituency in County Tipperary, saying that the balance sheet for the last year showed that there was a shortage of 64,000 gallons of milk as compared with the previous year's supply.  If that goes on for another year there will be no production of butter, and the consumer will have to go to New Zealand or to Australia for his supplies.  Farmers <Col N="2346" /> will be blamed much more than they are now.  In giving this little subsidy it should be remembered that to a great extent it will be paid by the farmers, because they are 75 per cent. of the community, and they will have to pay 2d per lb. for any butter used in their own homes.  Deputy Coburn sneered at farmers because they were not able to produce butter without a subsidy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephHassett" hpid="Mr. Hassett Mr. Hassett">

      <P>We would do so if there were no tariffs in this country&mdash;if we could buy everything in the cheapest possible market and had not to pay a tax of 33? per cent. on boots, 33? on machinery and other things used on the farm and in the home.  Tariffs have been put on many things in order to help manufacturers. If farmers are to get a little subsidy now in the shape of a bounty, at least three-fourths of which will be paid by themselves no one has any reason to grumble.  The Minister should give this Bill a trial for three years.  Otherwise we will not encourage farmers to stop getting rid of their cows.  We will not encourage them to produce more butter unless they get the reasonable cost of production or something near it.</P>

      <P>In introducing this Bill, I think the Minister helped to save one of our greatest industries by making the position of the farmer more economic.  Only that this Bill was introduced there would soon be no dairying in the Free State.  The Bill will not only solve the present difficulty but will give hope to the farmers when they see that there is a Government here that is willing to foster the industry.  I think there should be no time limit for the Bill.  I hope that the trouble in the industry will right itself and that the price of butter will become such that it will be economic for the farmer to produce it.  If the dairying industry goes down the whole machinery of this State will go down. I hope the present policy of the Government will be the policy of any Government in the future, that they <Col N="2347" /> will take steps to see that the main industry of the country will not go down and that it will be made economic for farmers to carry on.</P>

      <P>I think Deputies are not treating the House or the Minister fairly in asking for the imposition of a time limit in connection with this Bill, having regard to the existing position of the farming industry, and particularly of that branch of it which deals with dairying.  Those engaged in the dairying industry are asking only for the same consideration for which industrialists are asking&mdash;that is that they get the cost of production.  Every member of the House has admitted that at a price of 1/5 per lb. the butter producer would not be getting the cost of production. If it is good national policy that we should patriotically support our own products, that we, farmers, should buy boots produced in our own factories, would it be fair for the farmers to ask that they get their boots below the cost of production?  I am quite sure that the Minister is as anxious to come back to the House and report as any Deputy is.  He is anxious to take the House into his confidence and to treat it fairly.  This talk of being hard on the poor is not fair because agricultural labourers are dependent on the farmer for employment. This Bill represents only a small share of compensation to the farmer but it has given him heart. To confine it to a year or two years would undo all the good that has been done by the introduction of the Bill.  As my colleague on my left has said, a restriction of that kind would compel farmers to consider whether or not they would continue in the industry and that would be bad for the industry.</P>

      <P>As recently as December, 1930, a very competent Committee investigated the position of the marketing of Irish butter.  They drew attention to the fact that the present tendencies with regard to the butter industry generally and the very well-organised competition which that industry had to meet in the export market were such that it appeared vital <Col N="2348" /> to the prosperity of the creamery industry that some sort of concerted action by the producers should be undertaken.  That was, no doubt, for the purpose of reducing overhead costs and, to some extent, securing a better price in the market.  The necessity for that course is perhaps more pressing to-day than it was in 1930.</P>

      <P>Under powers given in this Bill, there may come a time when the assistance which is now being required from the ordinary consumer of butter may be contributed by the taxpayer.  At present, there is necessity for co-operation.  As recently as March of this year, the Irish creamery managers were putting forward a scheme for fixing the home and export prices and were making some attempt at the kind of organisation suggested in the report I have quoted.  We are now having this scheme opened up, a scheme which should be worked by the industry itself. In Australia, where such a scheme is in operation, it is worked by the industry without State assistance. If the industry is to organise itself for the purpose of cutting down overhead costs and improving marketing arrangements, the Minister should consider whether the period for the operation of the Bill and the hope that the taxpayer will ultimately step in to support the industry do not constitute too great an inducement to the creamery managers, who have so much difficulty in adopting a scheme, to sit back in their armchairs and leave the industry to jog along in the unorganised way in which it is jogging along at present.  I think every section of the House is agreed that a proper, co-operative scheme of marketing on the creamery side is most desirable and that such provisions as a Bill of this kind would contain should direct the minds of the organisers of the creamery industry to the lines on which organisation should <Col N="2349" /> proceed.  To give those interested under this Bill a long period or to give them the prospect of support from the ordinary taxpayer may not conduce to what is desired by all sections and the Minister should consider whether the shorter period mentioned in Deputy McMenamin's amendment would not be more useful.</P>

      <P>I want to make it quite clear that the members of the Labour Party have always advocated here the fixing of minimum prices for agricultural products.  I hope the House will have the good sense some time to fix such a price as will give farmers the cost of production.  I would not advocate a decent rate of wages for other workers and at the same time disregard the fact that the farmer should not get an adequate return as well as the man who works in the factory.  The time-limit proposal was put forward for the purpose of finding out whether, at the end of what I believe will be an eventful year, the necessary money could not be found from some other source.  If we are to have available a sum of £3,000,000, why should we not give portion of that money back to the people from whom we have got it instead of making the small section of butter consumers responsible for the entire imports?  I am sorry some of the Deputies who have spoken shirked the real issue&mdash;that the industry is not properly organised for marketing purposes.  I have heard Deputy Gorey, even when his own Government were putting on tariffs, weep and tell the House that these tariffs were being put on for the purpose of propping up inefficiency.  Why has the Deputy remained silent on this question affecting his own constituency? Surely he has some view on this proposal.</P>

      <P>The question is whether a year or two or three years is a reasonable period in which to review the whole position. Believing that the Minister has certain doubts as to the whole scheme contained in the Bill, I would appeal to him&mdash;for the first time I have made an appeal to him as Minister for Agriculture&mdash;to let the experimental period be limited to two years, making that appeal on the grounds that at the end of the two years' period we should review the circumstances in which the money has to be found, and if he is Minister at the end of that period I will give him whatever assistance is necessary to enable him through some other channel to find whatever money is necessary to assist an industry that is so vital to the agricultural community.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;butter trader&rdquo; means a person who carries on for trade or gain, whether alone or in <Col N="2352" /> conjunction with any other business, the business of selling butter wholesale;</P>
    <P>the expressions &ldquo;the creamery butter account,&rdquo;&ldquo;the factory butter account&rdquo; and &ldquo;the miscellaneous butter account&rdquo; respectively mean the several accounts required by this Act to be kept by the Minister under those respective names;</P>
    <P>(2) Each of the following months shall be a levy month for the purposes of this Act, that is to say, the months of June, July, August, September, October, and November in the year 1932, and the months of April, May, June, July, August, September, October, and November in the year 1933 and every succeeding year.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 3, line 48, to delete the word &ldquo;wholesale.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We feel that we cannot deal with certain classes of people in the butter trade under the word &ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; there in the definition.  There are for instance butter factories that act as agents for retail shops.  There are also retailers with multiple shops which sell a considerable amount of farmers' butter.  There may be other instances.  If we leave out the word &ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; we shall have more freedom in dealing with certain classes like that.</P>

There are also retailers with multiple shops who buy farmers' butter direct and are in rather a big way in that business. Under the definition section as it stands we could not deal with this particular class.  We want freedom to deal with them if necessary and by leaving out the word &ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; we shall have more freedom to deal with this particular class.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 4, to delete lines 5 to 8 and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;the expression &lsquo;butter account&rsquo; shall mean the account required by this Act to be kept by the Minister under that name.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In moving this amendment I desire to point out that it is important that the twopence levy shall be paid on all classes of butter and it is essential to preserve the factory until the situation under the Bill is clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of Deputy Desmond's amendment would be to make one common pool which would appear to be unfair to the creameries because the creameries have a bigger proportion of home consumption and therefore would derive more benefit out of the pool than the factories would out of the pool allotted to the factories, if the two were kept separate.  I think it is only fair to put the two of them on a separate basis.  Of course there will be a tendency as the creamery will get more out of the pool by way of bounty than the factory will get, for the factory to sell more at home and things will even out automatically. I think they should be allowed to come nearer to each other automatically and keep a separate pool.  I think the point Deputy Desmond tries to make is that if there was a common pool there would be a levy of twopence and a bounty of about 3½d.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister think that, as the present arrangement stands, the factories would be probably obliged to stop working, that the result of the system as set out in the Bill will be, if no amendment is accepted, that gradually farm butter will be withdrawn from the factories and that they will find difficulty in getting supplies?  Whatever one may think about the factory system it has served the industry in one way and it is in great danger of coming to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to make little of what the factories have done <Col N="2354" /> for the industry, but I do not see that the factories can in any way close down.  There is a surplus of the farmers' butter during certain months of the summer, there is more than is required for the ordinary needs of the consumers, and this surplus of the farmers' butter must go to the factories.  It cannot go anywhere else. The factories certainly will not close down.  It may be that the factories will not be able to give the price in proportion to the creameries' price that they are giving at present, but they will not go down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister does not suggest that the butter factories will carry on if they have to pay a levy of 2d. and only get back 2½d.  Are they asked as a commercial proposition to go to all the trouble that is involved and to undergo the clerical expenses for the sake of one halfpenny per lb.?  If this policy is adopted there is nothing for the butter factories to do except to go out of business, thereby destroying whatever market there is for farm butter.  The Minister may have in mind that it is quite a good thing to destroy the market for farm butter, home-made butter, but this House cannot overlook the fact that there is a huge demand in Ireland for butter made at home in the farmhouse, and that it would be a disastrous thing if the butter factories had to close down and that there should be no outlet for this butter.  It is a serious thing.  I think first of all that we should get a common pool, and secondly, that if they have to pay a levy of 2d. they should get a bounty of 2d. also.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this is an issue which has to be decided at this particular point.  The factory people make out that what they really will be getting back in addition to their 2d. levy will be nearer to one-third of a penny than to one halfpenny, and under amendment No. 22 the position in which the farmers' butter will be, if it comes on for sale at all, is that it will run the gauntlet of the levy.  There <Col N="2355" /> seems to be a strong case for one pool, particularly in view of the fact that it will make such a small difference in the position of the bounty.  So that the question of making one pool ought, I think, be faced here and not on some other amendment, because I think a very strong case could be made for taking out the factory if there is to be a separate pool.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kiersey has suggested that the amendment might be taken on another section.  But it is allowed here for the reason that it is rather revolutionary.

      <P>I should like to reply to Deputy McMenamin's statement as to what is to become of the farmers' butter if the merchants go out.  Surely if the butter is there somebody will buy it.  There will be merchants there to buy it.  Surely if the butter is worth, say, 8½d a lb. at the present time, if the merchants go out of business, you will have a number of enterprising men coming forward and offering 4d or 5d a lb. for it.  We have heard a number of complaints about hitting the poor people.  If they cannot do anything else they can supply the poor people with butter at 4d or 5d a lb., instead of at 1/5, and the poor people will be getting butter at a price at which they never got it before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a monstrous proposition to say that citizens will have to go over the country hawking butter for 4d or 5d a lb.  This is not business, and this House should not be a party to it.  The Minister is quite as much a farmer as I am, and perhaps he may be more so.  He must know that the farmers' butter is not exported. It is made up in lumps in the farmhouses, and then it is taken to the grocer's shop in the village, and then it is passed on to the butter factor who melts it down; it is washed and dressed, and it is standardised to one colour, and it is all of one quality.  The disposal of the surplus home made <Col N="2356" /> butter is a very important thing, and it is no way in which to treat the subject to suggest that the farmers' wives and daughters are to go about the country hawking this butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke in that way because of the statement that the Deputy made that the butter factories would have to close down.  It is the price of the creamery butter which regulates the price of the factory butter, and if we are going to put up the price of the creamery butter the price of the factory butter will also go up.  The price of the factory butter in the home market will increase.  Deputy McMenamin makes the point that it would not be worth while to pay 2d in order to get 2½d. on account of the clerical expenses.  There will be very little clerical expense.  The amount of extra work under this Bill will not amount to one halfpenny a cwt., not to speak of a halfpenny a lb.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It would look as if what the Minister envisages would produce the same result in a different way. The Minister presumably feels that if they only get one halfpenny, the factory butter will be put on the home market, and will take the place of the creamery butter, and that consequently there will be proportionately more creamery butter exported, and less consumed at home.  It will produce much the same result in another way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiersey</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see why the farmer making his own butter at home and selling it to the factor is not placed in the same position as the man supplying the creamery.  There are several parts of the country where they have not creameries or separating stations, and the farmers in these districts have to depend on the factories.  It has been pointed out by some other Deputies that the factories will take 2d. a lb. off the farmers; that <Col N="2357" /> they will pay the farmers 2d. a lb. less than the value of the butter, and only 2½d. is to be returned.  How can the factor know until the end of the month how much he will have to pay back to his customers?  If the factor's accounts are not made up until the end of the month I should like to know from the Minister how he can repay his customer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The creamery pays 2d. on production, the factory does the same thing, that is, when the butter comes into the factory we levy 2d. It is not payable until about the 17th of the following month.  But they pay on the amount of butter that goes into the factory.  They pay 2d. and they get 2½d. back when they export it. So there is no reason why they should deduct anything from the farmers.  If they take 2d. from the farmer they should also go back to the farmer and give him the 2½d. afterwards.</P>

      <P>I support a common pool.  There is as much human nature amongst the farmers as any other section of the community, and undoubtedly the home dairy farmer takes this Bill as legislating against himself. A levy of 2d. per lb. is placed upon him and he gets practically nothing back.  It is bolstering up the creamery industry very much and the dairy farmer is receiving no benefit.  I can say <Col N="2358" /> from what I gathered from those farmers whom I have consulted that there is a note of hostility to the Bill. I have no hesitation in saying that the last stage will be worse than the first.  These men will be decidedly in opposition to any Bill of the kind now introduced, because it is a Bill that will do them no real good in the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand on what principle the Minister differentiates against the home-made butter and the manufactured butter.  So far as I can see, from the point of view of the community the home-made butter is very much more valuable than the butter produced in the creameries.  The man who makes his own butter at home is more valuable than the man with the milk-cart.  The man who makes his butter at home keeps in his home the buttermilk and he usually gives his children plenty of butter and milk.  It is proverbial, as many will tell you, that in the dairying part of the country where the milk is sent to the creameries many of the children are under-fed because they do not get plenty of milk whereas in those districts where the butter is made in the homesteads one will find the children well-fed. There is plenty of good food for the children and it costs little or nothing at all to the farmer.</P>
      <P>Why the Minister should leave these people under the impression that the sooner he can get them out of the home butter-making the better pleased he will be, is to me a matter for surprise. I do not understand his action in the matter and I do not see what other construction you can put upon the section which provides that the butter producers shall pay a levy of 2d. and that the creamery man will get 4d. back while the man making the home-made butter will only get 2?d. or 2¼d. per pound.  I have not heard anything from the Minister as to why it is he makes the differentiation. Is it because this factory butter acts unfavourably upon the reputation of the Irish butter trade?  What is the reason?  Whatever it is, I think the result will be to alienate the producers of home-made butter.</P>

      <P>I see the possibility of danger if the Deputies accept this amendment; it might react against the creameries without in any way improving the position of the factory butter.  I do not see how it can be any great improvement to their position.  I agree that the people who produce factory butter must get their profits just as those making creamery butter must get their profits.  There is no injustice to the people if they pay a levy of 2d. per lb. and get back 2½d.  As regards the question raised about the factories docking the home-made butter, there is no justification for the suggestion.  They are providing a pool for getting back 2½d. if they pay 2d. into the pool.  After all, I do not see how their position is in the least worsened by the Bill.  On the contrary it is a good deal advanced. I do not see any great benefit in the amendment, and I do not think it will improve matters much for the factory butter people, while it might harm the production of creamery butter.  It might be an incentive to people to turn more to the making of home butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with this amendment.  I think what was most necessary in this country was that the people should turn to the manufacture of creamery butter.  I think that it was the credit gained by the creamery butter that saved the name of Irish butter in the world markets. The creameries were erected at considerable expense and on the whole they cost the country in one way or another a considerable amount of money.  The maker of the home-made butter does not go to much expense at all.  I believe that the producer of the home-made article will gain as much as the creameries.  If the Government adopted the policy suggested in the amendment it would be an incentive to people who supply creameries with milk to make their butter at home.  That would be a step in the wrong direction for it is these creameries that at considerable expense and trouble have raised the credit of the Irish butter and it is they who are keeping it in the forefront of the <Col N="2360" /> world's markets.  For this reason, they are entitled to the best support we can give them.</P>

      <P>None of the previous speakers has touched on one aspect of this question.  That is in connection with the home-made butter.  Deputies will realise that there will be no levy on butter used in a particular farmhouse where it is made, while the butter worked in the factory or the creamery has to pay a levy of 2d. Nothing has to be paid on what is consumed in the farmer's house.  There is no law to prevent the farmer from selling some of his butter to his neighbours whereas the creameries cannot do any such thing.  They have to deduct 2d. for every lb. manufactured in that creamery and pay it to the pool.  I think the producer of home butter has more advantages under the Bill than those who supply milk to the creameries have.</P>

      <P>I have been asked by Deputy O'Leary, who is unavoidably absent, to move amendments 4 and 5 <Col N="2362" /> standing in his name.  The effect of the amendments is to add to the Schedule all creameries situated in the Gaeltacht.  In his speech on the Second Reading the Minister gave a general reason and it might be called the principal reason for differentiating as between creameries in the amount of the levy that was to be imposed on them.  The general reason was this: &ldquo;that there are certain creameries which are not in a position to withstand the ordinary competition.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That applies to all the creameries in the Gaeltacht.  The three principal reasons were: first that &ldquo;They do fulfil certain conditions, such as that the premises were erected and equipped during recent years when the cost of construction and equipment was abnormally high, and they had not a sufficient time, while good prices ruled, to pay off some of that large debt which was contracted in the building and equipment.&rdquo;  And then, he goes on and says, &ldquo;All those creameries are also in districts where the competition from home butter making is very marked and the benefits to be derived by farmers making their own butter under this Bill would have a serious effect on those creameries if we compelled them to pay a 2d. levy and get a 4d. bounty, thereby giving them a net 2d. per pound, whereas farmers making their own butter in the district might have a greater advantage in competition with them.&rdquo;  I say that the latter reason applies very forcibly to all creameries operating in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other reason also applies to them.  The third reason was &ldquo;they are not in competition with other creameries.  They are isolated creameries, every one of them.&rdquo;  That also applies to the creameries operating in the Gaeltacht.  They fulfil the general reasons without any doubt but that can be said of all the creameries no matter where they are placed.  &ldquo;They are not in a position to withstand the ordinary competition.&rdquo;  That can be said about the creameries operating in the Gaeltacht.  Two of the reasons which the Minister gave certainly apply to these creameries affected by these amendments.  I agree that this <Col N="2363" /> would add enormously to the Schedule and that it would have a serious effect on the finance of the Bill as a whole, but I think it is a matter at any rate well worthy of consideration that the creameries operating in the Gaeltacht should be, for the purposes of the Bill, given the benefits that those included in the Schedule get, that is instead of a 2d. levy they have a lesser levy of ½d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendments.  I think that the Gaeltacht creameries deserve special consideration.  Invariably they have small supplies and their overhead expenses are the same as those of the creameries in Limerick, Tipperary and particularly the Golden Vale.  Already in the matter of housing and other matters the Gaeltacht has been favourably considered and I think in this matter too the Minister should agree to give them some little concession.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the amendments.  I have here a balance sheet of one of the creameries situated in the Gaeltacht in my constituency. Last year they manufactured only 277 cwts. of butter, and the cost of production was 67/- per cwt. There was a total loss on the year's trading of £251 10s. 4d.  There is one reason why this amendment should be adopted, and that is the elimination of the scrub bull.  In a prosperous area there is usually a large number of farmers who are strong financially. They can go to the Dublin Show, the Royal Agricultural Show at Balmoral, Belfast, or to Scotland, and there purchase bulls approved by the Department. In various parts of Donegal the farmers are not in a position to do that. As a result there has been a great dearth of milk.  Hundreds of cows have gone off breeding and, in consequence the creameries in the County, particularly the one I have referred to, have been hard hit.  I do not know what creameries Deputy Lynch has in mind when he speaks of the Gaeltacht in the West.  The creamery I have mentioned is the only one situated in the Gaeltacht in Donegal.  I will ask the Minister to adopt the amendments.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to the amendments for the reason that I have in mind several creameries in my constituency suffering from lack of funds. One might be tempted to include them in the Schedule if one did not realise what would then happen.  If I were to include in the Schedule all the creameries I have in mind that are deserving of consideration, it would be a very lengthy Schedule indeed.  Numbers of creameries were purchased under a recent Act, and the suppliers are at present paying big sums for them.  If anybody needs relief, they do.  As a matter of fact, I am opposed to the Schedule with the creameries already mentioned there.  I am afraid that the creameries set out in the Schedule will have an advantage that will be detrimental to the regular creamery business.  They will probably be in a position to under-sell the ordinary creameries in the home market; they will tend to keep down prices.  I am afraid that will be the result of giving certain creameries the advantage of a ½d levy as against a 2d levy in the case of other creameries.  As a result, the ordinary creameries will not get full advantage of the Bill.</P>

It is all right to encourage <Col N="2365" /> creameries in the Gaeltacht, but the point is that we are speaking in the dark when we have not some information from the Minister as to probable changes that may be made in his scheme.

      <P>I was about to give that information.  Deputies will realise that it would be absolutely impossible to include the whole Gaeltacht in the Schedule.  If we put all the Gaeltacht creameries in the Schedule it would mean that the Bill would be of little use to any creamery.  With regard to central creameries, there are 17 in the Gaeltacht.  There are only 6 in the Schedule at present, but they are small.  Amongst the 17 creameries there are some of the most successful and the biggest creameries in Ireland. As regards auxiliaries, we have 6 in the Schedule at present.  If we had all the Gaeltacht creameries included we would have 69 altogether in the Schedule and 23 centrals, out of a total in the Free State of 200 centrals and 350 auxiliaries.  The output of butter by the scheduled creameries is less than 2 per cent. of the whole and if we put the Gaeltacht creameries in it would mean 16 or 17 per cent.  It would make the whole scheme unsound if we were to include the Gaeltacht.  In the amendments tabled for the Schedule there is a considerable number of creameries indicated by Deputies which are really in the Gaeltacht and I am afraid it will be impossible to consider them.</P>

The creameries on the scheduled list fulfil all these conditions but there is no creamery as far as I know that is not on the scheduled list that would fulfil all these conditions.</P>

That has a much smaller area than the area of the Gaeltacht Housing Act.  I would ask the Minister to consider that before the Report Stage of the Bill is taken.  I cannot say off-hand whether there is a creamery in that area at all.  I had the figures the Minister mentioned in connection with the area of the Gaeltacht Housing Act, and I quite realise that if such a large number were included in the Schedule it would render the finances of the Bill absolutely impossible.

      <P>Sections 5, 6, and 7 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
      <P>(1) There shall be paid to the Minister in accordance with this section by every registered proprietor of registered premises on all butter held in stock by or on behalf of such registered proprietor at six o'clock a.m. on the 21st day of April, 1932, a levy at the rate of two pence per pound.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 7:&mdash; In sub-section (1), page 5, line 19, to insert after the word &ldquo;butter&rdquo; the words &ldquo;manufactured by such registered proprietor and.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section reads at present it might be held that butter held in stock, no matter where or how manufactured, would be subject to the levy. This amendment is to make it plain that it must be manufactured by such registered proprietor and held in stock and so on.  A high price before the <Col N="2368" /> 21st April was more or less a natural thing whether this Bill was introduced or not, but after that date the price has been kept up more or less artificially as a result of this Bill.  Consequently we have no compunction about levying on stocks and on production since that date because we feel that it is due to the Bill that any benefits have been got for stocks held at that date and since.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (6) and in lieu thereof to insert the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every such certificate shall be served on the person to whom it relates, and such person may within 14 days after service thereof appeal in the prescribed manner to the District Court from the amount of the levy so certified as payable by such person and the District Court shall have jurisdiction to ascertain and fix the proper amount of such levy; and make such order as to costs as to the Court shall seem fit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reason for putting down this amendment is this: if Deputies look at sub-section (3) of the section they will find that it is there provided that &ldquo;if any person liable to pay a levy under this section fails or neglects to send the said return in accordance with the next preceding sub-section he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds.&rdquo;  Under Section 46 of the Bill the Minister is given power to withdraw a licence given to any person, while sub-section (4) of Section 8 provides &ldquo;as soon as may be after the seventh day after the date of the passing of this Act the Minister shall make in respect of every person (whether such person has or has not made the said return)....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now in the first place the creamery can be fined £20 for not making this return; secondly, its licence can be withdrawn, and thirdly, under this sub-section the Minister can make a levy <Col N="2369" /> on it despite the circumstances prevailing. Take as an example of what may happen.  The Committee of Management are the responsible people.  If any fine or other penalty is inflicted they must bear it, but the failure to send in the return may be due to the neglect of the secretary or manager. The person liable to make the return may be ill and still the Minister is taking power to render the creamery liable to a fine of £20.  He is also taking power to withdraw its licence and to make the levy irrespective of whether the levy is right or wrong.  His certificate that such a levy has been made will be taken as conclusive proof in a court of law.</P>
    <P>My amendment makes provision for the right of appeal to the district court. We all agree that the income tax law is very rigid but yet there is the right of appeal to the Commissioners.  Under this Bill, as the result of neglect on the part of a manager or a secretary of a creamery to make the return, the creamery can be mulcted in the way that I have described.  The Minister can make a levy that on the sixth night or a prescribed night that the creamery had 100 cwts of butter in the creamery. When the Minister makes up a certificate to that effect the creamery is bound to pay the levy although it may not have 1 cwt. of butter.  The sub-section provides that the Minister can make up his certificate, and when that comes in to the creamery committee it may discover that some employee of theirs has neglected to make the return required.  The committee have no right to appeal from the Minister's certificate.  In view of the wide powers that are given, I think it is only right that the creamery committee should have the right of appeal to the district court.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment, because I am prepared to accept the view of the Minister that there are, perhaps, a certain number of creameries which require some help, and that it may be allowable to give them the help in this particular way.  This, however, is a very substantial subsidy, at the expense of other creameries to these particular scheduled premises.  What is going to happen, or what may happen, if they are getting the full extent of the benefit which can be given under the Bill as it now stands, is, that they will get 14/- per cwt. on all the butter they make for the next five years, or whatever period the Bill runs.  The Minister has undertaken <Col N="2372" /> to introduce an amendment on Report, limiting the life of the Bill to three years, but as he was proposing that these creameries would be scheduled, and would have this advantage for five years, I presume that we will be now asked that they should have the advantage for three years.  It seems to me that that is altogether excessive.</P>
    <P>Taking the average butter production&mdash;I have not the figures before me, but I looked at them a day or two ago&mdash;I think that, in the case of one of the creameries, if we took the average of the last two years as the amount of butter production, it would have a subsidy of about £2,000 a year, and another would have a subsidy of £1,700 a year, and if the Bill were to stand as it is it would mean that a particular creamery is going to get £10,000 handed over to it by the other creameries, many of which have their own difficulties.  I would not mind a creamery having 14s. a cwt. of a special subsidy given to it for one year at the expense of the other creameries, although before that is done I think that some further details ought to be given to the House.  I think it would be desirable when we come to consider the Schedule that the Minister should, in this matter, give the same amount of information to the House as he would give if he were coming to the House with an Estimate to give subsidies to these particular creameries.  I do not see that creameries can expect, or have any right to expect, to have a subsidy voted to them, and still have the right to have their affairs kept entirely private.</P>
    <P>I think that when we come to the Schedule, we should know the facts of these creameries in full detail, so that we may see exactly what sort of case is made out for them.  However, if we give this subsidy in this, if not exactly concealed way, in this private way, for one year, I think that that is the most we ought to do, and if the creameries cannot continue at the end of the year, on the same basis as the other creameries, that instead of levying an unknown amount, an undisclosed amount, off the other creameries to give to them, the Minister ought to take a <Col N="2373" /> Vote in this House, and inform the House that such and such a creamery cannot continue unless special assistance is given to it.</P>
    <P>I am taking it for granted, more or less, that the general statement the Minister has given with regard to the scheduling of these particular creameries and premises, is justified.  I am not altogether sure that that is so, and I would like to hear from the Minister whether he does not think that, even at this stage, it might be better to remove the Schedule and the principle of scheduling altogether.  If there are creameries which must be helped in a special way, which must have money handed to them, either at the expense of the other creameries, or at the expense of the general taxpayer, the facts should be laid before the House, by way of a Supplementary Estimate, and the amount voted and handed over to them, and that such supervision of their affairs as might be necessary should take place during the period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This sub-section is one to which there is extreme opposition by the creameries outside the scheduled list.  I agree with Deputy Blythe that if there was a special case, it should get consideration, but if we are to have those in the Gaeltacht included, I think it is unfair that those in the other areas should have to carry them on their backs.  I know that feeling is very keen in my area, that this should not be, and the amendment to this sub-section commends itself to me, that one year, if they are to be included, is sufficiently long to give them room to draw their breath, and to improve their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly have no intention of paying out £2,000 for five years to any individual creamery.  I think the Deputy is possibly correct in assuming that the most favourable case from that point of view, would work out, perhaps, at £10,000 but there was no intention, as I say, of giving that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My intention would be to raise the levy gradually on these creameries if the levy on the general body of creameries is not coming down; in other words, that we would make the <Col N="2374" /> gap between the two narrower each year until they would meet after three years, which they must now as we have accepted another amendment. If we were to put on a ½d. this year, and if the levy remained at 2d. on the general body of creameries, we would raise that ½d. either to ¾d. or 1d., the following year going to 1½d., and the year afterwards they would be on the same list.  The benefit to the creameries on the scheduled list would be somewhere between £3,000 and £4,000 instead of £10,000.  That particular creamery would get the most. I think myself that some on the scheduled list would not get anything like that.  The Deputy is entitled to get the figures he asked for, and we shall have them here to-morrow, and I hope when we come to deal with the scheduled list to give a fairly close estimate of what we think the benefit would amount to in each case.  I may say that I have considered this amendment very carefully to see if we could put in an amendment saying a ½d. this year and ¾d. or 1d. next year and I found it would be impossible to amend the Bill in that way.  That, however, is our intention if the Deputy is satisfied with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Bill ought to be amended.  I would be willing to leave it over for the Minister to consider between this and the Report Stage, but a very substantial sum is liable to be given to certain creameries.  To one of the creameries it is not at all unlikely that something very near £2,000 might be given. That is a very substantial sum.  The circumstances next year are something that we cannot foresee, but if more assistance were required I am not sure whether it would not be better for the Minister to face up to the proposal that he should come to the Dáil and ask for any money that is required. After all, when you are paying money out of a general fund to some particular individual, or group or section of people, it is better that it should be done in what is the normal way here, that it should have to run the gauntlet of the House.  What will happen if this Bill is not amended is that the Minister will <Col N="2375" /> allow a certain amount to go to the creameries this year.  He has the intention of reducing the difference next year.  He may find it difficult for a variety of reasons to do that, and he certainly will have, I am sure, all these creameries fighting as hard as possible to retain the maximum advantage.</P>
      <P>
        <i>[An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
      <P>I cannot undertake myself to draft an amendment gradually to reduce the difference from 1½d. to nothing over a period of two or three years, but I am satisfied it would not be beyond the skill and power of the Parliamentary draftsman to frame such an amendment. I would be satisfied personally to accept something that would wipe out this particular advantage in the period of three years if the Minister would undertake to see whether such an amendment could be drafted.</P>

      <P>This would provide that no levy will be paid during the preliminary period.  I think the Deputy afterwards moves that no levy is to be paid up to the 31st of July.  Well, of course, if no levy was paid there would be no bounty and the whole financial arrangement would be upset. We would not know how we stood or where we were if we accepted that amendment.  The whole Bill is drafted on the supposition that we start the levy at a certain time and the bounty at a certain time and if there was any substantial change in that date it would put us out very much.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>On account of the deletion of sub-section (3) of Section 9, and the insertion of a new section by amendment 25 at a later stage the words which are proposed to be inserted here are necessary.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 20 not moved.</P>
