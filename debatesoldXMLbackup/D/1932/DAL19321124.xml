      <P>The Minister for External Affairs and another Minister have received new passports since their appointment.  The request is still made over the name of the late Minister for External Affairs.  A large quantity of request forms had been printed in anticipation of a much larger demand for passports than has in fact taken place.

      <P>No proposal or suggestion has been made by the Government to have the legal or other issues involved in the land annuities dispute referred for decision or opinion to the Permanent Court at The Hague.  As the Deputy is aware, the policy of the Government has been to retain the land annuities in this country until such time as the British Government have established a valid claim to them.  The Government have always been willing to submit the issues involved for determination by an international tribunal.  The British Government, however, have declined to accept arbitration by such a body.  Neither have they invoked the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court. In our view the onus of invoking the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court at The Hague lies upon the party making the claim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state <Col N="194" /> with special reference to the Despatch seat on 6th July last by the British Government relative to the composition of a Tribunal to decide the Land Annuities dispute (inter alia), (a) if any restriction was thereby sought to be imposed on the appointment of Irish Free State nationals by the Irish Free State Government as their nominees on such Tribunal; (b) if any restriction was thereby sought to be imposed on the appointment, by agreement, of an Irish Free State national as Chairman; (c) if it is possible for the Government of the Irish Free State to appoint as their nominees some of the Counsel who prepared their case for the retention of the Land Annuities; (d) if there is any reason why a Tribunal with such Irish nominees should not be constituted forthwith and meet to consider the appointment of a Chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The full text of the Despatch of the 6th July will be in the hands of the Deputy within a day or two, and he will then be able to draw his own conclusions.  No special restrictions were sought to be imposed as to the composition of the Tribunal beyond that of confining its membership to persons drawn from the States of the Commonwealth.  It was because of that restricting condition that the Government of the Irish Free State refused to accept it. The possibility&mdash;if there were such a possibility&mdash;of having a citizen of this State selected by the nominees of both sides as Chairman would not make the Tribunal more acceptable.  The principle for which the Government stands in this controversy is that the tribunal to determine the dispute between the two States should be an international tribunal, that is to say, a tribunal selected without restriction as to the nationality of its members. The Government have no intention of abandoning that principle.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that the average all-in cost of the houses to which Section 5 (1) of the Act mainly applies, viz., houses built by private persons and public utility societies, would be approximately £450, regard being had to the numbers of houses provided in both rural and urban areas.  The percentage of a nearly all-concrete house at prevailing prices of cement is approximately 5.5.  An increase in the price of cement by 4/- per ton would involve a 0.5 per cent. increase in the all-in costs.</P>

      <P>The question of the payment of a bounty on the export of sheep was fully considered by me, but in view of the more urgent requirements, in respect of bounties, of other branches of the agricultural industry, and having regard also to the amount of funds available for the payment of bounties, I have not seen my way to recommend to the Executive Council the payment of a bounty on the export of sheep.  I may add that I have not been approached by representatives of sheep owners with a view to the payment of such bounty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware that of the total number of sheep produced in Ireland, one and a half millions come from County Galway?  Is the Minister not prepared to help this industry throughout the country, just the same as he is helping other live stock industries, or is it the declared policy of his Ministry to cripple the sheep industry, by which so many small farmers, particularly in the County Galway, earn a livelihood?  Finally, I would like to mention to the Minister that if that is the Government's declared policy he ought to remind the Minister for Lands and Fisheries that the people interested in sheep raising must inevitably be defaulting annuitants, because they will not have money to pay their liabilities.</P>

    <P>(1)  That there shall be charged, levied, and paid on every of the articles mentioned in the second column of the Schedule to this Resolution imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 23rd day of November, 1932, a customs duty at the rate stated in the third column of the said Schedule opposite the mention of the article in the said second column.</P>
    <P>(2)  That the provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duty mentioned in this Resolution on any article with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; and as though the Second Schedule to the said Finance Act, 1919, contained a list of goods to which the rate of duty stated in the fourth column of the Schedule to this Resolution opposite the mention of such article in the second column of that Schedule is made applicable as a preferential rate and such article were included in that list.</P>
    <P>(3)  That where a percentage is stated in the third or the fourth column of the Schedule to this Resolution opposite the mention of any article in the second column of that Schedule, such statement shall be construed as meaning a rate of duty of an amount equal to that percentage of the value of such article.</P>
    <P>(4)  That the provisions (if any) set forth in the fifth column of the Schedule to this Resolution opposite the mention in the second column of the said Schedule of any article <Col N="210" /> shall apply and have effect in relation to the duty mentioned in this Resolution in respect of such article.</P>
    <P>(5)  That whenever the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, so thinks proper, the Revenue Commissioners may by licence authorise any particular person, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, to import without payment of any duty mentioned in this Resolution all or any articles (not being articles in respect of which a power of issuing licences to import is contained in the fifth column of the Schedule to this Resolution) chargeable with any such duty either, as the Revenue Commissioners shall think proper, without limit as to time or quantity or either of them or within a specified time or in a specified quantity.</P>
    <P>(6)  That where an article could be regarded as chargeable with two or more of the duties mentioned in this Resolution, such article shall be deemed to be liable only to that one of those duties in respect of which the greatest amount of duty would be payable, and such article shall accordingly be chargeable only with such duty.</P>
    <P>(7)  That the value of any article for the purposes of this Resolution shall be taken to be the price which an importer would give for the article if the article were delivered, freight and insurance paid, in bond, at the place of importation, and duty shall be paid on that value as fixed by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(8)  That if any person does any act (whether of commission or omission) which is a contravention of any condition prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners under this Resolution or under a provision contained in the fifth column of the Schedule to this Resolution, he shall be guilty of an offence under the Customs Acts and shall, for each such offence incur a penalty of fifty pounds, and any article liable to duty in respect of which such offence is committed shall be forfeited.</P>

      <Col N="217" /> (1)  That sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Finance (Customs Duties) (No. 2) Act, 1932 (No. 11 of 1932), be repealed as on and from the 23rd day of November, 1932, and that in lieu thereof it be enacted that, in relation to all articles chargeable with the duty imposed by sub-section (1) of the said Section 3 and imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the said 23rd day of November, 1932, the provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the said duty with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; and as though the Second Schedule to the said Finance Act, 1919, contained a list of goods to which three-fourths of the full rate was made applicable as a preferential rate and the articles chargeable with the said duty were included in that list.</P>
    <P>(2)  That whenever the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, so thinks proper, the Revenue Commissioners may by licence authorise any particular person, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, to import without payment of the duty imposed by Section 3 of the Finance (Customs Duties) (No. 2) Act, 1932 (No. 11 of 1932), any articles chargeable with that duty either, as the Revenue Commissioners shall think proper, without limit as to time or quantity or either of them or within a specified time or in a specified quantity, but no such licence shall relate or apply to articles imported before the 23rd day of November, 1932.</P>

      <P>The first of the Resolutions reimposes, with some slight modification, duties which have been already effective under the various Emergency Orders. It is considered that it would be undesirable to make permanent, by a Confirming Bill, these agricultural tariffs until the Dáil has been afforded an opportunity of discussing them on a Financial Motion.  After they are agreed to they will be confirmed by a Bill and the Emergency Orders, so far as they have imposed these duties, will be amended in order to delete them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Financial Motion 2, it imposes a preferential rate of duty of three-fourths of the full rate on potatoes imported from Commonwealth countries.  By the Finance (Customs Duties) (No. 2) Act, 1932, potatoes from Commonwealth countries were originally admitted free. This position was changed by an Emergency Order.  Financial Motion No. 3 imposes a preferential rate of two-thirds of the full rate on cut flowers imported from Commonwealth countries. Section 2 of the Finance (Customs <Col N="219" /> Duties) (No. 2) Act, 1932, originally provided that cut flowers from these countries should be free.</P>
    <P>I suggest that, as the House will have an opportunity of discussing the principle of these motions when the Finance Bill comes before the Dáil in due course, it would be desirable to allow the Resolutions to go through to-day.  I want to make it quite clear that no new duties are being imposed. It is merely to give the House an opportunity, at an early date, of discussing certain of the duties imposed by the Emergency Orders that they are being brought before the House in this way in order that they may form the basis of a Bill which will be submitted to the House in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the rates been altered in any case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In the case of pigs' meat there has been an alteration made in the case of lard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the nature of the alteration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Lard other than the lard imported for the making of margarine. When the Tariff Commission sat to consider the question of bacon they had evidence from the manufacturers of margarine asking that neutral lard be allowed in free of duty.  That still holds; that will be allowed in free. There is no other alteration until we come to vegetables.  Vegetables are divided into three or four categories now.  All vegetables under the emergency tariff had a duty of 1/- per lb. and 8d. preferential.  After consultation with those interested in the vegetable trade, growers, market gardeners, glasshouse vegetable growers, those tinning vegetables, those engaged in the distribution of vegetables, and also some representatives of the hotels, we tried to come to an agreement as far as we could as to the classification.  Common vegetables that can be produced in this country to the extent required, such as cauliflowers, broccoli, cabbages, brussels sprouts, listed under (a) have an almost <Col N="220" /> prohibitive tariff of 1/- and 8d. There are then in (b), (c), (d) and (e) what we might call seasonal vegetables where the tariff is high during the season that they are produced in this country and low at the time they must be imported and cannot be produced here.  There are dates given, from 1st December to 31st March, during which lettuce may be imported at the lower rate.  In the same way, we are dealing with French beans, runner beans, peas and carrots.  They can be imported at the lower rate from 1st April to 31st May.  Otherwise, the duty of 1/- and 8d. holds for these.  There is a proposal to tariff tomatoes and cucumbers which will not commence, however, until 1st June, 1933.  It is to give notice to the growers of tomatoes that the home market will be protected to a certain extent for the home-grown tomatoes when they come in next season.  All other fresh vegetables, which would include such vegetables as asparagus, rhubarb, seakale, and some vegetables not produced here to any extent, will be allowed in at a rate of 6d. and 4d.  Dried vegetables will bear the higher rate with certain exceptions, such as onions, shallots, garlic, lentils, beans and peas, dried thyme, sage and mint.  Then there are the soups and all preparations consisting wholly or mainly of vegetables which have a tariff of 6d. and 4d.  There is one other class&mdash;rhubarb and mushrooms&mdash;which has a rate of 6d. and 4d.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I was dealing with two points.  One was the scheme which I had thought of suggesting to the House in order to fit in what I understood is the primary object of this Bill in relation to wheat, that is to get more wheat grown in the country&mdash;to get an increasing acreage of wheat in the country from year to year.  The scheme I had was not to <Col N="227" /> insist upon that wheat being milled, because if that wheat has got to be milled, it may cause some deterioration in the class of bread we have got to eat, and it may, alternatively, and most certainly will, cause some increase in the price of bread we have got to eat.  I was suggesting, instead of this wheat having to be taken by a miller and milled in each year, that he should be allowed to pass with the obligation only of purchasing this wheat, that he might mill it if he so pleased and if he thought it was of good type and was suitable for milling into bread for human consumption. If he did not do that, then he could dispose of it otherwise if he could.  I gave certain indications in the latter stage as to what I thought were possible means of disposing of it by offering it to the Minister for sale, by appealing for a bounty, so that the wheat may be exported to another country, by having it held and stored and dried by the Minister, and afterwards given back to him on payment, if he had not the necessary equipment for these purposes himself.  If he could not do any or all of these things, then it might be better for him to let a certain amount of it go to waste, or else make it into feeding-stuff of another type rather than mill it into stuff that had to be consumed by humans, and I think still that would be a better scheme.  You would always have the stimulus on the man who was purchasing, and who was bound to purchase, that he would have to make the use of it which was most valuable to himself, but it was left to his own option. Should he mix it with wheat that was purchased from abroad, should he make it into a mixture with feeding-stuff of another type, should he attempt to export it, or simply let it go on his hands?  There was always the economic drive upon him&mdash;which of these things would bring him in the most return for the money he had to spend on the purchase, which was obligatory under the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other item that was under discussion here was how far Section 27 is going to be workable under the new conditions so definitely outlined for us <Col N="228" /> by the Minister for Agriculture.  We are not going to have a discrimination possibly as between wheat which is described as millable wheat or which can be described as such, and the wheat which by implication in omitting that definition has to be looked upon as wheat not suitable for milling. The Minister at one time seemed to indicate that his way out of that difficulty was first simply to decide upon the percentage of Irish wheat which had to be used by the millers, irrespective of whether it was what would pass under the prescription, or under the standard that might be prescribed for millable wheat or not, and there were various objections raised to that.  First of all that it would mean, as will appear from later sections, that there was going to be a terrific handicap imposed on the miller because he would have to take what is offered to him, and the repercussions would be that people with good-class wheat might have been holding it at the end of the milling season and the other people would have got away with the sale of wheat of less good quality to a miller who is forced to take something, with consequent deterioration in bread and consequent increase in price.  There is a further point which is possibly much the same as that.  If it is not possible to determine what is millable wheat, and if the only way out of that difficulty is simply to apportion a certain amount of wheat that has not been purchased in the country and if, in fact, less good wheat happens to be purchased than the better class it will naturally be purchased at a lower price, and under the latter section the rate of subsidy is defined as being the difference between the price actually got in a particular season and a certain sum laid down in the Schedule.  If the actual price, because it relates to low grade wheat, is small obviously the subsidy is going to be so much bigger, and for no great purpose.  It is going to result, as I said before, in certain wheat which might have found its market being left over, and less good wheat sold at a less price, but with the subsidy having to be paid by the State upon that.  I do not take it that the Minister has <Col N="229" /> yet clearly outlined what he is going to do.  It seems from yesterday's discussion, the Minister only recently found himself in the difficulty of not being able to get a definition as to what millable wheat is, and was still suffering from the shock of that, and had not made up his mind as to what the alternative plan was.  Certainly on the section which deals with the bounty, there must be some explanation given as to how the Minister intends to proceed, because when it comes to a question of payment of a subsidy and when there is no standard of quality above and below which wheat may be graded it is going to be quite impossible for anyone to determine what is the price.  If it were possible to get a definition then it is clearly, I think, easy to determine the average price paid for wheat of that quality.  If there is to be a mixture, and if we have to take the average over all these, then I say the price would naturally have to fall and the subsidy that would have to be paid by the State would be great.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in reply to Deputy McGilligan. I think, of course, his whole difficulty is he is approaching the question from the point of view that millable wheat cannot be grown here. That is the fundamental error upon which all his arguments are based.  He is assuming, to begin with, that the wheat grown here will not be millable wheat, and the fact is that the greater part of the wheat grown here will be millable wheat, and that there would be no difficulty whatever about utilising that wheat in growing proportions in the production of flour here.  I do not see that any of the administrative difficulties he foreshadows are likely to arise.  If the millers report that a sufficient quantity of good wheat is not available to them from within the country to enable them to carry out their obligations under this section, their statements can be checked up by the inspectors of the Department of Agriculture, and if we find that these inspectors agree with the millers, then a Variation Order can be made. Similarly, if the inspectors and instructors of the Department of Agriculture <Col N="230" /> report that more good millable wheat is available than the millers are required to take, their statement can be checked up by the millers, and if agreement is reached, a Variation Order is made.  It is not a matter on which I see that any great difficulty can arise, in view of the fact that the Minister has power to vary the Order as circumstances necessitate.  The Deputy, however, can estimate that, on the average, 16 cwts. per acre of good millable wheat will be available, and, in fixing the quota on that basis, the Minister will not go very far wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that the Minister has really not answered the question put up last night and to-day? The fact is that his statement practically gives away the case. Granted that the greater portion may be millable, it is still possible for a large portion in a given season not to be millable.  That is what the Minister has not dealt with.  He says that if that happens and, if the millers report that they have not got a sufficient quantity to fulfil requirements under the Order made under this section, they can make their case and it can be checked up and if the inspectors of the Department agree, all right, but supposing they disagree, who is to decide?</P>

      <P>The Minister has not met the case.  He says he foresees no difficulty.  I quite admit that the Government have shut their eyes to the difficulties involved in this Bill. They say they can vary the Order when a case is put up.  Supposing there is, as I say, a conflict between their inspectors, again, who is to decide, when no idea can be given to them from the Department as to what is millable wheat, whether it is millable or not?  Supposing there is that conflict of opinion when does the variation of the Order take place; when can it be investigated, and at what period of the year?  The preliminary&mdash;and at <Col N="231" /> very best, even if you take the Minister's statement, it can only be a preliminary&mdash;fixing of the percentage takes place in August.  When can a variation of that take place?  After representation by the millers?  It is not now a question as to whether or not the greater portion of the wheat produced here is or is not millable. Experience alone can decide that.  It it is produced in large quantities, a large portion may very easily be unmillable in a certain year, and I say that if the Government approaches it with the refusal to give a definition as they have up to the present, there is very little chance of a satisfactory solution from any point of view.  I do not think the Minister has met the case at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister has not met the case, he has, I think, cleared the air a little, because he has declared that practically all the wheat grown here is millable or will I say, anyway, is grindable.  The Minister has declared, in other words, that four-fifths of the wheat that will be grown here is millable, and we have got that far on the question of standard, but the standard of millable wheat will be calculated as being equal to four&mdash;fifths of the grain that might be grown here in any one year.  That is the nearest we have got so far to a definition, and I think it was the definition the Minister had in mind, judging by the speeches of both Ministers.  The Minister for Agriculture, yesterday, in speaking about the difficulty of fixing a standard, said, when we suggested that there might possibly be a violent conflict of opinion between the millers themselves, that perhaps it might be said that he wanted a greater amount used than the millers would want to use.  That seems to be substantiated to-day by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, because he accused Deputy McGilligan of saying that there was no millable wheat grown in Ireland.  Nobody on this side said any such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we want is a definition of what is millable, and while I am prepared to admit that there might be some trouble in finding a definition, it can be <Col N="232" /> found, and it is all the more desirable that it should be found now in view of the admission of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there are going to be 16 cwts. of millable wheat to the acre.  In other words, four-fifths of the wheat grown here in any average year will be millable.  If that is the standard the Ministry have in mind for &ldquo;millable,&rdquo; all I can say is: &ldquo;God help the unfortunate industrial and working people.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the position of bakeries situated in the Border towns and I would like to impress on the Minister that they stand in a very different position from the other bakeries in the Free State inasmuch as they have to face the fierce competition of a city like Belfast.  I know that there is a tariff on at the moment but that can be negatived if the flour is not up to standard.  The bread baked therefrom will not be up to standard and it may so happen that the people living in these towns will still buy the bread from Belfast and from other northern towns at the increased price if it is made of better quality flour.  That is an aspect of the situation which should not be lost sight of by the Minister.  There is also the danger that certain bakeries in the City of Dublin may be in a position to get the best quality flour from the mills to the detriment of bakeries in towns along the Border.  There is such a thing as trade jealousy and I can see the possibility of that happening.  That is another aspect of the situation that the Minister should keep before his mind, especially in view of the position the bakeries in the Border towns find themselves in at the moment.  The Minister certainly has protected them but there is just the danger that the protection afforded at the moment may be nullified by the fact that the bread baked from this flour&mdash;I am not saying it will be bad&mdash;may not be of the same high standard as formerly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to stress again this point that has been made. It arises, to my mind, with great importance on this section but with more importance on another.  The two sections are, however, tied together. There is a quota business and a subsidy <Col N="233" /> or bounty.  The Minister for Agriculture yesterday said, and it has not yet been withdrawn, that he despairs of getting a definition of &ldquo;millable wheat.&rdquo;  We start off from that and, on that, we ask how is the quota going to be determined?  There has been an amendment accepted that, in determining the quota, some regard shall be had to the quantity of millable wheat grown in the country.  Again, I want to stress that regard therefore is going to be had to something about which the Minister despairs of getting a definition.  How it is going to be accomplished, I do not know, and we have not yet been told.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in an attempted defence of the untenable position, says: &ldquo;Oh, the inspectors will determine what is millable wheat.&rdquo; If they can determine what is millable wheat, they either have tests for it or they have not, and, if they have not, then, it is only mere guess-work, and, if they have, I do not think it is beyond the capacity of the draftsman to enshrine in words what their tests are likely to be or are going to be. But since we are told that it is impossible to get a definition, I am assuming that the phrase, when used, means that it is impossible to set down tests, so that we get to this point, that there is no test for millable wheat other than guess-work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other suggestion made last night was that you were going to determine as millable wheat whatever is milled. There, I think, the question of price comes in.  In a later section the Minister has to ascertain it from the sale of home-grown wheat and to issue certificates which, incidentally, are supposed to apply only to millable wheat, but afterwards the section suggests to all wheat milled.  The next section says he has to pay everyone who grew that wheat the difference between what the average price is and the amount set out in the schedule. The amount in the schedule is 25/- per barrel of 20 cwts., 1/3 a stone.  Supposing that in a particular year that is a subsidy of 3d. a stone, it would mean that the average price likely to be ascertained in that year was 1/- a stone. That would have been for millable <Col N="234" /> wheat, that is to say, wheat of a certain quality, just what the miller can be persuaded to buy.  Surely there is a dividing line.  If the miller has to buy a large amount he is going to see that he gets full value.  But supposing that he could buy anything, any rubbish, stuff, say, that he will give 3d. a stone for, he can throw that aside.  It will not be much loss.  It is going to be no loss to the grower, because the grower will get the whole difference in the average.  It will be likely to be cheap, rubbishy wheat, sold on the standard laid down, and the bill on the community will grow.  What check is there going to be on that?  We are told that it is on what is milled; what a man lets through his mill.  Surely that is no test.  There will come a point where, if he wants to get more or less out of the provisions of the Bill, it will pay to buy anything.  It is no harm to the grower to take a small price, because he is getting something for what he would really despair of selling at all.  By lowering the average for a year he can get an increased subsidy on the amount laid down in the schedule.  I have not been able to understand how the price is to be managed.  What lever is to be put on the mills to pay the best price?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing he only paid 3d. a stone.  There is not going to be a whole lot of Irish wheat in the market in the early days.  A small ring will get it arranged, and if the average is beaten down the grower will lose and the miller will gain, because he has paid something less than the best price.  The only people who will lose will be the community, first in the subsidy, and secondly by an increase in the price of bread.  The price question will arise with more point in a later section.  I would like to be told now what really is going to be the standard hereafter.  It is not a <Col N="235" /> standard that anyone can quarrel about.  If a man can assert his rights, if he feels that he has grown wheat that he thinks is of millable quality, if he can fight that point, get it examined and subjected to analysis, if there is not going to be a definition of that type, there is no standard laid down by which he could demand his rights.  It is going, apparently, to be left to the inspectors.  The minds of the inspectors in different areas will <Col N="236" /> vary.  A certain committee of instructors met and their opinions on millable wheat were as many as there were instructors in the room.  Otherwise it will be the other test, just the individual mind of a particular instructor with varying standards throughout the country, without any regard for equal conditions or certainty in price. It will be on the amount bought, and I think is subject to an amount of abuse.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 28.</P>
    <P>(1)  Where in any preliminary quota period or quota year for a mill in respect of which a milling licence is in force during such period or year there is milled at such mill an amount of wheat which is ten per cent. or more in excess of the quota for such mill in respect of such period or year, the holder of such licence shall at the expiration of such period or year pay to the Minister a sum calculated at the rate of three shillings for every four hundred pounds of wheat milled in excess of such quota and such sum shall be a debt due and payable by such holder to the Minister and may be recovered as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>(2)  In any proceedings by the Minister under this section to recover any sum from the holder of a milling licence the production of a certificate under the seal of the Minister certifying that such sum is due by such person shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts so certified.</P>
    <P>(3)  All moneys recovered by the Minister under this section shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister for Finance may direct.</P>

      <P>The explanation of these amendments was given yesterday in the discussion upon another amendment to a previous section&mdash; Section 24.  As the Bill stood originally, it was proposed that the fine upon excess production would not apply unless the excess was more than ten per cent. of the quota.  We have had various discussions with the millers and they represent that the arrangement contained in the Bill might act to the detriment of the smaller mills, and that if mills were allowed to exceed their quota it would be possible for the larger mills to concentrate on that and put the smaller mills out of business.  We accepted that up to the point in excess of the quota, but that the failure to mill up to the quota would not involve any penalty unless the failure involved more than ten per cent.  It does not mean any alteration in the principle of the Bill.  The position is that each mill will get a quota, and if it does not mill up to that quota, it will suffer no penalty unless the deficiency is more than 10 per cent., but if it exceeds the average then it will come into operation in respect of the total excess.  The original arrangement provided for a penalty if the quota was not reached.  The alteration will require some slight revision in the actual quota.  The scheme is the same except that the new arrangement is, in the opinion of the millers, and in our own opinion, less likely to operate to the detriment of the smaller mills.</P>

      <P>On amendment 65 I suggest that the word &ldquo;twenty&rdquo; should be substituted for the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo;.  First of all, in the new scheme suggested by the Minister, I do understand that a mill which mills less than its quota by ten per cent. suffers no monetary penalty, but what I want to know is, does it suffer by having the quota reduced in the following year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to suggest making a payment of twenty per cent.  Is there a yearly mathematical scheme, or otherwise why has the 3/-fine been chosen; and secondly, what is the purpose of this fine?  Is it&mdash;as I understood was mainly the system in this type of scheme&mdash;to allow a mill, which felt, for reasons best apparent to itself, that it was best not to mill but to draw from the pool, and in that way to allow a mill with better capacity and more efficiency, and therefore more likely to give better service to the community, to mill more than its quota and have a profitable business? That was the original scheme inaugurated as a result of discussions with the millers on the other side.  That was the reason for it.</P>
      <P>If I am to take sub-section (3) as an indication, this is meant to help the weak mills if they decide in a particular area not to mill their quota and to allow it to be milled by somebody else who will pay for it.  The fine here does not go to the mill that has failed, if there is one in any particular season. It goes to the Exchequer and, again, I want to know for what purpose. There are two points on which I would like information.  First, in regard to the 3/-, is that figure arbitrarily chosen or is there any reason behind it?  Secondly, what is the purpose of it?  Is it to say to the weak mill: &ldquo;If you do not like to mill the whole quota, on payment of a certain sum the large mill can do it and you can refrain from milling&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no penalty on a mill which exceeds its quota other than this fine of 3/-.  If a mill decides that it can by installing more up-to-date machinery, by a reorganisation of management or some such device, undersell a competitor to the extent of 3/-, then it can do so, but it will have to pay 3/- of a fine on its excess production.  It is conceivable that if a rival mill is efficient, it can pay the fine and nevertheless sell flour much better in the area of the inefficient mill.  The figure of 3/- was selected because it represents what, after careful examination, we have decided is a fair margin of protection for the small inland mill against the highly capitalised <Col N="240" /> port mill.  It would be quite possible for certain organisations operating in this country with large resources deliberately to pay a fine of say, 1/- per sack, on excess production over a long period and during that period put out of existence any particular mill it desired to remove, but it would become less profitable to do that at 3/-.  There is some possibility of doing it at 3/- but it would involve more substantial losses and it would require that the attacking mill would be highly efficient and the attacked mill inefficient for the project to succeed.  In these circumstances there is no objection to its being done. We think that this device is best suited to the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true the amount collected by way of fine goes into the Exchequer. It is out of the Exchequer any subsidy will come for mills which because of some particular natural difficulty are in need of it.  The pool is the Central Fund and it operates in much the same way as the pool established by the millers for their own purposes.  I think the Millers' Mutual Association had a fine of 5/- on excess production and the pool created by the fines was of course available for the subsidisation of the mills unable to sell.  We are not proposing to do that.  If a mill is so inefficient and makes flour of such bad quality that it cannot get people to buy it and people are prepared to take the margin available from the other mills, that mill will have its quota reduced and will ultimately go out of existence altogether. The fine of 3/- is there to afford it some slight protection but only a slight protection against the competition of the better equipped and more highly capitalised port mills.  The scheme is first of all to ensure that we will keep in existence the smaller rural mills. That we consider desirable, in view of the fact that our policy is to encourage wheat growing and also in view of the social need to decentralise industries, to help little rural industries in so far as it is possible to do it, and to curb the tendency of recent years of concentration at the ports.  Certain rural mills have advantages and also some disadvantages.  The intention is where <Col N="241" /> the disadvantages arise out of causes not within the control of the mills to redress them by the subsidy.  If there is another cause it will have to be considered.  The idea is to secure that the average mill will be protected against extinction by the port miller so long as it is reasonably efficient and selling at a price which will be regarded as competitive in relation to what the port mill can sell at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought this really was tied up with the subsidy to the inland mills and I am very much in a difficulty now.  First of all there is a plan for keeping what are called inland rural mills alive.  I have no great sympathy with it at all.  If a mill situated at a port, nevertheless can draw wheat from the interior of the country and mill and sell it cheaper than a mill situated in the interior of the country, then I do not see why there should be any penalty on that efficiency.  De-centralisation of industry is all very well in its own way.  Possibly you can do a good deal by it, but does it mean that you will decentralise branches of the same industry?  Why should we have three grinding mills for cement in different areas rather than one in Cork and a mill for something else in Galway? I do not see any system or safety in it.  The aim is the preservation, apparently, of the inland mill and the Minister here says that the 3/- is being put on because it is considered that is the protection required for the inland mill.  I put down 1/-, founding myself on the Minister's own later clause where with regard to inland mills he ties himself so that no greater subsidy can be given to the inland mill than 1/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That has no relation to this obviously.  It is 1/- plus 3/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, if 4/-were required would not a better division be 2/- each way rather than this method?  When I saw that another subsidy was to be given of 1/- per four hundred pounds to the inland mill, I thought that seemed to be the protection that the inland mill required.  Now I have got to look at the inland mill section in regard to this.  As far as I can make out from the new amendment <Col N="242" /> put down, an inland mill is any mill that is not within five miles of the post office in Dublin, Cork or Limerick.  A mill that is situated at Wexford harbour according to that is an inland mill.  A mill built on the water's edge at Galway is an inland mill.  The only mills really that are not inland mills for the purposes of the Bill are mills within five miles of the post office in the county boroughs of Dublin, Cork or Limerick.  Anything else is an inland mill and can be granted a subsidy up to a maximum of 1/- for every 400 lbs. of wheat milled.  I am not against the plan of the subsidy, but I think if it is going to be raised in this way there should be some equalisation as between the sum needed for protection and the other sum, or the whole thing might be put under the protective clause.  If you want 4/- make it that under the subsidy clause later on in regard to the inland mill.  If anybody outside wants to mill, when we are guaranteeing a subsidy, and if he does so efficiently let him get it, though that may mean one mill even producing against another.  And see what is the result.  It is the same with regard to the whole Bill.  The Minister's case is we must fit them into the Bill because they have no means of subsidy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

The 1/- will protect the inland, or the port mill, and <Col N="243" /> might be put in.  One inland mill can apply everything against another inland mill, though both are receiving a subsidy, which is a peculiar scheme.</P>

The section lays down that &ldquo;It shall be the duty of every person who is the holder of a milling licence to keep or cause to be kept ... the following records in the prescribed form.&rdquo; Surely a man might have a mill at one place where he did his milling and he might have an office associated with the mill, but not at the mill.  Could not the records be kept on premises not immediately at the mill, as long as they are designated for that purpose, and notified to the Minister?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of those responsible for the administration of the Bill is that it is at the mill they want the records kept.  If an inspector visits a mill for the purpose of seeing that the regulations are observed it is there that he would require the records for inspection, and not at an office which might be ten miles away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>He could make an inspection of the records at the office and take excerpts and then go on to the mill to verify them.  He has power to enter the mill where the material is milled and to make investigations there.  He could inspect the records at the office and take copies of the records.  Why should the miller have office premises at the mill if it does <Col N="247" /> not suit him?  There can be no subterfuge. The man should be entitled to say: &ldquo;I am keeping the records for the time being at my office.  I keep my material in the mill.  I designate where I keep them and if they are not there I am guilty of an offence.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is asking that the miller should be allowed to keep his records at some distance from where the milling is carried on. I went into this matter with my advisers.  First of all, it would be very little trouble to the miller to have the records kept at the mill, and it would be more convenient for the inspector if that was done.  There should be no difficulty for any miller to keep records of the quantity of wheat milled, of the dispositions and in respect of home-grown wheat bought.</P>

      <P>Where they are, no difficulty will arise.  If that is not the case surely these records, if kept as they ought to be kept, would entail a purchase journal and ledgers which must be constantly available, recording the value of the incoming wheat and the dispositions of it.  Certainly the purchase journal will.  I do not know whether the dispositions will, or how far there will be a record of the dispositions of the wheat, or the value of the wheat when converted into flour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And that ends that, but the Minister will want a record of the purchases.  The Minister knows that these records are bulky and awkward things to handle.  In many mills <Col N="248" /> premises it would be impossible to keep these records there unless the miller makes a duplicate or carried his records between the mill and the office.  He would have in (iii) to make a record of all dispositions of such flour and meal respectively.  This would tend to add a very heavy burden to the millers, whereas the burden that Deputy McGilligan's amendment would put upon the inspector would be comparatively light.  I do not think it is too much to ask the inspectors to do this work.  Surely representations have been made along these lines to the Minister himself. Any man with a knowledge of business will recognise very readily that to conduct the operations necessary under (a) (i), (ii) and (iii) would be impossible. I do not think he will suggest that every mill must transfer all its office work from where it can be more conveniently done down to the mill premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be some case for an amendment to the section where the offices are not on the mill premises but adjacent to the mill.  If, however, the offices were several miles away from the mill it might be a matter of grave inconvenience, and the amendment would permit of that.  On the Report Stage I am prepared to introduce an amendment to meet the case of offices not too far away from the mill and still not on the mill premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I put this to the Minister, that there is no question here of a surprise investigation.  This is merely an examination of records.  I quite see that if there was any question of a surprise investigation and that an inspector wanted to make extracts, a warning could be sent to the mill in cases where the offices were not on the mill premises.  That does not arise here.  Suppose, for instance, that the head offices are in Dublin and the mill is in Collooney.  The inspector can go on Monday morning to the offices in Dublin and take all the relevant particulars that he wants out of the mill books and proceed on Tuesday to Collooney to make an inspection of the mill.  He would presumably go by motor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> The inconvenience of calling at the head office, where he will have to call in any case in all probability, and of taking the extracts there is trivial compared to the suggestion that millers should reconstruct their whole accounting system in order to make it possible to have the records available at the mill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can discuss this better when we see the Minister's amendment, but if it is going to be limited I think it is not going to be of much use.  I am thinking mainly of the case of a miller that I have in mind.  He has three or four mills with his head offices in Cork.  I can well see that, when making his purchases, this man would not have his mind clear as to the amount of wheat bought at a particular place that is going to be sent to one of those mills more than another.  He will dispose of it according as he finds the mills stocked when the stuff arrives.  He has then got to follow the disposition of that; to get books kept at his premises showing that a certain amount of it went to A, B or C mill.  In the books at A, B and C mills there has to be a record of the stuff coming in until it goes out eventually as flour for sale.  That man would naturally, I think, have a full record of his purchases in the books at the head office.  The whole disposition of that may be followed, and if any inspections are required at any time, whether a certain amount of the stuff is said to be no longer in transit or is said to be at a particular place for milling purposes, can be settled by a visit to the mill.  What the records show can be compared with what the inspector finds on the premises.  It is not too much to ask, particularly in the case of a man whose office premises ordinarily are a good distance away from the mill, that every ounce of the stuff is under control and that that should be attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> The Minister should also bear in mind that it is becoming more and more the custom of good millers in the country to have certain laboratories attached to their works, but by no means in close proximity to the mill premises.  Such things as moisture content are under observation from time to time.  There might be a certain amount of wheat in some process of change, either into meal or flour.  I do not think there is any certain way of tracing the real disposition, other than sales, except through the head office where the directing mind is.  In the case of office premises which are close to the mill premises, I suggest that it would be sufficient for the Minister to ask that in such a case the miller should produce at the mill premises all that he has got there, and that, if required, he might send across in a motor-car for the books in the office premises.  The only difficulty that would arise there is where there was a big stretch of country between the head office and the mill, say, between Cork City and some place in North Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister perhaps has not noticed that the inspector, after making his inspection, can call upon the miller to produce all relevant documents, invoices, consignment notes, receipts, etc.  How can the miller do that if, in fact, the documents are at the head office?  Would it not be much more convenient for the inspector when he is examining or making extracts from the register to ask for the production of the invoices and consignment notes that he wants at the place where they are kept?  From the inspector's point of view, I think it would be much more convenient to have all that part of the work done wherever the mill office is rather than at the mill.</P>

If any of these operations take place, say, at twelve o'clock on a Saturday, in relation to a mill which closes at one o'clock on Saturday, then they have got to be entered up inside that hour.  Twenty-four hours might be all right from Monday to Friday, but for a week-end twenty-four hours is far from meeting the case.  For the week-end I think it should be twenty-four office hours.</P>

      <P>I do not want to press the Minister but I want to say that certainly my limited experience in business leads me to believe that if I were called upon to fill up, under heavy penalties, records of the disposition of all flour and meal within 24 hours it would be physically impossible.  I would have the particulars in my books but to transfer these particulars into the register would be physically impossible.  This would be specially so at certain periods of the year.  Take the two weeks before Christmas, and one will appreciate that no miller with his ordinary staff could possibly keep that record up to within 24 hours at that period.  If the Minister is going to require something unreasonable like that, he will have much greater difficulty in enforcing the law than he would if he had insisted only under reasonable conditions.  If the Minister is to provide in this Bill that that record is to be entered within 24 hours all I can say is that it will not be done and his own inspectors will find it will not be done.  They will find with practical experience that it would be at least 48 hours.  The Minister himself must realise that with the staff he has in view he cannot have complete records for the business of taking in flour and meal in 24 hours.</P>

      <P>And the Minister justifies all that by saying that the most serious misdemeanours that can be committed, can be committed under this section.  It now becomes obvious that if a man disobeys the Minister's regulations he becomes liable to a grave penalty and, on the other hand, if he disagrees with the whims of the Minister's inspector he becomes liable to these very heavy penalties mentioned in the Schedule.  The Minister may say that no reasonable judge would impose those penalties but, nevertheless, it is clear that any man who runs counter to the whim of one of the Minister's inspectors becomes liable to exceedingly heavy penalties.</P>

      <P>We have to go to sub-section (4) to get to the full absurdity of the thing.  In paragraph (b) we read &ldquo;a demand for inspection of a record or document shall be deemed to have been duly made to the holder of a milling licence if such demand is made verbally at the mill ...to any person in the employment of such holder.&rdquo;  Let it be noted that the refusal of that demand makes the holder liable to the maximum penalties. It amounts to this, that the inspector may make an application to the yardman, and if there is any failure to produce records or documents the miller can be brought up and the maximum penalties imposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have referred to this matter on several occasions, but I will repeat what I said in the hope that it may sink in this time.  The penalties prescribed are maximum penalties.  It is possible to have a very serious offence committed under this section.  It is possible also to have a trivial offence committed.  If the offence is trivial and a person is prosecuted, it is reasonable to assume <Col N="258" /> that the judges will not impose the maximum penalties.  But they should have the power to impose heavy penalties for serious offences which might be designed to facilitate frauds on the revenue or to wreck the whole scheme of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it might be as well for me to mention something also in the hope that it may sink in. In my opinion the Minister always argues too much.  Why have any discrimination in the case of maximum penalties?  There are three penalties set down by the Minister in the First Schedule of this measure.  If the Minister is always going to rely on the reasonableness of the judge, where is the need for any more than one set of penalties?  Why not take Part I of the First Schedule, for instance, and adopt that generally?  The Minister must have some reason for Parts II and III.  Why not leave in an overriding maximum penalty and be content afterwards to rely on the reasonableness of the judge?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind this is what the Minister did: He prepared the section and then said &ldquo;We must prescribe the penalties contained in Part I of the Schedule in relation to this section,&rdquo; and then he passed on to other sections.  The Minister ought to remember that though he may be a very much overworked man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there is all the more reason why he should constantly remember that it is his business, if he has three separate penalties, to see that they are allocated to the appropriate offences.  It should not simply be the policy to attach one penalty to the whole lot merely because the Minister might think that it was not worth while to put in any other sub-section specifying particular penalties in accordance with the gravity of the misdemeanours that may be committed in contravention of this Act.</P>

      <P>As the section stands, a miller might be prosecuted and be made liable to the very severe penalties that we have been discussing if an inspector demands from his yardman or the woman who sweeps out the dust or perhaps scrubs the floor the production of certain documents and fails to get them.  If the records demanded are not forthcoming the miller is at once in serious trouble.  This is rather a drastic provision.  It is a serious thing to make an employer responsible for the action of any of his employees. I think the Minister ought to accept the amendment.  If he does not he will be placing the millers in an impossible position.  Any miller would be subject to grave penalties if an inspector thought fit to ask any of his employees for records such as are mentioned in this section and failed to get them.  The employee might know nothing whatever about the records demanded.  The section is obviously a ridiculous one.</P>

      <P>The section may be, in the opinion of the Deputy, ridiculous but I would like to remind him that several times during the past ten years he voted for Bills containing precisely the same section.  It is the common form of legislation in connection with Bills of this type.  The Deputy's suggestion is that the demand should be made on the person charged with the custody of the documents. How is the inspector to know who is charged with the custody of the documents?  Supposing the holder of the licence does not appoint anyone to hold the documents? <Col N="260" /> Supposing that person is on holidays in the Riviera?  Is the whole Bill to be held up on that account?  It is the responsibility of the holder of the licence to have the documents available for inspection.  The inspector presumably will be a reasonable man. Assuming he is not and he goes to the yardman, it is quite possible the yardman will refer him to the office. In the office there must be someone in a position to produce the documents. That is the responsibility of the licensed holder and not of the inspector.</P>

      <P>Here we get the contention that it is the duty of the holder of the licence to have the documents available.  He might have them available, but if a part-time employee is on the premises and is asked for them the demand is duly made for the documents.  That man may not know anything about the records.  The miller must inform everybody who is in his employment, either temporarily or permanently, where these records are to be found.  The next sub-section states that &ldquo;a refusal or failure to produce a record or other document for inspection, if made or permitted on the mill, by a person in the employment of the holder of a milling licence, shall be deemed to have been made or committed by the holder of such milling licence.&rdquo;  There is no question that the miller must have the documents available.  That is perfectly sound.  Insist upon that.  But to insist that the demand for production can be made on anybody in the holder's employment is ludicrous under the circumstances of this Bill.  The Minister has made the objection to the amendment that the person charged with the custody of the document might be on holidays.</P>

The average law-abiding citizen prides himself on the fact that he does not ordinarily do things that leave it open to anybody to prosecute him or to bring him before a court of summary jurisdiction on anything like a prima facie case.  These provisions are, however, setting pitfalls all over the place.  I quite agree that no sane judge would enforce a proviso of this kind.  But the average law-abiding citizen objects to being put in the dock.  I think that the Minister himself would object to being put in the dock in these circumstances.  We ask the Minister so to frame the statute that no person will be put in the dock unless he is deliberately endeavouring to impede the inspector or to make the statute unworkable.  In those circumstances, it is quite right that a penalty should be imposed upon him.</P>

      <P>If there is not some person marked out for the production of those documents, there may be all sorts of friction between those entrusted with the administration of the Act and the millers.  The inspector may go to a number of people&mdash;we may leave out the yardmen&mdash;and he may not be in the very best of temper.  He may be sent about his business.  If the Minister hears of the incident, it will be the inspector's side of the story he will hear.  Complaints of that kind will become numerous and will lead to friction.  Then we shall have more severe penalties imposed than we have heard of up to the present.  Under Section 32, the Minister will have power <Col N="263" /> to impose further penalties.  There is no trouble in achieving what the Minister professes to aim at&mdash;that the records should be available.  But to make the employer responsible for all the acts, in this respect, of his employees seems to court friction in the administration of the Act.  If the Minister considers the matter calmly&mdash; he does not seem inclined to do that at the moment&mdash;he will see that there is a great deal to be said for the amendment of the section as it stands.  The wording of the amendment may not be the best but the Minister could get an amendment drafted which would achieve the purpose of the amendment on the paper.</P>

      <P>There is no use founding arguments upon the Minister's vague statement about other Bills.  Let us see the Bill, and get the circumstances in which it was debated. Let us see whether there is any comparison with what is talked of here, and then we will know where we are. Under this, the Minister, whose judgment, as we have observed during the progress of the Bill, is not very sound, is going to be allowed to decide such a question as has occupied the attention of many judges in relation to many measures&mdash;the question of fraud and the question of misrepresentation. I suppose there are chapters in all the books written upon contracts which deal with the dividing line between fraud, misrepresentation, and an innocent mistake.  But the Minister is going to decide this in a measure as to which both himself and his colleague have decided that they cannot get a formula to define millable wheat.  He is going to apply his judgment as to whether or not a man has procured a milling licence by fraud or by misrepresentation. He has not indicated what evidence will be produced with regard to it, who is going to be allowed to plead in the case, or anything like that. The Minister makes up his mind that the licence has to be revoked, and the livelihood of the individual is taken from him because the Minister says he has been guilty of fraud or misrepresentation in procuring a licence.</P>

      <P>If this were seriously meant, there would be no hesitation whatever in allowing a court to decide it.  It is obviously a matter that requires legal skill and the mind of a judicial person to decide whether there has or has not been fraud.  It is one of the most elusive things to determine. Misrepresentation is probably <Col N="269" /> not so difficult, but certainly fraud is a very peculiar matter.  The cases with reference to it are numerous.  That there is any fair judgment possible from a layman in the matter is very hard to believe.  As I say, if the Minister decides that a person has been guilty of fraud, the penalty is that he loses his licence and his livelihood.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give a definition of fraud or of misrepresentation, or draw a distinction between misrepresentation and fraud?  I know perfectly well that he could not. There is no branch of law so highly technical as drawing the dividing line between misrepresentation and fraud. The Minister should take care to make provision that he will not withdraw a licence until an order of the court has been produced and he will want to distinguish between whether he has been found guilty of fraud or of misrepresentation. If a person is guilty of fraud in my opinion he is not entitled to any licence.  When you come to misrepresentation, then you have serious misrepresentation and the mere technical offence of misrepresentation, which is a trivial thing.  Anybody in business could be guilty of technical misrepresentation which would bring him within the law.  Serious misrepresentation will nullify a contract altogether. This is a responsibility that I would not take upon myself if I were a Minister and I think anybody who has any sense of the gravity of the distinction between the two would not take on the responsibility.</P>

I was just going to say it was a pity Deputy McMenamin's services were not at the disposal of Cumann na nGaedheal when they were the Government.

      <P>In all the Bills requiring a licence for the exportation of eggs or meat or butter or any of the other articles subject to licence under the late Government.  In any case I want Deputies to appreciate the fact that the Minister is responsible here for everything he does.  I adverted to the fact yesterday, that because it was alleged in error that a certain concession granted under the Finance Act shut down Gallaher's factory, there has been public agitation for three months, we have had many debates here, and every attempt has been made to gain political capital out of that for the Party opposite, and to damage the reputation of this Party.  Does any Deputy believe that if the Minister withdraws a licence from a flour mill and shuts it down he will not be subjected to the same type of comment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It means the Minister must be able to justify his action here in every Bill.  He cannot revoke a licence at all except the licence was secured by fraud or misrepresentation, except the conditions of the licence were departed from, or except the licensee was convicted by a court of an offence under the Act.  These are the only three grounds on which the Minister can decide to withdraw a licence. I am leaving out (b) which does not matter&mdash;if for some reason &ldquo;the business of milling wheat has ceased to be carried on at such mill&rdquo;&mdash; but in the other three cases he must be able to stand public criticism on his action on one or other of these three grounds. He would want to be quite sure of his grounds.</P>

      <P>The Minister has just proved how absolutely unfit he is to give a decision of this kind. First of all he referred to the fact that he will get help from his Department. In a case like this the decision must be the Minister's, not only based on the legal advice he can get from his Department.  He must be capable of acting in a judicial capacity.  He cannot leave a judicial decision of this <Col N="271" /> kind to officials.  He may take their advice, but the decision must be his.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  I do not think there is necessarily in the Minister for Industry and Commerce this judicial capacity to give a decision of this kind.  The remark he threw in to Deputy McMenamin about the distinction between an egg and an elephant shows that he has no conception of the difficulties that will arise. Far more absurd is the idea that the thing should be thrashed out judicially here in this House.  The thing is absurd.  The merits of it, from the point of view of employment, can be thrashed out, but not a question on the working of the judicial side of it, which is what the Minister acted on. Everybody knows that this House should not, except in exceptional circumstances, be subjected to matters of that kind.  It is not what the House is for.  It shows that the Minister has no appreciation of what he is required to do under this particular section.  I put the question again, which I put at the beginning: Why is it he takes this out of the ordinary jurisdiction of the court, which is obviously the proper place to determine whether there is fraud or not, whether there is misrepresentation or not, and what is the penalty that ought to follow that? Obviously the court is the place to do it.</P>

      <P>For about the nth time the Minister told us that the Minister is responsible for the Bill.  If that is so, we could have been spared most of the sections of this Bill.  The Minister might have been responsible for everything, and there would be no necessity for any of the sub-sections in it.  I, for one, am not satisfied that the Minister is the proper person&mdash;or his Department&mdash;to determine whether a person is guilty of fraud or misrepresentation. It should be on the decision of the court that a person would be judged guilty or not guilty of fraud or misrepresentation.  It is no use for the Minister to answer us in the flippant way in which he replied to <Col N="272" /> Deputy McMenamin about the difference between an egg and an elephant. I might as well ask the Minister what is the difference between a top-hat and a chimney-piece.</P>

Even if there were precedents, even if at some time within the last ten years some Bill has been passed with this section in it, and the Opposition that were did not see it, it only proves that we are a more vigilant Opposition.  We see what the Government, who were then the Opposition, did not see.  We are a vigilant Opposition.  I, for one, am not going to be a party to any person being convicted of fraud or misrepresentation by the Minister or his Department, and I think I will insist at this stage that the court must be the determining factor as to whether a person is guilty or is not guilty.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister would make a little journey with me some day to the Law Library at the King's Inns, and I will there show him tomes in plenty, investigating the question of what is fraud and what is not; I will then lead him to another section of the Library, and I will show him tomes just as big which have been written on the question of what is or is not misrepresentation.  I fully appreciate that the quality of mind which characterises the Minister places him in a category apart from the Judges and Justices of the Irish Judiciary, but still, much as we appreciate that, a great many of us would prefer to commit our destinies to the hands of the judges and the courts of this country, rather than to the clear and crystal mind of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not know whether there is a precedent or not.  It does not matter whether <Col N="273" /> there is or not.  If there is a precedent it is a very bad precedent.  If there is a precedent it is a precedent for setting the courts of this country at one side, and taking into the hands of the Minister for Industry and Commerce not only the power he denounced other members for taking when he was in Opposition&mdash;the power of making the law&mdash;but the power of administering the law.  Bear in mind that the Minister's defence for this is that he has precedents for it in another Bill. What are they?  Another Public Safety Act?  This precedent might come in very useful to this Administration or some future Administration.  If it did, the Minister for Industry and Commerce might have reason to regret the precedent.  I submit to the Minister that the creation of precedents of this kind, interfering with the jurisdiction of the courts, is very dangerous. I will certainly challenge a division on this, and I hope the proposer of the amendment will challenge it.</P>

      <P>Those are the only three you have got.  Stick to them. The Minister's phrase is&mdash;if it were required, and I do not think it is required&mdash;sufficient proof that he is not fit to carry out the duties imposed on him under the section.  If there were nothing but the cheap jackery of his remarks to Deputy McMenamin it would condemn him, and the equally absurd intervention he made&mdash;I suppose there is no third-rate music hall that could not produce a better retort &mdash;about the difference between an egg and an elephant, and that from a man who has decided that he cannot produce the definition upon which this whole Bill turns.  He is going to take a judicial function and, funnily enough, he is going to take the judicial function of determining the very, very narrow matter of fraud or misrepresentation, whereas he leaves it to the <Col N="274" /> court, in paragraph (c), to convict of an offence under the Act.  There are certain cases laid down here that are to be offences under the Act.  They are to have penalties attached to them that are, so far as the monetary side is concerned, none so bad as deprivation of a man's whole livelihood, and, yet, on a thing that will require great judicial discernment&mdash;that of deciding whether a thing is fraud or mispresentation&mdash;he takes the matter into his own hands and the penalty is forfeiture of the licence.  But the other matter, a matter which is more a matter of fact determination, the offence under the Act, is left to the court and the court has to decide on the penalties. If he is going to be a judge, why should he not be a judge of the easy matters?  If he is not capable of being a judge&mdash;and the drafting of the section shows that he is not capable of being a judge&mdash;of an offence under the Act, why does he become a judge in such a cryptic thing as fraud and misrepresentation?</P>

There is my defence&rdquo;: and then sit down. That is all he has to do.  I would ask him to arm himself with an order of the court for protection, and nothing else, because nothing else is a defence.</P>

      <P>We have now got the point of view that apparently the Minister need not make up his mind as to whether it is fraud or misrepresentation. He can just leave it <Col N="275" /> vague.  It is not a question of what a man is guilty of.  He will not decide whether he is guilty of fraud, and neither will he decide whether he is guilty of misrepresentation.  He is satisfied if, in a vague way, he is guilty of one or the other, but the Minister will not go to the trouble, according to his interjection just now, of judging what he is guilty of.  On this matter, I would like to point out to the Minister that one of his interjections was that a person has the remedy of going to the courts open to him.  Where is it so far as this is concerned?  He put an interjection of this kind in when the debate on the sub-section was going on, but where is that particular remedy as regards what we are now complaining of?</P>

The Minister says that a person can go in and get the protection of the court.  That is precisely what we are trying to get for him here.  If you put that sub-section in the Bill, he has no protection, but if you put in a provision, such as that set out in the amendment, he has every protection the Minister envisages&mdash;the protection of the court against the Minister.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 82:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) (b), line 21, after the word &ldquo;mill&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;for an extended period (save where such business has ceased through circumstances outside the control of the holder of such licence).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it would be asking too much to revoke a licence because a mill had ceased to operate for a very short period&mdash;days or weeks.  There ought to be some protection for the miller. The words suggested in the amendment would provide for an extended period. As the sub-section stands it is rather drastic, as a mill might stop on a Friday evening and might not start again until some time in the following week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is not necessary.  Paragraph (b) does not state that the milling of wheat has ceased at the mill.  It means where the business has ceased.  A temporary stoppage of machinery would not mean the cessation of business.  The wording means that the mill would have to be out of action for an extended period, due to the fact that the company operating it had gone out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the Minister's reading of the sub-section I am satisfied. It appeared to me, as it might appear to the ordinary layman, that the mere temporary cessation of milling would bring the owner under penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 83:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (2) (c), line 22, to delete all words after the word <Col N="279" />&ldquo;convicted&rdquo; to the end of line 23, and substitute the words &ldquo;twice of offences under this Part of this Act both of which convictions have resulted in penalties being imposed under Part I of the First Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>I think it would be rather drastic to revoke a licence because there was a trivial offence.</P>
    <P>I propose that the licence should not be revoked unless the holder of the licence shall have been convicted twice, and not for trivial offences either.  The penalties are rather drastic&mdash;too drastic, in fact&mdash;and in this particular instance I think it offers a loop-hole to rather heavily penalise the individual miller.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The power to revoke the licence, if the licensee has been convicted, should be there.  It is quite obvious that that power will not be exercised unless for sufficiently grave reasons.  The shutting down of a flour mill would be a very serious thing for any Minister to contemplate, and he would need to have a good case to do that.  The point made here is merely to get permission to withdraw the licence if the miller has been convicted. It is quite obvious that if it was for some trivial offence, or that there was going to be permanent damage done as a result of the fine, the Minister would hesitate to take such power, but the purport of the section is to give the Minister power to revoke the licence if, in his opinion, the conditions are sufficiently grave to justify such action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the various other parts of this Bill and in the First Schedule to the Bill, the Minister has detailed various maximum penalties but, in reality, here he has gone beyond all that and has a new maximum penalty so far as the miller is concerned.  The amendment that the Minister refuses to have anything to do with allows him, on a second conviction of a person by a court, of the very many things under this Bill that are to be dealt with or which make a miller liable to incur the <Col N="280" /> penalties mentioned under Part I&mdash; that is, the serious offences, as the Minister himself would call them&mdash; to take away that person's licence. He refuses to put that in or to give that particular safeguard in legislation, and again everything has to depend on the wisdom of the Minister; and the only remedies open to a person who thinks himself unfairly treated under this sub-section are that the matter can be questioned here in this House.  That again, I think, is a most undesirable method of ventilating a grievance of that kind.  It means that in order to remedy a matter of that kind the only thing to do is to bring about the defeat of the Executive Council.  It is ludicrous from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Minister's objection, for instance, to limiting the penalties for offences incurred under Part I?  The Minister himself must acknowledge that he has been pretty generous in the way he treated offenders under Part I.  Surely the penalties prescribed in the Bill itself are heavy enough, but it does seem absurd that he should have power to inflict the loss of licence if the court thinks that the normal punishment is the punishment under Part II or Part III of the First Schedule.  Furthermore, the court, from the evidence before it, would be in a position to judge of the merits or demerits of the case.  I think that, if there is any objection to the amendment, it is that it does not give enough power.  The Minister should not have power to give that maximum penalty, namely, the loss of livelihood of the miller, unless the court inflicts the maximum penalty.  Having heard the case, and approaching it in judicial fashion, the court inflicts the maximum penalty under Part I of this Bill. That would seem a reasonable case for the withdrawal of the means of livelihood, but what the objection of the Minister can be to limiting his discretion to offences for which the penalties mentioned in Part I of the Schedule are prescribed, I do not know.  Why he thinks that he must have the power to deprive of a licence those whom even the Bill itself normally would make liable only to the <Col N="281" /> lesser penalties under Part I, Part II and Part III, I fail to see.  In reality, the amendment is much better than the Bill as it stands, even to the ordinary person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I do not think that any useful purpose is to be served by going over again what has been already covered.  This section is taken word for word from a number of similar sections.  The considerations to which the Deputy has adverted were, I am sure, in the minds of the Executive in the past.  The section is designed to give permission for the cancellation of the licence in certain circumstances.  That power would only be exercised in extreme cases, but, nevertheless, it is a power that should be there, and the whole operation of the Bill might easily be negatived if that power were not there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible.  A person might be charged with that offence and yet be deemed to be worthy of a fine of 5/-.  Another person might be found guilty and, under Part II, be liable to six months' imprisonment. That is no criterion by which to judge of the two offences, the nature of which we do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No grounds have previously been covered in relation to this amendment because it is an entirely new amendment.  Any arguments used previously about fraud and misrepresentation were specially directed to that.  This is where we have got away from the Minister's point with regard to who has power. All that he is asked to speak of is, where a man has been convicted &ldquo;twice of offences under this Part of this Act, both of which convictions have resulted <Col N="282" /> in penalties being imposed under Part I of the First Schedule to this Act.&rdquo;  It is an entirely new proposal, and has not been debated before in the House, and no argument can apply to this, other than the arguments used previously under Sections 26 and 27 of this measure.</P>
      <P>Under Section 26 of this measure a man who gets a licence is obliged to mill his quota.  He is, under an amendment put down yesterday, obliged to mill 90 per cent. of the wheat that has been assigned to him under the quota. If he fails for two years or for one year to mill that ninety per cent. he can be charged, and can be convicted under Part III of the First Schedule. The moment that happens he can have his licence taken from him.  The Minister's answer to that is that it is obvious it will not be.  We want to translate &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; into &ldquo;impossible&rdquo;&mdash;that it will not be possible to take the licence from him.  That is all that is aimed at.  I should like to find out from the Minister how he proposes to square the policy set down here with the line of policy which I understand his Party have adopted with regard to endorsements on other licences, and the abolition of a licence on a certain number of endorsements being put on that licence.  I understood that particular type of procedure did not meet with the approval of his Party.  Yet here on one conviction, with the minimum penalties, under the least onerous section of the Schedule, the Minister has it in his power to destroy a man's livelihood.  Surely it is much more serious to give that power to the Minister than to give to a judge the power, when it seems good to him, to record certain things on a publican's licence and to forfeit that licence after a certain number of endorsements.</P>

I think the words &ldquo;if he is satisfied&rdquo; are superfluous and that they should be deleted.

Now, to the Minister himself, without any court intervening, we are giving much greater powers merely because &ldquo;he is satisfied&rdquo; and there is no appeal from that.  It is a sufficient answer of the Minister to anybody that the Minister will act.  He will swear he has investigated it and that he has come to a decision.

I cannot understand the mentality of a Minister of a Fianna Fáil Government who feels that he is bound by precedents created by a Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  If the Minister is making that defence to me, I would respectfully assure him that I am not a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and I do not think he is.  Therefore, he is not in any way bound by the precedents set up by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  Of course, the Minister may have such a high opinion of the prudence that characterised the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration that he is quite content to copy their methods, but I suggest that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should improve on the Cumann na nGaedheal policy when he has an opportunity.  I make the suggestion to him now in this case that he could steer a more prudent course and set up a better precedent than this one now before him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asked us to compare two discretions.  There is, firstly, the discretion which now resides in the Minister under the Bill that he may revoke a milling licence if he is satisfied that such licence is procured by fraud or misrepresentation, or if he is satisfied that the holder of such licence has been convicted of an offence under this Act, or if he is satisfied that there has been any breach of the conditions.  He asks us that that discretion should be compared with the discretion which would still reside in the Minister to revoke the licence but <Col N="286" /> only after a court has decided that the licence was procured by fraud or misrepresentation or after the court had itself convicted and imposed penalties under Part I or after the court had decided that there was a breach of the licence.  The Minister thinks there is no difference in these discretions.  It is the Minister's contention as long as the discretion is still with him it does not matter, although there is a material difference in the conditions precedent to the exercise of the discretion.</P>
      <P>The Minister is very fond of finding precedents.  I have a measure here in which the Minister is given power to revoke a licence granted by him, but he is not allowed to revoke it except in accordance with the section, and the only two things that have any impact upon the licence through the section are (a) an application made to the court, or (b) that the holder of the licence has been convicted of a serious offence under the Act.  That was the Control of Manufactures Act which the Minister passed.  Why not apply it to this?</P>

In one case certain necessary punitive steps had to be taken in order to establish a standard of quality for an exportable product. In this case there is no such thing, and the Minister knows it.  Millers do not generally require any character from anyone here.</P>

      <P>That is the very thing we held they were not.  We held they were able to do their business and to preserve their industry in the country. Apparently the opinion about the efficiency entirely relates to the Ministry, because it is there, amongst them, from one end to the other.  In this case it is obvious that the Minister is called upon to come to a decision, so as to say there has been a breach of the conditions, and secondly that he is qualified by reason of that to annul a licence.  It is all on a par with the usual theoretical business comprehension of Ministers over there.  If there was a single business man amongst the Ministry this proposal would not be in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Again I emphasise that I am not concerned with previous <Col N="288" /> Acts even if the Minister for Industry and Commerce is very much so.  The Leader of the Opposition has shown that the Minister's analogy is false.  The Eggs Act set up a standard of good eggs, as distinct from electioneering eggs.  But the standard of quality in this Bill is conspicuous by its absence. It is the missing link in the Bill.  What he tries to ensure in this Bill is to put excessive penalties on the millers and others&mdash;penalties which nobody could stand behind.  The Minister, in his own person, is the court, and he judges beforehand.  These are things that no one could stand over, and, I think, the Minister might reasonably accept some of the amendments that are being moved.  I think at any rate he might accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney-General referred to the Eggs Act, and said unless there was thoroughgoing evidence that this worked injustice the case against this provision breaks down.  I contend that the provision in the Eggs Act does work injustice.  I want to make it clear&mdash;I do not know how far any persons had their licences withdrawn by the Department of Agriculture&mdash;occasions have repeatedly arisen in which one felt that one had absolutely no defence and could get no protection against the Department of Agriculture's inspectors.  They come down, under the Eggs Act regulations, and state that they require such and such a thing done.  You say you do not think it necessary that it should be done.  They say it is necessary and if you do not comply you commit a breach of the regulations. Therefore you have no protection from the suspension of your licence if the Minister listens to his inspectors. They present a case to the Minister and they tell you the protection that is required.  You have no protection and none of the securities you would have if you fought the case if you were prosecuted.  I had this experience repeatedly.  I know the inspectors of the Department of Agriculture are men representing a very high standard, and are by no means fractious or contentious men, but there was a time when they took one view and I took another.  We differed.  I know they are acting entirely from a sense of their duty.  I do not say that they were unduly fault-finding or vexatious.  They were what the Minister would describe as reasonable inspectors, but I think I am entitled before my licence is taken away to the protection of a court.  If a verdict was there given against me I would not feel the slightest hardship in complying with the regulations under the Act.  I did feel a sense of hardship when I had no appeal against the inspector. Naturally the Minister believes his inspectors, looks upon them as reasonable men with a great variety of experience, and he would say: &ldquo;This complaint is laid by some crank in some <Col N="291" /> back part of Mayo.  The inspectors are reasonable men and that is good enough for me.&rdquo;  But I feel I am entitled to challenge the Minister to prosecute me for a breach of the regulations if he thinks I have committed it, and, then, if the issue is tried before an impartial judge, I am quite prepared to accept the judgment.  But I do not believe that the Minister himself should have power to inflict the penalty which would result in the taking away of my licence.  That is the power that we are now asked to give the Minister and that is a power to which I object.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be well to take all the amendments to this section together.  I want to make a statement concerning this whole matter of subsidies for wheat in port and inland mills.  When we were phrasing the Bill originally, it was intended that we would pay a small subsidy to inland mills for a limited period in order to redress what we considered to be the disadvantages which these mills laboured under as compared with port mills.  That intention was based on the information then available.  Since the Bill was framed I had an opportunity of going into this matter with much greater care and with much greater information than had previously been obtainable.  I have come to the conclusion that, with the possible exception of certain peculiar cases, a subsidy for inland mills is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found it impossible to get from flour millers, as such, any precise statement as to what were the advantages or disadvantages, if any, of inland mills.  I found some inland millers took the line that it would not be possible for them to complete successfully with the port mills without a subsidy, whereas other inland millers took a completely contrary view and, in fact, stated they did not want a subsidy under any circumstances.  They said that they did not consider a subsidy was required to enable them to maintain <Col N="302" /> their position, if certain disadvantages were overcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Did they know about Deputy Norton's amendment which the Minister accepted last night?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that alters the position in the slightest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The millers do not think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Our proposal, therefore, is to amend this part of the Bill so as to make it clear that it will enable a subsidy to be provided if, in particular cases, the conditions would seem to warrant that.  At one time I considered the deletion of this part of the Bill, but on examination it did appear that there might be cases where, because of natural disadvantages, it might be necessary for a period to provide some assistance from the Central Fund to enable mills to be carried on, and flour to be sold at a price comparable with the price at which flour would be sold in other parts of the country.  That decision was easier to arrive at in view of the fact that there might be secured from the Bill certain revenues which would probably be sufficient to offset any subsidies which it might be decided to pay.</P>
      <P>It is possible that in the case of some of the silent mills a subsidy for a short period might be necessary in order to get them reopened.  In particular parts of the country, for example where the existence of a flour mill would be advantageous from the point of view of the cost of living in the district and from the point of view of those engaged in the bakery industry in the district, such a mill could be re-established, despite the fact that natural disadvantages, such as the absence of a port into which vessels of a reasonable size could go, might exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the various amendments which I suggest are embodied in this part of the Bill it will enable subsidies to be paid after the Minister for Finance has made an order and subject to the necessary money being voted by the Oireachtas.  In each case the proposal would have to come before the Dáil and be approved and then money <Col N="303" /> would be provided for the purpose.  I want it to be clearly understood that it is not intended generally to provide subsidies.  There will be no general subsidy for inland mills.  Any subsidy which will be provided for a mill will be limited in amount and strictly limited in point of time.  It is in relation to this statement that I would like these amendments considered.</P>
    <P>In amendment 93 I propose to delete the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;five.&rdquo;  I do not know if there is any substantial difference made by that change, but it is conceivable that a mill may be established within the limit suggested, and the scheme of the Bill is merely to ensure that a subsidy cannot be provided, no matter what the circumstances are, in respect of a mill in Dublin, Cork or Limerick, and by far the greater part of the milling capacity of the country is situated in these three centres.  I am not inclined to press this particular amendment if there is any very strong objection taken to it; but I think it is one which should be carried because the advantages or disadvantages which might exist within ten miles might also exist within eight miles of any of these ports.  Consequently, I think that provision should be made for it.  The other amendments I shall deal with when the time comes.  They are all designed to effect that change in this part of the Bill to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can understand these amendments, they come to this&mdash;that we want to have wheat milled rurally and the distinction we now have under the amendment to 36 (1) is that everything is considered rural except places which are within five miles of the main Post Office in Dublin, Cork or Limerick. Every other place is rural, or inland, for the purpose of this Act.  Is not that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And that is the situation at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation at present is that every part of this country is inland except those parts within five miles of the principal Post Offices of Dublin, Cork or Limerick?  I did not know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me read the definition as it is going to be:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of this Part of this Act, every mill (other than a mill which is situate within five miles from the principal Post Office in the county boroughs of Dublin, Cork or Limerick) shall be an inland mill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what we start off with. Shall we not, in fact, have dropped the distinction between inland mills and port mills when we incorporate the amendment?  Is not the distinction founded on something else&mdash;probably the capacity of the mills within five miles of the principal Post Offices of Dublin, Cork and Limerick?  Why <Col N="305" /> not say so?  We shall have got this section considerably readjusted by amendments and why keep this old idea of the distinction between inland mills and port mills?  We are in the peculiar position that even a mill on the water-edge at Galway, Wexford or Waterford is an inland mill, but a mill which is almost five miles away from the Post Office in Limerick is a port mill.  That is not a very logical distinction and keeping the old phrase seems to me rather to cloud for the future the point of discrimination. What that is has not been explained to us yet.</P>
    <P>I do not want to raise the question of the whole purpose of this section. It was, apparently, to have milling decentralised.  Why should you ask for milling to be decentralised if a mill situate on the water-edge, say, in Limerick, can, nevertheless, in competition, collect wheat milled inland from the hinterland around the port of Limerick, and sell the product more cheaply than the others?  Have we a sort of constituency idea and do we want to have a mill per constituency so that Deputies, other than University Deputies, can go down to their constituencies and tell the people what they did for them with regard to milling?  But what is the point of discrimination?  If it is to be the capacity of the mill, why not determine it here and say that a mill of less than a certain sackage capacity may get a subsidy and mills above that capacity cannot and so drive people to build&mdash;if they are going to build in the future&mdash;mills of the limited and smaller type that will be required if they are to be spread all over the country?  The section was better as it stood in so far as it did allow for some better differentiation as between inland mills and port mills. It would have been difficult, I think, to have got a mill in the county borough of Waterford or in an urban district, town or village situate on the sea determined to be an inland mill. Under the new scheme, those are definitely declared to be inland mills for the purpose of receiving subsidies.  The idea does not commend itself to me but it is in the Bill and I suppose it <Col N="306" /> is going to be pushed through.  I do not know that the amendments, other than the one I referred to&mdash;No. 93&mdash; make any great difference.  I do not think that they improve the measure in the slightest.  I did not gather from the Minister's explanation that any difference is made by the amendments on the point of finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, as it stands, would do but its form pre-supposed a general subsidy for inland mills.  The purpose of the amendment is merely to alter the form.  Certain of my advisers argued that it would be better to leave the section as it stands and not go to the trouble of amending it. In view of previous statements and the form of the Bill on Second Reading, I thought it better that I should make clear that no such supposition was to be drawn from the form of the Bill.  It is definitely intended that only in very rare and extreme cases will subsidies be provided at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is more satisfactory, even though it is only a presumption. On the Minister's statement, the presumption is against subsidies being granted.  As a result of amendment 93, Deputies who are interested in inland mills and who thought that inland mills, under this provision, might get a subsidy as against what we used to hear described as &ldquo;the more favourably situated port mills,&rdquo; must realise that differentiation at the moment is between mills situate at Dublin, Cork or Limerick and all other mills and it is pre-supposed that these &ldquo;all other mills&rdquo; will not get any subsidy whatever.  The presumption is generally in favour of a general rate, so that, if there is any rate struck, all will get it or none will get it.</P>

      <P>I should have no objection to including the Port of Waterford in this but, in fact, there is no milling at Waterford at present and something more than 80 per cent. of the milling capacity is concentrated in the three centres mentioned.  Any subsidy given would be limited to mills of certain maximum capacity or mills situate in a certain area.  It would be exceedingly limited in amount and limited in point of time.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the amendment.  In my opinion, the men engaged in the port mills are receiving a higher wage than the men who would be employed in inland mills.  The amendment would mean that certain benefits would be given to certain mills against the interest of the workers engaged in the port mills.  It will have an effect on the workers because it may possibly reduce the rate of wages paid in the port mills to the rate paid in inland mills.</P>

      <P>We have already inserted in the Bill an amendment moved by Deputy Norton which requires that the rate of wages paid in any mill will be the generally recognised rate for workers doing the same class of work in licensed mills.

I should like to point out to Deputy Everett that I did ask whether the amendment down in Deputy's Norton name allowed for different rates of wages to be paid in different localities, and the only answer I could get was that the arrangements were those which have been made between the trade unions representing the men and the employers, and if these permitted of different rates for different localities, then they were there, but if they did not, then they could not come.  I got no answer, either from the Minister or Deputy Norton, as to whether, in fact, the arrangements referred to did permit of a variation between locality and locality.

I was sorry last night that the Minister jumped at it so quickly before he had the explanation or the information he had later on in the debate.  I think if he waited for a little while he would not have been so anxious to accept it. That is the intention, and Deputy Norton did not deny it.  That is the position at the present moment.  Of course, we may have this up for consideration on the Report Stage, but, as it stands at present, it is a flat rate, and the mill in Deputy Everett's constituency that may be some distance inland, or on the borders of it, will be called upon to pay the same wages as a port mill, and the result will be that the port mill will get all the business because it will be able to do it at a cheaper rate.</P>

I am dealing with mills in County Dublin that may get an unfair advantage over mills at the Port of Dublin by reason of paying low wages.  If I am assured that mills in County Dublin will pay the same rate of wages, then I am prepared to accept the amendment.

      <P>I wanted to raise the point.  Sub-section (2) says that the subsidy shall be paid &ldquo;to the person who was the holder of the milling licence in respect of such mill at the time such wheat was milled or the personal representative or (in the case of a body corporate) the liquidator of such person.&rdquo;  You would not pay to the liquidator unless the body corporate were in liquidation.

    <P>This is one of the points I was querying.  In Section 47, sub-section (2), line 50, the phrase comes in &ldquo;other than Great Britain or Northern Ireland&rdquo; and I want to know what is the meaning of having it put in here.  The whole sub-section has to be taken in the framework of the section.  Sub-section (1) of the sections says &ldquo;subject to the provisions <Col N="323" /> the Minister may refuse to register an applicant if he thinks it is not desirable in the public interest having regard to the number of persons already registered in such register.&rdquo; Then when we come on to the sub-section it says &ldquo;notwithstanding anything in the immediately preceding sub-section the Minister shall not refuse to register an applicant if such applicant is bona fide engaged either as an agent for the importation of flour milled in Great Britain or Northern Ireland or as a direct importer of flour from any country other than Great Britain or Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  Why the limitation?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been acting on the assumption that there is a difference between those who are importing flour directly from Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and those who have been importing flour from other sources and in the allotment of the quotas for imported flour a difference has been made between the two classes. He was anxious to keep this distinction in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the reason for the difference?  For instance, a man must be registered &ldquo;if he can show he is bona fide engaged either as an agent for the importation of flour milled in Great Britain or Northern Ireland&rdquo; and he must get a licence if he can prove he is an importer of flour from any country other than Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  Apparently he is not entitled to his place on the register if he can only prove that he was importing directly from Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  Why?  If he is an agent for British flour, you allow him to register if he is importing from any place other than Great Britain and you will not allow him to register if he has been importing directly from Great Britain.  Why?</P>

Now, we get this period cut down even more when it comes to the registration of premises; where a man is entitled to get his registration you put a very narrow limit of time upon him.

      <P>What is the necessity of rushing this to the point where only one month is allowed.  It is quite clear the register must be made up, <Col N="325" /> and the register with regard to the new applicants can only be made up after the register of those who must get their licences has been made up, because there is the consideration whether it is desirable in the public interest having regard to the number of persons already registered.  You cannot consider the new people until you know about the other persons.  In regard to milling licences, it has been decided, and I think the time is considerably short, but at any rate, three months is going to be given for that, although the Minister told us to-night every 1931 vintage miller of wheat has his application in, and yet three months is given there.  Here, where we have not heard a statement, at any rate, that all these various people, the flour importers, distillers, wheat importers, wheat dealers, maize millers, maize importers and manufacturers of compound feeding stuffs, have all their applications already listed, it is only proposed to give a month after a particular date.

      <P>The Minister is not a miller on this occasion and he is supported by a very brilliant collection of advisers but where a miller is standing alone, frantically trying to earn a living in times of great difficulty, it is wonderful how rapidly a month will pass by.  It is perfectly true, as the Minister says, that if he got two months he might be a day late, or even if he got six months, but what we are asking the Minister to do is to show the miller every consideration consistent with the efficient administration of the Act.</P>

      <P>The Minister must consider this amendment in relation to the Bill as it is at present drawn and not as it is proposed to be amended by a later amendment.  At the moment, the Minister has power to decide, not merely what is in (c), namely, that the registration of the applicant is undesirable in the public interest having regard to the number of persons already registered on such register&mdash;he might have passed a favourable judgment on that and said that it is not undesirable in the public interest to have new entrants into the milling business&mdash; but he can also decide to throw out the application on the ground that the premises are not suitable or that the premises or equipment are not in a state of good repair.  Surely, these are two matters, apart from (c), on which the Minister might, with advantage, consult that committee he is going to set up under some other Act.  I agree that it would be undesirable to consult them with regard to (c), because I think the tendency, under all the provisions of this Bill, is to associate these bodies into rings, and if they are to be asked whether new entrants will be allowed into their ring, clearly they will go against them, but certainly I think they should be consulted on the question as to whether the premises are suitable or the premises and equipment are in good repair.</P>

      <P>We have regulations laid down for registration of premises and they run that certain people &ldquo;must&rdquo; get premises registered and that certain others &ldquo;may&rdquo; get them registered. Then we come to the registration of new premises.  I want to have it that the registration of the new premises shall run exactly on the lines of Section 47.  If a person has been already in business, and has occupied more than one premises he will be registered in respect of one or two premises and will not be limited to a single set of premises.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me point out that sub-section (1) merely states that any person who is registered &ldquo;may&rdquo; apply to be registered in respect of additional premises, and the Minister &ldquo;may,&rdquo; subject to the provisions of this section, register them.  When we look at the provisions of the section they relate only to provisions which may nullify the application, because the next section only talks about refusing to register.  Under the sub-section, a man may apply, and shall, subject to the provisions of the section, be registered, but we come later to a subsequent provision and find it only applies to refusal.  The obligation is carried forward under Section 47.  Is it not clear that there is under Section 47 an obligation on the Minister to register premises if a man had been in the business.  Is there the same obligation to register other premises than the first lot, if a man had been using them in the business previously?  That is what I want to achieve.  I do not think that is in the section.</P>

The first sub-section says that a person may apply, and that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; register, subject to the provisions of the section.

      <P>I move amendment 118:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of sub-section (2), line 57, to add the words &ldquo;but shall not refuse to register an applicant for registration in respect of additional premises in any register kept by him <Col N="333" /> if such additional premises had in fact been used by the applicant for the purposes of his business during any part of the appointed period as defined in the preceding section, or if such additional premises are required by the applicant in substitution for other premises used by the applicant for the purpose of his business during any part of the appointed period so defined, or as a necessary addition to premises previously so used.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My amendment is much on the same lines as the previous one, but I think it makes the point clearer.  I do not think this matter is covered.  The latter part of the amendment would not be covered by anything in the preceding section.  If any miller or person in any other business was to carry on successfully it would be necessary, on occasions, to make additions, or to substitute new buildings for old ones, maybe in a different place.  It is not asking too much of the Minister to take from him the powers of refusal of a licence for additional premises under such circumstances.  I am of the opinion that they are not covered by anything in the section.  They are not covered certainly by anything under Section 48.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I add to what Deputy Bennett said that amendment 118 might be divided into three sections. If Section 48 is so divided it would cover additional premises acquired in substitution for other premises used by the applicant for the purpose of his business during any part of the appointed period defined, or as a necessary addition to premises previously so used.  Let me take the second of those&mdash;substituted premises. This runs in a series of pairs.  Sub-section 6 of 47 is the one which obliges the Minister to register, or rather &ldquo;that he shall not refuse to register an applicant for registration in the register of maize millers in respect of any premises.&rdquo;  That seems to be wide enough, but the limitation occurs in the next phrase: &ldquo;if such applicant was bona fide engaged in the business of milling maize at such premises.&rdquo; Is it not clear enough that the Minister has to give a licence in respect of particular premises used?  Supposing the <Col N="334" /> premises are burned down, does not Deputy Bennett's amendment cover that?</P>
      <P>The other point is that a man may be carrying on a business and the business has outgrown his original intention, and he wants to add to it.  He puts part of his machinery into the new development, but it is part of the same mill.  Is that man bound to get a licence for this addition which he has made to his business?  It is the same business but he wants to get additional machinery to carry on developments in that business.  That position is not covered by the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the points raised by the Deputy as to a man's premises being burned down and his wanting to replace them by another building and also the point of a man carrying on the business of maize milling wanting to add to his business, he is entitled under Section 48 to register additional premises.  That would appear to cover the first part of Deputy Bennett's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the legal advisers at our disposal that Section 48 does give security to the people who want additional premises. If the man wants to get additional premises, he need not show that they are any addition.  He can get them in any case.  That would be covered by the term &ldquo;additional premises&rdquo; and this amendment would only mean adding what is unnecessary.</P>

I am of opinion that the first section in Section 48 does not refer explicitly to Section 47.  The Minister says that it does, but it is doubtful in my mind and in the minds of many members of this House whether that is so.

      <P>This is an amendment merely to change the penalties.  That is to say, that for an offence under this section the defendant shall not be liable to the penalty of imprisonment that is scheduled in Part II of the section, but should be subject to a fine as set out in Part III of the Schedule.

He is dealing with a somewhat different class of people from those he has been dealing with up to the present.  In this particular section he is dealing with the ordinary farmer throughout the country.  The maximum penalty may be imprisonment, and I doubt if the Minister should ask here for imprisonment, because it will undoubtedly be difficult for the ordinary farmer to make the prompt return required under this particular section.  I think owing to the class of people referred to here the plea for the mitigation of the penalty stands on stronger grounds than the previous pleas which we put forward.</P>

Would it not be better to enumerate the different things which the Minister has in mind?  The objection to the word &ldquo;dispositions&rdquo; is that it is too vague.

      <P>In sub-section (2), page 23, lines 56 and 57 to delete the words &ldquo;in the form prescribed by the Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been discussing for a long time this evening difficulties with regard to the keeping of registers, the situation of offices and other matters. To add to the difficulties of the millers they are now asked not only to keep records but to keep them on certain forms.  We all know that departmental and Government forms are rather difficult to keep.  One could easily make a little mistake and that might render one liable to <Col N="346" /> be imprisoned by the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The millers may be relied on to keep their records in a very good way and in a manner that will satisfy the Minister.  The amendment asks for the deletion of the words set out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty about this is that one would require to have some knowledge of accountancy in relation to the business of millers to appreciate the significance of this amendment.  If the Deputy who moved the amendment got an assurance that whatever forms were prescribed would conform, as nearly as possible, to those the millers have been accustomed to keep it might satisfy him.  Any alteration in the manner in which the information must be kept would be a matter of much concern to the millers.  There are various Government forms which prescribe different methods for the making up of accounts and so on. These are objectionable to business people who have their own methods of keeping their accounts, the methods to which they have been accustomed for years.  I take it the fear behind the amendment is that a whole new series of forms will be prescribed with which the millers will not be familiar.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy O'Neill I move amendment 135:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (2) (e), page 24, to delete all after the word &ldquo;stuffs,&rdquo; line 12, to the end of the paragraph and substitute the following:&mdash;&ldquo;such records of the quantities of all raw <Col N="347" /> materials brought on to the premises for the manufacture of compound feeding stuffs, of the quantities of all compound feeding stuffs manufactured on such premises, and of all disposals of such feeding stuffs as may be required for the purpose of supervising and enforcing the provisions of a licence granted under Part VI of this Act: provided that nothing hereby required shall be construed as obliging the production of any information relating to or disclosing the composition of any special mixture or any secret process used by the person registered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to protect the secret processes and prescriptions which may be of great value to the owners of mills.  These prescriptions relate principally to compound feeding stuffs.  Some millers, I understand, have paid considerable sums of money for these secret processes, and naturally will not want to make the secrets available to inspectors of the Department when they visit their mills.  The amendment seeks to ensure that the millowners will be safeguarded to the extent at all events that no inspector, acting under the authority of the Minister, will have the right to ask for these secret processes and prescriptions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is just as well that I should make it clear now that inspectors will have the right to inquire into such matters.  Otherwise we could not carry out the clause about compound feeding stuffs.  We want to see that the compound feeding stuffs turned out will be good in every way as feeding stuffs and also fair value for the money paid for them.  We could not do that unless we had this power.  Apart from that we will need to be able to trace the maize and other cereals through their different stages in the mill.  We will require to have power to trace where these go to.  In addition we may have to examine the books of the miller to see in what mixtures they went.  Of course these officials will be bound by the Official Secrets Act, and that should be sufficient <Col N="348" /> protection for the manufacturer. I do not think myself that there is much in those secrets.</P>

      <P>Surely that is a matter for the people who have the secrets to produce these peculiar proprietary stuffs.

      <P>So far as these proprietary feeding stuffs are concerned, the Minister may have his views as to their value as feeding stuffs <Col N="349" /> in his capacity as Minister for Agriculture, but I suggest that the only persons who can have views of their commercial value are the public or the owners of those particular secrets.  It would be a very serious thing if this Bill could be used so that these secrets could be made known to quite a number of people.  I do not know what the rank of the inspectors to be appointed will be or what their salaries will be. These are matters that now become important if the inspectors are to be in a position to inquire into and to have full knowledge of these things. Certainly the position, rank and salary of the inspectors will then become a matter of importance.  Could the Minister give us any idea as to the type of man he has in mind for the position of inspector dealing with this?</P>

      <P>At the present time we have power to take a sample of feeding stuff, analyse it and get the amount of carbohydrates and proteins which it contains.  I think as far as that goes if it proves satisfactory and if it is found that the price is not exorbitant we would not go any further into an inquiry, but if we felt that it was a case of a real fraud we would be entitled to go into it and find out if it was a fraud.  Some few years ago the Department of Agriculture knew that there was a compound feeding stuff sold in this country for about eight times its real value.  They exposed that, but all they could do was to publish the matter.  They could not go any further.  It was not very effective. We want to be effective, and to get the real contents of that stuff.  Then we can warn the manufacturer that he cannot continue it, and if he does so we can refuse to give the licence.</P>

      <P>These are two different methods of getting information. If you get information by analysis you can utilise this information in the same way as a person in the revenue service could get information about clients in a bank, but the information in the two cases would be different.  The information you get by analysis is one thing, but the information by this backdoor method is another thing if you utilise it for another <Col N="350" /> purpose altogether.  It may not be the mere question of the actual proportion of the contents of the compound, but the actual way in which the process is carried out.  You are using the information given in the Bill and not merely utilising it yourself, but the secret is no longer a secret of the owner.  The secret is given to an official and we do not really know what his position is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is really a further attempt to restrain the inquisitorial powers of the Minister and his officials.  The section reads ... &ldquo;and it shall be the duty of the person liable under this section to keep such record to produce for the inspection of such inspector on demand such record and also all invoices, consignment notes, receipts and other documents ... reasonably demanded by such inspector for the purpose of verifying any entry in or explaining any omission from such record.&rdquo;  Now the verification of an entry might assume considerable proportions if free scope were given to the Minister and his officials.  It may be that the official would insist on inquiring into the actual profits earned by the owner of the firm concerned; into the actual working costs of the concern and many other matters of a purely private nature which it appears to the owner are of no use and of no advantage to the official in the carrying out of his duties.  But on account of the way in which the section is worded there is no doubt that under the Bill the Minister is given very wide authority and naturally the section has caused a great deal of uneasiness in the minds of millers because they do not know if this Bill is passed into law what sort of information the official may ask or demand.  It appears that the section as worded gives the official a right to demand the actual working costs, the rate of wages paid to the men working on the premises and so on.  It seems to me that that is an entirely unreasonable position and I hope the Minister will take some steps to amend the section so as to make it quite clear that when his officials do visit mills of that kind carrying on this business that they will be restricted to the information necessary for them.</P>

      <P>This point was argued before on another question and I demonstrated on that occasion that it would not be possible to confine the <Col N="353" /> section as the Deputy suggests.  It is clear that the inspector would not have the power that the Deputy says he would have.  The inspector is only entitled to &ldquo;demand invoices consignment notes and so on for the purpose of verifying any entry in or explaining any omission from such record.&rdquo; If the owner of the premises felt that the inspector was exceeding his rights and was demanding some document that he could not reasonably require for the purpose of carrying on his duties, then he could reasonably refuse to give him the documents, and he has a good defence if he could establish that the document could not be reasonably required for the purpose of verifying the record.  We must assume that the inspectors will be reasonable people, and that if they are not reasonable people the Minister will remove them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. Wolfe Mr. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Minister said a short time ago I think it would meet his wishes if the words &ldquo;wilfully or negligently&rdquo; were inserted before the word &ldquo;fails&rdquo; in the appropriate places in this sub-section. I believe that would remove the anomaly of finding a man guilty of an offence and sending him to prison for six months while all the time he would be absolutely innocent of moral guilt.  Take the case of a director going away.  Before he leaves he takes every precaution to have the necessary forms filled.  When he comes back he finds that he has earned for himself an additional leave of absence of six months at <Col N="356" /> the public expense although he would be entirely innocent of any crime. Take the man who always keeps his own records and who becomes ill. When he recovers he finds that he has secured a cheap rest for six months although he is absolutely innocent of criminal intent.</P>
      <P>I agree that the section must be stringent, but I think it is going a little bit too far to have it so drawn that a man may, without his knowledge or consent, commit a criminal offence.  The probabilities are that he might have done everything possible to avoid that.  I wonder what would the Minister say if he found a similar section inserted in the Constitution (Amendment) Act?  I am sure there would be a good deal of trouble about it.  I think it is a mistake to strain the law.  There is a well-known principle that a man ought not to be found guilty of an offence of which he is, at all events, morally innocent.  If, as I suggest, the Minister inserts before the word &ldquo;fails&rdquo; in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) the words &ldquo;wilfully or negligently&rdquo; I think it will meet the case.</P>
      <P>Amendment 146 is in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4), line 51, to insert after the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; the words &ldquo;unless such failure, or such false or misleading entry is due to a strike, to a lock-out, or to any circumstance outside the control of such persons.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the same idea, but it strengthens and explains what I have said in respect of amendment 144.  I suggest to the Minister that he might safely accept the suggestion I made in amendment 146. Somebody might raid the premises and take away the records.  One can easily imagine dozens of instances where a man, without any negligence, might be in such a position that he would fail to produce the documents required by the inspector.  To make that man liable to imprisonment would be straining the criminal law to breaking point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that if the Minister would put into Section 55 a clause similar to that in amendment No. 50 it would meet the case.  It would be well that the same idea should not be expressed in two different forms of words.  That would completely cover it.  If you put the same tag on to Section 55 that you have put on to Section 26, it would meet that portion of the case.  But I would still press for the insertion of the words &ldquo;wilfully or negligently.&rdquo;&ldquo;Wilfully&rdquo; alone might raise difficulties, judging by what the Minister for Agriculture said in connection with another section. &ldquo;Wilfully&rdquo; alone might not be strong enough here, because negligence might not be wilful, and it is quite right that a man who is guilty of negligence should be held to be guilty of an offence under this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. Wolfe Mr. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister is taking me up correctly. If what the Minister states were so, I should agree with the Minister. Though the burden of proof in criminal cases is cast on the prosecutor, all the prosecutor would have to prove in this case would be that the accounts were not, in fact, kept.  Once that were done, it would be for the defendant to rebut the presumption of wilfulness and to show that the omission was <Col N="358" /> not, in fact, wilful.  In practice, the onus would be entirely on the defendant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that it is essential for the proper carrying out of the Bill that these records should be kept.  There must be a definite onus on the licence holder to keep the records. It is not a matter about which he can be careless.  He is liable to severe penalties if he fails to keep the records.  If he is prosecuted for failing to keep them or for failing to produce them when required by the inspector, he can plead, in mitigation of his offence, that his action was not done wilfully or that it was occasioned by causes outside his control.  No doubt, the court will take that into account.  It is essential that he should keep the records.  In the case of (d), which deals with the deliberate falsifying of records or the putting in of a misleading entry in order to defraud the revenue or to defeat the purposes of the Bill in some way, the onus should, undoubtedly, be on the prosecution to show that it was done wilfully.  But in the other case, the mere failure to keep records for any cause should be an offence, even though the court might say that the circumstances were such that no penalty should be inflicted. It is the duty of the person who gets a licence and who is responsible for keeping records to secure that staff shall be provided or other arrangements made to prevent any mishap arising which would mean that the records would not be available for inspection, if required.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I have not made myself clear.  I quite agree with what the Minister has said, but everything he has said will apply equally well if the words &ldquo;wilfully or negligently&rdquo; are placed where I suggest they should be placed.  I ask the Minister to consider that because, at present, the section creates a very dangerous precedent.  If the Minister will consider the matter, he will find that the view he has expressed will not be in any way affected by inserting those words.  On proof being given of the omission, the defendant will have to show (1) that he did not <Col N="359" /> do it wilfully and (2) that he did not do it negligently.  For instance, it might be said that he had completely forgotten it.  That would not be wilful but it would be negligent.  If the Minister decides to put in those words, he will find that they will not interfere with the view he has expressed, with which I am in agreement, as to the desirability of having ample power in the section for compelling the miller to keep these records.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the insertion of the words would have the effect I mentioned and would create considerable difficulties in the operation of the Bill.  I am prepared to have the significance of the insertion of the words examined, but if it would have the effect of making more difficult the punishment of people who fail to keep records, it will have to be turned down.</P>

      <P>The amendment I suggest would eliminate carelessness, because carelessness or forgetfulness would not be wilful, but would come under &ldquo;negligence.&rdquo;  In lieu of amendment 146, the tag to Section 30 should, I think, be added to this also. It reads better than the amendment I have drafted and would be in conformity with the wording in another part of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am not going to intervene in the legal aspect of the case, as to where the onus of proof lies.  I was, however, under the impression, as an ordinary layman, that murder must be wilful but that when the killing of the man is proven, the burden is not on the State to prove wilfulness but on the prisoner to prove that it was not wilful.  I suggest that that is an analogous case to the case with which Deputy Wolfe has been dealing.  Though, to constitute the crime of murder, there must be wilfulness and malice, if the killing has been brought home to the prisoner, the onus rests on him to establish that there was no wilfulness or malice.  That is precisely the point that Deputy Wolfe was arguing.</P>

      <P>There is also the point that this must be done within twenty-four hours.  In the twenty-fifth hour a man is liable to prosecution if it is not done.  The question of staff arrangements arises, and it is quite possible that a clerical staff would be kept only on certain days of the week. The writing up of a register or journal or any of those books ordinarily kept would not constitute a defence, because the records must be kept in a form prescribed by the Minister.  It seems unreasonable to prosecute a man for not having this done in twenty-four hours.</P>

    <P>(2)  Prima facie evidence of any entry in any register may be given in any Court or any legal proceeding by the production of a copy of such entry purporting to be certified to be a true copy by any officer of the appropriate Minister authorised in that behalf, and it shall not be necessary to prove the signature of such officer or that he was in fact such officer or was in fact so authorised.</P>
    <P>(3)  A certificate, purporting to be under the hand of an officer of the appropriate Minister authorised in that behalf by that Minister, that any person specified in such certificate is not entered in any specified registers kept by that Minister shall be conclusive evidence of the matters so certified, and it shall not be necessary to prove the signature of such officer, or that he was in fact such officer, or was in fact so authorised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. Wolfe Mr. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to your approval, sir, these amendments might be conveniently taken together because the same idea runs through them.  In sub-section (2) a peculiar provision is brought in which I agree is not entirely without precedent.  There is, I think, one precedent where the same course was adopted in what was looked upon as emergency legislation during the Great War (sub-section read).  There is a rather dangerous precedent for that sub-section which, I suggest should not be followed and that the words &ldquo;purporting to be&rdquo; in line 23 should be deleted. I am also suggesting that in line 24 and the following lines the words &ldquo;by an officer&rdquo; should be deleted and &rdquo; under the seal of the appropriate Minister&rdquo; should be substituted; and that all words after the words &ldquo;appropriate Minister&rdquo; should be deleted.  These are the three alterations I suggest.  I do not know whether reliance will be placed on the precedent, which is the only one I know of, and which is one that I think ought not to be followed, having regard to the exceptional circumstances in which it was adopted. Personally I think it is very drastic.  If <Col N="363" /> any one is prosecuting on behalf of the Minister all he has to do is to write out the necessary certificate on a piece of paper, sign it with any name he likes and hand it in, and it is evidence. I suggest that instead of that the old procedure, which existed before the Great War, and which is followed in another portion of this Bill, should be followed here.  It is in Section 28 (2) of this Bill and it follows the procedure of the Land Commission Court, and the procedure of all courts, so far as I know, prior to this unusual and emergency legislation.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In any proceedings by the Minister under this section to recover any sum from the holder of a milling licence the production of a certificate under the seal of the Minister certifying that such sum is due by such person shall be prima facie evidence of the facts so certified.</P>
      <P>I suggest that there is no reason why in this Section 56 the procedure adopted in Section 28 should not be followed.  I suggest that it is inconsistent, and that to have in Section 28 one method and one procedure and have that reversed as regards a somewhat similar undertaking in Section 56 would be wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again in sub-section (3) there is an extraordinary provision which is contrary, I think, to all precedent (sub-section read).  The certificate produced might be absolutely false and the man prosecuted might have absolute evidence that it was false, but whether he was registered or not it would be said that the man had no right to make a defence although he had one, because the certificate was evidence.  I never heard of such a thing before.  Section 28 as drawn, was obviously taken from the Land Commission precedent which is a fairer one.  I suggest as regards sub-section (3) to delete the word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;prima facie.&rdquo;  To have it otherwise would be absolutely unconstitutional and there could be no answer to it, I submit.  In Section 28 the position is that it is under the seal of the Minister. It is there and it remains there as <Col N="364" /> prima facie evidence and can only be dislodged by counter evidence, which cannot be given only in a very few cases.  Even Ministerial books are sometimes wrong and Ministerial records sometimes get lost.  In some Land Commission cases I have known the records to be wrong through no fault of the Land Commission officials. That might also be the case with the Minister's records, through no fault of his officials.  This is very drastic, more drastic than any legislation that has ever come before the House.  It is not a good precedent and is not one that should be followed.  I suggest to the Minister that in this section he should adopt the procedure which he has adopted in Section 28.  It will be doing the right and the wise thing and will really do no harm to the prosecution and will do no harm to the Department.  With regard to the other amendments, they deal with Section 34.  I have dealt with the first six&mdash; 162 to 167 inclusive.</P>

Why ought the register to be open for inspection?  Why ought a person to be allowed to inspect it?  I say you cannot have busybodies running around and inspecting the register and the only purpose that is legitimate is that a man would want to know is he entitled to deal with a certain person.

Is a maize importer, under the Deputy's suggestion, to write up to the Minister every time he gets an order and say: &ldquo;Is this man on your register or not?&rdquo;  It would be much more convenient for him to walk in and <Col N="369" /> look at the register and get the whole list.  In the same way with wheat dealers, and wheat importers, they can only deal with certain people.</P>

      <P>Yes, because they have not by any means the same reference. Amendment 160 refers to the Minister publishing in such manner as he may think fit certain matters entered in the register.  Then we come on to sub-section (3).</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The appropriate Minister may from time to time collect and publish such statistical information (including statistics derived from returns made to him pursuant to this Part of this Act) with respect to the extent of the businesses carried on by persons registered in any register kept by him as he may think fit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Whatever is to be said for letting the minor matters of the manner in which these things are to be published be as the Minister thinks fit, surely there is a great point here&mdash;the collection of statistical material.  If it were clear that this is governed by the secrecy which is imposed under the Statistical Act itself, then of course a certain amount of the anxiety would be cleared away, but I rather take it, that this is outside the Statistics Act, and that there is not the same secrecy imposed, and that the Minister might, therefore, err in his judgment and publish matters which would give away the extent of an individual's business&mdash;an event which of course we always guard against in the promulgation of any information so derived.</P>

      <P>Is there any answer to them except tradition? We might as well debate them, if they are not going to be replied to.  At the moment, the proposal is that the Minister may alter any registration and any register in any respect in which such registration appears to him to be erroneous and misleading.  Deputy Bennett moves to change that and to prescribe that the Minister may alter it where there is agreement, after notice given to the person registered, that the entry is in fact erroneous and misleading.  Why object to that?  If it is a matter of fact that can be shown to the person, surely he will be as anxious as the Minister to get a correct entry made?  Why not have it done with his approval?  That is all that Deputy Bennett sets out to have.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3) (a), line 65, to delete the words &ldquo;whether fraudulent or innocent&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I respectfully suggest to the House that the provision in this section is one which is absolutely without precedent, and that it is an innovation to put into a statute a declaration that &ldquo;registration was procured through fraud or by misrepresentation whether fraudulent or innocent.&rdquo; I submit that if a man <Col N="381" /> makes an estimate as to the height of a house, or as to its width, and if he makes a mistake, that would be an instance of misrepresentation, and in that case the Minister might cancel his registration.  Such a provision is entirely without precedent and in the best interests of the State should not be allowed to stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, it is not without precedent, as we can refer to a decision in this case also.  The fact is that this provision has been adopted word for word from the provisions of Acts passed by this House. I believe the sub-section is there in order to ensure the accuracy of the records.  If, in fact, registration was secured by fraud or misrepresentation, whether such misrepresentation was fraudulent or innocent, the Minister should have power to revoke the registration. That is all that is implied.</P>

If the phrase is going to be kept it is better to have it drafted so as to be clear as to the meaning.  How could you have an innocent fraud?  If it is only to apply to misdemeanour or misrepresentation, is there any equity at all in taking power to cancel a registration, where the Minister is satisfied that the misrepresentation has been innocent?</P>

      <P>As no evidence is given, well and good, we will take it that way.  What were the circumstances of the Eggs Act?  Was the licence or the registration of the premises to be withdrawn?  Were they the only premises a man had?  Was it with regard to the export business in eggs or what?  When we know these things we will know what the circumstances are.  We will know further whether this particular phrase had the approval of the representatives of the industry.  Then we will understand if there is equation, and the claim why it is there.  It should not be there, if it is there under circumstances at all comparable to this, because a man's livelihood, and the premises he has got registered, may be broken on the definite statement of the Minister, that there has been innocent misrepresentation. That is beyond the bounds of all justice, and no check by the Government is going to have the slightest effect.  That is not justice in this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The witnesses will be before the court, and the District Justice, or the Circuit Judge on appeal, will have an opportunity of judging on the facts, the guilt or the innocence of the defendant I think it would not be unreasonable <Col N="384" /> to give the Justice power to make a recommendation.  He has the sworn testimony and hears both sides, and all that can be urged on behalf of the appeal, so that a man will have a fair trial.  If that is not done, and if a man is tried in Dublin behind his back he will not be satisfied.  He cannot be blamed for that.  I think the first amendment might be usefully accepted. As to amendment 178 I think the wording there provides an alternative.  As a safety valve I suggest inserting the words in amendment 179.  It would be manifestly unfair for a man who gets the right of appeal under Section 18 of the Courts of Justice Act, on the one hand, to have it taken away on the other hand, if pending the hearing of the appeal he loses his licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the same.  This is a matter which has been argued before with regard to the licence for flour millers, I think.  It was pointed out by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the Minister had power to alter, or cancel, registration in case the Minister is satisfied of certain things, amongst them that the registered person has been convicted of an offence under this Act.  Deputy Wolfe wants us to give power to the court to decide whether it should be removed or not.  The second amendment is similar and the third amendments asks us to hold off for an appeal in case there should be one.  I do not think that the court would be the best tribunal to decide whether the person should be removed from the register or not, because that would be a matter for the Department concerned. Whether there was a considerable amount of laxity on the part of the person, or whether the offence was a serious one as far as the carrying out of the Act was concerned would be a matter for the Department, and I submit that a Judge would not be in the position to judge whether that person <Col N="385" /> should be removed from the register. He would not be as well qualified to give an opinion on that matter as the officials working the Act.  Therefore, I think that the Minister should have complete power to remove a person from the register or to cancel his registration or take whatever other action would seem to him fit and proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to say that a person should be convicted twice, because as it stands the effect would be that the Minister should have power to remove a person off the register because of trivial offences.  I think that amendment 177 would provide for that contingency better by adding the words &ldquo;on an appeal.&rdquo;  I think that that would meet the case, and I suggest that the Minister should accept Deputy Wolfe's amendment 179.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. Wolfe Mr. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>That would mean accepting amendment 177 with it.  I would say that amendments 177 and 178 are alternatives.  I think it is wrong to suggest, as has been suggested here, that an official of the Department is a better judge of the circumstances than the district justice who has heard all that has been said and has taken the testimony on oath of the accused and the other persons concerned.  I suggest that it is a tall proposition to state that a clerk in a Dublin office is better able to decide the question than a district justice, or that a district justice would not be as competent or would be more likely to be swayed by certain circumstances.  I, for one, will not believe that of any district justice. They are a very competent tribunal, and I think it is better for all of us, who wish that the law should not only be observed but that the people should have confidence in it, that such matters should be left for the district justices. I would respectfully press this amendment and ask the Minister to give the district justice the power of cancellation and not let the matter go without trial, because that is what it will mean for the man who is charged and who will not get proper facilities for defending himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not done without trial under that particular clause. <Col N="386" /> Under that clause it says that the man &ldquo;has been convicted of an offence.&rdquo; That means that the case has been tried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. Wolfe Mr. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but that might mean that he had been found guilty of some trivial offence and fined, perhaps, sixpence.  Surely, the district justice is the better judge of the truth or falsehood of the testimony? He has the opportunity of seeing the witnesses examined and hearing their testimony, and he is in a much better position to judge all the facts of the case than any official of the Department. If the Minister adopts the amendments, this work will be taken off the officials of the Department and that could be brought about by the adoption of amendments 177, 178 and 179.  I would, therefore, press for these amendments.</P>

      <P>The other people may prosecute.  At least we will have to assume that they can until we get a definite statement that they cannot until we get some clarification of the position.  The Minister has made the point that there has to be a conviction.  Deputy Wolfe has pointed out that any offence under the Act may have been marked by the particular district justice who tried it as a slight offence by the fact that he imposes a very slight penalty indeed.  Nevertheless powers are given to the Minister to withdraw, alter or cancel registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me refer again to the Control of Manufactures Act, Section 10 of which states the conditions under which a new manufacture licence can be revoked. I think it will be recognised <Col N="388" /> that a new manufacture licence is a licence given to people who up to, or prior to, a certain date have not been living in this country.  Definitely a new manufacture licence under the Control of Manufactures Act will be in the hands of foreigners, non-nationals of this country.  With regard to non-nationals in this country who have entered on a new manufacturing process after 1932, the Minister may on the application of the holder revoke. The Minister without such application may revoke if the holder of such licence &mdash;here is the phrase&mdash;&ldquo;has been convicted of a serious offence under any section of this Act.&rdquo;  The third sub-section winds up by saying &ldquo;shall not revoke or alter a new manufacture licence save under and in accordance with this section.&rdquo;  That is what we laid down in regard to, as I say, foreigners coming in to manufacture in this country for the first time after this Bill became an Act.  Outside revocation on application made, there is only power given to revoke or alter if the holder has been convicted of a serious offence under the Act.  Here we have &ldquo;convicted of an offence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us look at some of the offences. Section 53 ordains that the Minister for Agriculture may make regulations in regard to any of the returns to be made to him by registered wheat importers, registered maize millers, registered maize importers and registered manufacturers of compound feeding stuffs, the time at which such returns are to be made and the forms in which such returns are to be made.  Then it goes on to say that:</P>
    <P>Every person required by regulations made under this section to make any returns who fails or refuses to make such returns, in accordance in all respects with such regulations, shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to the penalties mentioned in Part II of the First Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>We have it now that that is an offence that would be absolutely put out of consideration if the phrase used in this were a phrase corresponding to that used in the Control of Manufactures <Col N="389" /> Act&mdash;&ldquo;convicted of a serious offence.&rdquo; It would be in very exceptional circumstances that any court would hold, I think, that failure to make returns up to a certain time or in a certain form would be a serious offence.  Consequently it would not be possible to have registration cancelled or altered because of a breach of the Act arising under sub-section (3) of Section 53.  It is possible here.  It is undoubtedly somewhat better than the phrase under this sub-section (a) because it is only the Minister's satisfaction that operates under sub-section (a)&mdash;the Minister's satisfaction with regard to such things as fraud or misrepresentation.  Here we have it down that there has to be a conviction but it may be a slight conviction.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I feel that right through the Bill the sections and the different parts were drawn up without there being any proper relationship between the parts.  A section that, in what we might call its framework, compared with this was Section 32.  Section 32 has the phrase &ldquo;he is satisfied&rdquo; as the governing phrase only with regard to fraud or misrepresentation but that phrase does not govern the phrase comparable with the one we are discussing&mdash;that the holder has been convicted of an offence under the Act.  In this, the phrase &ldquo;he is satisfied&rdquo; has to govern everything.  Is that deliberate?  In other words, are we going, in regard to cancelling or altering the registration, to have the mind of the Minister operating on the point as to whether or not there has been a conviction?  There is something to be explained in the peculiar position of the words.</P>
    <P>I wonder is the Minister following the point I am making.  In Section 32, sub-section (2), the phrase is clear and distinct &ldquo;if the holder of such licence has been convicted.&rdquo;  The phrase &ldquo;he is satisfied&rdquo; does not come in.  That is, in this, the phrase &ldquo;he is satisfied&rdquo;<Col N="390" /> is not applicable to the separate paragraphs but governs the whole lot of them.  Has it any meaning more than what was intended to be given under Section 32?  Unless it is a sort of mistake in the drafting&mdash;the fact that the point has not been appreciated and is going to be cleared up&mdash;it looks as if there is deliberation about this and the deliberation can only have the result of bringing in the mind of the Minister to operate on that very point&mdash;as to whether or not there is a conviction. What I mean can possibly be better understood if I put it this way, that previously under the circumstances to which Section 32 referred, the revocation of a milling licence, unless a court was satisfied that there was a conviction there would not be an offence and a conviction could only be proved by the production of the court order.  In this it is for the Minister to say &ldquo;I am satisfied there is a conviction.&rdquo;  Again I ask the Minister to say whether there is any deliberateness in that and whether he is satisfied that the phrase is applicable only as it is in Section 32 to fraud or misrepresentation.  Would the Minister answer that point?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that heavy expenditure has been incurred in the preparation of a number of drainage schemes in Westmeath, and if he will state what is the present position regarding them, and if he will consider allocating grants from funds at his disposal to enable those very necessary reproductive works to be carried out.</P>

      <P>A sum of about £1,000 has been spent on <Col N="208" /> the investigation of the petitions under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, received by the Commissioners of Public Works from Co. Westmeath.</P>
      <P>I have to refer the Deputy to a reply given to him on the 24th June, 1931, which showed that no scheme was proceeding in Co. Westmeath mainly because the occupiers of affected land and the County Council refused to cooperate in the proposals submitted to them.  The position is unchanged since then but I am sending the Deputy a statement showing the present position regarding each petition received.</P>
      <P>The Government has already offered free grants in aid of feasible schemes in the County but the occupiers and County Council have so far declined to agree to the necessary contribution to render the schemes economic.</P>
