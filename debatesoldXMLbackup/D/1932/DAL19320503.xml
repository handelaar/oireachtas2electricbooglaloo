      <P>asked the President if he is yet in a position to make an announcement as to the present policy of the Government in relation to the proposal to de-rate agricultural land out of the proceeds of the retained land annuities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The land annuities are at present, as the Deputy is aware, the subject of correspondence with the British Government.  It is, therefore, obviously undesirable at the moment to make any announcement in their regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the President's reply, and, in view of the promises made at the recent election by the President's Party, would he not consider that the time is now ripe for making an announcement as to what his policy is in regard to de-rating, which is the most pressing point in the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy must be satisfied with the answer I have given.  It is quite obvious that the question of de-rating hangs on this matter of the land annuities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the President tell us what is his position on this matter? Is he in a position to give an assurance that no proceedings will be taken against land annuitants in respect of annuities that fall due on the 1st June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand how that matter arises.  It has been made quite clear on all occasions that our policy is that the land annuities will have to be paid to the State as before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the President see the relationship between the position of the tenant who has to pay his land annuities on the 1st June and who has been told that he would not have to pay his rates after the 1st June?  The present position is that he has to pay both.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state what additional cost to the State, if any, is involved in the appointment of a Consul and Commercial Attaché in Paris, and whether the previously existing staff of the Irish Legation in Paris had been found inadequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (The President) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional cost to the State involved in this appointment is approximately £1,000 per annum.  The existing staff of the Legation consists of the Minister, the Secretary of the Legation, a clerk and two typists.  It has been found that the diplomatic and consular functions of the Legation occupy so much of the time of these officers that they have been unable to deal adequately with the commercial side of the work.  It is intended that the Commercial Attaché will shortly extend his functions so as to deal with our trade relations with Holland and Belgium.  The Minister in Paris will be accredited to the Belgian Government at a later date.  It is my intention to develop the trade side of all our foreign establishments.  That policy cannot be fulfilled without the appointment of officers, such as Mr. Kerney, with definite commercial experience.</P>

Some 2,800 congested districts holdings remain to be listed and will be dealt with as soon as difficulties in regard to them have been settled.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he is aware that Martin Connolly, Killimoran, Gort, Co. Galway (Folio No. 25873), paid an annuity of £5 13s. 8d. prior to vesting on 31st July, 1931; and if he is further aware that said annuity was raised to £8 1s. 6d. despite the fact that the old rent payable to the landlord was £7 13s. 3d., and if he will <Col N="1121" /> state on what grounds the annuity has been so raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>By judicial order of 24th June, 1885, the rent of Martin Connolly's holding on the estate of F.W. Lynch, Co. Galway, was fixed at £12 and on the passing of the Land Act, 1923, the holding was returned as subject to this rent.  A motion on notice on behalf of the Receiver over the estate for a direction as to the basis on which compounded arrears of rent and payment in lieu of rent were to be assessed was listed for hearing on the 15th July, 1924, when the Court decided that the abated rent of £7 11s. 6d. which the tenant had been paying was the basis on which to calculate compounded arrears of rent and payment in lieu of rent and that the judicial rent of £12 was the basis for calculation of standard purchase annuity.  Payment in lieu of rent was accordingly collected at £5 13s. 8d., i.e., 75 per cent. of £7 11s. 6d.</P>
      <P>As provided by Part I of the First Schedule to the Land Act, 1923, the standard purchase annuity from the date of vesting is £7 16s. 0d., i.e., 65 per cent. of the judicial rent of £12. At the date of vesting one year's compounded arrears of rent (£5 13s. 7d.) was outstanding, and this sum was, as provided by Section 2 of the Land Act, 1927, added to the purchase money of the holding, thereby increasing the standard purchase annuity to £8 1s. 6d.</P>

I might remind the Minister that the existing position gives rise to a great deal of annoyance and trouble and reacts very unfavourably on the trade of Dundalk and also on many towns in Co.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment may recall to Deputies the debate which took place in the Dáil on the adoption of the Constitution, when an amendment was put forward to the same effect and was rejected.  We are not putting forward this amendment, because we desire to do what is proposed in the amendment, but the principle of the Bill having been accepted, and the contention of the Government being that what they propose to do is not a contravention of the Treaty, we propose that the words of the Treaty stand in the Constitution.  If the contention of the President is correct, or can be shown to be correct, that in existing circumstances it is not obligatory by reason of anything in the Constitution that a Deputy should take the Oath, then the Government has gained its object and for all practical purposes the Oath is removed.  If, on the other hand, the Oath remains obligatory on Deputies, even if there are no words in the Constitution but the words of the Treaty, then the object we have in view, that there should be no breach of the Treaty, is secured.  I think the House should give very serious consideration to the idea behind this amendment.  It is, perhaps, true that we do not want to have our courts <Col N="1129" /> here giving a one-sided interpretation of the Treaty.  On the other hand, I think it is very desirable that the opportunity should still be given for discussion as to whether or not this particular Oath is obligatory.  I think there are very few Deputies who will dispute that at one time this Oath was obligatory.  I think there will be few to dispute that at one time if particular words of the Treaty had been simply inserted in the Constitution everybody would have regarded the Oath as obligatory.  Whether it is or is not now obligatory really depends&mdash;taking the view put forward by the Government&mdash;on whether or not the growth that has taken place in status has made a change.</P>
    <P>There are great and sound reasons why no violent dispute should be allowed to arise with the other parties to the Treaty in regard to this matter. If Deputies want to get rid of the obligation to take the oath they should be satisfied to get rid of it, and they should not insist on getting rid of it in a way that is likely to cause friction. I think it is necessary in the national interests that whatever is to be done in this respect should be done in an amicable way.  Assuming that Deputies are determined to get rid of this Oath at once, but, as they have indicated, have not made up their minds to scrap the Treaty, then they ought to leave the way open for further negotiations and for persuasion of the people on the other side of the Treaty settlement. The people of this country and the people of Great Britain have to do business together in the future.  They have, because of their geographical propinquity, in a sense, to live together.  There is, undoubtedly, an entirely new situation as compared with the historical situation which existed up to the time of the Treaty. Whatever one may think of the Treaty, it opened up an entirely new chapter in the relations of the two peoples.  It was not a case any more of one side being beaten and having to yield to the other side.  The military operations which were carried on did not result in driving the British out, they did not make the British position here untenable, <Col N="1130" /> and they did not exhaust British resources.  They did no more than to bring the British people to the desire to negotiate.  When these negotiations took place the surrender in fact, the yielding in fact, was all on the British side, and anything that was surrendered on our side was not practical, but purely theoretical and suppositional. Therefore, that brought about a new chapter between the two countries, and what we desire is that that new chapter should not be brought to an end by any sort of unilateral action on our part, that we should not merely not break the Treaty, but, if we can avoid it, we should not make it possible for a charge of a breach of the Treaty being made against us.</P>
    <P>Assuming that the Government are determined on a certain line of action, I suggest that their duty and their obligation is to pursue their object by means which will secure the best possible relations between the people of this country and the people of Great Britain.  The principle of the Bill having been accepted by the House, we suggest that, at present, they should take out of the Constitution the specific words which were added, and which were not in the Treaty, and leave the Treaty words stand as part of the Constitution.  It would follow naturally from that, that the Constitution being amended in this way, they should enter into negotiations with the people who were parties to the Treaty as well as ourselves, and endeavour to arrive at an agreed interpretation of the Treaty.  It was frequently asserted by opponents of the Treaty during the Treaty debates that there ought to be an agreed interpretation, that a Treaty was a document for settling differences, and in the spirit that should animate the relations of the people of the two countries, there ought to be an attempt to arrive, on every occasion on which differences arise, at agreement as to the interpretation of the Treaty.  If that view is taken each side would put its views and its arguments in direct negotiation with the other side, with a view to convincing them, if possible.  Such discussion should not be carried on in the heated atmosphere which is liable to <Col N="1131" /> arise if the particular line of action so far indicated by the Government is taken.  Everybody can understand that it is extremely difficult for tempers to be preserved, and for hasty and irritating language to be avoided, if a discussion of the sort that ought to take place is carried on, either by means of long range correspondence or in public. We suggest that the Government, having got a vote of the Dáil in favour of the elimination of any obligation to take the Oath, and having declared that they are not anxious to break the Treaty, ought to be content to get rid of the extra words in the Constitution, ought to let the requirements of the Treaty as set out in the Treaty stand in the Constitution, and endeavour to reach an agreed interpretation of the provisions of the Treaty.</P>

      <P>I have to resist the amendment.  It seems to me to be of no value whatsoever.  Leaving that portion which it is proposed to leave behind in the Constitution and taking away the effective words leaves so much unsound timber, so to speak, adhering to the Constitution.  As I said in the Second Reading Debate, I propose to put the Treaty in its proper place.  I am glad to see that the Opposition are beginning to realise what exactly we are proposing to do. Our action does not mean that we are acting in any way contrary to the Treaty.  Whatever legal effect the words in Section 2, &ldquo;given the force of law&rdquo; have, we do not propose to prejudice.  Accordingly, in taking the Treaty cut of the Constitution, we say that that is no place for it, that it ought to be dealt with as international treaties are dealt with and kept in its proper place.  To leave portion of it there, while taking out the other portion, would be altogether contrary to the general idea.</P>

It is legal for us&mdash;if we are going to keep to the question of strict legality&mdash;to <Col N="1132" /> break practically everything in the Treaty, but I would like to know what is the Government's view as to the proper place for the Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be just as well to explain that before we go any farther.  I have already indicated, as clearly as I could, when I addressed myself to this question&mdash; those who were talking about honour and the breaking of treaties and all the rest, had their ears closed to anything like commonsense or argument&mdash;that the Treaty remains as it was, that we are not proposing, in the present Bill, to interfere with whatever validity the Treaty may have.  We are simply taking out of the Constitution matter which ought not to be in our Constitution at all and matter which we are at liberty to take out of it at the present time.</P>

      <P>I am not called upon to decide that question.  We are not dealing with that.  We are simply putting the Treaty in its place.

We are not interfering with whatever effect the Treaty has at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The President seems to have gone on the assumption, not merely in his answer to Deputies Blythe and MacDermot, but in a great portion of the two speeches he delivered here, that the only Articles of the Treaty which have any binding effect whatsoever are those from Article 4 onwards.  If there is anything in his contention, surely anybody reading the Treaty must see that what applies to the later Articles must apply to the Articles up to 4.  Anybody reading the Treaty will see that, like many other international Treaties, <Col N="1133" /> it may have constitutional effect, and that, in fact, Articles 1, 2, 3 and 4 must affect the Constitution of this State.  That is what the President has ignored in the arguments he put before the House.  He assumes, as he says, that we can relegate this Treaty to its proper place.  Its proper place, so far as the first four Articles are concerned, is precisely in the Constitution. They were meant to have, and have no other purpose than, constitutional effect.  Otherwise, they were quite meaningless.  Seeing that, apart from the Article on partition and the Article on defence, it was on these particular Articles most of the trouble took place during the negotiations, and seeing that it was on these particular Articles most of the trouble at home took place, I suggest that it is absurd now to come along and say that these Articles can be treated as if they did not exist, which is precisely what the President proposes to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other Articles, to follow the President's idea, may be binding as between the two countries even if they are not binding in our domestic law, but what I think Deputy MacDermot wants, and what Deputies on this side of the House want, is to be informed how there can be any force in Articles 1, 2, 3 and 4 unless they get into our Constitution&mdash;unless we make them portion of our domestic law.  If we do not do that, we are nullifying them. The President has not got even the remotest idea of the case he is up against.  He speaks of putting the Treaty in its proper place.  I put the question before&mdash;why did he leave the Treaty still scheduled as portion of the Constitution?  It is still scheduled. Is there any other treaty so dealt with? The President told us the last day and to-day that he wants to treat this Treaty like any other treaty.  Is there any other treaty scheduled?  It is quite obvious that this is a purely secondary argument, thought out after the event &mdash;that the first thing was to get rid of the Oath and then to back that up with any argument that could be got. The contention that he wants to treat this like any other treaty is not borne out by the form of the Bill itself.  The President has not even made an attempt <Col N="1134" /> to answer the case which has been put up.  So far as Articles 1 to 4 are concerned, the Treaty can only be made operative if account is taken of them in the Constitution.  There is no other way by which they can become operative.  However pious your intentions may be about observing a treaty in the letter and in the spirit, if you make a treaty and then proceed to make four clauses of it inoperative, nobody can say&mdash;whether we like it or not&mdash;that you are doing anything else but breaking it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that it is the Deputy who has just spoken who has no conception whatever of the real position.  Articles 1 to 4 indicated the starting-off point of the Free State. They gave us a starting-point.  We progressed from that, and they are given effect to to-day in the position of the Free State in the British Commonwealth of Nations where, as a co-equal member, we are entitled to make any changes we like in our Constitution, and whatever force there is in the other Articles of Agreement between ourselves and Britain remains untouched. That is the case that I have been making from the start, but apparently Deputy O'Sullivan has not yet got it into his head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I must entirely disagree with the President when he says that these Articles indicate our starting off point.  That is right, but to a point that may be very easily misunderstood. If you are going to say that they indicate a static position at that time, then that is a thing that we must resist completely. The first Article indicates that we have the same position with regard to the British Government as the Dominions had, and all the assertions that the President is now making are merely by virtue of the fact that that position, which was not a static position but one which moved from time to time, still exists.  Therefore, his attempt to say that these things are relegated out of existence altogether; all he is claiming for the country at the moment, is due entirely to the fact that those Articles are there.  If those articles are not there, then his whole argument, if I can dignify it with the <Col N="1135" /> name of argument, falls to the ground. His argument is based entirely on the existence of the arrangement between this country and Great Britain which was made at that time: an arrangement that was not at any moment fixed.  It was defined merely by analogy: that the position would be modified by Constitutional usage and by the various agreements made at Imperial Conferences.</P>
      <P>The argument of the President seems to me to be rather burking the issue. Here is the proposal: that an Article of the Treaty, exactly as it is, with whatever implications it may have, may remain in the Constitution.  The President gets up and says that this is a most unheard of, a most rare thing for an international treaty to be incorporated in a Constitution.  I do not propose to discuss whether that is so or not, but there is one thing that is absolutely general and universal, and that is that certain parts of treaties, which require to be made a domestic or a municipal law, must necessarily be incorporated into the legislation of a country.  I quite admit that of the thousands of treaties that exist in the world very few of them are incorporated <i>in toto</i> in legislation, but on the other hand very few of them have not, to the extent of some part of their implications, to be incorporated in domestic legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take this Article 4.  The President says that there is nothing mandatory about it.  We contest that.  But whether he is right or whether we are right it is evident that Article 4 of the Treaty had something to do with an Oath and had something to do with the members of the Parliament of the Irish Free State.  Consequently it had something to do with our internal affairs and, without in any way attempting to decide the question as to what exactly it did mean, it is evident, and I think this cannot be contested, that here, at any rate, is a specific Article devoted entirely to one point.  That point relates to membership of this Parliament.  You have there an international agreement in which something was undertaken.  It meant something, at any rate, and had <Col N="1136" /> relation to our internal affairs.  As I have said, if you make a treaty whereby you agree to put, say, a high tariff on certain countries and no tariff on others, you must necessarily have that implemented by domestic legislation, because otherwise its terms could not be carried out.  When the fulfilment of a treaty requires internal legislation the other party to it has a perfect right to say that that treaty has been broken unless the internal legislation that is necessary has been produced.  Whatever this Article means, it means something which requires to be made operative in this country.  If the Treaty, as a whole, has the force of law in this country, then it might be argued that, consequently, whatever this Article means also has the force of law.</P>
    <P>The proposal in this amendment is that the exact words in the Treaty, without in any way attempting to construe them, be left in the Constitution; that is to say, to be left part of the municipal law of this country, because it was clearly intended that whatever they meant there must be some legislation here to make them operative.  Here you dodge, if you like, the whole question as to what they mean.  You fulfil the terms of the Treaty in that whatever the Article meant in the Treaty it also meant in the Constitution.  If the President were to make, for instance, a proposal that I think would be entirely wrong, that this should be taken out of the Constitution, but that certain legislation should be enacted to make it operative, then that would be a thing that one might discuss; but here is a thing that we have undertaken to fulfil&mdash;the conditions of Article 4, whatever those conditions are. Nobody can contest that whatever those conditions may be, if they mean anything at all, they must have required some sort of domestic legislation, and the only domestic legislation available for them is the position as it now remains with that Article in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is no proposal on the part of the President to make the words in <Col N="1137" /> the Article operative by any other Act.  Consequently, it seems to me that if the President were honest in the assertions that he has made so far he could have no objection whatever to accepting this amendment.  He has said that the Oath is not mandatory in the Treaty, that he had no intention of breaking the Treaty, that he only wanted to remove the Oath which was in no way mandatory in the Treaty from being operative in this country.  Well, if the argument that he made at the time was sound, the argument he is making now is not sound.  If the Oath was mandatory in the Treaty, leaving it in the Constitution will leave it mandatory here also.  The President gave his pledges, whatever they may be worth, to the country that he did not propose to break the Treaty.  He assures us that the form of words in Article 4 of the Treaty, so far as I can make out from what he has said, binds us to nothing. If that is so, then he can accept this amendment and say also that he is bound to nothing.  If his other statements are true, then I suggest he can have no objection to this amendment. Of course, many of us who heard his speech here on Friday night realise perfectly well that he is very happy about this Bill.  He stated here fairly clearly that it was a sort of heads I win, tails you lose, arrangement; either he is going to demonstrate that he can remove the Oath or prove, as he says, that co-equality and freedom are all bosh.  In either case he gains. He has saved his face and given some apparent justification for certain acts that took place in this country, and what happens to the unfortunate people of this country is apparently no concern of his.  We would like, however, to have a clear statement from him as to why he refuses to accept this amendment.  If the thing is not mandatory in the Treaty it will not be mandatory in the Constitution. If it is mandatory in the Treaty then, by his own words and the assurances he gave to the people of the country, it should remain mandatory in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>If I were to attempt to consider the amendment that is proposed <Col N="1138" /> from the Opposition Benches favourably, Deputy Fitzgerald's speech would convince me that I was wrong, and that the amendment should be rejected. But I was never inclined to regard this amendment favourably, because, to my mind, it is confusing the issue and raising a fog.  We have heard a good deal of suggestions that the President is trying to save his face.  If he is, I am not sure that he is the only person in this House who is trying to save his face.  To my mind, had the President and the Executive Council introduced a Bill containing Article I and Article 4 and left it at that, the position in which we find ourselves in considering this section and the amendment to-day would be very different.  I do not think there is any doubt in anybody's mind as to what we ought to do.  As I understand it, the case of the Government is that when Article 2 of the Treaty was written it may have contained a mandatory principle which required to be amplified and defined by Article 4, but that the moment the status of this country had developed, and had changed in the course of that development, the mandatory element in Article 2, with reference to the obligation to take an Oath had, so to speak, atrophied and disappeared, and that the definition contained in Article 4 carried nothing specifically mandatory in it at all.  The reproduction of that Article in the Constitution, in an aggressively mandatory form, was not in accordance with the Treaty, was not obligatory by the Treaty, and the time has come to implement the unquestioned will of the Nationalist people of this country, and to withdraw the obligation that is at present being imposed on the elected representatives of the people to take an Oath, that some regard as perjury, and that others are driven to the rather unhappy expedient of describing as an empty formula.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hogan, whose absence to-day acquits me of the necessity of saying a good deal I intended to say, in his rather raucous tones got up and said, on a recent occasion in this House, that anyone with a primary education ought to realise that it is not reasonable to object to the obligation <Col N="1139" /> to take this Oath.  He misquoted me, and he implied generally that anyone who took our view, that the Oath should go out of the Constitution, was a half-baked idiot.  I have always been in favour, and I still am in favour, of consolidating the ties between our people and the English people.  If I had to choose between a republic and free and independent membership of the Commonwealth to-morrow, I would choose the free and independent membership of the Commonwealth, in preference to a republic, and I am convinced that one of the strongest reasons for removing this obligatory Oath from the Constitution is that it is a grave obstacle to good relations between the Irish people and the English people, which would make co-oqual membership of the Commonwealth possible, and I believe that any half measures to that end can serve no useful purpose.  The only way of going about this business is the way in which the President has resolved to go about it, in so far as Section 1 is concerned, and that is to take the whole thing, holus-bolus, out of the Constitution and have done with it.  The Attorney-General, speaking in this House, explained very fully the Government position, and put up what I believe will prove to be an unanswerable case that this is not a breach of the Treaty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;that we are entitled to take the Oath out of the Constitution, and I am convinced that it is the right thing to take it out.  I believe it is the right thing, because I believe this Oath is an obstacle to good relations between our people and the English people, an obstacle to the permanence of our free and unfettered membership of the Commonwealth of Nations, and because I believe it to be so I am in favour of removing it from the Constitution. There is too much talk, if I might say so, of dishonour and lack of recognition of our honourable obligations. I am a critic of nobody's ideas of what his honourable obligations are, and I have my own views as to my own honourable obligations, and nobody in <Col N="1140" /> this House can teach or instruct me in regard to what I should do in honour. The same, I think, holds for other members of the House, and we would do a great deal better if we addressed ourselves to the question we have under consideration, and not to our honourable obligations.  We can always judge these for ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Talking of honour, what is to be said of an administration which, in the light of this, which appears at the end of Article 66 of the Constitution, providing for the supremacy of our own Supreme Court: &ldquo;Provided that nothing in this Constitution shall impair the right of any person to petition his Majesty for special leave to appeal from the Supreme Court to His Majesty in Council or the right of His Majesty to grant such leave,&rdquo; has got up and said: &ldquo;We do not give two straws for what is in that Article; nobody is going to the Privy Council, and if they do go, it will be a costly thing.&rdquo;?  Mind you, I think there is a good deal in the attitude they took up, but if they can do that simply by passing retrospective legislation, surely to God it is more honourable to come out blunt and plain and say: &ldquo;we are going to take the Oath out because we believe that we are within our Treaty rights in doing so.  If anybody makes representations that it is contrary to the Treaty they can be discussed in the proper arena, but we are going ahead with it and we are doing it in no backstairs manner.  We are not leaving it there because we do not believe it should be there, unlike what was sought to be done before, when it was left in and its effect nullified in each individual case that arose, by retrospective legislation.&rdquo;  I very much prefer the course we are asked to adopt here, a course in which I unhesitatingly join, but the snag is in the title&mdash;and this, to my mind, is one of the great tragedies of the present situation, and I am afraid that part of the responsibility must be laid on the Attorney-General, whose legal advice, I understand, is largely responsible for Section 2 and 3: &ldquo;An Act to remove the obligation now imposed by law on members of the Oireachtas and Ministers who are not members of <Col N="1141" /> the Executive Council.&rdquo;  I want to say this, that I have not the slightest objection to taking this Oath.  It does not cause me a moment's scruple, or a moment's difficulty, but I know it does cause honourable men grave scruple and difficulty.  I would not make a man pass under a ladder if he had a superstition about it, and how much more should I pause before I asked a man to do what he believes is perjury? I may think him foolish or wrong, but so long as he is honestly convinced, however misguided he may be in that view, that to do something is perjury, is it not criminal that I should insist on his doing it, and hold him up to public ridicule if he will not do it.  I think it is loathsome.  I will not stand up when you play the &ldquo;Soldiers' Song,&rdquo; because I detest it, and it is associated, in my mind, with horrors, and how much more loathsome is it to a man who has a deep religious scruple to have to subscribe to this Oath?  I would bitterly resent it.  If the Executive Council proceeded to outlaw me because I was not prepared to raise my hat to the &ldquo;Soldiers' Song,&rdquo; and kowtow to the Tricolour, I should resent it, and these are purely political considerations. How much more carefully should I pause when it comes to asking a man to swear an Oath to what he believes to be untrue.  Come now to the Second Section of the Title&mdash;</P>

There are a great many people who want to endorse, unqualifiedly, Section 1 of the Bill, but they will find it difficult, and they will fear misrepresentation if they act on Section 1 as they would wish to act in the anticipations of Sections 2 and 3.  The Title of the Bill gives us a clue to the difficulty that will beset many people.  We want to get the Oath out of the Constitution, and believe we can do it in accordance with the Treaty.  The situation created by the nomenclature of this Bill gives many people to pause, and I think it will be of material assistance to us if the President will address himself, before we are called on to vote on this section, to this aspect of the matter, and to say why it was that, on a matter of great principle such as this, the Executive Council were not prepared to present a Bill consisting of Sections 1 and 4 and to have left it at that.</P>

      <P>Before this amendment goes to a vote, may I make one more attempt to clear up what is in the minds of the Government?  I regret that I, at any rate, am still confused as to their attitude.  I am not confused by too much consideration of the question of honour, as the President suggested, because, in point of fact, in these debates I think I have said practically nothing about honour. The point, however, is this: Both the President and the Attorney-General laid very great stress on the question of exercising their legal rights.  They said, &ldquo;Every jot and tittle of our legal rights we mean to have, and as long as we confine ourselves to acting legally no one can accuse us of being immoral either.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposition underlying that is a very questionable one, that it is never immoral to exercise our legal rights. I have been given some hope to-day by what the President has said that I have perhaps misinterpreted their attitude. He has spoken of leaving the Treaty valid.  What I want to get at is, if that has any meaning at all, are <Col N="1143" /> we to consider that we can go ahead and pass any law we like, no matter what its relation to the Treaty may be, and as long as we are doing something legal nobody can blame us; or are we to understand that for some purpose, to some extent, and at any rate in some of its parts, the Government regard the Treaty as having a moral binding force upon us?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get this amendment back to some narrower ground than that upon which it is being discussed.  I should like to clear the way to a more concise discussion on the point, at any rate, that I have in view in this amendment.  Right through the course of the debate since this Bill made its appearance there seems to me to be considerable confusion as between a power to do a thing and the right to do a thing.  This House is fully empowered to do anything. As I said previously, no matter how ridiculous the thing is, it has the power&mdash;nobody can say nay to it. The question of right is entirely another matter and at that point honour does come in and just at that point.  This House has the power to pass any amendment whatsoever to any Bill that has ever been brought before it and now is an Act.  It has even power to pass any piece of legislation it likes completely abrogating any clause of any treaty, political or trade, or any multilateral Convention which it signed at Geneva.  It definitely has power to do all these things.  It has, further, this power and it has even this right, that it can by an open act repudiate all that it has done.  It can repudiate any treaty it has made, either the one with the British&mdash;the original one or the successive ones&mdash;or any treaty it has made of a trade type with Germany, France or any other country.  It can repudiate any Convention it has made at Geneva&mdash;repudiate or denounce, if there are ways of denouncing in the instrument itself.  But what they cannot do in honour is to pretend to hang on to a part of a treaty they have signed and to get rid of these parts they do not like, without previously negotiating on the matter with the <Col N="1144" /> other parties to the treaty.  That is one thing they have not the right to do in honour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking at the moment that the Government should, at any rate, put their cards on the table with regard to one thing, and one thing only.  We have been told that there are a variety of arguments on which there is based the contention that the Oath, agreed to have been in the Treaty at some time, can now be removed from the Constitution, and I think in the background there lies in that argument, from the Treaty.  One of these arguments is that the phrase is not mandatory.  I am not asking at present in this amendment for a thing which I consider desirable.  It is the third best.  The best thing to do, to my mind, in this whole situation is to keep the Treaty. The second best thing would be to negotiate an alternative Treaty.  The worst thing we could do is to break part of it and pretend we are carrying out honourable obligations.  I suggest this as a third thing.  Apart from Section 2 altogether, I hold, and have always held, that Section 4 is clearly mandatory in its terms; clearly mandatory both with regard to the fact that an Oath must be taken and that it must be taken in that particular form, and that is denied.  I am told to-day that the Attorney-General made an unanswerable case.  He made an unanswerable case certainly on one point, and that was this phrase.  He said that on the question of whether the Oath was obligatory or not there were two views, and it would be silly for any lawyer to say that one interpretation was the correct one.  But what meaning is being founded upon that unanswerable statement of the Attorney-General? That the Government is going to say that a particular thing is correct, and is going to advance on foot of that statement that the Attorney-General has laid down, that it would be silly for any lawyer to say that any particular interpretation was the correct one.  Some of them, at any rate, have said that the words &ldquo;to be taken&rdquo; were not obligatory.  I want to test that, and that only, and, therefore, I say, leave the phrase as it is without the clearly obligatory words <Col N="1145" /> that follow, and leave it in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I understand the argument has been made that that cannot be done because it is leaving the Treaty in the Constitution.  It is not.  I take on that point the argument made by Deputy Fitzgerald.  It is correct to say that treaties in general do not <i>in toto</i> appear in the domestic law of any country.  It is much more accurate to say that nearly every treaty made between any two countries appears in some form, or at least some clause of it, in the domestic legislation of both countries.  We have examples of it ourselves.  We have signed a trade treaty with Germany, and there had to be implementing legislation.  We signed a treaty with France and there had to be implementing legislation by way of certain taxation.  We have signed all sorts of multilateral conventions at Geneva, and we either have had to pass legislation, or have had, when signing the conventions, to admit that our legislation was in conformity. If we took away any of that legislation we would have to go further and denounce the convention.  It is not an answer to the amendment to upraise the argument that the Treaty should not be in the Constitution.  This is not putting the Treaty in the Constitution. This is taking a phrase and is putting it in the Constitution, and a phrase which has words which are declared not to be mandatory.  If the Courts are going to be asked to decide upon them, as they might well be if they are in the Constitution, they are not decided upon the Treaty, but upon the simple net point, do these words &ldquo;the Oath to be taken&rdquo; mean that an oath must be taken?</P>
    <P>That amendment is going to be refused simply because of the fact that certain judges might declare that these words were obligatory.  What judges is this likely to come before, if it remains in the Constitution?  The judges of this country.  Who are the judges of this country?  We have been told by the Government that two of them, sitting on the Constitution Committee, determined that the Oath was not obligatory, that the phrase used in the Treaty, this phrase which I am <Col N="1146" /> importing into the Constitution, was not obligatory.</P>
    <P>If that is so, the Government then have the advantage that in any trouble with England they would come before a court biassed in their favour, two judges, according to their argument, which I do not believe, having declared the Oath was not mandatory. We give them this advantage, that they can take the case to the court and get these two judges, now sitting in a judicial position, to declare that the words are not mandatory, and, with a judgment in their hands, they are in a stronger position to deal with any British Government in this matter.  There is no argument against accepting this.  It shows bona fides, if there be bona fides.  It gives to a biassed tribunal in favour of the argument an opportunity of deciding whether the Oath in fact is optional or not, and it does not import the Treaty into the Constitution. It takes a phrase as is often done, as is the usual thing.  The only other argument I heard against it is that founded upon co-equality.  I want to say right here that no argument founded upon co-equality can ever be pushed to this point, that this country, or any other which is tied by a Treaty, can do what it pleases within the terms of the treaty with its own Constitution.</P>
    <P>If one takes a bird's-eye view of the powers in Europe, either pre-war or as they are now, there is nobody who can deny that the States in Europe were and are co-equal, and yet there is nobody but would have to say that every single one of these States in its inter-relations with the others, was bound by all sorts of restrictions; covenants and treaties, and that did not take away from their sovereign status and co-equality.  A specific restriction that in the exercise of their sovereign authority people have decided to put upon themselves is not incompatible with co-equality and sovereign status. I was interested, as the debate went on, to hear Deputy Davin confine himself to one of his interjections that have been so full of meaning for the last few days, because otherwise Deputy Davin <Col N="1147" /> did not express any meaning as regards himself except by interjection.  This particular subject came up for discussion when Deputy Davin was a member of an earlier Dáil.  He spoke upon this point, and he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It must be plain to everybody that the violation or alteration of any vital clause in the Treaty by one of the high contracting parties that signed would render the whole agreement null and void.  Unless Deputies are prepared to face this position honestly and say that they are ready to accept the full consequences of their action, notwithstanding promises, explicit or implied, given to their constituents, they are only wasting the time of this Dáil in moving amendments which, if accepted, would leave the English free to say the Treaty was no longer in existence.</P>
    <P>And he went further and said:</P>
    <P>The proposal to abolish or alter the Oath at this stage is like trying to destroy the middle storey of a house after the building has been completed.</P>
    <P>And then he went on to say:</P>
    <P>Are Deputies so squeamish in their conception of an oath of this kind as to insist that it is going to prevent them from being better Irishmen or better citizens than if they had not taken it?  If any Deputies feel that way I think they ought not to be in public life, and the sooner they retire from the Dáil to the quiet seclusion of a monastery the better.</P>
    <P>I presume that is the reason why the Deputy is so silent quite recently&mdash; the vow of silence is upon him.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General (Mr. Maguire)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand what Deputy McGilligan means by drawing attention to my statement that lawyers may take two views upon a certain matter.  He seemed to point to it as the only statement made in my speech that deserved any weight. He will recollect that in my speech, when I did make that reference, I also referred to a statement by him with <Col N="1148" /> regard to the necessity for repealing the Colonial Laws Validity Act, that there were two views on the effect of that Act, whether it affected Ireland or not, and the reason it was necessary to repeal that Act was in order to put it beyond doubt, as he put it, to coerce the judicial mind.  I have endeavoured to see what exactly is the view taken by the late Government as to the meaning and effect of the Treaty.  I have been led to believe by what I read in the debates of this House and have seen stated elsewhere, that whatever might be the English view as regards the position conferred on this country by the Articles of Agreement of 1921, there was certainly a definite view adopted by the late Government here and presumably by their legal advisers, to use a phrase of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, that the position given by the Articles of Agreement was not static, but that it was, I think, the phrase used was, on another occasion, dynamic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite at a loss to understand why all this talk of breaking the Treaty should find such a prominent place in the speeches of the members of the late Cabinet, who must be able to appreciate, however back-benchers and others who do not appreciate, how the argument at present rests between this country and the English lawyers.  If Deputy McGilligan will pardon me for saying it, there can be two legal views about any matter.  There is the English view, the Thomas view, implicit in the Thomas dispatch, which I suggested the other day he should have stepped in earlier in this debate to prevent being adopted here. It is, I suggest, not consistent with the attitude he took up in such important debates as that which took place when the Statute of Westminster was being discussed here.  Certainly it is not consistent to allow some of the Deputies sitting behind the Front Bench opposite, and even some of the members of the Front Bench themselves, to take up the attitude they are taking up on this matter. We can, without making one single fresh argument, find in his speeches <Col N="1149" /> arguments with a legal basis to justify every single line of our Bill. That was the implication in my speech the other day, and I repeat it again to-day.  When Deputy McGilligan himself spoke as Minister this is how he put the status under the Articles of Agreement.  On 16th July, 1931, he said:</P>
    <P>When the Irish Free State came into existence in 1921 we happened to strike in at a definite state in the evolution of the other members of the Commonwealth.  But their evolution, though politically rapid, had been slow from the point of view of the legal expression of the political facts.  There was a whole hinterland of highly anomalous law to be cleared out of the way, and an elaborate system of administrative practice to be transformed or discontinued.</P>
    <P>And he went on:</P>
    <P>Deputies will agree with me when I say that there can be no two views on the question that when this country accepted the status of Canada in certain respects in 1921, the status of Canada then accepted was not a stereotyped legal formula.</P>
    <P>These are our views, and it is on that basis that we introduced this Bill here. If we are wrong in that, and if it turns out that some tribunal that may consider this says that we were wrong, we have had no more earnest advocate of that position than the late Government. But the Minister went further when he said:</P>
    <P>Therein lies the kernel of the whole Treaty position and the key to the progress that has gone on.</P>
    <P>Has any progress gone on or have we been listening to nonsense for the last ten years? This is not the first step, it is the first open step, as Deputy Dillon put it, to assert the rights that we have been told over and over again have been conferred upon us by this document. If you accept that view there put forward, you will find that this question of honour which troubled so many has totally disappeared.  Deputy McGilligan says:</P>
    <P>Therein lies the kernel of the whole Treaty position, and the key <Col N="1150" /> to the progress that has gone on, I will not say at our own behest, or even always at our instance&mdash;since 1926.  How well the founders of this State builded, the developments which have since taken place go to show.  The task begun in 1926&mdash;the first Commonwealth Conference since the Treaty, in which we took an active part&mdash;is completed in the paragraphs written down in Part V of this Report.</P>
    <P>That, as I said a moment ago, was what I might style as the Irish view. Do they wish to repudiate that view? Do they wish to retreat?  Are they in full retreat from that position?  Am I not right in saying that it is upon the basis that that view is not right that Mr. Thomas is utilising the Treaty in his despatch?  That there may be two views to it finds expression in a statement made by one member in the British House of Commons about this matter.  Mr. Amery, speaking on this matter, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The main basis, the first clause of the Treaty of Agreement, was that the status of Ireland was that of Canada and the other Dominions.  I do not know what lawyers may say as to what that meant, whether they say that it meant the status of Canada as at the date 1921 and that Irish nationhood was, as it were, put into cold storage, at the 1921 temperature.</P>
    <P>Is that the view of the Opposition?</P>

      <P>We have pushed it very far.  This is the first time, I understand, that an effort has been made to assert the position is as the Opposition claim it to be.  When during the years past, they took exception <Col N="1151" /> to the action of the Privy Council, as Deputy Dillon put it, and put it with great force, they went by a back-door method to do what they accuse us of doing.  If this Bill is a breach of the Treaty, every Act that was passed retrospectively annulling the acts of the Privy Council was equally a breach of the Treaty. Deputy McGilligan himself announced in this House in answer to a question that he proposed to bring in a Bill to abolish appeals to the Privy Council. I suggest to him that first of all he stood exactly on a par with the action we are taking here, and that the steps to give effect to that position would be exactly the steps taken by us in this Bill.  I suppose it is unnecessary for me to refer to the actual questions and answers but I have them here.  On the 18th March, 1931, Mr. Lemass asked the Minister for External Affairs:</P>
      <P>If he will state when the legislative proposals to abolish appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council will be introduced.</P>
      <P>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. McGilligan): I refer the Deputy to the answer given to Deputy Mullins on the 11th December, 1930, to which I have nothing to add.</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: Would the Minister state when it is intended to introduce the legislative proposals referred to?</P>
      <P>Mr. McGilligan: I have nothing to add to the last reply.</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: The Minister did not state when he intended to do so.</P>
      <P>Mr. McGilligan: I did.</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: When?</P>
      <P>Mr. McGilligan: In due course.</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: Will the Minister explain what is meant by the term in due course?</P>
      <P>Mr. McGilligan: No, I cannot do that.</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: Will the legislative proposals be introduced this year?</P>
      <P>Mr. McGilligan: Oh, yes.</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: Within six months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" /> Mr. McGilligan: I cannot answer any further.</P>

There is no Article in this creating that right.  There is no explicit recognition of the right.  There is only that implicit recognition of the right.

      <P>When Deputy McGilligan proposed to introduce legislation to remove that, I suggest to him that it was necessary not alone to remove the principle but specifically to take away the right from the citizen here to go to the Privy Council, <Col N="1153" /> in order to make the then position of this State accord with the legal position within the Commonwealth of Nations.  He talks here about &ldquo;the right&rdquo; and &ldquo;the power.&rdquo;  He says we have the power and that of course this Dáil has power to do any silly sort of thing.  We are not basing our case on any such silly argument.  We say if our interpretation of the present constitutional position be right, not alone have we power but we have a clear right, which cannot be denied by the British Government, otherwise all these declarations of the Imperial Conferences that we had grown up, all these declarations about co-equality, all these statements that we were entitled to grow with the other Dominions are nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If our Constitution is to be shackled by the verbiage of the Treaty of 1921, then, of course, there is a question about it.  I have yet to learn that that view found acceptance by the Opposition when they were in office.  I have yet to learn that it has found acceptance by Constitutional lawyers.  I have yet to learn why our representatives were at the Imperial Conference at all if that be the position.  To go back to the question of honour, which I dealt with on the last day, surely to goodness, if this document be a Treaty at all in the ordinary acceptation of the term, if it meant anything it quite obviously meant to confer on this country a status and a growth under that status. It certainly meant that we should grow as the other Dominions can grow. What is to prevent our taking advantage of the growth of that status and to allow the Treaty, as it stands, to be the basis along which the growth is to take place?  Surely the British are not entitled to say that it is dishonourable or a breach of the Treaty to take advantage of the very conditions that grew out of it as it originally existed? That seems to be the matter in a nutshell, and although Section 2 is not under consideration&mdash;I suggest it should not be&mdash;the removal of the Oath from the Constitution is necessary to give a clear legal expression to what is a political fact, the words used by Deputy McGilligan previously.  There <Col N="1154" /> is one other matter that I think I should have referred to in opening.  Am I right in saying that the long Title which Deputy Dillon seems to think is not quite suitable, is not being discussed now and that it will be discussed after the whole of the Bill has been considered?</P>

      <P>The learned Attorney-General, in the remarks that he has just addressed to this House&mdash; I am sure unintentionally&mdash;has completely and entirely misrepresented the position which we on this side of the House have taken up, and the position which we have always and consistently taken up.  It has always been our contention, and always will be our contention, that the Oireachtas is a sovereign Assembly.  That has always been our contention, and we have never departed from it.  We are empowered to pass any legislation that we like dealing with this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not deny that it is within the legal competence of this Oireachtas to pass this Act.  We have never contended to the contrary, and such a proposition has never been advanced in the course of the debate on this particular measure.  And why the Attorney-General should go wandering around and around, coming back again to the same point and saying: &ldquo;You are fighting the case of Mr. Thomas, you are fighting the English case,&rdquo; is more than I can understand.  We are doing nothing of the kind.  And while I do not for one moment charge the Attorney-General with deliberate misrepresentation of our position, I do think it very strange that the Attorney-General, after searching, as he tells us, through the various volumes of the debates of this House, is ignorant of our position.  Our position is clear here and now.  It is that we are a sovereign Parliament and that we can pass any legislation that we like.  That is our position.  It has never been anything else.  We are told by the Attorney-General and by some Deputy who interjected that we are fighting the English case in this House.  We <Col N="1155" /> are not fighting the English case.  We are fighting the Irish case.  We take up the attitude that the best interests of this country compel us to take up the attitude that we are taking up&mdash; the attitude of defending the honour of our country and its economic position. That is the attitude that we are taking up, and I contend that it is the right, correct and honourable attitude for every true-hearted Irishman to adopt.  That is my attitude, and I believe it is the true and sensible view. We are fighting Ireland's real battle here, because we are fighting the battle of our country's honour.  Deputy Dillon said that he was not concerned very much with the honour of individual people.  I agree with him.  It may not matter very much what the particular subjective attitude of anybody upon any question may be, or what the particular subjective attitude of any particular Deputy in this House may be.  It does not interest me in the slightest any more than it interests Deputy Dillon.  But what does interest me is that the national honour as a whole should not be besmirched.  It has nothing to do with the conscience of any particular individual who may have a twisted or warped conscience. It is the national expression through this House of wrong-doing that besmirches this country.  And the breaking of a Treaty is wrong-doing.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General put forward a very strange argument here the other day when he inquired under what code of morals it was wrong for a people to exercise their legal rights.  My answer to that is that I believe that it is wrong under every moral code that has ever been put forward.  It was wrong under the old natural law, and it is wrong under the modern international law, and it is wrong under the Christian law.  If people exercise to the full their rights regardless of the rights of other persons and of other States, then they are acting entirely wrongly.  A man may have certain legal rights under municipal law, under the law of his own country, that he cannot morally exercise. For instance, somebody may be sued for a debt more than six years old. If he is doubtful whether he owes the <Col N="1156" /> debt, if he has forgotten the circumstances, he is entitled to plead the Statute of Limitations.  But if he remembers the circumstances completely, if he knows that he owes a sum of money to his neighbour, he has got a legal right to repudiate it, but he has no right under the moral code to repudiate it, certainly not by the moral code of the Church to which I belong. You cannot satisfy yourselves always by saying: &ldquo;I am living according to the law of the country,&rdquo; no matter how absurd that law may be.  There is a very extreme example given in a very well-known book, Dicey's &ldquo;History of Constitutional Law,&rdquo; in which it is stated that the British Parliament is sovereign and that it could order the execution of every blue-eyed baby. According to the Attorney-General, if a law of this kind were passed in this House or any other Parliament, people would have a legal right to execute all blue-eyed babies, and a moral right also; and the Attorney-General, I am afraid, would not be in this House. That is the Attorney-General's argument. And between States it is exactly the same.  There is such a thing as international law, and perhaps the best expression of that international law is that given by a conference which was entered into in 1870, when Russia declared itself to be no longer bound, on grounds that are set out, by the terms of the Treaty of Paris, which forbade it to keep a fleet in the Black Sea.  It was declared by a conference held between the parties to the Treaty of Paris &mdash;and the declaration was ultimately signed by all the leading Powers of Europe: &ldquo;It is an essential principle of the law of nations that no Power can liberate itself from the engagement of a treaty nor modify the stipulations thereof unless with the consent of the contracting parties by means of amicable arrangement.&rdquo;  And any State that breaks deliberately a whole treaty or modifies its stipulations without the consent of the other parties to the arrangement, is a State which is breaking its pledged word; and it is dishonouring itself and is entailing serious consequences upon itself.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat what was <Col N="1157" /> said here the other day, that if a State repudiates once its reputation is gone, nor do I want to deal with what I consider to be the very, very serious economic consequences which I believe will follow from this violation of the Treaty.  Here you have got explicitly in the Treaty clear definite words: &ldquo;The Oath to be taken by members of the Parliament of the Irish Free State shall be in the following form.&rdquo; You have got that clearly, definitely, specifically put.  There is no statement in the Treaty that there is to be an appeal to the Privy Council.  The appeal to the Privy Council came into existence solely because there was an appeal from the Canadian courts to the Privy Council.  It was for that reason, and for that reason only. That has always been our contention. We have grown up since.  It has always been our contention that we have grown up, and by our growing up we have now powers which we possibly had not some years ago.  I will not stay to argue that point at the present moment.  The power now exists in Canada, and, therefore, the power now exists in us, unhampered by Section 2, to abolish appeals to the Privy Council.  But it is under Section 2 that the Oath comes in.  Section 2 of the Articles of Agreement has nothing to do with the Oath.  The Oath is very clearly and explicitly in Section 4.  It is because it is in Section 4 and only exists in Section 4 that it is a violation of the Treaty to take it out of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>This has developed into a two-sided argument of what would be the decision of a court of honour and what would be the decision of a court of law. Quite frankly, my difficulty has always been to discriminate between the action which is now being taken by this Government and the action which was attempted to be taken by the previous Government in relation to the Treaty.  To me it seems, reading the Treaty as a layman&mdash;and it is as a layman that I would go into a court of honour&mdash;the Privy Council was at least as definite in the Treaty, and perhaps more explicit, than the <Col N="1158" /> Oath.  The contention of our opponents is that they can go into a court of honour as lawyers; that they can bring in their honour so delicately balanced, so beautifully discriminative as to what honourable men can do, that in that court of honour they can swallow without any hesitation the thing which is implicit, but that they must balk as men of honour at the thing which is explicit.</P>
      <P>After all, a court of honour is a court of honour and not a court of law.  In a court of honour you deal with what were the obvious intentions of the agreement between honourable men. You do not go in there to balk at the difference between explicit and implicit, if the obvious meaning and intention to a layman was that one should be as binding as the other.  There was in the Treaty, under the form of a plebiscite, a provision which controlled the permanence of Partition, a provision whose obvious meaning to a layman was of one kind, whose obvious meaning was made a fundamental justification of this Treaty to the people of Ireland, whose obvious meaning was preached from one end of the country to the other by those who defended the Treaty.  But in a court of law, under Mr. Justice Feetham, it was found that that was not the meaning; it was found that we were not in a court of honour, that the narrowest possible legal meaning of the terms deliberately chosen to trap the people of this country, could be used to enforce against them the permanent separation and division of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems we do not know whether we are in a court of honour or in a court of law.  These people go into a court of honour and use the arguments of a court of law when it suits them.  You cannot do that.  Either we are in a court of honour or we are in a court of law.  The British were in a dilemma, and they deliberately used those fools, and those fools deliberately allowed themselves to be used for the purpose of getting the British out of that dilemma.  When this was being discussed in the House of Commons, Mr. Winston Churchill, one of the signatories of that Treaty, one of the men who deliberately <Col N="1159" /> claimed the right to interpret that Treaty over our heads, said that under the Statute of Westminster the position will be produced under which all sorts of unthinkable things can be done under the Irish Treaty and the Irish Constitution.  A legal position will be produced, he said, under which the Privy Council and the Oath and a lot of things would have to go.</P>
    <P>There was considerable disturbance of mind in England over this matter. How were they to get out of that? Who was to help them?  They could not get out of it themselves.  Mr. Thomas, speaking in that debate, warned those who were pressing for the exclusion of the Free State from the Statute of Westminster of the danger ahead: &ldquo;Remember, there are two Constitutions in the Commonwealth of Nations which will be concerned in the matter&mdash;there is the Free State Constitution and there is the Constitution of South Africa, and if you touch the one you touch the other.&rdquo;  That was his dilemma.  He went on to say: &ldquo;Having regard to what this House knows of the actual conditions in South Africa, is there a man in this House who will dare to apply to South Africa the provisions which it is suggested could be applied to the Irish Free State?&rdquo;  The answer was that there was none.  He was in a dilemma.  How was he to get out of it?  He could not get out of it himself. Remember, he had no discretion; he could not alter a word, a line, or a comma of the Statute of Westminster. That was not a Bill voluntarily introduced into the British House of Commons to be altered or approved by them.  It was drawn up word for word, line by line, comma for comma with every single implication in it worked out and laid on record in the minutes of the Imperial Conference, not by the British Government, but by the representatives of the Dominions. He had to take it as a whole, and the House of Commons had to pass it as a whole.  The passing of this Act created an opportunity in the existing conditions in which we can legally do all these things, in which we can exercise all these powers parallel with and involving in their <Col N="1160" /> use all the other Dominions.  He could not reject it without breaking up this Empire openly.  He could not exclude the Irish Free State from it without doing something which it was admitted no single member of the British House of Commons would dare do in view of what they knew to be the actual and unescapable consequences of it in relation to South Africa.  How was he to get out of it?  The House of Commons could not get him out of it.  The Dominions could not get him out of it, but ex-President Cosgrave and the bundle of duds which composed his Council&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave went to Buttevant and made a strong speech claiming to stand for the rights of the Irish Free State under the Treaty. He was not quite so strong for its developability.  He did exactly what Mr. Thomas wanted him to do.  He got Mr. Thomas out of his trap, as far as a Government of such temporary possession of power in this country could do it, by saying: &ldquo;We are going to contract out.  In a court of honour we are going to contract out of our legal rights under the developability of the Treaty.  We are going to contract out of our rights under the Statute of Westminster.  Whatever the Statute of Westminster says, whatever powers have been given to us, and whatever legal rights we have, we will, as far as suits you, dear Mr. Thomas, stand by the static position of 1921.&rdquo;  There is no other meaning to that letter which Deputy Cosgrave wrote and which it was absolutely unnecessary for him to write.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a pure, gratuitous intrusion into the position to save the face and strengthen the hands of Mr. Thomas. But for that no question of a court of honour could possibly have arisen.  It was upon the question of law that the matter was tried in the House of Commons. On the question of law it was declared there by a British signatory to the Treaty that we had these legal powers.  It was to get out of that difficulty, to get out of the trap set for the British in the 1922 Treaty when they defined the powers of the Free State in terms of the powers of the other Dominions; it was to get him out of the trap in the Statute of Westminster that Deputy Cosgrave wrote a letter which said that we would contract out of those rights, that we would go into a court of honour and refuse to exercise the powers we had under the developability <Col N="1164" /> of our Constitution, and under the actual terms of the Statute of Westminster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it matters very much, the complete ignorance or lack of knowledge of the last speaker, but the statements of the Attorney-General are extremely ominous.  We presume his business is to advise the Government in these things and it strikes us as very appalling that he has completely failed to understand the situation here now, the situation that has been here for the last ten years.  It is assumed that there is no difference in dealing with the Oath and dealing with the Privy Council.  If they are going to negotiate with the British or to correspond with the British with that confusion in their minds, it seems to me they cannot win out.  There has been talk about the British point of view and the Irish point of view. Really what ought to be superior to both is just simple truth.  I am afraid if there were two different truths&mdash;British truth and Irish truth &mdash;with the complete misunderstanding of the situation which the Government have shown, it is British truth which would prevail.</P>
      <P>As far as I can make out from the Attorney-General he presumes that our contention is that the position of the Treaty in 1921, that is to say the status acquired then, remains static. He asserts if that is not so, that status covers everything.  Our contention is this, that in the Treaty there are certain clauses defining status by analogy; besides that there are other matters.  The Treaty lays down that there shall be care and maintenance parties in certain ports here.  Can any development in the relationship between Canada and Great Britain change that position? If that position comes to change I do not see myself how any developments of Dominion status could possibly change it, because it is laid down specifically and it has had relation to the peculiar position of the Irish Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now with regard to the Privy Council, we accepted the same relationship as Canada.  We felt that whatever <Col N="1165" /> the law might be in Canada, Constitutional usage had modified the position with regard to the Privy Council very considerably.  But as it was arguable that a good case could be made out for the fact that we inherited at that moment the position in which the subject had a right to appeal to the King in Council, we put in that clause in the Constitution which was not a mandatory clause.</P>
    <P>It says if there be any right of appeal to the King in Council that is not interfered with.  Of course Deputy Flinn, who knows nothing at all about these matters, is unaware that in 1926 that question was discussed in the Imperial Conference.  We had not that inferiority complex that the present President has.  He is not prepared to face up to things because he feels that other people might know more about them than he does.  We went over and discussed the matter, and the British and Dominion delegates sitting around the table agreed that the Constitutional position of the Dominions was now such that the matter of the appeal to the Privy Council was entirely a matter for the Dominions themselves to decide; that there was nothing in their position as Dominions which insisted upon the appeal to the Privy Council.  That appears quite clearly in one of the resolutions of the Imperial Conference of 1926.  That in itself was an interpretation of Articles 1 and 2 of our Treaty, because it was in virtue of the analogous position in our Treaty that the argument was advanced that the appeal to the Privy Council was implied.  When the Imperial Conference of 1926 laid down that it did not necessarily flow from Dominion status that a Dominion which did not want to have the appeal to the Privy Council was bound to have it, that was an interpretation by agreement and by negotiation on a question of status.</P>
    <P>Our argument in this case is that development of status of a Dominion and everything that goes to any Dominion in the way of power, status or anything else, by virtue of its going to any Dominion comes to us, <Col N="1166" /> but we have besides that specific arrangements vis-a-vis the British&mdash; between the British and the Irish Free State&mdash;which are laid down specifically in the Treaty.  Anything that is not set down specifically in the Treaty was by implication in the first Articles, but anything set down specifically in the Treaty arising out of the geographical position, the historical position or the actual administrative position between the two countries at that moment&mdash;I am not going to say that any of these should remain for ever, but what I will say is that they should be changed from time to time to meet the circumstances by negotiation between the two countries.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General is insisting all the time in trying to make out that the attitude we are taking is incompatible with our attitude on the Privy Council question, but if he has that in mind, in any dealings with the British he would certainly run this country into a very bad mess.  We had a watertight case with the British on the Privy Council.  If there had been since we came into existence any right of appeal to the Privy Council it was by virtue of the analogous position of ourselves with the other Dominions.  In 1926 it was clearly laid down that the right of appeal to the Privy Council over the head of the Government of a Dominion no longer existed, as merely flowing from the position of the country as a Dominion.  In 1929 or 1930 or some such year we proposed to bring in a Bill to give specific legal effect to what was admittedly the Constitutional position with regard to Dominions.</P>
    <P>Here in a Treaty with the British Article 4 lays it down specifically that there shall be an Oath taken to the King.  Supposing Britain became a Republic to-morrow.  If that Oath flowed only from the status position you might say that automatically the word &ldquo;King&rdquo; ought to be substituted for the word &ldquo;President.&rdquo;  So far as I understand the position, and so far as I would interpret the position of treaties, if that happened, the position of the Oath to the King would still remain by virtue of the <Col N="1167" /> Treaty.  But the British might come to us and say that position is changed now, and that the word &ldquo;President&rdquo; should be substituted for &ldquo;King.&rdquo; They would have to come to us as they came to us with regard to Article 12. They had to get our agreement to the change there although it was obvious that the machinery had broken down and that it was impossible for a certain proposition in that Article to be fulfilled.  The British did not turn around and say: &ldquo;Everyone knows perfectly well the position is now changed and we cannot get the men appointed in the way stated.&rdquo;  They actually came over here and, as far as I remember, we discussed it from morning until evening and we agreed that the position had changed and that another arrangement had to be made because it was impossible for either the British or us to secure the fulfilment of a certain condition.  With regard to anything that is specifically laid down in the Treaty why are those things laid down specifically?&mdash; Because they were dealing with things that were required and that did not flow from the status as Dominions. That is why they were put down.</P>
    <P>The British put down the provision as to the care and maintenance parties in Spike Island and Beare Island. Why did they put that down?  If it was innate in the position of a Dominion that British care and maintenance parties should be in the ports they would not need to have put it down.  Because that did not flow from status it was put down.  If we want to change the arrangement with regard to the care and maintenance parties in ports there is only one way of doing it, by going to the British and saying: &ldquo;The circumstances under which this Clause was made in 1921 no longer exist.  It is an inconvenience to us. We find it undesirable.  We think you will agree that it is a position that should be changed now.&rdquo;  We certainly would not go to the British and say: &ldquo;The status we took in 1921 is quite different from the position in 1932; these men must get out.&rdquo;  There is talk about honour.  There is a good deal of a mix-up about honour.  Some <Col N="1168" /> people stand for honour because they are honourable.  That would not appeal to Deputy Flinn.  Another matter has to be considered&mdash;that of the interests of this country.  The President on Friday put forward a doctrine&mdash;a most damnable doctrine, a doctrine which if any country in the world should resist it would be this country.  He said, in effect, that if a powerful country makes a treaty with a weak country, then the weak country has the right to interpret and twist and distort&mdash;I should not say &ldquo;twist.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">

      <P>I did not say anything of the kind.  The Deputy has twisted, as he usually does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just correcting myself.  Perhaps the President knows the difference between twisting and distorting.  The President stated that, in the circumstances I have mentioned, the weak country has the right to set itself up as sole arbiter as to what is meant by that Treaty.  In the words of the President, the weak country, if it is Ireland, is entitled to translate the Treaty in the Irish way.  The sanctions of a treaty consist of three things&mdash;sense of honour, consciousness of interest, and power to enforce the conditions of the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you are going to say that the weak country has the right to make itself the arbiter as to the meaning of the Treaty and to insist upon whatever interpretation it likes to put upon the Treaty, what is going to be the position of the big country?  If you go to negotiate with the British it will come back to the one thing&mdash;the power to enforce.  If we are going to negotiate with any country in the world, and we take up the point of view the President propounded here last Friday, the business of the big country is to use the big stick with us.  If, at any future time, it should be necessary for us to negotiate with the Six Counties, which would be the smaller and conceivably might be the weaker party, are we going to negotiate and put things in black and white when they can come along and say later: &ldquo;We want to amend this; we are the weaker party, and if the Free State attempt reprisals <Col N="1169" />&mdash;I think that is the word used by the President&mdash;&ldquo;then they are going to be in the wrong.&rdquo;  It seems to me that that is the most diabolical doctrine.  It is up to us, in our own interests, as a weak country, to insist upon the complete fulfilment of treaties &mdash;the most nice and exact interpretation of the meaning of treaties.  That is in our interests.  Honour and interest with us, as I believe was always the case, are identical.  If we are going to say to the British &ldquo;We are going to interpret this document in this way and make ourselves sole arbiters,&rdquo; they can do the same to-morrow. What have we of these three things&mdash; honour, interest and power to enforce? Have we got honour?  It seems to be rather dubious at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Did they put up any case against it?  Did they attempt to argue the case?  They did nothing of the sort.  That was the position then. Up to 1926, I quite agree, there could be argument as to whether appeal to the Privy Council was not an essential part of the Dominion position.  In 1926 the British agreed it was not an essential part of the Dominion position. If not the British Government, but certain individuals attempted to argue that, although it was not part of the Dominion position, it applied to this country then we would defy them.  We would say this&mdash;which I put to the Attorney-General&mdash;if any impartial international tribunal after the Imperial Conference of 1926 considered <Col N="1170" /> the matter, they could come to no other decision but that we were fully justified and entitled to remove the appeal to the Privy Council.  I put it to the Attorney-General: would any body of responsible lawyers give it as their opinion that any impartial international tribunal would give a decision that the Oath in the Treaty is not mandatory?  Would any impartial international tribunal lay it down and pledge its reputation&mdash;the Attorney-General seems to be rather nervous of his reputation since he left the legal explanation on Friday to the President&mdash;that the Oath is not mandatory? Is the Attorney-General going to tell me that if he goes to any body of international lawyers and asks them for advice as to what we may expect an impartial international tribunal to do, they will tell him that the act we are performing is other than an outrage on international law and usage?  In the case of the Privy Council, does the Attorney-General or anybody else say that an impartial international tribunal could come to any other decision than that the removal of the appeal to the Privy Council was eminently justified and unchallengeable? If the Attorney-General is going to mix up these two things, his negotiations with the British are going to be made perfectly impossible. In arguing with us, he seems to be in a particularly strong position through not understanding the situation.  It is very hard to argue with a person unless you have some common ground of knowledge.  The Attorney-General seems to have a completely distorted idea as to the negotiations that took place with the British during the last ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have always recognised that in respect of anything specifically laid down, in the Treaty it was laid down specifically for the reason that it did not flow from the Dominion position. That we have always recognised and must necessarily recognise, not merely for honour's sake, but for the sake of our own interest, because the sanctity of treaties is a thing much more vital to us than to those who have the power to enforce the keeping of treaties.  We are dependent on the sanctity of treaties.  Any specific matter laid down <Col N="1171" /> in the Treaty is laid down specifically because it does not flow from the Dominion position.  When it is laid down specifically, it is a statement of the relationship or of an existing fact between this country and Great Britain.  That is not really a Dominion matter.  It is a definition of the specific and peculiar relations existing between this country and Great Britain.  These peculiar relations apply only between ourselves, and they can be altered, from time to time, by agreement between the two contracting parties. What is the proposal here?  In this amendment we are not attempting to interpret the position.  We are merely leaving in Article 17 exactly what is in the Treaty.  If, as the Attorney-General has tried to hint but has carefully refrained from stating definitely, the development of status has in some peculiar way completely eliminated the specific Article in the Treaty, then what remains of Article 17 in the Constitution will be absolutely meaningless.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Attorney-General of one little, historical fact. The Attorney-General's and the President's argument was that Article 4 is only in to state the form of Oath to be taken, because the Oath is implicit and is binding on us whether Article 4 is in or not, by virtue of the position in Canada and our status.</P>

      <P>Surely the Attorney-General knows perfectly well that in 1921, when we were in negotiation with the British, the Deputy's profession was not very numerous in our movement. We were really inexperienced, if you like.  We did not set ourselves up as great construers of international documents.  We used our commonsense and tried to see that one or other reading was applicable.  If anybody expects us to turn round now and stand for the things some of our advisers told us in 1921, he is expecting far too much. It does not matter what advisers said now or then.  What really matters is what the truth is.</P>

      <P>In the document immediately preceding the Treaty there was an oath set down, and that oath was identical with the oath in Canada. If the President's contention, that the whole thing flows from Article 2, were well founded, that would have been completely unnecessary.  The British did insist on an oath here irrespective of what was done in Canada; they would not have needed to refer to any oath at all if, as the President says, it was implicit in our status when we took over in 1921.  So far as anything laid down specifically in the Treaty is concerned, we agree and have agreed always, and are prepared to continue to agree that change requires preliminary agreement between the Government of this country and the Government of Great Britain.  We have never at any time asserted or in any way implied that we intended to break any specific arrangement agreed to between us in the Treaty.  We have insisted in the matter of the development of status that there was a matter of interpretation and we have insisted, and will always continue to insist, that any attempt to interpret blatantly and clearly against the truth was a thing we were not going to stand for.  That is the position.  We stood for truth in the interpretation of status and we stood for truth, honour and our own interests in the interpretation of the specific clauses in the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney-General warns us that we are playing Mr. Thomas's game. He says that no one should be better aware of that than we are.  I cannot see how it can be said that we are playing Mr. Thomas's game in insisting that in the interpretation of a specific document between two peoples the clear and the obvious meaning of the <Col N="1173" /> word is the first thing to be accepted. It is only by agreement between them or by some superior court or something like that that the non-obvious and clear meaning of the thing should be accepted if it is against our interest.</P>
    <P>We are talked of as though we were standing up for British rights, the implication, to my mind, being that British rights and truth are identical. That has never been our point of view. Our point of view has always been that Irish rights and truth and our honour are identical.  If the Government, or the people of this country, do not want to be bothered with talk about honour, let them think of something which may mean more and which is of vital interest.  The existence and well-being of this country depend upon honour in this case.  They depend on the most religious observance of the Treaty on both sides.  We have not the military or naval forces to impose upon England a rigid observance of the Treaty.  She has that power to enforce it against us.  We must use our other weapons: that, in the eyes of the world, we are going to stand for honour and truth and justice between the two countries.  If we turn to the world and say: &ldquo;Honour, truth and justice be damned, we have certain blackguards in our country who do not want to take the Oath, and they are dearer to us than honour, truth and justice,&rdquo; then you are going, necessarily, to sacrifice the economic well-being of the whole people as well as our relations with Great Britain. You are going to sacrifice everything so that the consciences of the murderers of Kevin O'Higgins may be satisfied.</P>
    <P>If that is to be our line, then this Government is right and this country is going to disaster.  I do not know whether I have succeeded in making it clear to the Attorney-General that there is a vital difference between the points that we were dealing with and this point that he has now brought up&mdash;this matter of the Oath. If the British, on their side, attempted to suggest that some change in their relationship with Canada in any way changed the specific relationship between us and them, then we would equally have to protest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> There is another matter I want to refer to.  The President on Friday last said that if the British took reprisals against us he would at least have the satisfaction of having proved to the people that equality and freedom were all humbug.  Before the Bill goes finally through I would like to hear from the President what he means by reprisals.  Would, for instance, the placing of an embargo on our goods be counted as a reprisal?  Would the removal from us of the benefits of Imperial preference be counted as a reprisal, because, if so, I think you will find that most countries of the world would not only permit, but would insist on that reprisal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, when the Deputy who has just sat down addresses the House, one is always prepared to find that he does things just as is done with regard to the doctrine that I am supposed to be propounding.  He takes an obvious statement and twists it until nobody can recognise it in the twisting.  This damnable doctrine that I am supposed to have propounded is only damnable in the misrepresentation of it.  It is a well-known doctrine: the doctrine that if you interpret a treaty between two parties the assumption is that the stronger party has been able to impose its will upon the weaker to the extent, at any rate, of being able to express what its own will was, and that if you are going to interpret it you may reasonably assume that the strict meaning of the words should be applied in favour of the weaker party. That is the doctrine, and I submit that it is a reasonable doctrine and not a damnable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot of play made with the difference between the position of the Privy Council and the position of the Oath, One is implicit and the other is explicit.  Deputy Fitzgerald has tried to make out that there was a vast and a vital difference between the two positions.  There is, to my mind, the difference between tweedledum and tweedledee as far as this is concerned, that the right that is referred to in the Constitution&mdash; referred to as a right and recognised <Col N="1175" /> as a right by those who made the Constitution apparently&mdash;if it exists at all springs solely from the status Articles in the same way that the obligation to take this Oath springs from the status Articles.  I have been listening to the nonsense that has been spoken about the words of this particular Oath during the whole of the debate.  Is anyone going to suggest that Lord Birkenhead could not put in the words he wanted to put in: that he did not know the right words to use?  I submit that he did know and did use the right words, and that the words he used are to be taken to indicate that there was an assumption of acceptance of some Oath.</P>
    <P>The obligation to take the Oath arises from Article 2.  Article 4 was necessary simply because there was a variation in the form of the Oath to be taken.  Therefore, you have the words here &ldquo;The Oath to be taken shall be.&rdquo; If there was no question of an obligation to take an oath otherwise, being implied, there is no doubt whatever that what would have been added are the words in the Constitution&mdash;&ldquo;there shall be taken an oath&rdquo; or something of that kind.  It is quite obvious to anybody who reads the document as a whole that &ldquo;to be taken&rdquo; is a reference to the implied obligation in Article 2, and that obligation springs from an analogy between the position here and of Canada at the time.  It is by analogy, therefore, an oath was taken in Canada.  Our position was to be the same in the Free State.  It was to be by analogy with the position of Canada.  The Oath was taken there, but there was a variation of it provided for, and that was the variation that was put down in Article 4.</P>
    <P>Now our position is this: that just as Canada to-day could, without the slightest shadow of doubt, bring in a Bill to remove their oath, so we can bring in this Bill, and do it quite consistently with and without any violation of the Treaty.  It has not been proved on the other side that there is a violation of the Treaty.  A mere statement does not prove it.  The whole argument is on the assumption that <Col N="1176" /> there is a violation involved, but there has been no attempt whatever to prove that, none whatever.  All this argument about honour, the breaking of treaties and the sanctity of treaties and all the rest of it is based upon an assumption that has not been proved, but our contention is that we are not violating the Treaty in any respect whatever in bringing in this Bill to remove the Oath.  We are bringing in this Bill to remove the obligation to take the Oath in the same way that Canada might.  I say that we are doing that without in any way altering the force of law of the Treaty where it has the force of law here, and that we are not in any way altering the validity of the contract whatever validity the contract otherwise possesses.</P>
    <P>Now, it has been said that the introduction of Clause 2 in this Bill suggests a doubt in our minds as to whether we can do this without violating the Treaty.  I say that that is not the purpose at all for which the clause is introduced. We are asked on the other side, why not let this matter be decided by a court of law?  My answer to that is that the courts could not decide it, and I pointed that out in the Second Reading of the Bill.  The courts, if they gave a verdict in our favour, would not help our position a whit, because it would be said: &ldquo;Oh, it is your own courts did it.&rdquo;  If, on the other hand, they decided against us, if they made a mistake and decided against us&mdash;as I said before, mistakes can be made by judges just as well as they can be made by other people&mdash;then in that case the mistake would be irretrievable.  We would be told that &ldquo;even your own courts would not find in your favour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our attitude is that this should not be a matter for our own domestic courts at all.  This is a matter of the interpretation of a treaty which has to be taken up with the main parties. When we have got this Bill through and settled our own position with regard to our own attitude here then let the British talk about it.  Let them make their protest against it.  We are quite prepared to hear them.  We are quite prepared to hear what they have to say, but any dealings with them about this Oath will be as equals.  At <Col N="1177" /> the present moment, and in the present position here, we are inferior because they have imposed something upon us which is going to deprive us of that equality of status which is absolutely necessary for us if we are to talk with them about this Oath on equal terms.  We hold that what we are doing we are doing within the Treaty. There has been no argument on the other side to prove that we are not, except the argument that Article 4 can stand by itself and that the words &ldquo;to be taken&rdquo; are clearly by themselves mandatory.</P>
    <P>That is a construction of the document, apart from the whole texture of the document.  Mr. Lloyd George, in his communication to Mr. Griffith on 10th December, 1921&mdash;I forget the exact date, but, from 10th to 13th December, 1921&mdash;pointed out the difference between these status Articles and the other Articles of the Treaty.  He pointed that out quite clearly, and indicated also that the position was not to be a static, but a progressive one, and we hold that Articles 1 and 4 have been given effect to, and that they have progressed to the point at which they are best expressed by the statement that anything Canada can do, anything that Britain can do, in virtue of their status, we can do.  Is there anybody here who is going to deny, for one moment, that if the British House of Commons considered that it would be in the interests of peace in that country, or otherwise, they could bring in an Act to-morrow without consulting anybody else, to remove, from the members of Parliament, the obligation of taking the oath which they at present take?  As a matter of fact, we know that the whole history of the imposition of the oath in England proves quite clearly that it is something which the British Parliament brought in at a certain stage, mainly for religious reasons.</P>

      <P>And that later on, they could get rid of it, if it served their purpose.  A lot of play has been made from the other side, in regard to the difference between power and right.  We have not been arguing <Col N="1178" /> about our power to do certain things, but about our right to do these things. We have heard the argument about our legal right and the moral right.  I do not know if I referred to that myself at all, but, as far as I am concerned, the view I hold is, that nations are capable of expressing their moral rights by treaties, and by laws, and that we have only to interpret the law here, in order to secure the moral situation.  We have the moral right to do everything contained in this Treaty&mdash;there is no quibbling about that.  We are not doing something suggested by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, when he said that we are trying to do something, like a person who had pleaded the Statute of Limitations to get out of a just debt.  We are doing nothing of the kind.  In fact, as I said, our right to do this is the real test of whether or not we have that co-equality which is boasted about so much by members of the Opposition. The point has been made by Deputy J. M. O'Sullivan&mdash;I think it was he&mdash; about the Schedule in the Treaty.  If he had studied the matter carefully he would have found that, right through several Articles of the Constitution, there is a reference to the Scheduled Treaty, and the Schedule, from that point of view, is necessary by way of reference.</P>

      <P>There is reference to this particular set of Articles; you want something down there&mdash;some of the things you refer to&mdash;because in the Constitution, as they drafted it at that time, they chose that particular way of writing the Constitution.  We could write it completely differently to-morrow if we wanted to, and leave the Treaty as we propose to-day on one side, as having the same effect as any treaty between any two nations.  We propose to do it, at any rate, to the extent set out in Clause 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the only points that seem to me to call for reply, and it seems to me that the amendment would simply leave a piece of decayed timber. The words &ldquo;shall be,&rdquo; etc., have no particular meaning in the Treaty, <Col N="1179" /> without the imperative words that compel the taking of the Oath.  There is no sense, whatever, in leaving them remain.  We have either to take it out completely, or else to put in words which remove any ambiguity.  Our attitude, at any rate, is that we can remove this Article, and we are doing it, without in any way infringing the Treaty, and I submit that there has been no argument from the other side proving that there is an infringement of the Treaty.</P>

Do I understand that all this matter as to comparison between the action with regard to the Privy Council and the action with regard to the Oath will fall for discussion when the section comes to be considered?  If so, we can leave them aside, at the moment, and deal with the one point.  I am presuming that is the case.  May I take that for granted?</P>

      <P>Then I propose to confine what I have to say to the amendment which is supposed to be under discussion.  There was an amendment <Col N="1180" /> put down in my name to delete, not the whole of Article 17, but only certain words.  I want to get an answer, if there is an answer, from those who refuse to accept that amendment.  The point has been clarified by the President in his last speech.  He says that the obligatory force with regard to the Oath comes from Article 2 and not from Article 4; that Article 4 by itself means nothing.  That is his contention.  I ask to have inserted in the Constitution, Article 4 only, not Article 2.  We have been told that Article 4 by itself would not impose an obligation.  I want to have that tested.  I want to have that brought before impartially - minded people, people accustomed to rule on such matters, accustomed to the niceties of constitutional law.  We want simply to leave it in the Constitution as it is in Article 4.  We are not going to import into the Constitution, as far as the amendment is concerned, that part of the Treaty which, according to the President, gives the Oath its obligatory force.  We are taking only the part which, according to him, is either meaningless or else leaves the Oath optional.  What is the objection to leaving these words in on the part of people who hold they are meaningless, or else leave the Oath optional, when they are moving to take away the obligation imposed by law?  That point has not been answered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The President's contention is that if you had a document to construe you would bring in the part which gave it its obligation. I was leaving that out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have the thing argued.  Two Articles are brought to bear on the question of the Oath, and the President's contention is that the second of these Articles, Article 4, is either meaningless at the best, or it is such that the Oath could be declared optional.  The first of the two Articles, Article 2 of the Treaty, is that which <Col N="1181" /> gave the Oath its obligatory force.  I say leave out the Article which is going to give it the obligatory force that the President says is there, and leave only for the discretion of the judges the Article which says, either nothing at all, according to the President in one of his statements, or else that the Oath is optional, and that is being refused.  Why?  Because there is a conscience and a fear behind it distinctly. I said previously: look at the tribunal it is going to go before.  We were told by several speakers on the other side that the Chief Justice, when acting as Attorney-General, declared that the Oath was not mandatory.  I do not know whether he said that or not &mdash;I do not know that he did.  We are told that another member of the present judiciary, who was then on the Constitution Committee, was also of the opinion that the Oath was not mandatory. We are going to put before a tribunal, biassed in that way, not the whole Treaty, or Article 2, which might be said to be obligatory, but only this meaningless Article, and the Party that is so strong in its belief that the Oath is not obligatory is frightened to accept that test before its own judges, who are biassed, because it is said they have already declared that the combination of the two Articles did not make the thing obligatory.  We only propose to put in that one Article, and there is the contention that they will hold it is obligatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The contention is very simple.  You are leaving what was in fact a form of oath and taking away the obligation to impose it.  If you got a thing like that away altogether from the Articles of Agreement, as an Article of the Constitution, you would naturally be inclined to make it obligatory, because it was away from the whole context in connection with which it would be interpreted. You remove it from its whole setting. You import it into the Constitution, where naturally you will say to yourself, &ldquo;What is the idea of putting into the Constitution a form of words if you do not have the imposition of them?&rdquo; It seems to me you could not leave it there.</P>

      <P>Our position is that all the Articles of the Treaty are there. Whatever force or validity the Treaty had at any time, it is still left there. What we are doing is, we are taking away the imposition here, which is a domestic matter.  Whatever test we care to put on our own people is our own affair at the present time, anyhow. Whatever it may have been in 1921, it is certainly our own affair to-day.  I say that if there is any reality in this co-equality, then we are quite free, on account of the whole situation arising from Articles 1 to 4, to remove that domestic test.</P>

      <P>We can leave out co-equality if we are only asking to put into the Constitution an Article which says that the Oath is optional. If I brought forward a clause which got the President's approval as being merely an optional phrase, a phrase which imposes no obligation with regard to the Oath, and imported that into our Constitution, would he say that the putting in of a phrase about the Oath in an optional way derogates from co-equality?  Surely not.  That is what we are proposing.  We are proposing to put into the Constitution one of the two Articles.  A combination of the two, according to the President, makes the Oath obligatory, because Article 2 overrides Article 4. I say to him, &ldquo;Put in Article 4 alone, removing Article 2, which imposes the obligation,&rdquo; and the answer is that the judges, when getting that without the context, will be bound to decide that the words &ldquo;to be&rdquo; are mandatory. That is what we said all along, and now we have your own confession about it.</P>

In the case of a number of people they do not realise the implication in Article 2 of the words &ldquo;to be.&rdquo;  If you had Article 4 by itself, you would have to ask yourself the question, &ldquo;Is it not a strange thing that a lawyer would put words of that kind into a document?  The implicit obligation is in Article 2, which quite a number of people did not see.</P>

Therefore, we are opposing the putting in of this one part. By putting in one here the meaning that would be attached to it would be obviously different from the meaning attached to it if you had it in relation to another.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>To have the courts deciding an international matter.  As I have shown, such a system works to the disadvantage of the country, because a judgment of its own courts would not be accepted by the other parties, who will say that the courts are prejudiced, whereas if a judgment was got against you in your own courts, it completely rules out all chance of having the matter considered favourably between the two countries, because it would be said that even your own courts decided against you.  On the ground of principle, therefore, you <Col N="1184" /> cannot separate Articles 2 and 4 without giving Article 4, by itself, a meaning it would not otherwise have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had replied earlier on that point as to bringing the Treaty into domestic legislation.  I agree with the President when he stated that that was unusual but I say equally firmly and accurately that it is a most usual and normal thing to have any Treaty taken up in certain of its clauses in domestic legislation.  And if the judges were going to decide on that clause only the Treaty is nowhere about.  They are not deciding on the Treaty but what the President believes to be the optional phrase and it is safe for the President to trust his own courts, biassed as they have been described from their previous history, to decide that.  There may be strength in the contention that if our judges came to a particular decision in favour of the contention of the President the British would not accept it, but what a wonderfully strong position, morally and legally, the President would be in if he got such a decision; and the mere fact that he avoids it very much weakens the position he believes he has.</P>

We are supposed to be co-equal with England and to have the same powers with regard to the Free State that the British House of Commons has with regard to her England.  It has been held in a case of this kind that it was wrong to submit a matter of this kind to any jurisdiction except that of the House of Commons.</P>

      <P>I have been listening to this debate and in the unique position of having an open mind upon it I listened to Deputy McGilligan's usual cogent and powerful argument on the <Col N="1186" /> question.  I would like to find out whether it could possibly be maintained that the words of Article 4, detached from the words of Article 2, would carry the same meaning they do when they stand admittedly as a definite Article to Article 2.  Article 2 lays down status.  I shall not read the whole of it but it seems to me that Article 4 proceeds to set out the terms of the Oath as required in Article 2. That is at least one point of view.  Can any one maintain that the Article in the language of Article 4 &ldquo;The Oath to be taken by members of the Parliament of the Irish Free State shall be in the following form&rdquo; appearing in a statute alone, that that is making the same case as one makes when it is standing with Article 2?</P>
      <P>Of course if it stood alone an argument would be put up of quite a different character if it were detached from Article 2.  I do not want to deal with that as I expect the President dealt with it from the Fianna Fáil point of view.  From my point of view if Article 4 stood alone the &ldquo;to be&rdquo; argument is not a very complete one, but when Article 4 is read in conjunction with Article 2 quite a different situation arises and you have to make up your mind at what state of development Article 2 has arrived before you deal with Article 4.  If you leave Article 4 in a Constitution where Article 2 does not appear at all, then a different and a much more complicated situation arises.  I am afraid if I say more on this matter I will be called to order for discussing Section 2 of the Bill.  I should say I see all the difference in the world between Article 4, standing in conjunction with Article 2, and Article 4 alone in a statute as the Constitution would be.</P>

      <P>Why does the Attorney-General think like that?  If the Deputy would think less and had listened to what for the last few days has been said it would shorten the discussion. No one denies the legal rights and the Attorney-General knows that, and the attempt to drag in legal rights is an attempt to confuse the issue.  We are a sovereign Parliament and have sovereign rights and the Attorney-General knows that.  His case is that legally and morally we are in the same position in taking out the Oath as we were in taking out the Privy Council.</P>

      <P>He need not drag in the legal point.  If we are sovereign, we have all the legal rights the same as Germany and France have their legal rights.  But apart from this question of interpreting what somebody tells us is what we mean when we take out Article 4, will the President tell us that he befogged the country?  What are we after?  When we take out Article 4&mdash;we are taking out the acknowledgment of the King.  Is that not true?  Is that not the intention?  That is the only Article that recognises the King.  The King is in the Constitution and I am talking of taking out the Oath.  Let me put it another way: When we take out Article 4 and announce our intention that nobody here shall take the Oath that is in the Treaty, then we take the King out. I only want to clear up the position. If the King is in our Constitution&mdash; and the King is here by reason of the Governor-General's presence and is in existence in the Oireachtas&mdash;it is the King, the Dáil and the Seanad&mdash;if it is the intention to leave the King in the sense that the Legislature is the King, the Dáil and the Seanad, what is the objection to Article 4?  What exactly do you mean&mdash;what does the President or the Fianna Fáil Party mean when they take out Article 4?  The President and the Attorney-General stated that the Canadians would have the right to refuse to take the Oath, a legal right. <Col N="1188" /> For the sake of argument&mdash;I may not know as much constitutional law as the President or the Attorney-General&mdash;let me admit that, let us have that admitted once and for all.  Supposing the Canadians took the Oath out of their Constitution or whatever Agreement or Treaty they have, what exactly would they mean by that?  Can you conceive any civilised body of people taking an Oath out of their Constitution or their Agreement without on the other hand intending to declare a Republic?</P>

I cannot for the life of me understand the national point of view which is willing to see the King in the legislative machine, in the machinery for making laws&mdash;the King, the Dáil, and the Seanad&mdash;which is willing, let me go the whole distance, which is even anxious to see the King here as part of the legislative machine but draws the line at acknowledging him or recognising him, nor can anyone <Col N="1189" /> else.  I do not for a moment want to get involved in the particular point which the Deputy raised.  I want him to answer me a specific question.  Is it an understandable national point of view that this Irish nation should be anxious&mdash;I go that far&mdash;to see the King, anxious for whatever reasons, material or otherwise, as part of our legislative machine, as part of the machine which makes legislation, which governs the interests and the life of every man in the country, to see him there and yet will not acknowledge him and will go to the length of civil war to prevent an acknowledgment of him?</P>
      <P>Is that a possible situation?  Is that a situation that anybody believes that any country except a fourth-rate country would take up?  I want to put this genuine question from my point of view.

That is the real question here.  That is not a question for lawyers or pettifoggers.  It is only a question for pettifogging lawyers, because there are lawyers and pettifogging lawyers.</P>

I want to be clear, and I want to put it this way to him: Does he take up the position that this State wants to see the King as part of its legislative machine and is willing to see the King as part of the legislative machinery of the <Col N="1190" /> country, of the sovereign Parliament of the country and at same time does not want to acknowledge him?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Look here, sir, I want to tell the Deputy who made that observation that my immediate ancestors &mdash;ancestors is the only word I can use &mdash;spent their time and money in keeping the Republican organisation alive in their own country, and every Deputy of Fianna Fáil from that county knows that.  If the Ceann Comhairle were in the Chair, no one knows it better than he.  I am making no excuses to President de Valera or any Deputy on the benches across there for my Republicanism or for my Nationalism.  It is better than theirs and much longer in this country than theirs.  I am no parvenu here.  I am not going to make <Col N="1191" /> any excuses here for my action on this very important measure.  I come back to the point, are the Nationalists of the country willing to see the King in the legislative machinery but will not acknowledge him?  That is the real question.  All the rest is pettifogging, face-saving, lawyers' quibbles, and nothing else.  In reply to that question I can see two answers.  I can understand two answers to that question&mdash;one from the people who say that &ldquo;whatever the inconvenience or whatever the losses may be, we want to see the King out and have a Republic either now or soon afterwards.&rdquo;  Is that what the Deputy means?  That is the question that every man, whether he is Republican or anti-Republican, down the country is asking.  That is the question we are entitled to vote on.</P>
      <P>When I was speaking the other night Deputy Norton said: &ldquo;Why did you not leave the Referendum in?&rdquo;  I can tell you.  The Referendum was used to trick the people.  The idea underlying the use which President de Valera was going to make of the Referendum three or four years ago was to try and trick the people just as he tried to trick them about the Oath at the last election.  There was no such issue as the Oath at the last election.  If you go down through the country and ask the electors about the Oath <i>simpliciter</i>, what would they answer?  Do they want the Oath or not?  Nobody cares very much whether it is an oath or a declaration.  The real question to put to this country is: Do you want to remain in or to go outside the British Empire?  That is the real question to put to the country; that is the honest question to put to the country; that is the real issue here and not any other issue.  And will the Attorney-General, who knows so much, tell me: Is taking the Oath out of the Treaty and the Constitution&mdash;because that is the meaning of it&mdash;is that going to be a Republic or is it going to mean separation?  Would the President tell me that?  Does he know?  He does not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not in a position <Col N="1192" /> to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that question; and that is really the serious question for the country.  Does the taking of the Oath out of the Constitution and bringing about a state of affairs in which no Deputy entering this House will take the Oath or acknowledge the King in any way&mdash; does that mean the establishment of a Republic outside the British Empire? That is the real question.  Is the President in a position to answer it? He is quick to interrupt if he is.  He is not in a position to answer that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question that has been asked half a dozen times in this debate, and it has not been answered yet; and it is a question that should have been answered long ago.  The working people of the country, whom you are representing here, are not concerned about saving President de Valera's face or with making legal reputations.  They are concerned with their own material interests; and their own material interests are going to be heavily affected by the answer to that question. That is the question that should be really answered here.  Is the taking of this Oath out of the Constitution, and refusing to allow Deputies to take the Oath when entering this House and Senators when entering the Seanad&mdash;is that going to mean the establishment of a Republic outside the Empire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To go back, I agree that that is the line that a certain small section of doctrinaire Republicans take in this country; and that is a line that I can appreciate.  But if that is the President's line, should we not be told it? Should not the country be told it? Should not the country get an opportunity of saying whether they are in favour of the Oath or not?  I want to put this seriously to the Labour Party, because it does affect the poor, because it affects unemployment, because it affects every interest which they have at stake: If this is the real issue, if the real issue to the country is&mdash;are you going to go outside or to stay within the British Empire? <Col N="1193" />&mdash;should not the country get an opportunity of saying what they mean on that before this Bill is passed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Without duress, the Deputy says.  The country has a right to react to duress.  The Deputies sitting here, and the Fianna Fáil Deputies, who are not, I claim, of better timber than the Deputies sitting here&mdash;we all have to yield to duress. The French had to yield to duress, and the Germans had to yield to duress. Supposing that the Treaty was signed under the threat of an immediate and terrible war, has not Thomas Walsh, my next-door neighbour, a right to take that into account, and has not Thomas Murphy, in the County Tipperary, a right to take that into account?  Has not every civilised man to take the reactions which are against him into account and act accordingly? I do not care if this country deliberately decides to defy duress and to go through anything that the people may have to go through in spite of duress.  But what I do object to is that the country has got no real chance of deciding on the real issue: and that is, whether we want to remain within the Empire or separate.  That is the real issue.  And if that is not the real issue we are in the most humiliating position that the Parliament of any country was ever in, because if the issue is not separation or remaining within the British Empire, then all the talk and all the legal opinions that we have been treated to have been so much waste of time.  Because, what then is the issue?  And I put this to Deputy Dillon: If that is not the issue, then the issue is that there are men who want to remain within the Empire. who want to see the King part of their legislative and constitutional machinery, but they will not say it. What a degrading, futile, childish position for Irish nationalism to sink to! That is the point of view I hold firmly to.  That is the point of view I put steadily before the country, and to which I have never got any decent, fair or square answer yet.  I put it to the President that he is trying to <Col N="1194" /> walk on a tight-rope.  I put it to him that there are only two issues, and that he has not put either.  We put our view to the country.  We told the country: You are independent, you can exercise your independence as you wish, we suggest to you that you should exercise it by remaining within the Empire.  Has not that been our line?  Is that not a straight line, an understandable line?  What has been President de Valera's line?  He has not gone to the country and said: I stand for a Republic, for separation, for no connection with England.  He will tell me that the people are not ready.  Of course, I shall be told whenever the people are ready.  I am not talking of what he will do, but of the issues put before the electors.  He went to the country and he told the people: We will take out the Oath, we will not break the Treaty, and then he told the people what they were really asking: There will be no unemployment and there will be no work. That is what he told them.  The people voted for the latter part of his programme: No unemployment and no work; and they did that after he had given them an undertaking that for his own reasons he would take the Oath out of the Treaty, but would not go outside the Empire and would not break the Treaty.  Is not that what happened?  Is not that what is going to happen?  We have a Bill to take the Oath out of the Constitution, to withdraw all legal validity from the Treaty.</P>

      <P>Fortunately, I have just one or two sentences with which to conclude.  We have here a Bill which seeks to take the Oath out of the Constitution. We have a Bill which will withdraw all legal validity from the <Col N="1196" /> Treaty.  What I want to know from the Attorney-General, and particularly from the President, is whether, when that Bill is passed, we will not be outside the British Commonwealth of Nations?  Can the President say whether we will or not?  I suggest to the Labour Party that they should listen to the answer and satisfy themselves about it.  If in fact we are, then this country has been tricked and grossly tricked.</P>

      <P>It certainly gives one great satisfaction to see our new model Opposition going through their paces in this not very brilliant debate.  One would imagine that this subject has been adequately discussed, not merely during the past four or five years, but during the past ten years and that the country is well aware of the different points and has long ago made up its mind why a decision ought to be taken and the decision that the country wants is the decision that this Government are now looking for.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Hogan talks about pettifogging lawyers I wonder whether in this country or outside it one could find a more pettifogging lawyer or one who deals in greater quibbles than he himself does?  He knows that in 1923 not alone did the former Government impose this Oath upon the members of the Dáil in spite of some of the best legal advice in the country, but they went so far as to impose declarations embodying a somewhat similar oath upon all civil servants. Even the poor teacher of Irish who had to go round the country was compelled by these gentlemen to take an oath of allegiance, to forswear his nationality, in order that he might be allowed to teach the national language. They compelled civil servants and forced teachers to make this declaration; they compelled the members of the Dáil, and their whole argument is that there was something honourable and something right and something just about this arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney-General and other speakers on this side have, I think, sufficiently demonstrated that there was no great legality about it.  The <Col N="1197" /> legality, it has been clearly shown, is on our side in the action we now propose to take.  When we come to consider all the talk about public honour, national honour, honesty and enlightenment, the right thing, the decent thing and all the other bosh we have listened to recently, I wonder do the people who say those things really represent this country or is there anything in the theory that this is a separate nation?  What was all the pother about before this wonderful Treaty was brought along?  The Irish Party, as I said a few days ago, in its most degenerate days never subscribed to some of the remarkable declarations the gentlemen on the opposite side gave utterance to.  They would have us believe that the Irish people think there is something of national honour involved in taking a declaration that we do not want to take.</P>
    <P>I must protest against the effort to make the people believe that Englishmen have taken up a definite attitude about this test.  The Opposition Party pretend that there is a body of feeling in this country deeply concerned about the Oath.</P>

      <P>I maintain that the people of this country do not care twopence about this test and that is one of the reasons they want to get rid of it.  Further, they know that the Government that has in the forefront of its policy the taking away of this test has given them peace since it came into office.  They are prepared to support this Government and the sooner we succeed in doing away with this test perhaps the better for all of us.  The country wants to give this Government a chance to carry out its programme; to give it a chance of maintaining the peaceful conditions that have existed since we took over office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies on the opposite side want to brush that aside.  How strange are their speeches from what we used to hear when we sat in opposition.  We were told of the dreadful evils that would happen when Fianna Fáil took office.  We do not hear much of that <Col N="1198" /> argument now.  The country knows there was nothing in it and as time goes on the country will begin to realise exactly who has been deceiving it.  We are told of the evil things that will take place when the Oath is abolished.  Where are all the evil things we were told would happen? Is the great British Empire waiting for Deputies Hogan, Cosgrave and the rest of them to hurl questions at us as to whether we are to remain in the British Empire before they make up their minds as to what they are going to do with us&mdash;that is, if they think it wise or prudent to do anything?</P>
    <P>The British Government had not to wait for the Opposition Party in this House to put questions before it made up its mind as to what it would do. The British Government knows this matter has been going on for years, has been discussed and fought out in election campaigns.  It knows that in spite of all the dreadful things threatened and in spite of the feeling of panic they tried to create that conditions were never so peaceful. We were told that no man's life would be safe if Fianna Fáil were elected; that a man would not be safe going home from the fair with 2/- in his pocket; that some morning he might awake and find his house burning. The people are in no mood to be trifled with.  They have a serious position to cope with because of the existing economic difficulties.  In spite of all their dread prophecies the country turned down those now on the Opposition Benches.  When they were ten years in office how was it they never had the courage, the prudence, the discretion to test the feelings of the country?  They never gave the country an opportunity to express in a clear and emphatic way its opinion upon this single issue.</P>
    <P>In the last election Fianna Fáil could not disentangle this question from every other question.  I submit that in so far as it is possible under any system of election to get a mandate on a single question, the Fianna Fáil Party have got a definite mandate and it is a mandate on this particular issue.  That is not denied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The ex-Minister for Agriculture tries to get over that question of the mandate by trying to throw dust in the eyes of the public as to what the British Government are going to do.  What are the British Government going to do?  Surely the British Government have got quite sufficient encouragement from their allies here during the past two or three weeks to do their damnedest, and let them do it.  This Party is prepared to go out of office on this issue and if we do go out of office it will be all the sooner that we will come back, and come back with a clear and unequivocal majority.</P>
      <P>It was not for fun that people like myself refused to take this test when it was put up to us, when we were in public employment.  We refused to take it.  We refused to forswear our principles.  Is it suggested that Englishmen or men in any other country would want Irishmen to take a test in which they in conscience do not believe?  But supposing that we agree that the theory of the present Opposition is right and that this thing should be left as it is, then the question of peace in this country, the question of our mandate, the economic policy in which the present Opposition professes to be interested would have to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have loudly proclaimed what a model Opposition they are, how they are out to be constructive and helpful and that they are going to help the Fianna Fáil Government along the right road.  These experienced statesmen are going to help the Fianna Fáil Government along the road to progress.  Even if we assume that their contention is correct, if we give up this whole matter to-day and say that we are not going to proceed with it any further, is that going to be any great victory for the British Empire?  I wonder will it?  Will the British Empire be safer or more secure in the hearts of the people if we leave this question as it is or as it has been?  What satisfaction will it be to the British <Col N="1200" /> Government or to anybody else to feel that this test which is degrading in its nature and which cannot last, is enforced here?  I submit that from the democratic point of view it cannot last.</P>
    <P>This test is going to go.  We all know that the symbols of Imperialistic paraphernalia are falling away; that they are being destroyed and are going into dissolution in every country in the world.  This thing will ultimately fade away.  I do not think anybody will contend that it will not.  When it is clear that this measure will be to the advantage of the country, when it is clear that it will mean a whole-hearted national effort to advance upon our economic difficulties and try to solve them, when it is clear that the abolition of this test will bring that consummation about and will bring about a new feeling of cordiality, friendliness and permanent peace to this country, would it not be a shame for anybody to put the whole thing back again and plunge the whole country into controversy which might never end?</P>
    <P>Would it not be better to get away from these things?  We are going to go through with it.  When I am told that the people interested in it are only doctrinaires, or on the other hand, that they are the murderers of Kevin O'Higgins and so on, and that no attention should be paid to them, I say that they have a far better right to speak in this matter than some of the members on the opposite side.  They represent the national feeling, however wrong their actions may have been, or however we might disagree with them.  We on this side have never challenged them as exponents of real national feeling.  We believe they are animated by worthy sentiments.  The pity is that the late Government had not the patriotism and the statesmanship to take many years ago the step we propose to take and thereby solve this question.</P>
    <P>Had that step been taken it is quite possible that these murders would not have taken place and that the dissensions would long since have disappeared. The Deputies on the Opposition side of the House would <Col N="1201" /> have been quite free long ago to go about their business.  I do not believe that they need have the slightest fears now.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Opposition are fair to themselves or to the country in taking up this attitude. Nobody wants them to take up this attitude. Nobody has asked the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to do so; no body of national opinion in this country representative of the old Sinn Féin movement has asked them to take up this attitude.  Why should they take it up?  Have the British Government asked them?  I do not think so. Why are they persisting in this? Undoubtedly, they are disappointed in being out of office.  According to themselves, they hope to be back soon. Well, they need not feel so terribly disappointed if their hopes are genuine.  It seems they are so disappointed and angry with the Irish people that they are prepared, instead of giving the House an exhibition of what decent, honest and sportsmanlike Opposition should be, to enter on a campaign which may last for a considerable time and betray a huckstering and denunciatory spirit here in this House, a thing which I submit will not do the country any good.  The only effect of it is to hamper the Government and perhaps that is the real object of it.  Is it to prevent the country from realising the seriousness of the economic position in which the Opposition Party profess to be so interested that they are not prepared to allow the country to go along and tackle all those problems arising out of unemployment, agricultural depression and the other problems that we are confronted with in the Budget?</P>
    <P>We have no apologies to offer in regard to this matter for it is a national question.  We have not intervened in this debate because it is a matter that we cannot argue.  We have the feeling that there should be no argument about this matter.  We have had always the same feeling. We have always been consistent about it and we are consistent about it now.  I believe in the present circumstances the overwhelming body of the <Col N="1202" /> Irish people will agree with us in the efforts we are making.  On historical, democratic and plain, national grounds we want to get rid of this test. Even viewing it from the narrowest possible compass, we appeal to our friends across the Channel to regard it as a conscience test, a test that has been reduced, as the President pointed out, to something worse than a nullity, to a regular farce by the interpretation that the late Government put upon it.  Is it seriously contended that any men of intelligence and enlightenment at the other side of the Channel want to maintain this conscience test?</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is any large body of opinion in England in favour of it.  I know that there is a certain type of newspaper in Britain which will be very anxious to have speeches made in this House, such as have been made by the chief Opposition Party.  It will give the &ldquo;Die-hards&rdquo;&mdash;the people who are always anxious to make Irishmen in England feel that they are inferior beings &mdash;encouragement.  The Opposition Party should really examine that question seriously, to see whether in all this talk about standing up for national honour and so on, they are really thinking of the ordinary Englishman in the street&mdash;the ordinary fair-minded Englishman.  Their arguments seem to be directed to evoking some answering echo, some reply from the Tory Press in Great Britain. Has not this country reached a nice position in our historical evolution when the gentlemen whom the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; and other English organs, that maligned and treated in a way that no Irishman with any sense and spirit could do anything but resent&mdash;is it not a strange situation to have the Opposition to-day making exactly the same case in this House that the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; and other English newspapers and the people that they speak for in Great Britain are making?  I submit that the Opposition Party had a great opportunity of getting on to really solid national ground in this debate and bringing about the unity that the Irish people so ardently desire.  The people recognise that there must be <Col N="1203" /> differences of opinion in this House on economic and on political questions, but I think that 99 per cent. of the Irish people, those of them who took a part in the struggle for independence and helped to establish this House and this Government, would be anxious that we should come together finally, and that we should have some definite, national programme on which we could agree.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has studied the present question and who can disentangle the realities from the fog in which the Opposition have striven to envelop it, cannot do otherwise than believe that we are merely carrying out a policy that the late Government tried to carry out.  We are trying to carry out the same policy that it was shown in this House they tried to carry out, and that they announced they were going to carry out, with regard to the Privy Council.  With regard to that matter, may I remind those who are greatly worried about Section 2 of the Bill that when we want to put this question beyond yea or nay in the Bill, when we want to take it out of the competence of the courts here to invalidate any action we may now take, we have a very good reason for doing so.  The reason is that we cannot be sure that the present Opposition Party, either that portion of it led by Deputy Cosgrave or that portion led by Deputy Thrift, will not take steps afterwards to take this matter to the Privy Council.  If they have not in the back of their minds the idea of taking this question to the Privy Council, to try to override the legislative act of this House in that way, what on earth is the meaning of the opposition to this section?</P>
    <P>I believe the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in taking up their present attitude does not represent any considerable section of national opinion. They may persuade themselves into the belief that they are evolving some new policy on the lines of the policy of the late Irish Party in the British House of Commons.  I do not think they are up to that standard because the Irish Party in the British House of Commons, however we differed from them, <Col N="1204" /> on all possible occasions stood up, not only for the rights of their own country, and for its independence, but for the rights of every subject nation.  The present Opposition Party, which succeeded during its last couple of months in office in carrying into force a Coercion Act that has been a headline for those who are repressing nationalism throughout the world, have now the temerity to tell us that they have discovered a wonderful new policy of Irish nationalism.  I think if the leaders of the Irish Party were here, and if all the circumstances were explained to them, nobody would be more surprised or more perturbed than they, that having got an independent and sovereign State, as we are told, an independent and sovereign legislature, we should have an Opposition Party whose chief object and chief function in the public life of the country seem to be to try to bedraggle or put some stigma upon us when we are taking national action, action in which we have the people behind us, that we are not ashamed to take and that there is nothing dishonourable or discreditable about.  That is what I call the inferiority complex.  It indicates that those gentlemen in spite of their ten years in office do not know the real feelings of the Irish people.  If they think that the last election did not give sufficient indication of the feelings of the Irish people on national questions, I submit that the sooner the Irish people get an opportunity of expressing their opinion in a more definite way &mdash;in a more unequivocal way, if that is possible&mdash;then the better for all of us.  If the Opposition really believes that we have come here to do honest work, if they are anxious to cooperate with us in trying to put into effect an economic policy which will get our country out of its present difficulties, I submit they are going the very worst way about it.  They are not fair to themselves and not fair to the country.  They ought to have more patriotism and they really should have learned more than to pretend to think that a Party which has lost its love for Ireland, whose only weapon is fear of England, which waves that weapon in the <Col N="1205" /> face of the Irish people has the slightest chance of coming back to power.</P>

      <P>I hope I am in order in discussing the amendment. The Government Benches have wakened up.  They are making, so far, all the speeches relevant to the Second Reading which they are sorry they did not make last week.  We have certainly had that from more than one speaker on the Government Benches.  Deputy Dillon asked whether there was any person who held that Article 4 by itself would be mandatory.  I would say, yes.  I hold that it would.  I will say further that everybody at the time the Treaty was signed&mdash;I only know of one exception where a tentative view was put forward to the contrary&mdash;held that Article 4 was mandatory.  The signatories on both sides not merely held that the Oath was mandatory, but that Article 4 was mandatory.  We have heard arguments from the President.  It is very strange that all the years he was in opposition he never put up that argument.  It is very strange that he never put it up at the recent elections.  His theory then was that the Oath had not been made mandatory in the Treaty.  I am quoting his own words from a speech he made at Carrick-on-Shannon&mdash;that the Oath had not been made mandatory.  I submit that if Deputy Dillon or any other Deputy has any doubts as to whether Article 4, standing by itself, is mandatory or not, and wants to know whether any court would hold that, the way to find that out is to vote for the amendment.  The amendment will give that opportunity.  It will give the people an opportunity of testing that precise matter, whether under the Treaty or in the position in which we are now, Article 4 is or is not mandatory.  Does anybody hold that Articles 1 and 2 by themselves would have imposed an oath?  I suggest they would not.  They deal with allegiance and have got nothing whatever to do with whether members entering Parliament take the Oath or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Articles 1 and 2 make no reference to an oath.  They have merely got to do with questions of allegiance, with <Col N="1206" /> acknowledgment of the Crown as a symbol of the sovereign authority, so far as this State is concerned.  There is no mandatory force in Article 1 or Article 2 so far as any oath is concerned. So far as any oath is mandatory in the Treaty, it can only be under Article 4.  I understand the argument put up to be that if there is an obligation to take this Oath it comes not from Article 4 but from Articles 1 and 2.  These Articles by themselves would not have imposed any such obligation.  I think the argument of the President was that Article 4 was in respect of this matter simply a variation of Articles 1 and 2&mdash;that Articles 1 and 2 imposed an oath of a certain kind, namely, the Oath taken in Canada, South Africa, Australia and other Dominions, and that Article 4 simply prescribed a modification of that Oath.  No such oath is prescribed either directly or indirectly in Article 2.  Articles 1 and 2 deal with allegiance. Article 4 gives a sanction so far as the definite acknowledgment of that allegiance by certain persons is concerned. That is the only Article that deals with the Oath.</P>
    <P>I am now dealing merely with the amendment.  The question as to the value and position of the Oath can be discussed on the section.  So far as the amendment is concerned, if there are Deputies, like Deputy Dillon, in doubt as to whether or not Article 4, standing by itself, is mandatory, then the way to find out and to get that question answered is not by statements from this side or the opposite side of the House and not by alleged opinions, which may never have existed, but by appealing to the supreme legal authority in this country.  Deputies who are in doubt can find out for themselves by voting for this amendment. As the Deputy in whose name the amendment is down, I should say that there were other courses which we could have taken.  This is not the best course to take.  There were other courses open to us.  These courses have been rejected.  A lot of the statements indulged in here can be tested by adopting this amendment.  The suggestion that matter contained in a treaty should not be tested before a court of <Col N="1207" /> law is a new suggestion.  It is by no means exceptional for treaties to be given the force of domestic law.  Most of the conventions of the League of Nations, as the President will find out if he has not already found out, are in that position.  The countries are asked whether or not their domestic law is in accord with the convention they have accepted.  If not, they are given time to bring their domestic legislation into accord with it.  You are not asked to take over the Treaty into your Bill.  What you are asked to do is to take that provision of the Treaty into your Bill.  That is all the amendment asks you to do.  You are asked in this particular respect to bring your domestic legislation, or municipal legislation, as it is called, into accord with your international obligations.  The Government refuse to do so.  The President suggested that he did not want to elevate this Treaty into a position over other treaties, though in fact he has done so.  In this Bill, it is left in a peculiar and particular position.  If he wanted to do as he says, he could have done it in another Bill.  I suggest that there is a fear on the part of the Government that any court would interpret Article 4 as mandatory.  Therefore, I ask the House to support the amendment.</P>

    <P>As Deputies are aware, when an Order is made under the Customs Duties (Provisional Imposition) Act imposing a duty, the Resolution has to be submitted to the Dáil within ten sitting days and approved of by the Dáil.  Otherwise the duty ceases to have effect and any revenue secured under it has to be repaid.  Within another period of ten sitting days a Bill must be submitted to the Dáil and must pass its Second Reading.  In view of that, I suggest that it might not be desirable or necessary to discuss these Resolutions at length now.  I shall explain the circumstances under which the Orders were made and the modifications in the duties which are now proposed, and any discussion which Deputies consider may be necessary could take place upon the Bill which will be introduced within ten sitting days from now.</P>
    <P>The position concerning the Order made in respect of agricultural machinery was that certain information reached the Executive Council that some abnormal importations of agricultural machinery had taken place and that others were in contemplation. Consequently, an Order was made to <Col N="1210" /> prevent industrial injury being done, from the flooding of our market with foreign machinery, pending the consideration of the circumstances of this industry by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The examination of the circumstances of the industry took place in the meantime, with the result that we have now to submit to the Dáil a Resolution confirming the Order, with certain modifications.  These modifications are set out in the Resolution circulated to Deputies.  Certain classes of agricultural machinery are exempted from duty altogether.  The Order originally applied to certain classes of agricultural machinery which are enumerated in the schedule.  Certain classes there enumerated will not be subject to duty in the future.  In addition, certain parts of agricultural machinery are also being exempted from duty.  One of the matters in relation to the duty, which was raised here by Deputies, by way of question, was the necessity for permitting the importation of parts for foreign machines now in use here.  We have considered that matter, and it is proposed here to modify the duty by excluding from its scope all parts for agricultural machines which do not exceed 5/- in value.  Investigations that we have made show that that exemption will operate to exempt from duty 95 per cent. of the parts for the foreign agricultural machines referred to.  In addition, as certain apprehensions have been aroused, it is proposed, in this year, to confer upon the Minister for Agriculture power to issue licences if, at any time, it appears to him that inconvenience will be caused through inability to procure any particular agricultural machine of home manufacture.</P>
    <P>Normally, an Order of this kind should be imposed some months earlier than it was made so that the factories here would be in a position to build up stocks that would enable them to meet the requirements of the country in the first year.  In this year, however, that is not possible, and, consequently, as some people are apparently of the opinion that the home factories <Col N="1211" /> may not be able to supply all our requirements in certain machines, it is proposed, where the necessity is proved, to give this power to the Minister for Agriculture of permitting the importation of parts for these machines under licence, free of duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As from to-day, if the Resolution is adopted now.  The modifications contained in it will be in force as from to-night.  I would like to give the Dáil a general review briefly of the position of the industry.  The three principal firms engaged in it are situated in the County Wexford.  There is also a firm in Limerick which produces a limited range of agricultural machinery, and also a certain number of smaller firms situate in Galway, Clones, Letterkenny and Dublin, that make plough and other implement parts.  The employment given at the moment in the industry is roughly over 300.  The employment given by the three principal Wexford firms never at any time fell much lower than 250. That figure has risen to 350.  It is anticipated that the effect of this tariff will be to increase employment in the industry by about 500.</P>
      <P>During the European War all the country's requirements of agricultural machinery were produced here and, in addition, at that time the Wexford firms engaged in this industry carried on a fairly considerable export trade.  The factories are all of considerable extent. One of the Wexford factories is the largest agricultural machinery factory in what formerly was called the British Isles.  They are efficiently equipped and quite capable of supplying all the requirements of the country as regards the agricultural machinery enumerated in the Order.  At the present time, they are only supplying roughly one-third of our requirements.  Their production in each of the census of production years was roughly about £100,000, while the total imports averaged about £250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of the foreign firms doing business in the Saorstát in these <Col N="1212" /> goods are linked up in trusts and combines for the purpose of monopolising trade, and some of the methods adopted by these trusts and combines make it exceedingly difficult for the home manufacturer to hold his trade upon an economic basis.  The Irish firms are members of the Harvesting Machinery Section of the Agricultural Engineers' Association.  That is a British Association, which includes amongst its members most of the British manufacturers of agricultural machinery.  The Association fixes prices for its products in Great Britain and Ireland.  On a number of occasions the Irish representatives complained at meetings of the Association that certain makers of British machines were selling certain articles at a lower price in Ireland than they were selling them in Great Britain.  In the records of the Department of Industry and Commerce there are minutes of meetings of the Association showing that as a result of complaints made by the Irish firms the prices of machines sold in the Saorstát were increased to the listed prices fixed by the Association.</P>
    <P>There is considerable evidence at the present time to show that the industry in Great Britain is passing through a very critical time, that a large number of firms there have been forced to close down in recent years, and that competition has become very severe.  It is the opinion of Irish manufacturers, an opinion which appears to be supported by the facts, that the only hope of saving the Saorstát industry is the imposition of an effective measure of protection such as we are proposing.</P>
    <P>Now various statements have appeared in the Press from people purporting to speak for farmers, and some statements have been made here concerning this duty.  I would like at the beginning to clear up any misunderstanding that may exist in the minds of Deputies.  One of the statements made is that the Wexford machines are not suitable for all types of soil, or for the conditions prevailing in all countries.  The manufacturers, of course, claim that they can make all types of machinery, machinery suitable for all kinds of <Col N="1213" /> soil.  In order to test the validity of the complaints made, we had an investigation carried out, and find that the proportion of Irish-made machines in actual use at the moment is the same in every county in the Saorstát.  It would seem to be fairly conclusive, therefore, that there are no special considerations peculiar to any county which would make these machines unsuitable for use in any county in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>The manufacturers have given an undertaking to me that no increase will be made in the price of their products as a result of the imposition of the duty.  The present basis will be maintained by which the prices charged in this country will not exceed the figure at which the English farmer can buy the British article. That guarantee is subject only to one condition, and that is that it may be modified by the manufacturers when circumstances arise that are beyond their control, such as an increase in freights or of the price of the raw material.</P>
    <P>These are the main facts that I think it necessary to bring to the notice of the Dáil.  If any Deputy requires additional information on any point, I will be very glad to supply it. I repeat the suggestion, however, that I made earlier, that Deputies should leave these matters over until the Bill to give effect to these duties is introduced.  Of course, that is a matter for Deputies themselves.  It is quite clear from the facts of the case that we can supply all our requirements in agricultural machinery.  We have done so before.  We did it during the War period when we had a substantial export trade as well.  We can supply all that machinery without any increase above the present level of prices.  By doing so, we can give employment to approximately 500 additional hands.  We have met the difficulties which inevitably arise when a new tariff of this kind is imposed in relation to existing foreign machines in this country.  The owners of these machines can secure, under the modifications proposed here, 95 per cent. of the parts required by them free of duty.  We have taken the omnibus <Col N="1214" /> power of permitting at any time any of these machines to be imported free of duty in this year if the necessity should arise for it.  In these circumstances, I have no hesitation in recommending the Resolution to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>In my part of the country very few mowing machines are used.  The majority of the farmers there are small farmers. They have to fall back on the use of scythe blades.  From my knowledge of the Irish scythe blades during the past few years, I feel certain that people would not give a shilling for them.  I sell them and I would not give a shilling for some of the scythe-blades made in Ireland during the past two years, because they are no use.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's suggestion that we should not be making speeches at this juncture, but I would ask the Minister, when he is considering the permanent measure, to take into consideration the following facts.  Would he find out approximately the quantity of agricultural <Col N="1215" /> machinery in use here during the war, as compared with the quantity in use now?  I think he will find that there is an increase out of all belief in the amount of agricultural machinery used now, as compared with the war period.  I think he will also find that agricultural machinery brought in from abroad, was selling at exactly the same price as Irish machinery, and I think he might, with profit, look into the question of what the reason was; why Irish farmers chose foreign machinery in preference to Irish machinery, when the price was exactly the same?  Must there not have been some shortcoming in the Irish machinery to induce them to buy the foreign machine?  Lastly, the system in the sale of agricultural machinery is that every manufacturer has one agent in each district.  Will the Minister look into the question, and see will the Irish manufacturers make available to all implement dealers a supply of their products?  And will they adhere strictly to their old agency contracts and knock out of business every agricultural machinery dealer who had not been dealing with an Irish firm, for one reason or another in the past, reasons which I will explain to the Minister, in private, if he wishes?</P>

      <P>I would like to know if I understood the Minister correctly when he said that the exemption only applied to parts not exceeding 5/- in cost.  My information is that if that is so, the exemption is practically worthless.  Take, for example, all the major parts of a reaper. They cost a sum much in excess of 5/-, the only part of the plough under 5/- being the point.  The dearest point I know&mdash;the point for one particular plough&mdash;costs 4/- at present, while any other part will cost more than 5/-. Surely, if there is any exemption at all, it should apply to the dearer parts. In this connection, I consulted Deputy Corry, and I understood from him that the Pierce people are making all these parts for foreign machinery.  That cannot be correct if there is to be an exemption now.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Dillon as to the efficiency of these machines, I have made some inquiries in my constituency. I am not going to say whether my information is correct or not, but I would like the Minister to make inquiries, and to get an undertaking from the Pierce people, for example. I have heard it stated that the fault of the Pierce reapers is, that while they are quite good for cutting grass, they are not suitable for reaping oats, in the agricultural parts of Donegal, and that some of the large farmers there would not take a Pierce reaper under any conditions.  Those are the actual words of one of the largest farmers in East Donegal.  I do not know whether that is true or not, but if the Pierce reaper has that defect, I suggest that the Minister should indicate to the Pierce people that they should remedy the defect, so that farmers will not have to suffer a handicap of that kind.  I will ask the Minister also to examine the figures and to see what will be the effect of limiting the exemption to 5/-.  If there is to be any exemption at all, it should apply, at least for a time, to all the parts, because all the substantial parts of the reaper cost sums much in excess of 5/-.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon has asked the Minister a question, and, of course, the Minister is quite capable of dealing with it, but I belong to the same constituency as Deputy Dillon, Deputy McMenamin and Deputy White.  Deputy White answered and contradicted Deputy McMenamin most effectively.  Deputy Dillon asked the Minister to find out whether there were more implements used now than during the war.  The Deputy should know perfectly well that there were more used during the war, for the reason that there was more land under cultivation than there is now.  He also asked why the Irish farmer used the foreign agricultural implements, rather than the Irish-made implements, in the past.  I say this, and it is an answer to Deputy McMenamin, who said that a large farmer in East Donegal could not see his way to use an Irish agricultural implement, because it was not suitable for certain classes of work, and that the machine used for mowing grass could not be used for reaping corn&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Dillon knows that there are men in this country who never would take an Irish-made article.  I cannot understand the attitude of Deputy Dillon if he does not know that.  I admire the attitude of Deputy White when he says that he has practical experience for the last twenty years of agricultural implements, and knows, as a dealer and a practical farmer, that the Irish-made article can be sold equally well with the foreign article and do the same amount of work.  As a matter of fact, I heard him say once that he had a certain article, made by Pierce of Wexfor, which he had used for twenty years and which was almost as good as the day he bought it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement with regard to the modifications applying to what he describes as 95 per cent. of the parts of machinery required.  His announcement will be very welcome to farmers who have got machines manufactured outside the country.  I also welcome the Minister's statement with regard to the obtaining of machines which cannot be supplied by firms here.  My information is different from the Minister's, and it is that there will be a serious shortage of many classes of machines, particularly as the tariff was imposed so suddenly.  While I have no doubt that in years to come all the machines required can be manufactured here, and as good as any brought into the country, I ask the Minister, before he introduces the Bill, to have another talk with the manufacturers, and I think they will tell him that they do not expect to be able to compete this particular year. I should also like to ask the Minister to endeavour to expedite the delivery of parts.  One thing that makes tariffs so unpopular is that it is impossible to obtain delivery of parts within a reasonable time.  The actual cost is only a secondary consideration to all the trouble and the red tape and delays which have almost driven shopkeepers insane.  If a part is required for a machine which may cost over 5/-, it might be the autumn before that part could be got through the Customs.  The question of the delay is far more important even than the actual cost.</P>

      <P>As far as the constituency I represent, and the neighbouring counties are concerned, there is no body of opinion in favour of the tariff, either amongst farmers whom it concerns deeply or retailers who sell the machinery.  I have not heard any <Col N="1219" /> demand for a tariff.  If it is insisted upon it will entail a great amount of extra cost to the farmers, notwithstanding what the Minister said about guarantees as to not raising prices, and create confusion owing to the difficulty of getting parts for existing machinery.  It will create a state of affairs which will militate against farmers.  As I said, I know of no body of people in favour of it, and I intend to oppose the motion.</P>

      <P>There could be propositions brought forward by the Minister for Agriculture which I would have some doubt as to the merit of, but I have none as to this. I am absolutely against this tariff and my point of view is shortly this: That industrial tariffs, generally speaking, and with very few exceptions, will increase the cost of living or production of farmers.  Any industrial tariff which you impose will have the effect either of increasing the cost of living or the cost of production of the farmers.  In that state of affairs, I think the Executive Council should have drawn the line somewhere.  If they were forced to impose tariffs, I think they should have said: &ldquo;The agricultural consumer as a class is the biggest consumer in the country and we will decide this at least, that we will not increase his cost of production.&rdquo; After all, if you impose an industrial tariff it increases the cost of living, but that is shared not only by the farmer, but by everybody else.  Here is a case, however, where I propose to show that you definitely increase the cost of production to the farmer who will pay the whole tax, because this is a tax.  Nobody else will share it with him.  Nobody but the farmer buys machinery, and so far as there is any increase in the sale price of agricultural machinery, farmers as a class will pay the whole of it.  This is a direct tax on the farmer, whether the tax be big or small.  There is no question that if there is any increase in the price of machinery as the result of a tariff it is a direct tax on the farmer, and from that <Col N="1220" /> point of view I am absolutely against it.</P>
      <P>I would regard as cynical enough an increase in the cost of living of the farmer, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce could say that. if there is an increase in the cost of living of the farmer there is an increase in the cost of living of every other consumer.  But here, where you increase the cost of production, you directly tax the farmer.  Whatever the increase is, the farmers as a class pay it in its entirety.  There is no question whatever but that this is going to increase the cost of production, and that agricultural machinery will cost more.  I would not mind, for the sake of employment, for the sake of the extra taxation and the other indirect benefits, that machinery should cost a little more in other circumstances and if farmers were better off.  But there is no doubt whatever that agricultural machinery will cost more.  The guarantee which the Minister announces is not worth the paper it is written on for three reasons, two of which he gave.  He said the manufacturers made this reservation, that their prices must be subject to freight being all right and being the same as competitors in other countries.  That is the first. The second is the cost of raw material.  I am not in a position to say, and I do not think the Minister is, whether firms in this country are in a position to buy materials as cheaply as, say, the International Harvesting Company.</P>

      <P>If they buy them cheaper will the price go down?  Have you a guarantee of that?  What is your guarantee worth?  You have no machinery, and what is more, you could not set up any machinery which would control them.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean a Commission about prices.  I understood from the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; that there was a Commission to be set up about prices generally, and I assume such a Commission will be set up.  You have no machinery, you could not devise machinery, and no Minister could devise machinery to control the prices at which Irish firms will sell goods.  It cannot be done.  A guarantee from that point of view is useless.  You cannot get after them if they break the guarantee.  In any event, there is the simplest way in the world out of any guarantee.  I wish Deputies would realise that.  A guarantee of prices is worthless without a guarantee of quality.  Who can guarantee quality? If I buy a mowing machine or any other machine from a certain firm, I am no judge of steel or metal or brass or anything else&mdash;I could not be&mdash;and I am in the hands of the firm selling it.  Unless the quality of that machine is up to the quality of the machine turned out by other firms in other countries, then your guarantee is no good.  Supposing I buy an American mowing machine for £24 and an Irish mowing machine for £34, and the Irish machine lasts five years and the American machine two years, which is the cheaper?  That difficulty goes down right along so far as every other agricultural machine is concerned.  As long as you have an uncertain quantity, namely quality, your guarantee of price is worthless.  Everybody who buys machinery knows&mdash;the Minister for Industry and Commerce knows and the Minister for Agriculture knows it&mdash;that quality is more important than price and so long as there is difference in quality no guarantee of price is any good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Give up talking about your guarantee.  I say it cannot be made operative.  You have no machinery to make it so and even if you had the machinery there is the question of quality and that question will always defeat the machinery you can set up. Your position is in the air, in the hands of the particular manufacturer, and that manufacturer unless he is <Col N="1222" /> a fool&mdash;I am not suggesting he is a dishonest man&mdash;will charge the full amount he gets for it as the Minister for Industry and Commerce would do in his shop or as I would do on my farm, and there is nothing immoral in that.  He charges the full amount he can get, and the full amount is influenced by the fact that there is a high tariff upon his competitors.  The farmers of the country can make up their minds that they will pay more for agricultural machinery.  This is a direct tax upon the farmers of the country and I protest against that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture introduced a scheme that was received with a certain amount of support and a certain amount of criticism.  That was the scheme for an import duty on butter.  I think, as I said that day, that whatever people may say the Minister had no great alternative. He must do something for the dairying industry.  He could not help the dairy industry by a tariff and he must impose a bounty.  I put this to him.  Is it likely that he will be able to help any other item of agricultural production by the same system?  I doubt it.  I do not see how he could help the cattle trade or the live stock trade or beef trade by such a system. He certainly could not increase the price of eggs or anything of that kind, even bacon, by this system of export bounty.  The only item of production he can help is butter.  He is doing that, but I believe that the system will stop dead at butter.  I cannot see it work in regard to any other item of agriculture.  If this is really the only thing he can do by way of a tariff or bounty on agriculture, does he really think it fair to increase the price of everything the farmer has to buy such as boots and clothes, cocoa, and any amount of other tariffs, and also to impose a direct tax on agricultural machinery? I think it is most unfair to the agricultural community, and I think it will cause the very greatest dissatisfaction in the country.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell me am I right in saying that, roughly speaking, all the items in the First Schedule will be subject to the tax?</P>
    <Col N="1223" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>And all the items in the Second Schedule are exempt and that so far as parts are concerned, parts under 5/-, they are exempt.  That is a much better position, I agree, than the first when all parts were thought to be subject to the tax.  It is probable that 5/- will cover most of the parts the ordinary farmer has to buy.  But the general principle is, I think, fundamentally wrong.  I think the farmers in the long run, when you take quality into account, are going to pay the full amount of the tariff for any agricultural machinery they are going to buy and I do not think that they can afford to pay that for it at the present moment, nor do I think it is going to give a great amount of employment. We have no definite information on that point.  I do not think the amount of employment that will be given in Wexford is going to be justification for the amount the farmers, as a class, will have to pay for their agricultural machinery.  In answer to one point made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce I say this.  He mentioned they got enquiries made and found there was the same proportion of Irish machines used in each county.  I am not surprised.  But I would like to know what was the proportion.  Was it 25 per cent.  of the whole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirty per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has to remember that you have in each county five or six different classes of land. You cannot divide the class of land in this country between counties.  You have light land with heavy land in Wexford and in Galway&mdash;different classes in each county and each barony.  You have a bigger proportion of light land in Wexford than in Meath, but you have a lot of heavy and medium and sandstone and limestone land in other counties.  He should take that figure very carefully.  He can take it that Irish machinery as made at present is not suitable for a considerable area of land in this country and not suitable for the economic circumstances of a considerable number of farmers in this country.  The <Col N="1224" /> small farmer who has only got one horse and a jennet cannot afford a heavy machine.  Even although a heavy machine might suit his heavy land, he must buy a light one.  On the other hand, a farmer with three or four horses might have light land and might want a light machine.  You cannot generalise about these matters. You can take it for granted that, so far as machines made by Irish firms are concerned they are used throughout the country on their merits.  There is no question of any animus against the Irish machines.  Deputy Carney spoke about East Donegal and made the point that there was a prejudice there against Irish machines.  East Donegal is the best farm district in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I know the farmers in East Donegal well.  I believe they have such a wonderful conception of the value of a shilling that, when they come to buy their machinery or anything else, they buy it purely and simply on the merits. In that district, which is about the best farming district in Ireland, no man who knows what good farming is would venture to criticise their operations. Farming at the moment is dependent to a large extent upon savings, small profits, cutting losses, and so on.  It would be an extremely serious thing to upset that, because you are really adding another element of difficulty to the many difficulties that confront the farmer at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other point that I want to make in regard to this tariff, and I hope I shall not be misunderstood. This tariff is an example of the fact that you should not impose a tariff without reference to some judicial machinery.  Take this tariff. I will go the whole way and say that Irish manufacturers as a body are thoroughly honourable men.  I am not saying that with my tongue in my cheek.  I believe it.  I do not believe either that there is anybody in the Executive Council who could be got at.  I am making no suggestion of any kind about that, but here is a tariff which is in the interests of a very limited number of manufacturers, and there are certain dangers attached to it.  Ministers may say, &ldquo;Oh, well, people in this country are honourable,&rdquo;<Col N="1225" /> and so on.  I know they are. I know they are just as honourable as in any other country.  When I was Minister in the Department I dared not think of selling a bull to the Department; and I would not think of getting a relation of mine to sell a bull to them.</P>
    <P>We all know that people generally are honourable; but if the Executive Council can come along and can clap on a tariff which is undoubtedly going to mean big money to a limited number of manufacturers, look at the avenue it opens to all sorts of doubtful proceedings later on.  I put it genuinely to the Executive Council that it is a bad precedent.  If it is necessary for their policy that they should impose a large number of tariffs quickly, very well.  Let them devise some machinery that will be quick and expeditious, but some machinery that will be more or less independent of themselves, independent of political influences, some machinery that will give some assurance that the tariffs are imposed on their merits.  This is the beginning of these tariffs, and in this country we should not close our eyes to the fact that in any other country in the world where the Government has a free hand to impose tariffs without reference to any judicial or semi-judicial machinery, corruption does come in.  I only want to put that point of view.  I say, and I am perfectly certain, that this tariff was imposed genuinely and justly from the Executive Council's point of view, and from the point of view of every member of it, and from that alone.  I have no reflections to make about any maker of Irish agricultural machinery, but I put this to the Executive Council, that if they think over the possibilities from the manufacturer's point of view, or the politician's point of view if you like, they ought to adopt some judicial machinery or semi-judicial machinery that will come between them and the manufacturers who want a tariff.  We had our machinery in the Tariff Commission. The present Government thought that that was too slow.  Their policy is different.  They want tariffs <Col N="1226" /> quickly for their own reasons.  That is a perfectly valid objection from their point of view.  I do not agree with it, but it is a perfectly valid and legal objection.  But surely some machinery could be suggested and devised by which there would be some sort of judicial check on the imposition of tariffs and by which tariffs would not be left to the whim of the Minister or Ministers in charge and the manufacturers in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielVaughan" hpid="Mr. Vaughan Mr. Vaughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Vaughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to oppose the imposition of this tariff of 25 per cent. on agricultural machinery.  I can assure the Minister that there is great dissatisfaction amongst farmers in regard to the imposition of this tariff.  As we are all aware, the industry is already overtaxed and farmers are waiting for some relief from the present Executive. In the first place under this tariff the farmer's choice is restricted in regard to the implements he may use.  Farmers have to take a particular type of machinery whereas previously they had an opportunity of selecting from different types.  As far as I can see there appears to be no guarantee from the manufacturers as regards prices, as to whether the cost of these machines will be increased or whether they will cost more than the English-made machines. There is no real guarantee given to the farmers that the tariff will not raise the price of their machinery.  What the farmers want at present, of course, is the cheapest and most up-to-date machinery having regard to the present position of the agricultural industry. The Minister brought in a Bill the other day giving a bounty to butter to try to alleviate the present depression amongst farmers.  Now he comes along with another Bill to impose a tariff on their machinery.  I wonder what will be the next imposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is well aware that agriculture in this country was never in such a poor condition or that prices for produce were never so bad as now.  It seems to be the policy that parts costing less than five shillings will be allowed in free.  I would like to point out that there is no part of a foreign machine that could be made here to fit as well as the part that could be obtained from the manufacturers of the <Col N="1227" /> machine themselves.  I certainly say that this imposes a tariff on the farming community and I would advise the Minister when he is introducing the Bill to see that he will not place any restrictions on the importation of parts of foreign machinery costing more than five shillings.  I say he should allow at least half the price.  I certainly say that this tariff injures the agricultural industry.  We are trying to assist the farmers to get better prices for their produce and it is unfair for the Government to put a tax on that industry which is the main industry of the country. I hope it will be the first and the last tax on that industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKiersey" hpid="Mr. Kiersey Mr. Kiersey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiersey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to look at this tariff in another light and to ask the Minister seriously to consider a very important point of view.  The Minister himself knows that there is in this country a very considerable amount of foreign machinery, both English and American.  The people who own these machines bought them principally in the last year or two. Are they to be taxed on every part that they may require for these machines or have they to scrap them? I would submit to the Minister that only to allow an article in costing up to five shillings would give very little relief to the owners of these machines, because it would be a very small part of the present up-to-date machinery that would cost less than five shillings. It would be infinitesimal.  In all the classes you have there, take grass mowers, tumbler rakes, and everything like that, they will require an annual expenditure on some of the parts, and that will be an annual tax on the owners of these machines.  I would submit to the Minister that he should give serious consideration to the question from that point of view.  I do admit that, in the case of a man buying a new machine, it will not make such a lot of difference to him to get an Irish-made machine as against a foreign machine.  The man whom I wish to protect is the man who has bought a new machine and probably paid £25 or £26 for it, probably six months ago &mdash;I want to protect him from paying <Col N="1228" /> a tariff of 35 per cent.  on all the parts required for such a machine.</P>
      <P>I must also agree with the Deputy &mdash;I think it was Deputy Hogan&mdash;who mentioned that there are parts of this country where foreign machines will do better work than home-manufactured ones.  And on that I could give practical experience, because I could bring the Minister into my own farmyard and show him an Irish-made machine that did very little work and that had to be thrown aside because it was not able to cut the stuff that I required it to cut, and I had to get a foreign one.  I am not certain whether Irish manufacturers make a bar plough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister is replying I should like, if he can, that he would give us a little more information about the reasons for imposing this tariff in this way.  He did say that the Government had information that there were going to be excessive importations which would inflict industrial injury. He must realise that this must have sounded to the Deputies a little bit like a repetition of an empty formula, that he was rather sticking to the words of the Act to provide a formula previous to the statement that a duty had been imposed.  I should like if he would give us some indication of the circumstances, if they are known to him, which caused this undue or excessive importation to be threatened, because it would seem that in the ordinary way one would think that this is the sort of tariff which might very well have been the subject of investigation by the Tariff Commission in the ordinary way.  I should like also if he would indicate why it was thought necessary to put on the high duty of 33? per cent. or 25 per cent. which is I suppose an effective tariff.  This particular industry is an old established <Col N="1229" /> industry and it has been carried on in spite of any competition that it has had to face heretofore, and it would not seem to have undergone any rapid decline in recent years.  There would seem to be, on the face of it, no reason for a tariff anything like as high as the tariff imposed as the result of this order.  I should like therefore if the Minister would give us something more about the reason for this tariff and the fixation of the tariff at the point at which it was fixed.</P>

In the first place it is taking 500 families off the backs of the farmers, because it is the farmers who will have to support them in the finish if they are idle.  It is taking 500 families off our backs in the first place, and in the second place it has put an end to what I may describe as the very dirty game which has been carried on in this country for a very long period. I bought a Pierce mower in 1915 which is a pretty long time ago and it has cut 28 acres of hay each year and fairly heavy hay and on several years I had to cut the corn where it lodged.</P>

      <P>No, it is about as heavy as the hedge that you cut in Galway. We had a statement from Deputy Dillon, who was wondering why there was a preference for English-made machines.  I may tell him why.  It is because the dealers get an extra commission out of the English machine. That is why the dealer will push the English machine on you when you go into the shop.  He has more out of it. Then we had another learned farmer, Deputy McMenamin I think it was, telling us that though it could cut grass, it could not cut corn.  I often heard a fairly good story, but that is the richest one ever I heard.  I do not believe he ever saw the cutting of a field of hay or corn, because no matter how bad a mowing machine may be it will cut corn, but the bad mowing machine will not cut hay.  Then we had another complaint from a Deputy about an Irish-made machine which he had to throw on the fence. That Deputy ought to learn to work it. If he learned to work it, it would be all right.  This is the most nonsensical kind of arguments I ever heard. Then Deputy Hogan wound up with the suggestion that was most worthy of him.  He told us about corruption. That is most worthy of him.  I would suggest that the Deputy ought to know a fair lot about it.</P>

      <P>We have heard complaints about tariffs and the great trouble that would be caused to farmers who bought English-made <Col N="1231" /> machines a few years ago.  I suggest these complaints will soon be remedied. All these parts will be made in this country.  I cannot see any difficulty in the making of them.  Henry Ford would not be long turning them out in his Cork factory by means of mass production. We hear all those arguments from people who last week told us that we had not got a mandate on the Oath, but we had on unemployment. We are now helping to solve the unemployment problem.  By this proposal alone we will be taking half a thousand people off the unemployed list.  The moment we do so we have a growl.</P>
      <P>I have been farming since I was a child.  I have been using Irish-made machines all my life.  There is not a better machine on the market than the Irish machine.  I cannot see what objection there could be when we are able to produce machines in this country second to none.  Deputy Hogan said that our guarantee as to prices was not worth anything.  Deputy Hogan's word is apparently better than the guarantee given by the manufacturers. We hear a lot of this senseless argument from time to time.  It is about time that ceased.  Looking at this matter from the farmers' point of view we have to consider how many families this will help to take off home assistance, to which the farmers largely contribute.</P>
      <P>One day we have a howl over a possible increase in the price of the farmers' butter; then we have a howl over the extra cost on the farmer in view of this tax on agricultural machinery.  Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies should not forget that a few years ago they were in favour of a tariff on old women's rosary beads. Surely they should not growl so much over the tariffs now proposed.  I think Deputy Vaughan was at one time in favour of a tariff on ladies' handbags.</P>

The primary factor that should underlie every proposal in the Dáil is how many men will that particular proposal take off the streets and put working.  I believe this proposal <Col N="1232" /> now under consideration will give employment to at least 500 men.  I hope this action will be followed up by a few tariffs that will protect the farmer.</P>
    <P>I was rather amused when I heard Deputy Hogan's argument about profiteering. The Deputy knows very well that the last Government during its ten years of office made no attempt to prevent profiteering.  They know very well that one famous firm in this city was profiteering on the farmer to the extent of 37s.  6d. a barrel on barley.  There was no attempt made to stop that. They reduced the farmers' price by 37s.  6d. and never passed it on to the consumer.  We hear talk about profiteers the moment an industry is prepared to start, the moment men with faith in the country are prepared to extend their manufactures.  Those men do not say that if we abolish the Oath they will take their businesses to England.  There are some patriotic firms in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the Minister might raise the price to 10s. at least. Any part worth having for a machine is certainly more than 5s.  I agree, of course, that a tooth of a spring harrow would be less.  With regard to the tariff itself I think the Minister said that complaints have been made by manufacturers that the prices here and in England were not the same; that the machines were sold at a lesser price here.  Is that the strongest language the Minister can use?  He said complaints have been made by manufacturers. What efforts were made to see whether the complaints were well-founded? Were the complaints of the manufacturers accepted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say yes; it is well to have something definite.  Anyhow, the Irish farmer was getting the machines at a lesser price.  I would like to know how much less.  The Irish farmer had the benefit but still, with that benefit, look at the position of Irish agriculture to-day.  With regard to castings, the complaint up to now has not been so much about the original machines, Irish or English, but the great discrepancy between the quality of the castings supplied in renewing parts and the quality of the original article.  I can bear that out.  The complaint is universal and it is true. The parts supplied have not been equal to the original castings.</P>
      <P>With regard to the tariff on parts above 5/-, Deputy Kiersey has said what I was going to say.  Two or three years ago, let us say, a man bought a machine.  That machine should last ten or twelve years.  At the time of purchase nothing was known of a tariff. In the circumstances it is not fair to put a tariff on parts for that machine. The plea may be made that if you let in parts there will be assembling of parts here and a new machine could be made up.  This is altogether wrong. Whatever may be said about a tariff on new machinery&mdash;and I have very little to say in defence of it&mdash;I am altogether opposed to the tariff on parts.  The man who bought a machine in good faith when there was no talk of tariffs ought not now be penalised.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Corry said that one of the chief reasons why there were more foreign machines used in this country was because the merchants here got a bigger commission on foreign than on Irish-made machines. That is not true.  The commission for the merchants on English, French, American or Irish manufactured machinery is the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that the statement is not correct.  I have been in the implement trade all my life, and I know that the commission allowed by the manufacturers in France, Germany, America, Scotland, or England is the same as is allowed by the manufacturers in Ireland.  That, therefore, is not the reason why Irish farmers should use foreign machinery in preference to Irish manufactured machines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1235" />
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the discount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneJOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The discount in all cases is exactly the same.  No matter where the machine comes from the merchant here gets the same profit on its sale.  The net cost of the machines to the merchants all over Ireland is the same regardless of the country of origin, so that the commission on the machinery would be no reason why the merchants would be in a better position to give better terms to the farmers than in the case of Irish-made machines.  As a matter of fact, the tendency is to give better terms to the buyers of the Irish-made machines. They are often sold by the merchants at lower prices just in order to encourage the home-made machine.</P>
      <P>This tariff on machinery has naturally upset the farmers.  They are very dubious about the capacity of the Irish firms to supply their needs.  At any rate, they think the question should be taken in a different way, and steps should be taken to ascertain whether the native firms would be able to meet the requirements of the country. I had an experience quite recently. It was just a week before the tariff on machinery was put on.  A farmer came to me and asked me for a cake-crusher.  He was very keen on getting an English cake-crusher, but I convinced him that he should have an Irish-made one.  To be candid, one of my reasons was that he would get a quicker delivery of the Irish machine.  He ordered the machine. Two days after, the tariff on agricultural machinery went on.  Ten days after giving the order, I had a reply from the Irish manufacturer of this article that the firm had ceased to manufacture this particular cake-crusher, so I had to send across to the other side for it and pay the duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal reason why Irish farmers are not using Irish machines is not because they are not as good as the foreign-made machines. I have no doubt in my own mind that they are as good, but English and foreign manufacturers of these articles have a far better system of salesmanship. In that side of their business <Col N="1236" /> they are far more efficient than the Irish manufacturers.  Their delivery and the service that they give are far better.  It is really sad to think that that is the case, but Irish manufacturers have not given sufficient attention to salesmanship, delivery, or service in the past.  Possibly, now that they have got a monopoly, they will attend to these matters, but my own experience is that, since the tariff was imposed, they have stiffened up and adopted a more or less independent attitude.</P>
    <P>The farmers are particularly alarmed about the tariffs on parts more so than on the machines themselves. Every Irishman would naturally be inclined to fall in with the Minister's desire to create employment and to help on industry.  But when a man has his capital sunk in foreign machines he does not like to find himself in the position of having a levy put on him for any parts he may require for these machines.  For a certain period at any rate after the imposition of the tariff on the machinery the parts required by farmers should be allowed in free.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always pleaded that it is very undesirable to impose tariffs in favour of an industry which was incapable of supplying the needs of the people of this country.  But here we have the position where the Minister for Industry and Commerce, after examination, is able to assure us the Wexford firms are capable of supplying the needs of the farmers of this country or, if they are not able to do that at the moment it is because of the uncertainty that prevailed during the past few years.  Firms in Wexford found themselves in an awkward position because of the fact that there was dumping going on as far as English and American machinery was concerned.  It has been proved by the Wexford firms that English manufacturers have been selling machinery here at a less price than at the other side.  If that is not dumping then I do not know what dumping is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the opposition offered to the application of this tariff.  In view of the line taken by the members on the other side of the <Col N="1237" /> House last week during the debate on unemployment their present attitude is surprising.  We were told then that they were very anxious to see numbers of people sent back to work.  But here we have concrete proof of the desire of the Government to send a large number of people to work.  At the present moment, there are in Wexford town about 500 agricultural machinery operatives walking the streets unemployed.  It is safe to say that within a very short period the majority of these will be at work.  The ex-Minister for Agriculture is talking about the cost of production going up on the farmer.  I fail to see in what way the cost is going to go up.  We have an assurance from the Minister, who has received an assurance from the manufacturers to the effect that not alone are they prepared not to increase their prices, but that if there are fluctuations or any sort of a downward tendency in the case of English and American machinery in the near future the Irish manufacturers will also bring down their prices.</P>
    <P>In view of that I do not see why anyone should have any hesitation in supporting these tariffs.  I would remind Deputies on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches that in 1923 the firm of Pierce and Co. were asked by the then Government to set up special machinery to make parts for foreign ploughs.  The Party that is now in opposition should not forget that the Wexford firms went to the expense of setting up that machinery.  In view of that I do not think the present opposition is fair.  Having set up the machinery I submit that these firms fulfilled what they were asked to do at the time.  As Deputy Corry has pointed out, the application of these tariffs will take a burden off the shoulders of the farmers who are the largest ratepayers.  In Wexford between £120 and £150 is paid out weekly in home help.  That burden will be removed from the farmers if these men get employment.  Most of those who get that relief are men who were practically reared in the Wexford foundries where these machines are manufactured so that this form of relieving <Col N="1238" /> direct taxation is worthy of consideration. As to whether Irish machinery is not as good as English machinery I think it has been proved over and over again that the Irish machines are just as efficient as, if not more than, those imported.  Some people in this country have an animus against Irish manufacture for reasons that I do not know.  It is very desirable when tariffs of this kind are being imposed that the Minister should have some advisory body or a representative who understands machinery to pay periodical visits to the workshops of these firms and make a thorough examination so that only efficient machinery would be sent out. When the country is backing an industry the Minister should see to it that the people get value for their money.</P>
    <P>Another question that I am deeply concerned about is that of wages.  I urge the Minister to see when applying tariffs that the minimum living wage is paid to the workers and that the proportion of boy labour is limited.  I am not suggesting anything in this case as I have not had time to examine the matter yet.  I consider that if proprietors in an industry of this kind are sheltered by a pretty high tariff, as in this case, the benefits of the tariff should be extended to the workers.  So far as this Party is concerned when a Bill of this kind comes before the House we will try to secure that the suggestions I have made are implemented in some section of it.  As to the remark of Deputy Hogan that the cost of production would be increased on farmers, I do not think Deputy Hogan took the same precautions when he applied a tariff to bacon immediately before the last election.  That tariff was keenly felt by unfortunate people in receipt of home help.  It was felt perhaps to a greater extent than farmers, though in a bad position, will feel this tariff.  I hope the Minister will pay particular attention to my suggestion that the benefits of the tariff should be extended to the workers, as they deserve all the consideration that they can get.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very decided opposition on the part of farmers in the area I represent to this tariff. <Col N="1239" /> When you find farmers letting labourers go and trying to work their farms themselves, owing to the depression in agriculture, I think that the Minister should seriously consider what impositions he should place on the cost of production.  Tillage is very vital for this country and gives a good deal of employment in rural areas.  I think this tariff will amount to a large item in the economic working of a farm.  When he is about buying an implement at a high price, an addition of 33 1-3rd per cent. will make the farmer think seriously before doing so.  Any increase in price at a time of depression will naturally restrain him from making the investment.  He will probably carry on with an old implement or borrow a machine from a neighbour.  Perhaps two neighbours will join to get over the difficulty.  If the tariff is put on there will be a decrease in the purchasing of agricultural machinery. We cannot overlook the fact that it adds very materially to working costs if prices are increased at a time when it is vital to increase production, and when the farmer cannot afford extra expense.  We want to try to get tillage going if possible.  Tillage has been so vitally hit by the depression in prices that the tendency is to get out of it.  This tariff will have a serious effect on tillage.  We have to consider whether the increased employment that may result from the tariff will counter-balance the decrease in employment on the land and the public assistance that is bound to result from unemployment.  I think it will restrict production and will decrease employment on the land.  In order to increase employment in a small number of sheltered industries, we are going to sacrifice a large number of rural workers.  It would be wise to think carefully before adding to the farmers' expenses.  There is a certain tax on agricultural imports from across the Channel in the form of freights.  That should help and has always helped home manufacturers. A remark was made about 500 labourers being given work in the making of agricultural machinery.  It <Col N="1240" /> is more than probable that the increased price will for a considerable time tend to prevent these men getting work simply because the farmers will not pay the increased prices for machinery.  There is also the probability that the farmers will wait until some other Government comes along and takes off the tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is not at all unlikely.  Deputy Corish referred to the wages paid in England and in the Free State.  Is it not more than probable that if wages in the Free State go up very much beyond the English level, without the same working conditions, that machinery cannot be produced as cheaply here and will have to be sold at a higher price?  I have no hesitation in voting against this tariff.  It might have been effective if introduced when farming was prosperous, but at a time when agriculture is acutely depressed, I will certainly vote against it, as it will increase the costs of farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Objection has been taken to this tariff by Deputy Hogan on the grounds that it will put up the production costs of the farmer.  Suppose, at the present time, the farmer tills on an average twenty acres and owns £18 worth of agricultural machinery which may be subject to a tariff, the depreciation is not more than from fifteen to twenty per cent. at the outside. That would mean that he would have to pay each year between £3 and £4. That is all the average farmer will have to pay, and I do not think that there is any farmer so unpatriotic that he did not buy, during the past ten or twenty years, some machine of Irish manufacture.  At any rate, I hope that there is not.  Reference has been made to the different varieties of machines, and it has been stated it may not be possible to get the varieties of machines suited to the different parts of the country.  I can tell Deputies that the firms in Wexford turn out machines suited to every class of soil in the country.  I do not believe that there is a single soil for which a suitable machine is not turned out in Wexford. Deputy Kiersey referred to bar-point <Col N="1241" /> ploughs.  They are being made in Wexford and have been made there so long as I can remember.  Deputy Hogan mentioned light machines. Light, one-horse machines have been made in Wexford for years.  Anybody who looks at the Wexford stand at the Spring Show will see all sorts of machines.</P>
      <P>This tariff was absolutely necessary. Deputy Corish pointed out that there are from 200 to 500 former employees of the Wexford foundries walking the streets of Wexford.  If the tariff had not been imposed, the factory would have been in danger of closing down, because there was dumping of machinery from England at a price lower than that at which it was being sold in England.  There is no doubt about that.  I am not at all satisfied that the Minister should have exempted parts under a cost of 5/-, because the majority of the wearing parts of ploughs are under that cost. I do not think they should have been exempt from the tariff.  The points and socks of a plough are under 5/- in cost, and I do not think they should have been exempted.  Parts in connection with mowing machines and other machines might have been exempted up to a higher point than 5/-, but the wearing points of ploughs should not have been exempted.</P>
      <P>The objection to this tariff by Deputy Brasier and other Deputies is ridiculous. Deputy Brasier does not know very much about tillage.  He objects to this tariff because it is going to increase the cost of tillage, and he says that it will mean that farmers will disemploy labourers.  I do not believe that there will be a single agricultural labourer disemployed as a result of this tariff.  There may be room for tightening up in some directions in existing factories.  They have taken steps recently to see that all the machinery turned out is standard. Within the past year, they have taken these steps, but there may have been room for complaint some years ago.  I know there was.  That state of affairs does not exist at present, and is not likely to exist in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Government would be well advised to set up machinery by <Col N="1242" /> which they could inspect factories protected by tariffs.  I do not refer to factories engaged merely in the production of agricultural machinery. They should take steps to see that up-to-date measures are used in all protected industries, and that manufacturers are not allowed to use the tariff to put indifferent articles on the market. If that were done, it would ensure that the products of tariffed industries would be turned out efficiently and at a price which would compare with the price obtaining for similar products in other countries.</P>

      <P>I should like to put a few questions to the Minister for reply when he is closing the debate. There are, however, a few matters arising out of the last speaker's remarks to which I should like to refer before putting the questions.  The case which the last Deputy made is surely too easy.  Nobody is going to suffer as a result of this tariff.  Farmers are not going to suffer, in the sense that they are going to pay anything more.  Nobody is going to be dismissed because of any burthen that will fall on the farmers.  That was mere perversity on the part of critics.</P>

      <P>I should like to have, not the Minister's &ldquo;thought&rdquo; but a definite statement, because the <Col N="1243" /> figures can be got.  The Minister said that in Wexford the present number employed in this industry was about 250, that it had been normally&mdash; leaving out the War period&mdash;350, and that he expects another 500 to be put into employment.  How did he get that figure?  Is it the old business of doing sums&mdash;so much production per head&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to say, 400 more than the highest it reached normally.  I want to know how that 400, or even 500, is arrived at.  Is it the old business&mdash;you take the average production per head as 200 and divide that into whatever the import is and immediately you have the industry enlarged by so many persons.  That is how the 8,401 people came into the boot question.  The Minister is very good at doing sums of that sort.  You could almost see the chalk about his shoulder when he gave out these figures.  Has he got any estimate from the firms themselves?  Has he checked that estimate?  Firms will always give you estimates, but they have to be checked and sometimes considerably reduced.  Is there any further statement to be made as to when whatever number of hundreds are to be employed will be put into employment? Will it be this year, or will that increase of production be spread over a number of years?  Because as long as the tariff remains and the factories are growing but have not yet reached the full point to which they may come, a very heavy tax will be paid by the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told about the European war.  It shows a weakness in the case to bring in any reference to that. Anybody who had any touch with <Col N="1244" /> business during the war period knows that it was not a question of being in business and getting profits on it, but rather what business you were in and the size of the profits you could get.</P>
    <P>As far as the machinery end is concerned, the Minister brought in the question of an export trade in agricultural machinery to England during the war period.  He knows that amounted to something like his own system or very nearly that.  There was no idea of competition in those days.  The Minister told us.  I suppose by way of defence as to how this tariff was brought in under the terms of the Act. that there have been trusts and combines in this particular industry, that these trusts and combines adopt particular methods, and that these methods had come down rather heavily upon the Irish manufacturers. The Minister went on to add to that&mdash;he had to add to it in the interests of accuracy&mdash;that it was quite true to say that the Wexford manufacturers were in that combine, at least to some extent.  I would like to have that further explained as to how the results of the combine have affected so adversely people who, for some part of the business, are members of the combine.</P>
    <P>We are told that there is to be an undertaking, but the undertaking has been rather whittled down to this point: provided there is no increase in freights and no increase in the price of raw materials.  I think, if the manufacturers get to hear of what Deputy Corish said to-night, there will be a third item added: provided there is no increase in the wages paid in their concerns.  Even with all these reasons the guarantee is limited to this: that there is going to be no increase in price.  That was the first way the Minister put it. Then he corrected it by saying that at any rate the Irish farmers would get this type of agricultural machinery as cheaply as the English farmer gets it from those who supply him.  I think that argues that the price that prevailed last year for agricultural machinery is going to be raised, because I understand the argument is that there was dumping <Col N="1245" /> going on and that by reason of the dumping the Irish manufacturers' price had been lowered.  They found that they could not live on the lower price they had to sell at.  Therefore, I think it is essential&mdash;I do not think this is going to be denied&mdash; that prices will rise from what they were, say, a year of six months ago.</P>
    <P>The other point that comes out is that there is no check upon this. Despite what Deputy Corish and Deputy Allen have stated with regard to supervision, no supervision is going to be of any great assistance.  It may prevent the manufacture of bad machinery, but it will have to be so bad that it is going to be revealed as bad on a rather cursory type of examination.  There is to be no examination that is going to be worth anything.  The only test that is going to be applied is the test that will be put upon a particular article or implement by the person who uses it in the course of farm operations. Of course, that test will only take place after the article has been purchased. There is no question of guaranteeing quality.  It cannot be guaranteed and there can be no check on it.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister that there was a period during which English manufacturers sold the same type of article here at a lower price than they did in England.  I would like to know how long that was going on.  To take Deputy Corish's thought-reading again with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, it has been going on apparently for three years. I would like to know if it has been reflected by a great amount of unemployment in the last three years. Has the tot of the employed in the agricultural implement business in Wexford, for instance, gone down in the last three years?  Does it show any great variation?  When I asked a question about this before I was told by the Minister that the only information he could give me was a reference to the census of production for 1926 and 1929.  The Minister did say that as between those two years the number employed had gone down in 1929 compared with the number employed in 1926.  Yet it emerged <Col N="1246" /> that the production value annually in 1929 as opposed to 1926 had only gone down by £1,000.  Therefore, to take the method of doing sums again, that should only be reflected by an unemployment problem of five people. I wonder has there been an unemployment problem representing even as much as five people between the years 1926 and 1929.</P>
    <P>If there is going to be a 500 increase in the number employed&mdash;I do not care when it occurs, even if we have to wait three or four years &mdash;I would like to have that translated by the Minister into another form: what will be the increase in the annual production of, say, the Wexford firms after they have got the benefit of this tariff for some two or three years, and after they have reached the highest point they can hope to get to?  Will the Minister let us have that information, even if it is only an estimate, because that is the only way that one can get an answer to what Deputy Allen said. It will indicate the amount that manufacturers at home propose to sell surplus to what they sell now, and the tariff on that will be what the farmer will have to pay in comparison to what he might have to pay if he was getting machinery from abroad.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish and Deputy Allen have spoken on this matter of unemployment. Unemployment surely has to be considered, not merely in reference to the men put into work, but in reference to the men put into work and the cost to the community of doing so.  If it were only a question of getting men employed, the whole country could be employed, but you have got to count the cost. It is uneconomic to put certain people into certain work under the conditions that prevail in certain industries to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny that.  There are things produced in this country at this moment sold in opposition to similar articles produced in England, and they are sold in England at a lower price.  What the Deputy has said certainly cannot be applied to every industry in the country.  The test, at any rate, of this unemployment is not that it is going to put people into employment&mdash;it is the getting of people into employment, taken in relation to the cost to the community of getting them employed.  Surely, that is an essential item in the calculation.  Supposing the 500 spoken of go into employment at a cost to the community &mdash;I am taking a wild figure&mdash;of £1,000,000, is it worth while to get them employed?  Merely talking in terms of people getting into employment does not get us any further.  If the cost of putting these 500 people into employment is to be £1,000,000, there is surely no advantage, and you are going to have a minus sign to put against the plus 500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish gave us a rather interesting statement this evening, and I hope that those who are so keen on tariffs will note the two things that have been said.  There is, apparently, even amongst those who stand so wholeheartedly for tariffs, being aroused a certain amount of suspicion that there may be an increase in the cost to the general community.  Hence, we are getting these statements made about supervision.  It will be for people to see that there is no dumping of machinery, to see that there is some check on the cost.  It is proper that that should be done if it can be done. The manufacturer who applies for a tariff comes to you and can give you almost any guarantee you like. He will subject himself to close supervision, because he knows that in the end, unless it is going to be of the type of analysis that might be done in a laboratory, and even after that some sort of test such as is carried out in actual operation afterwards, that there is going to be no real check <Col N="1248" /> that way.  Then, in addition, we get Deputy Corish adding this to the tariffed industry: that it is time we began to attend to wages.  I think if these two things are sufficiently insisted on that even a very hot tariffist of a manufacturer is going to find his enthusiasm damped considerably.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us, when replying, if there was any reason why the question of wages should have been brought into this particular matter at all.  Are the wages, on the whole, as paid, say, in Wexford, as high as those paid normally across the water? At any rate, we do get the fundamental point of view of labour expressed here by Deputy Corish to-night, and it is right that it should be expressed. They are going to demand their whack out of these tariffs.  There has got to be something passed on to the employee, and we are setting our feet now on the road that Australia tramped with so much agony, and we will eventually get to the position of chaos in which she finds herself at the moment. The wheel is now starting to turn.  The type of town employee for whom Deputy Corish speaks does realise now that if you are going to have bounties on butter and tariffs, on clothing and on furniture, and all these other things, his cost is going to be increased and he is going to see that he will get a bit more out of it, in wages, when a tariff is applied to his industry.  By degrees, the whole situation will be much as it was before, with everybody paying a bit more, with costs a bit higher and with standards lower.</P>
    <P>That is what we are aiming at and it was never shown so well as in this particular thing.  At any rate, it is a good thing to see that second thoughts are considerably better than first thoughts on this tariff.  The modifications given here do represent some concessions.  They are, I should say, as much a concession to the manufacturers as they are to the consumer.  I wonder had the Minister, before he made this list of modifications, any approaches from the manufacturers, to the point, that, if they were going to be tied tightly to a guarantee that the price would not go up, certain essential <Col N="1249" /> parts for their purposes would have to be brought in free.  That was a thing that was staring out from the information collected, and how certain parts were ever brought into the original order passes my comprehension.</P>
    <P>Orders of this type are supposed to be passed when the Executive Council is satisfied that a customs duty of a particular type is necessary to prevent an unfair dumping of goods or an expected importation of goods, in either case arising out of financial or other events in other countries, and occurring in circumstances that occasion industrial injury.  I would like to have an analysis made of the clauses of that by the Minister, when replying, as to what it was that caused the imposition of this provisional customs duty, in the first instance.  Was it dumping?  If so, and if it has been continuous for the last three years, would he tell me precisely how that is reflected in the unemployment returns in the industry in one place for the last three years?  If it was something expected more than what was actually happening, will he let us know the evidence on which this expectation is built?  If it is not dumping, will he tell us if it is some financial event in some other country, and if so, where, and also, what were the considerations on which he based his recommendation to the Executive Council that this duty should be imposed? Then we will have some sort of clear picture.  At the moment, there is not even a prima facie case for this order, even with the modifications, and I think it will be opposed.</P>

      <P>There are some minor points I would like to get cleared out of the way before dealing with those arising out of Deputy McGilligan's jeremiad.  The first of these relates to parts, and it appears that there is some considerable misunderstanding in respect of them.  It is proposed to exempt from duty all parts of five shillings value, that is, five shillings c.i.f.  value at the ports.  It is not five shillings retail price in the shops.  I think that five shillings price at the port represents something about ten shillings retail price in the shops.  We <Col N="1250" /> have had careful examination made of all the parts that are required, and we are satisfied that from 90 to 95 per cent.  of them will be free of duty in consequence of that modification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We fixed that figure at the point where we would permit into the country, free of duty, the greatest possible number of parts, without exempting parts entirely, as was suggested, and which would result, as Deputy Gorey appeared to contemplate, in an industry merely for the assembly of parts here.  That is not the type of industry we want.  We want a manufacturing industry and we can get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that a part, five shillings c.i.f. at the port, was sold in the shops here at ten shillings.  I have been in the implement trade all my life, and the suggestion, I respectfully submit to the Minister, is certainly extravagant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that five shillings c.i.f. price represents about ten shillings retail price.  I am prepared to take it at 8/6 or 9/- or whatever you like.  That certainly represents free imports of 95 per cent. of the parts required for foreign machines.  A number of the remaining parts, as Deputy Allen pointed out, are made in Wexford.  The Wexford firms, at the invitation of our predecessors, installed machinery to make them, and they can make them.  Most of the parts required for foreign ploughs of all makes are, in fact, supplied from the Wexford works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will make further inquiries.  The main arguments, however, related to the question of price, and I think they were typified by the speech of Deputy Hogan, which was of this nature: There is a guarantee given in respect of price.  That guarantee can be evaded.  Therefore, it will be evaded. Therefore, prices will go up.  Therefore, farmers will have to pay more for machinery, and, therefore, agriculture will have a very heavy imposition placed on it.  That is the argument. That is the logic those on the Opposition Benches apply to these particular questions.  Let us consider that.  The price of machinery here has been subject to regulation.  As I explained, the Irish manufacturers are members of an association to which the English manufacturers also belong. That association regulates the price of machinery here and in England. The justifications for the allegation in respect of dumping are these, that during the past year, as the records of the Department of Industry and Commerce show, the Irish manufacturers had to make complaints to that association that certain English manufacturers were selling in Ireland below the recognised price, that they were selling certain machinery at prices lower than those at which they were selling in England. I have here the minutes of a meeting <Col N="1252" /> of the association in which these manufacturers justified their action on the ground that they regarded Ireland as no man's land.  Deputy McGilligan must address certain queries to me on this matter, but certainly he must have all the information in my possession in relation to that particular aspect of it.</P>
      <P>The fact is, however, that prices here and in England were maintained at the same level, and that they will in future be maintained at the same level.  The undertaking given by the Irish manufacturers is that the price of machinery to Irish farmers will be the same as the price of the same machinery to English farmers, when supplied from their English works, and that relates to quality as well as to make.  The ingenious mind of the ex-Minister for Agriculture&mdash;I might almost say the criminal mind&mdash;applied itself to this problem: how the undertaking could be evaded, and he discovered a method which he promptly suggested to the agricultural machinery manufacturers.  Obviously the undertaking relates to similar machines and a similar machine will be sold at the same price here as in England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making that case.  I am telling the Dáil that we have this undertaking from the machinery manufacturers that the price of their machines here will not be increased, that they will be maintained by them at the same level as in England. I do not want to give the Dáil the impression that if I did not get that undertaking this tariff would not be imposed.  I am not setting up as a standard to be applied to all tariffs suggested here that the prices must be maintained at the same level as in England. Irish industries were killed by a process of price fixation.  That is not the test we are going to apply to any <Col N="1253" /> application made to us.  The test we will apply is: is the industry suitable to this country; can our people be employed in it; can it produce at an economic figure; can they develop the resources of the country in the development of the industry?  If we get affirmative answers to these questions, we are going to assist that industry, but not necessarily by a tariff.  The tariff is only one method, but we are going to their assistance to insure that such industries will develop.</P>

      <P>We can see that in relation to each industry as we come to it.  The one point I want to make quite clear in the minds of Deputies is that the English level of prices is not going to determine the number of industries or the nature of the industries that will exist here.  In this case, however, we have no difficulty in that matter.  Working to one quarter of capacity, the Irish firms have been selling in the past at the same price as the English, and as a result of this duty, when they are working to full capacity, we can expect from them a diminution rather than an increase in price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>An import duty of this kind once imposed obviously terminates an arrangement of that kind, unless the English manufacturers choose to accept their obligations under the arrangement and continue to sell at the same price despite the duty, in which case the revenue will gain and the tariff will be ineffective. We have heard a number of speeches about a tax upon farmers and the increase in the cost of production, which were obviously nonsense; obviously designed to damn the chances of this industry, and made without any other reason.  I cannot understand what other motive is behind them.  Deputy Brasier talked nonsense about farmers having to pay thirty-three and a third more for their machinery.  Why should they, unless they are people of a mentality <Col N="1254" /> determined to get English machines at any price, no matter what others are available?  Irish factories are in a position to supply all our requirements at the same price as the machines sold in England. Is there any reason, under these circumstances, why a farmer should pay 33? per cent.  tax, or 25 per cent. tax, as a matter of fact, in order to get machines of English make?  No reason whatever.</P>
      <P>A further statement made by Deputy Brasier, that this tariff may only last for a limited period, raises another matter.  If Deputies go out deliberately to create the idea that any arrangements made by this Government to foster industry are going to be only of a temporary nature and will terminate with the termination of the Government, it is obviously going to be much more difficult for us to get industrial development pushed ahead, or to get people to risk their money in the extension of existing factories and the establishment of new ones.  I hope that we can get from the Party opposite some assurance that if a duty is imposed by this Government it will not be removed by them without, at any rate, some examination into the facts, that they will operate the machinery of the Tariff Commission, for which they have such regard, before removing a duty, as they did before imposing it.</P>

      <P>In what way is the community going to pay the cost?  It is not going to pay it in import taxes. We do not anticipate one penny to the revenue as a result of the duty.  It is not going to pay it in increased cost of machinery.  How is it going to pay it?  It seems to me that we have discovered one particular method by which we can put 500 men into work without costing the community anything. If any Deputy can demonstrate how any member of the community is going to pay one penny in order to put these 500 men into work, I shall be glad if he will do so.  No one has done it. There will be no increase in the cost of home-manufactured machinery.  There will be no increase in the cost of the foreign machinery, except for those who desire to pay more because they are foolish.  I do not think Deputies opposite, if they cast their minds back over the years since 1926, when the Tariff Commission was established, can remember a single case for a tariff put up to the Tariff Commission as strong as the case that can be made for this tariff.  The machinery manufacturers were considering an application to the Tariff Commission and that application was in the Department of Industry and Commerce when the change of Government took place. They were, for various reasons, hesitant about pushing it.  Some of these reasons are known to Deputies. Their doubts and fears in that regard were removed with the change of Government, and they have now secured that protection to which they were entitled, and that protection which will insure the development of the industry which they might have got if the Tariff Commission had brooded over the matter for four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blythe asked some questions concerning the reason for imposing the tariff, the circumstances under which it was imposed, and the reason why the 25 per cent. rate was fixed.  First of all, I want to make quite clear that we did not use the machinery of the Customs Duties (Provisional Imposition) Act for the purpose of giving effect to our tariff policy.  We found <Col N="1256" /> that subsequent to the change of Government imports of certain commodities were very greatly increased. In respect of some of these commodities, boots, for example, the supply brought in is sufficient to meet all the needs of the people here for a period of at least six months.  The result is that a definite industrial injury has been done, in so far as the existing home factories will be deprived of orders until these stocks are cleared. As the Deputy is aware, certain machinery was established by him which enabled the Department of Industry and Commerce to get immediate notification from any port where a customs officer noticed an abnormal consignment of particular goods arriving. One of the first, if not actually the first, such notification that came before us was in respect of agricultural machinery.  This order was imposed in March and related to a considerable consignment of certain machinery obviously imported much earlier than usual, and in much larger quantities. We have used the machinery of that Act only to deal with the emergency situation which arose in the past three or four weeks when these very abnormal importations took place.  We have used that to the minimum extent. There are quite a number of classes of goods in respect of which the amount coming in could be fairly described as abnormal, but emergency orders were not applied because we do not want to be rushed into taking action without being satisfied as to the consequences.</P>
    <P>The resolution before the Dáil represents the carefully considered proposal for the protection of this industry.  I admit it represents a modification of the original proposal hastily prepared and applied.  None of the Deputies who have spoken opposite have been able to find any serious fault with the duty as now modified.  That duty represents the maximum protection that can be given to the industry without imposing hardship upon anybody.  That is the reason the 25 per cent. rate was fixed.  It was considered that 25 per cent. would effectively stop the unnecessary importation of foreign <Col N="1257" /> agricultural machinery.  I am quite prepared if we find it is not effective for that purpose to recommend the Dáil to increase it.  The intention is to stop imports because the existing factories are able to supply all the requirements and machinery which is as good as cheaply as the imported machinery.  I cannot understand the mentality that seems to think that machinery coming from England is better than our own manufacture.  One of our factories is larger and better equipped than any of the English factories, and can supply better machinery than any in England.  We should give an industry of that kind, with large capital, which has been carrying on with considerable difficulty and which is blessed with efficiency and enterprise in its management, every opportunity, and that is what we are proposing to do. I do not propose to delay the Dáil longer as there is another motion to come before the House.  Deputies will realise the necessity for getting a decision in respect of this and the subsequent motion this evening.  Certain instructions must go to the Customs authorities, and it is necessary that before the Dáil adjourns the decision upon these motions should be known so that either the modifications can be brought into operation at once or the duties cease to be applied.  If the resolution is defeated the duty ceases to be operative and any duty which has been paid by the importers as long as the duty was operative becomes repayable. There is no reason however why this particular duty should not be made permanent, and I hope in respect of any other proposal of a similar nature I have to make that it will be possible for me to make as strong a case for it as in this particular instance.</P>

      <P>There was one point in the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that will, I think, cause a certain amount of anxiety, namely, that in the event of a new industry being established in the Free State and that industry being established by reason of a certain definite protection given, that industry might collapse if a new <Col N="1258" /> Government came in with a change of policy.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy misunderstands me.  In relation to the establishment of a new industry in consequence of a certain contract with the Government, I think that contract would be regarded as binding upon our successors, just as the contract our predecessors made in the case of the Carlow Beet Factory is binding upon us.  But the rate of import duties that applies in the case of particular commodities is obviously one that could be varied from time to time.  What I am suggesting is that Deputies opposite should assent, say, to this extent, in connection with industrial development, namely, that they would undertake that any duties which this Dáil applies would not be modified without examination by some body before which the industralists concerned could make their case; that if we are going to get people to invest capital and risk their resources in consequence of any protective measures adopted, it is necessary that they should have some degree of security as to the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Customs Duties (Clothing and Wearing Apparel) (Provisional Variation) Order, 1932, which was made on the 26th day of April, 1932, by the Executive Council under Section 1 of the Customs Duties (Provisional Imposition) Act, 1931, (No. 38 of 1931) and a copy of which was laid on the Table of Dáil Eireann on the 28th day of April, 1932, be approved, subject to the following modifications, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  there shall be inserted in the said Order after paragraph 5 thereof a new paragraph as follows&mdash;&ldquo;6.  The duty imposed by this Order shall not be chargeable on component parts of personal clothing and wearing apparel which are made wholly or mainly of non-textile material or materials, but this exemption shall not apply in respect of parts made wholly or mainly of leather unless the parts are intended for and suitable for use in the manufacture of hats or caps,&rdquo; and</P>
      <P>(b)  the Schedule to the said Order shall be amended in the following respects and shall be construed and have effect accordingly, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  by the addition at the end of sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 1 of the said Schedule of the words &ldquo;not including umbrellas,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>(ii)  by the addition at the end of sub-paragraph (c) of the paragraph 1 of the said Schedule of the words &ldquo;not including gloves,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>(iii)  by the addition in sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 2 of the said Schedule of the words &ldquo;and collars&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;shirts,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>(iv)  by the deletion of sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 2 of the said Schedule.</P>
      <P>I will try to be as brief as possible because it is necessary to get a decision on the Resolution before 10.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duty imposed by the Order was as follows:&mdash;60 per cent., with a preferential <Col N="1263" /> rate of 40 per cent., upon men's and boys' ready-made clothing and other ready-made clothing of various description as set out in the Order.  No change in the existing rate of duty upon shirts, collars, straw hats, felt hats of all descriptions, hats of any other description and intended for wear by women and girls, and all component parts and all accessories of any of these goods.  When I say no change, the existing rate of duty was 15 per cent.  Under this Order the maximum may be 22½ per cent. with a preferential rate of 15 per cent.  The present rate is 30 per cent. upon every article of men's and women's wearing apparel. The modification proposed in the resolution is designed to take out and place in a separate category all gloves. As the Revenue Commissioners themselves interpreted the original Order, gloves made of leather were subjected to the higher rate of duty and gloves made of wool to the lower rate of duty. The intention is that all gloves be subjected to the 30 per cent. rate.</P>
    <P>The position in respect of this industry is probably well known to a number of Deputies.  For a number of years past a Customs duty of 15 per cent. was applied to all wearing apparel.  We have split up that duty as it were into its component parts by an increase in respect of some articles and a lessening of the duty in respect of others.  We have increased it not so considerably in respect of the third class.  Another change that we are proposing to make in the Order is to admit free of duty parts for caps&mdash; peaks and leather parts.  We are proposing to abolish the duty now payable upon cloth for manufacture into caps, which cloth is of a kind not now supplied from within the country or likely to be supplied from within.</P>
    <P>A considerable reduction should take place in the price of caps.  I hope that announcement will be of some consolation to certain merchants who have been importing these caps at a very high rate in the past couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>The position in respect of men's and boys' clothing is this: This industry despite the fact that it had a slender <Col N="1264" /> measure of protection of only 15 per cent. has developed at a remarkably rapid rate here.  The imports of men's and boys' suits amounted to £835,000 the year before the tariff, and they amounted to £207,000 last year. Pre-tariff there were less than 800 workers employed, calculated on a full time basis, in the industry.  The numbers employed had reached 2,561 in September of last year.  The main development of the industry has been in respect of men's and boys' suits. The development is not so rapid in respect of men's and boys' overcoats, but that end of the industry is developing now.  There is no reason why the £60,000 which represents our imports of overcoats should not disappear in due course, and all these coats be made by the existing factories.  Generally speaking, the requirements of the country in respect of ready-made suits and men's and boys' overcoats amount to £1,300,000.  Of that possibly £1,000,000 worth is supplied from within the country and £300,000 worth imported.  So the industry has only a very short step further to go in order to meet our entire requirements.  The intention of this duty is to secure for them the remaining portion of the market.</P>
    <P>The development of the industry, which was very rapid the first years after the tariff, was checked in 1927 when certain firms, Messrs.  Burton, Hipps and other firms operating multiple shops commenced operations here.  The operations of these firms did check the development of the industry. One remarkable fact about the industry is that the competition between native manufacturers is very severe, with the result that prices have been kept at a very remarkably low level.  Despite the fact that a duty of 15 per cent. was imposed, the prices prevailing for men's and boys' ready-made suits have not been higher than those prevailing in England and Northern Ireland.  The costs of production here are slightly higher and the representatives of firms who operate factories in the Free State and the Six Counties, with whom I discussed this matter, assured me that the profit here, in consequence of this <Col N="1265" /> keen competition, is very much lower than in respect of the Six-County factories.</P>
    <P>In the hat and cap industry there were three firms employing about 90 workers when the tariff was first imposed and there are now five employing 200 workers.  It is anticipated that there will be further development there in consequence of the facility which we are proposing to give by exempting from duty the raw materials which were heretofore taxed.  In the making of ties, there were five firms employing about 100 workers pre-tariff, and at the moment there are nine firms employing 222 workers.  In the umbrella industry there were three firms employing 45 workers pre-tariff, while at the moment there are four firms employing about 75 workers.</P>
    <P>In the case of women's clothing, the development has not been to anything like the same extent.  A beginning, in fact, is only being made in the manufacture of women's heavy outer garments. In respect of women's light outer garments and under-garments, there has been a substantial industry in existence for a number of years.  There are at present almost 30 firms in the Saorstát engaged in that business. All these firms have made very definite progress since the tariff was imposed in 1925, the number of workers engaged having increased from 100 to 800 over that period.</P>
    <P>In respect of hosiery, the position is this: that although a very substantial advance has been made in consequence of the protection afforded, there is still a considerable distance for this industry to travel before it will have reached the point at which it will be supplying our requirements.  The most rapid advance has been in respect of wool hosiery.  The imports of wool stockings have decreased since 1924 from £344,000 to £171,000 in 1930, and wool underwear from £151,000 to £106,000.  In the case of fancy hosiery, there has been an increase of imports in respect of cotton, artificial silk and other materials.  The industry has not made much headway up to the present.  There is no reason why the <Col N="1266" /> firms existing here, if they secured the market, cannot meet all our requirements in respect of these articles and produce them at a highly competitive price.  For a slight period, during which the industries will be installing the necessary machinery and perfecting their organisation to meet the situation consequent on these new tariffs, there will be some slight dislocation.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to anticipate that dislocation now, because in respect of this class of goods there has been a considerable importation during the past few weeks, and there is probably in the country a very considerable supply which will avail to meet all our requirements during the period when the factories are extending their plant and equipment, and which will enable them to get to the position of availing in full of the new markets now made available to them.  I do not wish to delay the Dáil any longer, as some Deputies may wish to speak on this matter.  I am anxious to supply any information Deputies may require.  In case Deputies feel that the time at their disposal is unduly limited, I will point out again that they will have another opportunity to speak on the matter when the Bill confirming this Resolution is submitted to the Dáil ten days hence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise this Resolution has to be passed by 10.30, and I do not want to take up much time.  I think the method by which the Government is proceeding in this matter is about as objectionable as they could have chosen.  There was not, at any rate, the secrecy about their intentions that there might have been.  It was rumoured all around that some tariff of this nature was going to be imposed, and great numbers of people took advantage of the opportunity and imported large quantities of goods. Perhaps other people were caught out, and they will suffer.  In that respect, this was not a surprise action on the part of the Government.  This order was rushed out in such a way that it required considerable modification afterwards.  There would have been an excuse for acting as they did in hurrying <Col N="1267" /> out the order without all the consultation that there might have been if they were going to secure that there would be no forestalling.  They did not secure that there would be no forestalling, and, on the other hand, there was not adequate consultation.  As a matter of fact, a great deal of confusion has arisen, and a great deal of trouble and annoyance has been occasioned to traders that ought not to have been occasioned.</P>
      <P>Numerous complaints have been addressed to me on this matter.  I gather the order which imposes these duties has not yet been printed or made available to people who might be interested.  It may have been available in some form, but it was not readily available.  The order fixes duties by reference to a previous Act and it is very difficult to understand. If one takes the original Act and the amending order it is hard to be sure at what rate a particular thing is charged.  I presume those who have already paid 60 per cent. on gloves will be entitled to a refund of the excess duty.  In cases where people have had parcels tendered to them and have refused them and are now prepared in view of the modification to accept those parcels, I think the double delivery fee ought not to be charged.  That perhaps is a matter for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs rather than for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  But if the order was issued in such a form that it had to be charged, then I think the trader should not have to pay double in consequence of the Government changing its mind.  This tariff is going to cause a very substantial increase in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are great ranges of the cheaper goods, the goods which the poor must use, and there is little likelihood of their being manufactured here, at any rate, for some considerable time. There are ranges of goods&mdash;I do not say this particular motion deals with them&mdash;which are not made here. There is nothing approaching them in price made here.  So far as the cheaper classes of hosiery and cotton <Col N="1268" /> underwear which is bought in large quantities by the poor are concerned, there seems to be very little prospect that they will be made in quantities here for some time.  I think the same applies to women's wear.  The poor will have to bear the cost of things that are going to be very substantially increased.</P>
    <P>So far as men's ready-mades are concerned, considerable progress has been made by the industry; but I gather as a result of the changes made in the tariff on fabrics, the tariff being applicable to the cheaper ranges, all tweeds with price lists have been withdrawn from the traders and these goods are going to cost more to the traders and the public.</P>
    <P>This is, therefore, a tariff which is going very substantially to increase the cost of living.  It is a complicated sort of tariff dealing with different classes of goods, and it seems to me to be the sort of tariff, especially as these goods are protected already and progress has been made, that should have been imposed only after a public or semi-public investigation so that there might be some discrimination, and the tariff should not be imposed on classes of goods that must be bought by the poor and that are not likely to be made here in sufficient quantity for a considerable time.  Somebody said that the tariff is kept at its existing level on the classes of goods which the Minister for Industry and Commerce knows about and, where he does not know about them, he has increased the tariff in such a way as to make it certain that the cost of living figure will be affected.  The Minister said the other day that he did not anticipate that the tariff policy will raise the cost of living figure at all.  Everything that I hear from traders who are not Free Traders, they are simply retailers, convinces me that this tariff is going to have a very serious effect on that section of our people who will feel the increased cost most.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to one matter.  It is in connection with pads, shinguards and gloves used in playing games. <Col N="1269" /> These articles are not manufactured here.  The Revenue Commissioners previously regarded these as wearing apparel.  It was never the intention to put them down as wearing apparel, but unfortunately the Revenue Commissioners gave that interpretation to the words and there was no getting out of it.  These things were treated as wearing apparel.  In view of the fact that they are not manufactured here and that they are not wearing apparel I would ask the Minister to make an exemption in the case of pads, shinguards and gloves that are used in games.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that all these emergency regulations will be reviewed again at the Budget time and that therefore we need not now discuss the whole principle of the various tariffs that are proposed.  Therefore I do not propose to vote against them, because their defeat would hopelessly and unnecessarily embarrass the Government. We can discuss them fully, on the Budget. I do say this, that this tariff above all others is going to hit the poor and nobody but the poor.  Anybody who is fairly well off gets his clothes made at home.  People who are fairly prosperous buy their clothes made to measure and the people who will suffer over this tariff are the poor who try to keep their children clean and neat. That is abominable.  They will be made pay this tariff.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I will invite the Minister to investigate the conditions under which the workers in this industry are working in the City of Dublin.  If he does he will come to the conclusion that greater pressure ought to be brought to bear upon clothing manufacturers who already have benefited by tariffs to see that their operatives work under better conditions than those under which they work at present. I will ask the Minister to look into that question between now and Budget time.  Is it reasonable that on the first departure to the new intensive policy of tariffs the poor should be made pay first and suffer the most?</P>

      <P>I would like to get the views of the Minister with regard to how he proposes to deal with second-hand clothing.  Is he going to impose a tariff on second-hand clothing?  Already there is a tariff on boots to the extent of 15 or 20 per cent.  Has the trade in the country increased very much as a result of that?  I was speaking to a manufacturer the other day. He had 300 men employed before the tariff and now he has 350.  It is all right to collect money from tariffs, but it is another thing to have the people going naked.  Some of the Deputies who question my statement that the people may have to go naked might be very glad later on to wear a suit of second-hand clothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to support this motion.  Something can be said in favour of it that cannot be said about other motions of a similar character introduced by the Minister.  In the course of the debate someone said that this would tend to increase the cost of clothing for the poor.  If the cost of ready-made clothing is increased on the poor people it will be nothing but a crime.  The Minister knows, or at least should know, because he has had some contact with the business, that there are efficient ready-made clothing factories in this country where they can, if they wish, produce an article as good and as cheap as anything that can be imported.  I know the word &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; is rather a relative term, but the fact remains that in Dublin and Cork you have efficient clothing factories employing a fairly large number of persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the last few weeks supervision was suggested, I think by <Col N="1271" /> Deputy Davin, and the suggestion was responded to in a very friendly way by the Minister.  I think it would be advisable if there was some supervision, and if some price regulation board was set up, some board which would prevent profiteering in this particular commodity.  Apart from being concerned with the price charged to the poor, I am just as much concerned with the conditions that will operate in the industry.  Will the Minister guarantee&mdash;and he can do so&mdash;that the Trade Boards Act will operate, and that no sweated conditions will obtain in the industry in the Free State? Those of us who take an interest in the economic development of the country know that in Dublin particularly a number of one-horse shows are being set up.  Some person starts a factory in a back room or in a slum, engages four or five young girls, and sweats these girls, and will do the same so far as male labour is concerned.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to discriminate between one class of the community and another, we are aware that a number of Easterns&mdash;they will easily be identified by that appellation&mdash;are engaged in the industry in Dublin.  I want to know what steps the Minister proposes to take to see that these people will not sweat the mere Irish, taking advantage of this high tariff on ready-mades.  Will he see to it that there is no orientation of a lot of these gentlemen into the country, and that they will not be allowed to come over here from the East End of London to establish factories in Dublin and possibly in Cork in order to exploit the mere Irish?  Will he offer the protection to the poor of this country that he is now offering to the manufacturers? I want to have these safeguards extended to the poor.</P>
    <P>I am supporting the motion because I feel it is going to increase employment in the industry and because I feel also that the materials can be produced in this country.  Good, honest, Irish tweed, good, honest homespuns can be produced and, because of the facilities of new machinery and because of highly-skilled labour in that industry, <Col N="1272" /> we can produce these articles as good and as cheaply as any outside firm.  I admit that this country could not and will not be able to compete with imported articles manufactured under such conditions as I have referred to&mdash;sweated labour.</P>
    <P>I also want the Minister to assure the House that he will see to it that the Trade Boards Act will operate in connection with this industry.  In that connection I would point out to him that at the moment a number of handicraft tailors are engaged in the industry. The Minister must be aware of that, too.  I do not claim to know too much about the industry, but in my inquiries into other industries I found that a number of handicraft tailors are engaged in these ready-made factories.  It might appear to be a misnomer when I say a handicraft tailor is engaged in a ready-made factory, but in order to compete with the firms the Minister has mentioned, firms which I do not think it right or proper to mention here, Irish firms have engaged that class of labour for making and attaching the collars of the garments.  Will the Minister also see to it that the Trade Board in regard to the handicraft tailoring industry is also revived and that fair conditions will operate?  I do not want to see a number of exploiters in this any more than in any other industry. It matters not to me whether our Irish people are exploited by Jew or Gentile. I want to see that they are not exploited at all.  I do not care what flag that man flies over his factory, whether it is green, white and yellow, or the plain honest green flag with the harp in the centre of which I am very fond, but I do want to see that fair conditions will operate and that the working classes, the people of Dublin, Cork and of other parts of the State, will not be exploited in these industries.  I want this assurance from the Minister. I am not making a bargain because I am going to support this tariff on the principle that it may give employment. I believe that we Irish people can make these goods as good and as cheap as they can be made abroad.  In order that the poor people of the country will not be fleeced and exploited, it is <Col N="1273" /> up to the Government to take the steps I have indicated.</P>

      <P>I should like to have one or two questions answered, so as to get this in its setting.  If I take the taxation already evidenced by some of these orders, the point as to the increase in the unemployment insurance contributions, the order as to the butter tax, footwear and cocoa, it seems to me on an ordinary calculation that there is a likelihood of about one and a half million pounds being imposed by way of extra taxation.  I want to know what is going to be added by this tariff.  I find myself in difficulties in regard to these early statements about component parts.  What does the statement about component parts in paragraph (a) of the new order mean?  In the schedule of the original order, section 1, lettered section (d) there is talk of &ldquo;all component parts and all accessories of any article mentioned in any of the foregoing sub-paragraphs of this paragraph.&rdquo;  Does the piece of the material count as a &ldquo;component part?&rdquo; Is that included as a component part?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister expect that there will ever be a &ldquo;component part&rdquo; brought within the definition, since it will be merely the shaping which will be in question. It will be easy to avoid it.  If that is so, the lettered end of that paragraph is negligible, and we will have to wait and see the decision of the Government on this point of the fabric itself. I leave that out of calculation at the moment, and I leave out the big tax there would have been under this order if the fabric had been included. Would the Minister, at a later stage, if it is possible&mdash;and I think it is, though it could not be done now&mdash;segregate out for us the employment <Col N="1275" /> which is likely to be given under the different headings of his first schedule &mdash;the schedule as it appeared in the original order&mdash;and the increased employment he hopes to get out of the (b) item, proofed wearing apparel and proofed clothing, not including umbrellas.

      <P>The Minister has not got my point.  There was a duty put on.  In effect, it operated as a tax. There was very little in the way of women's hats made in this country. There is going to be a heavier tax put on clothing&mdash;a heavier tax than before. I suggest that there should be relaxation on the women's clothing side, particularly in respect of women's hats. Otherwise, if the Minister is not going to relax, will he let us know what employment has already been given by that tax, if it is going to be constant and what increase in employment he is <Col N="1276" /> going to look for in respect of women's clothing, apart from this question of hats.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister informed the House, and I am sure he has figures to support the statement, that subsequent to the election of the present Government, there appeared to be a considerable increase in articles imported under this heading.  Can the Minister produce any set of figures covering any period that he has in mind, showing that his statement is justified, when compared with the figures of a corresponding period for the previous year?  I noticed that following the return of the present Government several influential deputations of manufacturers were received, including a deputation of those engaged in the industry dealt with in the resolution.  A report of an interview with the Minister appeared in the newspapers, and I am a little bit anxious to know if we can get any information from him as to what actually transpired at the interview. Did the Minister get an indication from those he met in the trades covered by the resolution as to the extent to which new capital might be put into them?  Did he question them about wages and conditions operating in the concerns for which they are responsible?  Has the Minister been furnished with records to show the wages paid and generally the conditions prevailing in these industries?  Am I to take it that he is satisfied with the working conditions of the employees engaged in them?  From information at my disposal I share, to a large extent, the fears expressed by Deputy Anthony, because I knew long before I anticipated a resolution of this kind, that in Dublin wages and conditions have been imposed upon women and men in this trade that would not be imposed in China or in any other country.  I am not going to commit myself to resolutions in this House, now or in the future, for the purpose of giving the benefits of tariffs to people engaged in industries, <Col N="1277" /> unless there is a definite assurance that decent, human, Christian standards and conditions will be applied by those who are going to benefit.  My attitude on this matter applies to other industries but I am more concerned about this industry because I can see little hope of controlling the prices that are likely to prevail as a result of the imposition of this tariff.  When imposed in other industries tariffs may make it possible for the Minister to fix prices by way of a tribunal, but I cannot see how such a price fixing tribunal can regulate prices in this industry.  Being satisfied about that I want the Minister to give an assurance to the members of this Party that if he has not got the information concerning conditions operating in the industry covered by the resolution, he will do so and satisfy himself that the manufacturers who are going to get the most benefit out of this will apply decent rates of wages for the workers and also human conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am right and that Deputy Dillon was wrong in suggesting that the figures mentioned in the resolution are likely to be modified in the Budget resolutions.  I take it that that is not so.  I ask the Minister if he can see any good reason for imposing this tax on second-hand clothing.  I came across an instance some time ago where a number of persons associated with the Abbey players when in England sent home some old clothing to a charitable organisation.  I was amazed to receive a letter from one of the members protesting against a duty being imposed on clothing sent to a charitable organisation for distribution to poor people. I would like to know if there is any possibility of excluding from the tariff clothing of that description or, of modifying the duties.  I am mainly concerned about the conditions of labour in the industries that are going to benefit from the duties.  I have very positive information that individuals associated with one industry are not prepared to pay anything like the proper rate of wages, and I want to see that they are not going to get the <Col N="1278" /> benefit of a duty of this kind at the expense of the poor and the workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with second-hand clothing the situation, of course, is that the duty applies to second-hand clothing in the same way as to new clothing.  I understand that the Public Health authorities have considerable objection to the importation of second-hand clothing in large quantities. Possibly we will have some action by them in respect to it as they have reason to believe that there is some spread of disease in this country, in consequence of the large importation of second-hand clothing.  On the other question raised by Deputy Davin, the position in respect to the ready-made clothing manufacturers is that for boys' and men's suits, women's light garments and outer garments, there are Trade Board trades in which the rates of wages and conditions of working are regulated by Trade Boards.  If Deputy Davin has any information that Trade Board rates are not being paid in any particular concern, I would be glad if he sent me the information.  If there is any reason to believe that the rates are unsatisfactory it is the duty of the workers' representatives on the Board to take the matter up in the first in-instance with the Boards.  Is the Deputy satisfied on that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more concerned to know if the Minister asked for certain information when he received the deputation and if he got figures and is satisfied with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the rates of wages are fixed by the Trade Boards.  The manufacturers assured me that they pay Trade Board rates, and some of them stated that they were paying more.  There are recognised piece rates in all these industries. We got these rates from them in certain cases, because costings had to be gone into in order to compare prices here with prices abroad.  There are certain matters that I want to have cleared up before the discussion terminates.  In the first place, the question of prices and the increased cost of living is of most <Col N="1279" /> importance.  There is no reason whatever why a person who is prepared to buy Irish goods should pay more.  That is quite obvious.  A certain class of goods will be imported and a duty paid on them such as artificial silk stockings, fancy hosiery, certain fancy overcoats and heliotrope suits.  If people want to import these goods there is no reason why the State should not get the revenue.  The State must get revenue in any case and I would sooner see it getting it in that way than by taxing sugar or tea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to ready-made clothing, prices are as low here as in Great Britain or in Northern Ireland, because the competition is keener here.  In future, in consequence of the duties we have imposed on clothing, there is undoubtedly the prospect that ready-made suits, made out of imported cloth, will be slightly dearer &mdash;by about 1/6 or 2/- a suit.  However, the position is that the poor person who has been referred to, and whose interest we are all anxious to safeguard, can get a better suit of clothes made from Irish cloth at a cheaper price.  In so far as it is necessary for him to go naked, as Deputy O'Hara put it, we are safeguarding his interests. That applies to all ranges of goods covered by this duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The same conditions do not apply in respect to children's ready-made clothing.  I appreciate that.  But they are likely to apply in the future as certain additional firms are going into that particular business now, that is, the manufacture of children's ready-made clothing.  I expect <Col N="1280" /> that in respect to these classes of goods the same conditions as regards competition and output will operate as in the case of adults' clothing at the time.  That brings us up against the question: what duty is going to be effective?  Deputy Blythe referred to boots.  The position in respect to boots is that we increased the duty from 15 per cent. to 25 per cent.  The English manufacturers who are importing boots here met that position by cutting the price of their boots to such an extent that you can now buy English boots and shoes cheaper than you could have bought them before the duty was increased. That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally applied.  It has been advertised in the newspapers.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring now to the price lists circulated by these English manufacturers to their customers in Ireland representing the price at which they are willing to supply boots during this season and comparing those prices with the prices at which they sold last season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That explanation is possible: that they are, to some extent, <Col N="1281" /> cutting their prices, and in other respects depreciating the quality of the article.  That brings up the question: at what stage can you give an effective measure of protection to existing industries to give them an opportunity of developing?  The English themselves imposed a duty of 25 per cent. on boots. England is a highly industrialised country with a great number of large boot factories and is in a position to supply all her own requirements. Because we are not in that position, even though our duty is at the same rate as the rate in England, it will, in consequence, be less effective than the British duty in Britain.</P>

    <P>There is one point that I want to get quite clear in the minds of everyone and it is this: that these tariffs need only bring in revenue to the Exchequer in so far as people want English goods or goods made out of English cloth in consequence of their shape, style, colour or something of that kind.  But people who are prepared to buy and wear Irish goods made out of Irish materials can get them cheaper in consequence of this tariff than they have ever been able to get them before. There need be no increase and there will be no increase in the cost of such goods.  There is certainly no reason why anybody should have to undergo the hardship that Deputy O'Hara contemplates. Deputy Gorey referred to shinguards and articles of that kind. These things may not be made here, but because of the administrative difficulties involved in exempting them from duty we should not do it, and if revenue does come into the Exchequer from that source, well it is expended for the good of the country from the Exchequer.  The figures with reference to imports during the past few weeks have, in certain cases, been supplied to me, but it is not upon such figures that my information relating to abnormal imports are based.  That information is based on special reports received from the Customs authorities at the various ports, and I do not think that anybody has any doubt in his mind that very large imports of these goods have, in fact, taken place.  However, in a short time, the monthly import figures <Col N="1282" /> will be available, and Deputies will have an opportunity of comparing the position for themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony referred to foreign firms coming in here for the purpose of exploiting Irish workers.  We will shortly be proposing to the Dáil legislation which will, in the case of certain industries to which that legislation can be applied by order, give us the power to control new entrants into these industries, in order to ensure that, where an industry is already developed, where Irish capital is invested in it, and where the requirements of the country are, or are about to be, adequately supplied from existing industries, it will not be possible for some foreign firm to come in here, and utilise its larger capital resources for the purpose of driving these Irish firms out of the market.  In other words, we are going to give persons who put money into Irish industries a certain measure of security which will be used to operate against undesirable aliens coming in here to start factories.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister extend the same protection to the operative as it is now proposed to extend to the manufacturer?</P>

      <P>On that point, I would like to know if the Minister has been supplied with the right information.  Is he giving an assurance to this House that all the industries covered by this resolution can be dealt with by Trade Boards?  Is he aware that certain employers' representatives on certain Trade Boards, who are not willing to face facts, do not attend the meetings and turn the whole business into a farce?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will promise the Deputy this, that Trade Boards are going to become effective instruments in regulating conditions of employment.</P>

      <P>The whole position in respect of Trade Boards is under review, and certain reorganisation is taking place which, I trust, will result in these Boards becoming much more effective than they might have ever been in the past.</P>
