      <P>A question put down by Deputy Corish for Wednesday was, due to his unavoidable absence on that day at the funeral of the late Deputy Captain Redmond, postponed until Thursday, but owing to a genuine misapprehension the question was not answered yesterday, and I desire to assure the Deputy that no discourtesy of any kind was intended.</P>

      <P>There were various matters raised on the Vote yesterday afternoon, and I would like, as briefly as possible, to cover as many of them as I can.  A number of Deputies, including Deputy McMenamin, Deputy Morrissey, and Deputy Gorey, raised a question as to the possibility of a reduction in the cost of telegrams from 1/6 to 1/-.  If the reduction asked for were applied in the Saorstát, Great Britain, and Northern Ireland, it would mean a loss of £41,130, and it has to be remembered that we are already losing £100,000 on the telegraph service.  In all the circumstances the Department does not feel that the further reduction asked for is possible.</P>
      <P>The question of porterage charges was also raised by various Deputies. In anticipation of the matter being raised, we have gone very carefully into it.  The actual cost of delivery under this heading is £23,000.  I had a long discussion with the official who is chiefly responsible for this end of the business.  I asked him to review the position and see if even a reduction in the porterage charge could be made. This matter is at present under consideration, and I think there is a possibility that we may reduce the mileage charge from 6d. to 3d.  I am not definitely committing myself to that at the moment.  There are a few considerations that have to be taken into account before we definitely decide on it, but my sympathy is with those who want this reduction, and I am hoping that it will be possible in the very near future to effect this reduction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the Minister that this sum of £23,000 represents the total charge for the delivery of telegrams within and without a certain radius?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the figure that I have got from the Department.  The actual amount collected is £11,700.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that would represent the amount collected from those living outside a certain radius.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the amount of the collection.  My sympathy is entirely with those who are living in areas far removed from telegraph delivery offices, but, like every other problem in the telegraph service, we have got to consider what we can do in view of the fact that we have a very substantial loss each year.  As I said here last evening, it is a decaying service, and it is difficult to visualise how greater facilities can be afforded, considering the loss that is already involved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon, I think, raised the question of a reduction of staffs and seemed to infer that staffs were being reduced unnecessarily and that this was perhaps affecting the service throughout the State.  I am afraid from my limited experience that the very reverse is the case: that we have many redundant officials that we are finding it difficult to place and still have the responsibility of carrying them, as many of them are established officers.  It is difficult to assimilate these economically, and it is also going to be costly to dispose of them.  We have also very considerable difficulty departmentally in trying to handle the problem of unestablished officers.  There are many factors involved in this.  One's human sympathy is with the unestablished officer whether he is a postman or an operator, and the inclination is to try and keep him in employment in view of the economic condition generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I look upon as one of the tragedies of the service is that the selection often depends on the Minister.  I personally would prefer if that could be obviated, and if the responsibility of making the selection <Col N="477" /> fell into ordinary civil service channels.  There is a certain amount of apparent patronage in the hands of the Minister in charge of the Department which causes a good deal of trouble, and I need not tell Deputies what it means to them in applying for preference for different people throughout the State.  The main point that I want to come to is that we have redundant officers in the service, and that so far from the staff being hastily or unduly reduced the position is quite the reverse.  Deputy Dillon referred to the congestion and faulty service at the General Post Office in Dublin.  So far as I can ascertain from the Departmental heads, there have been no such complaints. I would point out to Deputy Dillon that in most businesses such as transport, restaurants, etc., there are what are known as rush hours and on those occasions one has to cope with the rush hour period as well as one can without unduly overloading the service for what might be looked upon as the normal or slack periods of the day.</P>
    <P>The question of the reduction of telegram charges to Great Britain has already been dealt with, and I do not think I can add any more to it. Deputy Good referred to the high trunk charges, and to the delays&mdash; I think it was he referred to it&mdash;in getting connections with cross-Channel centres.  I am having the matter of the trunk charges investigated, but I cannot hold out much hope of anything in the matter.  With regard to the delays, there has been an undoubted increase in the trunk calls, and particularly cross-Channel calls. The business has grown, it appears, and the only solution would be an arrangement for an additional cable to the cross-Channel ports.  That is a matter involving very heavy expenditure, and, under the present turnover, could not be contemplated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good also suggested that we should reduce charges for telephones. I would like to think that, at some future date, or near date, we might be able to consider that, but it will require considerable development yet in the telephone service before <Col N="478" /> it can be contemplated.  The people are not yet telephonically minded, so to speak, in this country, but undoubtedly there has been a very considerable growth, and if that growth continues we might be able to arrange for reduced charges.  One idea that I have myself is that we should get the American system of monthly charges adopted here.  The sum would look very small, and it might be attractive to subscribers, but involved in that would be the extra cost for book-keeping and furnishing accounts. I would also like to mention that our charges are not considered exorbitant in comparison with the charges in Britain.  The business line charge in London, Birmingham, Glasgow and Liverpool, is £7, while the Dublin rate is £6 10s. 0d.  The private line in these cities is £6, whereas ours is £5, so that we cannot consider that we are being over-charged, particularly when we take into account the proportionately higher number of subscribers there will be on the exchanges in these centres, compared with what we have, even in Dublin.  With regard to the congestion in Rathmines and Terenure, so far as I know, most of these applicants have been satisfied, and the services asked for have been fulfilled. I am having further investigation made to see if there are any outstanding cases; if any orders for installations are not yet completed. Deputy Good also raised the question of reducing the postal rate from 2d. to 1½d.  I pointed out in my opening statement what the effect of that would be&mdash;I think it works out that the reduction in the rate would mean something like £245,000, and, at the moment, we cannot contemplate that reduction, until we show, at least, a margin of profit.</P>
    <P>A good many Deputies raised the question of equality of services, and, theoretically, I agree with them; but it is very difficult to see how it can be worked out.  A person living in the outlying districts, say, two, three or four miles from a country town, may argue that he is a citizen of the State, and entitled to the same services as a resident of Dublin, and, theoretically, that is sound.  But it <Col N="479" /> is a fact that the delivery of letters to the outlying districts far exceeds in cost the postage that is charged. I do not see that we can go very far in regard to giving additional services, when we realise that postmen may have to go a circuit of six miles to deliver three, four or six letters.  We certainly are not at the point yet when the economy of the service would allow it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell dealt with the question of the College Green Post Office, and I may say that that matter has been engaging the attention of the Department for quite some time.  We are hoping to have reconstruction at College Green.  Certain steps are being taken in that direction at the moment.  With regard to his complaint about the signs and curtains at that and other offices, I will try to see that such minor complaints as that will be dealt with.  Deputy Briscoe raised the question of the savings bank, and the possibility of development in that direction.  I may say that the savings bank department belongs properly to the Minister for Finance. However, I want to assure Deputy Briscoe that I am already seeing how the savings bank end of the business can be further extended and improved.  It is a big problem, and of course will in the ultimate have to be decided by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Myles advocates a flat rate for services.  This is the old problem again of the man who lives three or four miles outside an area.  There is only one aspect of that I should like to point out to Deputies who raised the question, and that is, if the people residing in Dublin have certain services and certain facilities in many directions, they pay for these in another way.  The cost of living is probably considerably higher, rentals are considerably higher, and while they have conveniences it is generally felt that they have to pay for these in a great many ways.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish raised the issue as regards co-operation between the local bodies and the Department.  I infer from what he said that this is the <Col N="480" /> matter of facilities for erecting poles, brackets and so on.  So far as I can learn, this co-operation is sought and generally follows.  The Department has no anxiety to work against any interest or any body representing the people or any of the people themselves.  I can assure him as far as I am concerned, that I will see that co-operation is always sought and that amicable arrangements are made before anything is done.  He also raised the question of the method of compiling the telephone directory.  The directory is complied on the alphabetical basis and it is generally believed that this is the most satisfactory way of doing it.  I know from my experience in other countries that that is the method universally adopted.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Neill raised the matter of the basis of costs for telephone facilities in outlying districts.  I have not had very much time to go into that matter yet.  I have already, before I brought forward the Estimate, investigated it to some extent.  Naturally, the method is to work out the costs of bringing the telephone to an area &mdash;the capital cost, the maintenance cost, and the cost of the engineering work, then take them in proportion to the number of subscribers and fix the cost on the basis of capital and maintenance cost over a certain number of years.  I cannot see that any other method can be adopted.  An isolated subscriber may want a line to his house and it may cost several hundred pounds to bring it.  If he chooses to live in a certain area far removed, say on the top of a mountain, of course the telephone installation can only be made available for him at a certain cost.  He also raised the question of superannuation. I was not very clear as to what he was referring, but I think he was talking about the hardship of unestablished postmen not being entitled to an established pensionable position.  There are very definite Civil Service regulations governing that and they apply in the Post Office as elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy mentioned what seemed to him to be an anomaly of a <Col N="481" /> telephone message having to circuit round Dublin and come back to a point within a few miles of the point of origin.  It will be obvious that there may be areas where a gap of four or five miles might exist between two points and there would be no justification for the erection either of poles of wires between these two points.  If that were the case, the only method of sending a message would be to go right round the circuit.  It looks anomalous, but when one realises that here again a cost of £400 or £500 might be necessary to make a direct connection where there would be very few messages perhaps, the situation I think will be obvious to all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton raised quite a number of points.  As he represents the Union looking after the interests of the postal servants I should like to deal with some of these matters.  I have already been in contact with the Deputy on various matters affecting the status, position and condition of the service generally.  He raised the matter of the Pearse Street office. Whilst the Department will not agree that these charges are entirely justified, and whilst I must frankly admit that up to the present I have not been in the Pearse Street office, I intend to be there next week.  The Dáil will be interested to know that already arrangements are being hurried on so that construction work in the Pearse Street office can be carried out.  We are very definitely expecting to have this work well under way this year. We want the work carried through for various reasons.  It will give a certain amount of employment and I am personally anxious that our staffs should be as well housed and looked after as is possible in the circumstances. Deputy Norton can therefore rest assured that that work will be proceeded with at the earliest possible moment.  The Deputy did raise a rather interesting point with regard to what he called the architectural design and structure of the country offices.  I suppose we all have certain ideas of the ideal Post Office that we would like to see in every village and town, but unfortunately these are not realisable. We have to realise that in many <Col N="482" /> country post offices we have to take the best available.  When we realise further that some of these services only bear a remuneration of £18, £20, £30 and £40, and that for that the services in a small village have to be given, we cannot expect to have a model post office erected there.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised a most important point and one that will require very grave consideration, and that is the question of the closing down of postal services on Christmas Day. There are two points of view about that.  In one sense we would all very much like to release all postal servants so that they may be at home with their families on Christmas Day.  That certainly is very desirable, and if we feel that the public will stand for that, I would be delighted to see it put through.  I understand that all over Great Britain there are almost complete services on Christmas Day.  I might mention also that for Christmas Day work post office officials are given double pay, and it appears that some of them would not like to be deprived of that.  However, taking the thing on its broad basis, I say that we ought to abolish Christmas Day work if at all possible, and I can assure Deputy Norton that my leaning is that way.</P>
    <P>If I can see my way to abolish the Christmas Day deliveries next year, I shall do so, that is, assuming, of course, I am still in the position I am in now.  The public, of course, could make that easy.  I would point out to the House that every Christmas, appeals are made to post early and to avoid the necessity of employing men on Christmas Day, but, like most notices of that type, they are almost completely ignored.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton raised a most important point with regard to the assistants and to the steps that are possible with regard to making promotion easy or at least available in the postal service.  The Executive Council has not yet got to the point of definitely laying down its policy with regard to promotion.  But speaking purely personally, my feeling <Col N="483" /> is that all the avenues leading to promotion should be open to every member of the Civil Service.  That is not so easy as it might appear. The only method I see possible is to leave the doors open either by limited examination plus selective nomination by responsible supervisors and departmental control so that it would be possible for an intelligent, bright youth to progress from the lowest step in the Civil Service to the highest appointment in his Department. That is fundamentally my point of view from the point of view of justice and the leaving open of the door to promotion.  As I say, the Executive Council has not yet dealt with the matter from the complete Civil Service point of view but all my leaning is that way and I hope to see that method adopted.</P>
    <P>He also referred to the moral responsibility of the State in its employment, and referred to the responsibilities and onerous work of the postal servants and the question of wages.  He stressed the fact that wages would have to come before reduced charges.  Here again one would have to approach the matter from the point of view of equity. We do not want any slave-driving or any underpaid workers in the Civil Service.  We want reasonable work under decent conditions.  That is my attitude of mind, and that will prevail in the postal service so far as I can make it prevail.  The question of conditions for the service in the Department being taken before reduced charges will, I fancy, always be taken care of by Deputy Norton and his organisation.  These are the main points raised in the debate that follows the Vote, and I think I have dealt with them certainly as fully as my limited experience in the service enables me to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few questions I want to ask.  Allowing for the £11,000 collected for deliveries outside a certain area, is there still a loss of £22,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimate of the cost of telegraph deliveries in 1931 <Col N="484" /> was £23,000.  The amount collected in porterage fees is estimated at £11,700. In so far as I understand these figures, the net cost of delivery was £11,300.  That is, we recovered £11,700 out of the £23,000 by porterage charges.  If we reduce the porterage charge from 6d. to 3d. a mile, it would mean an additional cost of £5,850.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it you have a loss of £11,300 within the free delivery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>And are you satisfied with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hardly call it a loss, it is the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>The other is loss on cost, too.  Is it worth while trying to recover this irritating charge of £11,000 outside the free delivery area which is a very considerable burden to impose upon people who are forced to live outside the free area?  I have known creameries for instance that have to carry on their business outside the free area who have to pay in many cases 2/6 for each delivery.  In some rural areas I know the amount realised from delivery charges outside the free delivery area paid the messenger for all their deliveries in that area.  For the sake of this small amount and considering the injustice involved, I ask the Minister to consider the matter now and to do away altogether with this unfair and irritating charge instead of proposing to reduce it from 6d. to 3d.  I do not want to use any more adjectives about the matter, but we are suffering from it long enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask time to consider that matter and to go into it with the Department.  I may say it was a personal urge on my part to get the suggestion tentatively agreed to, but even that is not agreed to yet. The question whether we are prepared to lose £11,700 is a very considerable one.  My feeling is that if we approach this step by step it would be a very considerable concession.  I can understand that in certain areas the <Col N="485" /> whole wages paid to the boy delivering these telegrams might be met by these charges.  We had one Deputy here who said he had to pay six or seven shillings for delivery.  If he had three or four deliveries per week it would not only pay the boy's wages, but show a profit.  That is very abnormal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard of any charge so high as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction may I say the point I made was that half a dozen telegrams were delivered together at a charge of 1/- per telegram making the whole charge 6/-.  For the one delivery 6/- was charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like time to consider that matter and I shall go into it with the Department.  I cannot bind myself down to a figure, but I shall consider the whole matter. All my sympathy is to have the services for every citizen in the State on the same basis and the same cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual loss on the telegraph service was £94,000 or £100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>£100,000 on the telegraph service and this would add £11,000 more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>But you will not then be making a victim of one section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder could I trouble the Minister for information on one or two points.  I think he made the definite statement that there are established officers at the present moment redundant through the service and implied that quite a number of unestablished officers could have their services dispensed with without upsetting the economy of the service in any way.  I wonder could we know in what particular branches or in what particular districts there is that redundancy and what are the circumstances in which that redundancy is tending to come about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the difficulty of dealing with cases in which a certain amount of patronage arises. I sympathise very much with his <Col N="486" /> position in that matter.  I think the principal line on which patronage arises is in the appointment of sub-postmasters. In such cases is there not in the Post Office service a machine analogous almost to the Civil Service Commission or to the Local Appointments Commission, with the headquarters staff and the local postmasters? Is there not a sound and responsible machinery for recommendation there, and is it not the practice that there is a definite list of preferences put up to the Minister? If it were generally understood that there was that adequate machinery of selecting the best possible person in the opinion of the Department, would it not be possible to get rid of the patronage pressure that is likely to arise in those cases?</P>
    <P>I would also like to know from what particular branch of the service the pressure comes for no Christmas Day work.  I do not think I ever saw a postman looking unhappy doing his Christmas Day work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like an explanation of the Minister's reply to the query put by Deputy O'Neill yesterday evening.  I quite understand the Minister's position in regard to the cost of extending the telephone to a house, say, three miles from the exchange or from a town where there are no subscribers on that line.  What I would like to understand from the Minister is that A, who is two miles out the country, gets a telephone extended to his house and the entire capital charge is levied on that man over a number of years. Subsequent to A having got the extension and the entire capital charge being levied on him, B, C and D, on the same line, become subscribers. Are they also charged with the initial cost or is the original subscriber charged with the entire capital cost, while B, C and D receive all the benefit of his initiative in getting the cable extended?  If that is so, I think it is a grave injustice, and it is also a handicap on the progress and development of the telephone service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Mulcahy, I cannot at the moment give <Col N="487" /> him the particulars as regards the redundancy in the different Departments of the service.  I could however get these and supply it to him.  With regard to patronage, undoubtedly there is a machine.  There is the system of nomination on departmental advice.  That is being followed as far as it is humanly possible to follow it. The Deputy probably knows quite well to what I refer.  I think it is undesirable that a Minister or anyone in my position or in a similar position should be in a position to be bombarded by all sorts of pull of one sort or another for positions in a service such as ours.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion for the withdrawal of services on Christmas Day, that entirely comes from Deputy Norton who, I think, represents the big Union of which the majority of the members of the service are members.  It is from that Union and through Deputy Norton, that the suggestion came last evening. What the result will be I do not know. I mentioned, of course, already that all officers working on Christmas Day are paid double time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from the Minister that in his own mind he had more or less committed himself so far as he could to do away with Christmas Day work.  I hope his mind is still open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>My mind is still open. What I did say was that my leaning was entirely towards the abolition of Christmas Day work.  My prejudice may be in that direction.  That does not mean to say that having all the facts in regard to the convenience to the public&mdash;the departmental view and all the other factors before me&mdash;that I would decide that Christmas Day should be a closed day.  I hope I will be able to give a judgment, leaving aside my own personal flair for the freedom of employees on Christmas Day.</P>

    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy McMenamin, I find it somewhat difficult to follow what I might call his algebraic economics with regard to the extension of the telephone <Col N="488" /> service.  Of course, if one is a pioneer one pays for it.  If A decides to have a telephone two miles from the nearest centre the Post Office cannot be expected to know that B, C, D, E and F will come on afterwards.  That is purely a matter of ordinary business adjustment and I think it will be treated in the Department on a purely business basis.  I see no other way to do it.  This whole question is being closely examined at present&mdash;that is all I can promise&mdash;with a view to seeing that the very best services that are possible, particularly in the rural areas, will be given as far as the economic position of the service will allow it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not quite clear up the matter that I raised.  If additional subscribers come on the line what I would like to know is does the Post Office make an adjustment of the burden on the original subscriber who is paying the capital charge for the entire extension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy means does it make a revision of the charge originally made?  That, I cannot say, off-hand.  It might look justifiable that a refund of the original charge should be made, that if three new subscribers come along three-fourths of the original cost should be refunded to the original subscriber.  I do not know what business method is adopted.  If the Deputy likes I will investigate the matter and report to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to three points.  The Minister, with some asperity, I must say, referred to my observation about the General Post Office.  I conceive it to be my duty, if I have a complaint to make, however unpopular, to make it and let it be contradicted or jumped on.  I shall continue to do that.  If there are redundant officials in the Post Office I should suggest that some of these redundant ladies and gentlemen should be put in the windows heretofore occupied by the notice &ldquo;Dúnta&rdquo; and give them an opportunity of serving the public instead of fattening on the public funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> So far as the observation I had to make about reducing the cost of telegrams to England, the Minister admits that it is a difficult question.  Representations have been made to the Minister for Agriculture again and again by representative bodies with regard to facilitating the export of agricultural produce, to the effect that the 6d. extra tax on telegrams is a serious charge on that very important industry.  It may be impossible to remedy it.  What I ask the Minister to do, before he puts it out of consideration, is at least to consult the Minister for Agriculture and to look into the merits of the case.  If it cannot be dealt with, we can only bear the burden, but if the Minister for Agriculture advises him that it is a matter of serious gravity, then I think it is worthy of more consideration than a brief reference to the permanent officials of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>The third point I want to make is this: the Minister said that a person living five miles from a town with which he wants to establish communication through the telephone should understand that it would be more economic to send his message to Dublin and back again than to put up poles and wires between these two towns, between which only one message may travel in the year.  I quite understand that, but what we in the rural areas want is that Donegal or Roscommon should be connected with one central exchange in Donegal or Roscommon, and that messages for Donegal or Roscommon should come through the central exchanges in these places.  Messages having to be sent a long way to Dublin and back again to the extreme west of the country involve a considerable delay.  That could be avoided if there was a central exchange in every county, while messages for more remote parts of the country could go through the central distribution system in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to protest against the suggestion made by Deputy Dillon that, first of all, I dealt with this matter of the telegram charges merely by reference to an official or two.  That <Col N="490" /> is not the case.  I had gone into the matter very closely before I came into the House.  I knew it was a burning question with the business population throughout the country and I have investigated it very fully.  I have here a minute prepared over two weeks ago on the matter.  I would also ask him to believe that I was quite sincere in dealing with his point and that no off-hand manner was intended at all.  Actually the position would be if we reduced the minimum telegram charge from 1s. 6d. to 1s., that reduction applied to telegrams originating in An Saorstát for delivery any place in An Saorstát, Great Britain or Northern Ireland, would result in a loss of revenue of £41,130.  In regard to the actual loss on the service at the moment, the revenue last year was £197,700 and the expenditure £298,700. The loss on the service at the moment is £101,000.  It is entirely a matter for this House to make a recommendation or a decision that they will have telegrams at 1s., 9d. or 6d. and that will be carried out, but the House will have to do that knowing what the loss is at present on the telegram service. Deputies will have to add to that the £41,130, the actual amount that the proposed reduction on the charge for telegrams would add to our loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the loss on the service when telegrams cost only 1s.? Has the loss increased or decreased since the cost of telegrams was raised to 1s. 6d.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The loss has been steadily increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the cost was raised to 1s. 6d.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>That I cannot say at the moment.  But there has been a steady loss on the telegraph services for the period since An Saorstát was established and that loss is increasing. I might further add that I have already examined the telegraph reports of the large cable companies in the United States, and the telegraph services throughout the world are a decaying service.  The large cable companies which formerly paid substantial dividends and made enormous profits are <Col N="491" /> facing now a losing period.  One large company that had in dividends three years ago paid a million dollars, this year has passed the dividend altogether. That is the telegraph situation throughout the world and we are no different.</P>
      <P>I am not sufficiently <i>au fait</i> with the position of the telephone service to say what can be done in regard to telephones being operated from one centre in the county.  That will be investigated and, assuming that anything can be done about the matter, the Department will deal with it. On this one would require to have considerably more technical experience than any of us have here, and certainly more than I have got, at all events, to know how the technical position would have to be faced.  The issue I was dealing with when I spoke of gaps in the service referred to a particular area which Deputy Kennedy mentioned here last evening.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy McMenamin, I have now a short brief from one of the Departmental chiefs in which he says that if A is a pioneer, if his rental is say £20, and if B, C, D and E come along later, the whole joint cost will be reviewed and fixed on the usual basis, a reduction will then undoubtedly result to A.  So apparently what Deputy McMenamin had in mind when he mentioned the matter has already been covered by the method of charge in the Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £40,310 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge <Col N="492" /> which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1933, for the Salaries and other Expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the whole year is £60,310.  The accounts last year on a commercial basis, not yet audited, show that our total revenue is £59,229. That was made up as follows:&mdash; From wireless licences, £14,750; Customs tax on apparatus which is credited to the broadcasting section of our Department, £43,129; Advertisements, £1,350.  The expenditure out of the Vote was as follows:&mdash; Broadcasting service, £40,574; Posts and Telegraphs, £5,000; Exchequer and Audit Department, £100; Public Works and Buildings, £1,000; Rates on Government Property, £250; Stationery Office, £100; Costs of Collection of Customs tax, £4,312. There is a gross surplus, on a commercial account basis, of £7,893. From that has to be deducted, depreciation 7½ per cent., and interest 5 per cent.&mdash;that is, 12½ per cent. on £26,221, which amounts to £3,278, plus an establishment charge of £1,000.  That is deducted from the gross surplus of £7,893, leaving a net surplus, on commercial account basis, of £3,615.  These figures, of course, are subject to final correction before they go to the Auditor-General. The Vote is for £60,310 for the entire year.  It is reckoned that that will be sufficient to cover the broadcasting service.  The total expenditure for the Department is, however, estimated at £88,620, the difference being made up by other Departmental votes as detailed in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>The expenditure is made up as follows:&mdash;Broadcasting service for the coming year, £60,310; Posts and Telegraphs, £4,610; Exchequer and Audit, £50; Public Works and Buildings, £15,350; Rates on Government Property, £500; Stationery Office, £100; Cost of Collection of Customs Tax, £6,000; Additional Cost of hastening the erection of the High Power Station at Athlone for the Eucharistic Congress (Public Works and Buildings Vote), £1,200; Broadcasting Vote, <Col N="493" /> £500; making an estimated total of £88,620.  The estimated revenue from Wireless is:&mdash;Licences, £16,000; advertisements, £5,000; Customs Tax on Wireless Apparatus, £60,000, giving a total of £81,000, showing an estimated deficit of £7,620.  It is only right to mention with regard to that estimated deficit that this year's figures will include a considerable portion of the cost of the building of the Athlone Station.  Capital expenditure on the building of that station during the year was £49,500.  It is expected that a comparatively small sum of £7,000 may be due against the capital account of the Athlone station when this year's figures are completed; that is the coming year's full returns if they reach the estimated figure.  The number of licences issued during the year 1931-2 was 28,693.  The number of licences for valve sets was 24,968 and the number of licences for crystal sets was 3,715.  There were 187 licences issued at £1 and 70 licences at £5 each.  This is an increase of 2,700 in the total.  The revenue from advertisements on sponsored programmes is £1,500, but in the event of sponsored programmes being continued from the new high power station a much higher revenue will be realised.  This matter is now being very closely investigated with the view to a proper valuation of such services from the station&mdash;the length of time to be made available for sponsored programmes, and the standard of quality to be demanded. Arrangements have been made hastening the work in Athlone, in the hope that we may have the high power station temporarily available for the broadcasting of the Eucharistic Congress. This entails an extra cost of £1,700.  It was felt that on such an important occasion we should broadcast from our own high power station. The contractors expect to have everything ready for that work, but this will be for temporary service only. I am not personally conversant with all the details and matters, such as programmes and station orchestra. But all these things are being gone into.  I have already done a certain amount of work with regard to them <Col N="494" /> and I will be guided a good deal by any suggestions that may be put forward for consideration here to-day.</P>

      <P>The position is that £49,500 was the capital expenditure on the station for this year&mdash;that is, on the erection of this high power station.  I think that the total cost of the station will be between £70,000 and £80,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quarrelling with the total amount of the cost. The only thing I would like to impress upon the Minister is this: If this money is to be spent, that the Minister, through his technical advisers or whoever is responsible, should insist that this is the most effective wireless station that can be erected.  I am not particularly concerned as to the nature of the programmes that are to be given, because if the programmes are not what they should be or what the public want, the public will soon dispose of that.  All they have to do is to turn the switch and turn on to another station.  The outstanding thing, from the national point of view, is that this new station should be a credit to the country, and that whatever steps are necessary to be taken should be taken now to see that that object is achieved.  Speaking of course for myself, I would not limit the question of expenditure on this matter, because it involves the status of the State and it involves its status not only nationally but internationally. For that reason, when this high-power station is being erected, it should be erected in such a way with such efficiency and power that it will be not only a credit to ourselves internally, but that it will be known throughout the world as a high-class station.  I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to give very serious attention to this matter, because I submit that it is really more important <Col N="495" /> in the immediate future than any other branch of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise first of all to congratulate the Minister on the announcement he has made to the effect that the high-power station will be erected and functioning soon. I want to say, had his predecessor listened to the requests made during the past two years to get on with this work, the extra money now being spent to rush the station for the Eucharistic Congress could be saved. I want to ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to one or two points I wish to put to him.  If the Minister reads the debates criticising this particular Vote during the past four years he will find numerous suggestions made from all parts of the House.  To most of those suggestions his predecessor turned a deaf ear.  I think it would be well if the Minister went through those debates and gleaned from them certain information.  Listeners, and also those engaged in the development of wireless from the point of view of business, are very anxious to have a system inaugurated whereby, while no interference on their part will be made in the functioning of the station, at least their opinions will be listened to, and, if found reasonable, some of them will be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister what his views are with regard to the Advisory Board.  There was an Advisory Board set up, and it was stated by Deputies on previous occasions here that the relations between the Advisory Board and the Department were not satisfactory. Subsequently, members of that Board resigned.  At present the Advisory Board, from the point of view of functioning, is non-existent.  Is the Minister prepared to look into the whole question of the Advisory Board and its relations with his own Department, with a view to the Board having some say in the future with regard to programmes and the manner in which they should be presented to the public? I am sure the Minister knows there has been a great amount of <Col N="496" /> criticism and discontent at some of the programmes&mdash;I will not say all. If he will indicate that he is prepared to set up an Advisory Board to represent the public and the trade he will find that complaints of this nature will cease to exist.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the number of increased licences.  Now is the time when the Irish station will have to give a programme that will be worth while listening to, if the Minister is to look forward to a continued increase in the number of licences.  The receipts amounting to £14,000 represent 28,000 listeners.  That number has become more or less stagnant for the last few years.  The Minister points out that a great amount of the income for the upkeep of the station is derived from revenue from the duty applied to the importation of wireless parts.  The Minister will have to realise that wireless apparatus now is more stabilised and there is not the same amount of changing of apparatus or changing of sets as there used to be.  Unless the station is going to be of a nature that will attract increased listeners the revenue from licences is going to fall and the Minister will find himself in a position where he will have to get public funds to keep the department going instead of, as at the moment, having it more or less self-supporting.  The amount of revenue from Customs and Excise will fall because of the stabilising of wireless sets.</P>
    <P>The only way to secure increased revenue is by increasing the number of listeners.  I am not saying this in any spirit of criticism.  The Minister is to be congratulated on the steps he has already taken.  There is great satisfaction amongst the wireless public in the knowledge that they are now going to have a station which can be heard by the people using less expensive sets all over the Free State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>In congratulating the Minister on the two statements he has made I would like to draw his attention to a rather important point. From the number of licences taken out in the Free State it would appear that one in every hundred of our population has a wireless set.  If we compare that <Col N="497" /> with other countries, Great Britain for example, I think the ratio there is one to every eight, or ten or twelve of the population.  It is quite obvious from that that wireless reception here is really in its infancy.  I am not going to suggest to-day what would appear to me to be the reason for this great discrepancy.  I would like the Minister to find out if he can what are the causes which are delaying so much the spread of wireless reception throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to what Deputy McMenamin said with regard to the position that will have to be faced when our high-power station in Athlone is operating. I agree with every word of that.  I am not an expert on wireless and I sometimes have my own doubts as to the desirability of having mechanism in the home as against a certain culture that prevailed perhaps to a greater extent before mechanical methods began to assume such an important part in our lives.  However, I agree that if this wireless station is going to be a success we will have to consider it from every point of view and above all from the point of view of what it is going to mean in representing this country nationally and in its national outlook to the world.  We cannot have either poor programmes or discreditable programmes once the scope of our broadcasting goes beyond the shores of the country.  It is not desirable to have discreditable programmes&mdash;and I hope we never did have discreditable ones. With the ears of the world open we will have to realise that our programmes will have to be, first of all national, characteristic of the country, and above all of a very high standard in order to show that we do realise and appreciate what are the things that are worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I would prefer to see no broadcasting at all in this country rather than have a wireless service which would go outside the country and would not be in every sense creditable to the country.  Deputy McMenamin can rest assured that whilst I have any control I will try to see that such programmes only are <Col N="498" /> broadcast as will be creditable from the artistic, the cultural and the national point of view.  The line of demarcation between what public taste demands and what we would like to give is a line that has to be very carefully considered, but within certain limits we will try to have as our ideal of what broadcasting should be just such things as Deputy McMenamin mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to the satisfaction he felt at the Athlone high-power station being in operation soon.  I would like to make it perfectly clear that the high-power station will be broadcasting for the week of the Eucharistic Congress ceremonies only.  The arrangements are being made on a temporary basis.  The actual completion of the high-power station will not be until probably about the end of October.  Already I have had various communications dealing with the points Deputy Briscoe raised. I do not suppose it will ever be possible to please everybody with a wireless programme.  I have heard complaints of different types&mdash;the quality of the programmes, and the type of programme, the type of artist and so on.</P>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the director or with any director who is trying to please the entire community with a variety of items on the wireless.  All I can say is that we are going fully into the matter to see what can be done with regard to the improvement of the programmes.  That, after all, is largely a matter of expense.  There is an Advisory Board and I think on the whole this Board has been meeting consistently and such differences of opinion as arose amongst the members of the Board were mainly on the question of the orchestra.  That is so far as I know of the matter at the moment. It is felt that the orchestra is insufficient in numbers, that there should be at least twelve to fourteen members in order to supply the different elements that go to make up even a moderately small symphonic orchestra.</P>
    <P>My feeling is that once we start our high-power station, whether we make <Col N="499" /> or lose for the first year, we must have quality, adequate numbers in the orchestra, and adequate service from other artists who will be engaged.  An important thing that will have to be very carefully weighed with regard to Athlone is the sponsored programme. This will be of very considerable value and I think the advertisers will be found to be ready to pay considerable fees.  There is only one possible handicap in regard to that&mdash;that we shall always have to exercise strict censorship over the programmes, however tempting the advertising offer may be. I think the House can rest assured that that matter will be attended to. Deputy Briscoe also referred to listeners.  I differentiate very definitely between listeners and licensees. Quite a number of people have licences who might not be considered listeners to 2RN.  However, the quality of the programmes must be considered if we are to maintain the number of licences.  This can be done to a certain extent.  If we get increased revenue, we will be able to give really good programmes.  It will be necessary, however, to take a chance and gamble on the result by giving decent programmes at the beginning.</P>
    <P>I cannot explain to Deputy Thrift why only one per cent. of the population is using wireless, whereas in other countries the percentage is ten or twelve.  There are, of course, obvious reasons other than economic reasons.  We are an agricultural community and not quite so sophisticated as the city folk of other countries where wireless had its boom before we had even heard of it.  This taste can only grow with time.  That is always assuming that we desire to see the development of the wireless mentality.</P>

    <P>The Land Commission Estimate for this year amounts to £588,102.  That would show a nominal net increase of £9,201 over the Estimate for last year, if we take the figure without reference to the Supplementary Estimate which was passed last month and which amounted to £118,708.  That Supplementary Estimate arose entirely out of the operations of the Land Act of 1931. The major portion of that Supplementary Estimate&mdash;£79,493&mdash;is a non-recurring item.  It was explained at the time the Supplementary Estimate was being introduced that this non-recurring item consisted of what was known as &ldquo;additional sums&rdquo;&mdash;sums advanced by the State to the purchasers in respect of the few months from the gale day to the dividend day after the appointed day.  It really represents a temporary advance by the State, and it is payable by six equal instalments by the tenant purchaser to the State. The arrangement has been made in order that the hardship of payment by a lump sum might be avoided.  In this <Col N="501" /> Estimate a sum of £3,940 arises in the same way&mdash;that is, out of the operations of the 1931 Land Act. Therefore, if we want to arrive at a proper comparison between this year's Estimate and the combined Estimate for last year, we have to deduct these two items, and we have also to deduct the sum of £31,790 in respect of the repayment of additional sums which come in as an appropriation-in-aid. They should be disregarded.  That would leave this year's normal Estimate £615,952 as against a corresponding total of £618,116 last year, or a decrease of £2,164 on this year's Estimate. That indicates that the Estimate for this year and the Estimate for last year are substantially the same.</P>

      <P>I shall deal with the sub-heads later.  The net decrease is £2,164.  As I pointed out, the Estimate as a whole is substantially the same as last year if you deal with it in the way I have mentioned and deduct the items that arose out of the operations of the Land Act of 1931.</P>
      <P>Three sub-heads might call for some comment&mdash;sub-heads B, H and I. Under sub-head B, which deals with travelling expenses, there is a decrease of £7,000 as compared with the Estimate for last year.  That decrease has been brought about by the arrangement made for the headquartering of inspectors in the areas of their employment. The saving was effected by that departmental arrangement.  Under sub-head H there is an apparent increase of £66,000 in the printed Estimates&mdash;that is, if you take it without reference to the Supplementary Estimate for last year.  The Supplementary Estimate added £36,705 to the original Estimate of £34,000, making the total Estimate under this sub-head for last year £70,705.  The real increase for this year is only £29,295, and that sum is also accounted for by the operations of the Land Act of 1931.</P>

    <Title>In Committee on Finance. - Immediate Needs of the Unemployed&mdash;Debate Resumed.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following Motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that steps should be taken forthwith by the Executive Council to provide work or maintenance to meet the immediate needs of the unemployed.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputies Morrissey and Anthony.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephByrne" hpid="Mr. J.J. Byrne Mr. J.J. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We have magnificent headlines in the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; informing the public at large of all that the new Government is trying to do to assist the unemployed.  We have big black letters: &ldquo;Planning the provision of work for all.  Government solution for the unemployed problem.&rdquo;  But this House is still waiting for some information as to how this magnificent planning is going to be carried out, waiting to hear of some concrete proposals to relieve the immediate necessities of the unemployed. The motion Deputy Morrissey has put down is a definite and precise motion.  It calls for steps to be taken forthwith to provide work or maintenance to meet the immediate needs of the unemployed.  The Government have accepted that motion.  We want to know what steps they propose to take now to give food and shelter to the destitute that they themselves admit have considerably increased in numbers.  The time has gone for empty promises; the time has come now for a little performance.  Fianna Fáil were very generous in promising the electorate a new heaven and a new earth if they were returned.  They have been returned and it is time that the public, and especially the unemployed, got some little fulfilment of these promises which is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it might be well just for a moment to dwell upon the unemployed situation as it exists in the City of Dublin.  We all know that there has been a great influx from provincial <Col N="503" /> centres of unfortunate people looking for work and that that has acted very detrimentally on the Dublin people themselves.  But I would like to point out that since the Government came into power unemployment has been steadily increasing.  The needs and necessities of the unemployed have been thereby considerably increased and accentuated.  I do not wish to paint an over-lurid picture of the situation.  I will speak of facts that have come to my own knowledge.</P>
    <P>Let us take the building trade-one of the great means of employment, especially in Dublin City.  I have been credibly informed that building contractors have hastened work that they had in hands and have suspended the carrying out of other work.  I have been credibly informed of two cases which will illustrate the state of uncertainty that exists in the country at present. In Dublin, one large industrial firm contemplated a building extension involving an expenditure of £10,000. That scheme has been indefinitely suspended.  In another case, a firm contemplated a building extension involving an expenditure of £2,000. That scheme has also been indefinitely suspended.  The feeling of uncertainty is such that even in commercial circles employment has been very adversely affected.  As a matter of fact, large firms at the present time are keeping their staffs to the minimum and carefully conserving the capital they have in hands.</P>
    <P>I may remind the President that, under the Dublin Poor Relief Act, £250,000 is being found annually to provide food for the unemployed.  I regret to say that that £250,000 is grossly inadequate to deal with the existing situation in Dublin City. There were listed in the courts one day last week about 160 ejectment cases.  In these cases, the landlords had been as lenient as they possibly could with their tenants, but there is a limit to which leniency can go and that limit had been reached. Within the past three weeks, I have had a great many callers stating that the bailiffs were coming and asking <Col N="504" /> if it would be possible to obtain for them even a respite of a week in order that they might find some shelter. What hope have unemployed people of finding a shelter in the circumstances that now exist?  What landlord would take in people of that type?  What landlord dare take them in unless he wanted to provide for them at his own expense?</P>
    <P>I draw attention to the fact that during the last week 8,014 families received poor relief in the City of Dublin.  Last week, there was an increase of over 900 families receiving poor relief over the number for the same week last year.  I ask the House to visualise an advance of 900 families in poverty over the number that existed last year, involving an expenditure of £4,375.</P>
    <P>In accepting this motion, the State is undertaking to provide work or to maintain these people.  It also involves the further responsibility, the lifting from the shoulders of the ratepayers of Dublin City of a burden that they can ill afford to bear.  Public representatives on the various councils have stated that the position in Dublin City is desperate at present. The heart-breaking factor in the whole situation is that the distress is affecting almost every class in the community.  There is a type of people looking for relief to-day that nothing but the pangs of hunger would ever force to seek for such help or for such remedy.  Amongst the various applicants for poor relief last week there were three men who had managed large business houses in Dublin. One can understand the misery and the mortification of people of that type asking help from the State.</P>
    <P>It is lamentable to notice that for one vacancy, for which the magnificent salary of £90 a year and apartments was offered, there were 112 applications. I think these facts should be considered by the Dáil, and that we should have some definite proposal from the Government as to what they mean to do before this debate ends. On this side of the House, we are not satisfied with the promise of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that something good is coming out of <Col N="505" /> the Budget.  We want something definite now.  We cannot accept the statement that the Minister for Industry and Commerce made in the course of the debate, that a permanent solution of the unemployment problem cannot be separated from the abolition of the Oath.</P>
    <P>We challenge the truth and the accuracy of that statement, and we unhesitatingly assert that it is the carrying out of this political programme of the new Government Party that has so considerably accentuated the present unemployment problem.  I think that the Minister would have received much more sympathy and much more co-operation in this House in dealing with the difficult problem that is confronting him&mdash;we on these benches do not want to minimise the difficulty of that problem, for we have been up against it ourselves&mdash;and that he would have been more honest and honourable had he admitted the truth of the contention of Deputy Morrissey that the unemployment problem transcends in importance the abolition of the Oath, which will provide neither food nor shelter for the unemployed in this State.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister for Industry and Commerce that, in the last debate we had here on this question, he made some very startling and dogmatic statements as to what it was possible to do, and to do immediately. Last December the present Minister, in the course of the debate for the relief of unemployment, stated that a sum of £250,000, if made over to the Dublin Corporation, would be insufficient to deal with the needs and the wants of Dublin City alone.  The Minister is a representative of Dublin City, and there is no member of the House who should be more anxious to look after the interests of his constituents. We want to know what the Minister is going to do in face of the statement he made in December, a statement that is on the records of the House.  We want to know what sum he is going to allocate to deal with the immediate necessities of the moment.  He also told us that steps should be taken which would deal <Col N="506" /> immediately, or almost immediately, with the unemployment problem.  He reminded the House that there were 1,500 shipyard workers idle in Dublin. I can tell the Minister that their number has not diminished since he made his statement here in December.  As I have said, the Minister stated on that occasion that there were 1,500 unemployed shipyard workers in Dublin City, and that the Dublin Dockyard Company had installed new repair equipment and were in a position to do repair work if it were only available.  He told the House how that work could be made available if there was a proper Government dealing with the situation. Now that we have a proper Government capable of dealing with the situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we want them to deal with it as they have promised.  I want to point out to the House&mdash;I do not mind the interruptions of that man from Cork whom nobody minds&mdash;that the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time definitely outlined the ways and means by which this problem could be tackled immediately.  He stated that firms like Heiton and Co., Guinness and Co., and the L.M.S. could be approached, that the L.M.S. carried the Irish mail and that pressure could be applied by the Government to get this repair work done here.  Now the Deputy who made that statement is in control to-day of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and what we want to know is: has he approached these firms and what steps has he taken to carry out the statements he made in the House in December last?  We want to know what pressure has been applied to Messrs. Guinness and Co. to have their repair work done at home. Has the Minister approached Heiton and Co., and what steps has he taken to deal with the L.M.S. Railway?  If he has taken no steps in the matter, then I think it is perfectly obvious that his statements at the time had no sincerity in them; that they were made purely for Party purposes and were simply an exploitation of the miseries of the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the situation amounts to this: <Col N="507" /> that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government to which he belongs have bitten off more than they can chew.  If he is incapable of dealing with the situation, and if the Government to which he belongs are incapable of putting into effect the promises they have so recklessly made, I think it would be better, in the interests of the unemployed and of the State, if they frankly admitted that they were mistaken in the views they held.</P>
    <P>There is one thing an Irishman always admires and that is courage and manliness in anybody.  I did not admire the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he told us that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Hugo Flinn, had various plans to deal with the situation.  I want to ask those seven men on the Labour Benches what mercy will the unemployed of this country obtain from a man of the type of Deputy Hugo Flinn?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;May God save them from their friends,&rdquo; says Deputy Anthony, and in saying that I think he is echoing the sentiments of this House. The critical factor in the whole situation is that the President told the House that he had a sovereign remedy to solve the unemployment problem: that it could be solved more easily in this country than perhaps in any other country in the world.  We are still waiting to hear that something is going to be done for the unemployed.  I want to remind the President that promises in future of pensions for widows and orphans will not help the unemployed in present circumstances, and also the Minister for Industry and Commerce that his promise to place a fresh burden on industry and commerce, on capital and labour, for the payment of further unemployment grants will not help to provide additional work for the unemployed.  I think it is due to the House that we should hear something definite from the President or from the Minister whom he has assigned to deal with this imperative problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> Of course we all know that the solution of the problem is to manufacture at home the goods that we import so needlessly.  We all know that the President has a cast iron tariff system up his sleeve and that the moment it comes into operation there is going to be a complete transformation of the present industrial position in the country.  We have noted some of the immediate effects of that cast iron policy.  We have noted it in the case of two of the most important firms in the City of Dublin, and I am sure the President has noted them.  There are from 6,000 to 8,000 people in employment in Dublin City to-day who have noted the effects of that policy and who are in a very anxious frame of mind.  One thing the new Government never appear to have digested and that is that the imposition of tariffs is a two-edged sword; that this imposition of tariffs is mainly directed against our best customer, practically our only customer, to whom we send 90 per cent. of our exports year after year.  These tariffs are directed mainly against the customer who buys from us the products that we have to sell.</P>
    <P>I suggested in speaking on this debate, on the last occasion, that the business of the State must be run on business lines, and I ask any sane man in this House is it business, or is it logic to begin to quarrel with your best customer?  Could the President not have held his hand, for the time being, and not have created all this insecurity, and all this financial instability, until he sent his representatives to Ottawa, and saw what would be forthcoming there?  There are two ways of accomplishing a thing&mdash; by force or by co-operation.  We warned this country before Fianna Fáil were returned to power that one of the cardinal planks of their programme was a policy of non-cooperation with England.  Will the President say if he still clings to that policy?  Will he give us some information as to whether that is the line on which the economic resources of this country are to be developed, and the line along which he believes that this State can be industrialised?  We have to buy, and we have to sell, and <Col N="509" /> I suggest that the glorious policy of insular isolation, for which those on the opposite benches stand, can bring nothing in its train but misery and disaster either to industry or to the common people of this country.  There has been, of course, a vast difference between the economic policy of the people on the opposite benches and the economic policy of the Government Party.  The Government Party, while they stood for tariffs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>What Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>While the late Government stood for tariffs, and imposed tariffs, they always took care that there would be national gain, and not a national loss.  We are now going to have tariffs imposed, regardless of national gain, and regardless of national loss.  Deputy Norton, when speaking to this motion, asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Government Party generally, whether they were going to profit from the disastrous consequences that had accrued from similar policies in other countries of the world.  Sometimes we are told that the great industries of the world have been built up by tariffs, but any man who knows anything about economics&mdash;and I am sure the President knows a great deal&mdash;knows that the imposition of tariffs is only one factor in the development of a country.  The Minister knows that if he does not set up efficient industries in this country, it would be better that no industries should be set up at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are going to industrialise this country, and set up new industries, we, on this side of the House, are anxious to co-operate in that policy, in every way, but, in co-operating with that policy, there is one thing against which we stand, and that is the protection of industrial inefficiency. Anybody who is conversant with economics knows what industrial inefficiency means.  We have examples of the greatest industries in the world co-operating to reduce overhead charges and expenses.  We have vast schemes of industrial re-organisation being carried out in various parts of the world, and, in this House, not one single word of industrial <Col N="510" /> re-organisation; not one single word of setting up our manufactures in this country on an efficient basis.  We have only one thing&mdash;&ldquo;impose a tariff and trust to God for the rest.&rdquo;  Was there ever such an insane economic policy enunciated by any Party, especially in the case of an agricultural country like the Irish Free State?</P>
    <P>When we are told what tariffs have done for other countries, I wonder if the people who make those statements know or understand what they are talking about.  I wonder would it be news if I informed the House that France, one of the greatest protectionist countries in the world, could have at least trebled her export trade, especially owing to the advantage she enjoyed by reason of the geographical position, had she embarked on a different policy. To-day France has protection.  It is like an old man of the sea round her neck, strangling her, and only for the fertility of the soil of France she could not have survived.  To-day we have French statesmen looking for what?&mdash; the economic unity of Europe, in order to get some relief from this great panacea for the solution of industrial and economic troubles, which the new President sets forth.  I wonder is the President aware that even in the highest industrialised countries, unless production costs are low, there is always a relapse and a reaction.  I wonder would it be news to the House that the great United States of America cannot build ships because of their protection policy.  I think these are facts that he ought to take into consideration.  Important happenings are about to take place shortly under this new policy of the Government Party.  We have Australia before our eyes.  They proceeded upon exactly the same lines on which the new Government intends to proceed.  They set up a cast-iron protection policy, and kept out practically all imports, making the goods themselves, and what was the result?  To-day Australia has a National Debt of £350,000,000, and her currency is threatened with collapse. Do we want the same condition of affairs in the Irish Free State?  If we do not, we ought to hasten slowly. <Col N="511" /> This mad craze which is actuating the Government, and forcing them to close their eyes to the realities of the situation, must be examined, and examined carefully.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, we, on these benches, stand for the industrialisation of this country.  We know very well that tariffs can do a great deal to industrialise this country, but tariffs must be wisely and skilfully used.  The unskilful use of tariffs will produce more evil than good.  I see that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Finance has come in and I hope he is about to disclose these plans to which the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred.  The one thing we want to have, before the debate closes, is what is the Parliamentary Secretary, or any other member of the Government, going to do to find ways and means to deal immediately with the existing unemployment situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a very illuminating statement from Deputy J.J. Byrne on this unemployment question.  He complains that Fianna Fáil have not relieved the unemployment problem in two months&mdash;this legacy of 80,000 unemployed, which Deputy J.J. Byrne, with the assistance of the Executive Council, has created in the country, during the past nine years.  Now he complains that we have not completely relieved it in two months&mdash;Deputy J.J. Byrne, who sells Shamrock shovels, made in Manchester.  I wonder how much employment would the making of those shovels give here?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I question that.  I believe I could nearly produce one here.  The Deputy also threatened us with any amount of ills and woes. He told us about Messrs. Guinness and Messrs. Jacob, and what they will do if we dare move.  I can assure the Deputy that no employer <Col N="512" /> in this country is going to dictate to the present Executive Council. The day when one of these gentlemen by raising his little finger, or when the Masonic Order by using the mailed first, could frighten the Executive Council is gone for good. The Deputy may be certain on that point.  We have heard a lot of talk about what Messrs. Guinness will do. I have some figures here which may be illuminating to Deputy Byrne. Messrs. Guinness, in January, 1931, imported 9,240 cwts. of foreign barley. In January, 1932, they imported 152,000 cwts. of foreign barley, an increase of something like 142,000 cwts. in one month.  There was imported into this country in January, 1931, 6,473 cwts. of foreign malt.  This year they imported 12,796 cwts. of foreign malt, just double the import. The difference between the price of malt and the price of barley is 10/2 per cwt.  The greater portion of that 10/2 goes to labour.  The total amount of foreign malt imported last year was 322,000 cwts, or £167,000 taken out of the pockets of the Irish labourers whom Deputy Byrne complained about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>£167,000 of imports and £5,000,000 of exports!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall settle all that in a few minutes.  The imports of foreign malt increased from 137,000 cwts. in 1929 to 322,000 cwts. in 1931.  There was no increase, but on the other hand a decrease in the export of beer and spirits in the same period.  The total amount of foreign barley imported by Messrs. Guinness in 1931 was 458,000 cwts.  To produce that amount of barley would require 22,000 acres of tillage.  It is no wonder, when we had this condition of affairs existing, that in my constituency, where there were something like 11,000 odd agricultural labourers employed in 1926, there are less than 5,000 employed to-day. That is 6,000 men hunted out of employment on the land by this import of foreign barley.</P>

      <P>I stated that the amount of barley imported was 458,000 cwts.  I am allowing a produce of 10 barrels to the acre.  That would mean that it would take 22,000 acres of land in tillage to produce that.  I shall show another <Col N="514" /> illuminating side to these gentlemen who confer the great benefit of their presence upon us.  The price of barley in 1920, 1921, and 1922 was something like 52s. per barrel.  The price of the pint of stout and the duty on beer and spirits were then the same as to-day. Last year the price of barley was 14s. 6d. per barrel.  I do not know what Messrs.  Guinness's dividends were in 1921 and 1922, but probably somebody will enlighten us.  There is, however, a difference of 37s. 6d. per barrel, which has not been passed on to the consumer but which has been collared by the brewers.  The brewers could at present reduce the price of a pint of stout by 1¾d. and have the same profit as in 1922.  These are rather illuminating figures with regard to these benefactors who have conferred so much advantage upon us, and yet we are threatened that the sun will be removed from the heavens by them because Fianna Fáil is in office.  I invite Deputy Byrne to consider these facts.  I do not believe that Messrs. Guinness have increased the wages of their labourers.  I believe the wages were reduced to increase the profiteering.</P>
      <P>We have also heard a lot about the labour exchanges and the increase in the number of people registering.  I am very glad to see more people registering. It shows the faith they have in the present Government and the hope they have of getting employment now. I know of men with large families in my constituency who were out their boots going to the labour exchanges week after week to register.  After registering for 12 months, one day, they saw a young man who had just come out of the national army registering at the labour exchange and getting the job that these men had been looking for. These people know now that they are going to get a fair share of employment, that the man with a family is no longer going to be put aside for the young single gentleman who walks out of a job one week and into another the next week.  They know that they are going to get a fair show, and are now registering, knowing that there is going to be employment for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first step towards giving that <Col N="515" /> employment, not sops or doles, but permanent employment, was taken yesterday by the Minister for Agriculture in order to bring the dairying industry out of the hopeless mess of insolvency into which it was plunged by the late Government.  That is the first step which will bring to the farmers some hope of getting a livelihood out of their industry.  I quoted figures yesterday given by the ex-Minister for Agriculture on that head.  He showed that a farmer with 20 500-gallon cows, at 4d. per gallon for milk, would at the end of the year have £18 to support himself and his family.  That would be less than 7s. 6d. per week.  I do not think any labourer with a family is getting as low as that.  The Minister for Agriculture took the first step yesterday to provide employment in this country and I hope other steps will be taken along the same lines.  We are told of the uneasiness and unrest caused by the proposal to remove the Oath, and that nobody is going to invest money any more in Irish industries. If the Deputy had a look at our post during the last three months it would open his eyes.  The number of people who are anxious to invest money in industries here would amaze him.</P>

      <P>If they will, they will get it, and they will not be knocking at the door like you were without any result.  The Deputy told us about the American protection policy and what it had done for shipbuilding.  I am very glad of it.  We have an industry in Cobh as to which I have particulars before me.  That industry is now looking not to double its employment, but to treble it, in the breaking up of ships owing to the new economic policy of the world.  That industry alone will give employment in the town of Cobh, which has been practically starved out by the policy of the late Government, to treble the number employed at present.  That is going to be a big change, and those people are not afraid to invest more money in new plant.  Their whole complaint here is about the manner in which the <Col N="516" /> fine machinery that was in Cobh was rendered useless owing to the manner in which it was worked by the late Government.  Complaint has been made of the way in which everything was left to go to rust and rot and ruin by the policy of the late Government in Haulbowline.  Everything was turned into a heap of scrap, good for nothing.  The way we are going to deal with this problem will result in bringing people back to the land, where they should be employed. Neither Deputy Byrne nor I will then have any complaint of people coming from Cork to Dublin or from Dublin to Cork to get work at Ford's.</P>

We will make Shamrock shovels here, and then they will be entitled to have the shamrock upon them and they will give a good share of employment.  As I pointed out, the barley imported last year would have meant 22,000 acres of tillage to grow it here.  In conclusion, I can assure Deputy Byrne on one point.  Our Executive Government are no longer going to be frightened by the bludgeons of a couple of employers, nor by the organised Masonic Order in this country.  The day that they could frighten the Executive Government is gone, and gone for ever.  There will be more employment in this country, and the wages paid will no longer be dictated by the Masonic organisation in Molesworth Street.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="517" /> Coming from a rural area and seeing the conditions in North County Dublin since 1922, I fail to see what has been done, good, bad or indifferent to alleviate the unfortunate unemployed in Dublin.  So long as Deputies were all right themselves they did not seem to care about the unemployed workers in the country.  In 1922, as a member of the Balrothery Board of Guardians, I know that the outdoor relief amounted to £4,000.  I have listened ever since to political meetings at crossroads such as the ex-President referred to yesterday.  We are not speaking now at cross-roads, but I am at cross-roads every night and see the condition of the unfortunate unemployed. I have heard speeches at cross-roads, and in villages, at election time, when we were told the country was prosperous.  In 1922, as I have said, the outdoor relief in Balrothery amounted to £4,000.  In 1926, it increased to £9,146 but still, in 1927, at the General Election we were told that the country was prosperous.  The outdoor relief in Balrothery Union rose from £9,146 in 1926 to £19,659 in 1931-32 and still we were told by the late Government, and the members of the present Opposition that the country was improving.  I have sympathy with the new Ministers and I am not saying anything against them at the present time as they are only a couple of months in office.</P>
    <P>I hope they will get going at once to try and relieve the conditions that are prevailing in the country.  I believe that there are few in this House who know what starvation is.  I might say that I have had a little experience of it, and as Chairman of the Balrothery Board of Assistance I have experience of what the workers and their children are suffering.  Since 1922 the amount spent on home assistance has increased from £4,000 to £19,000.  An unfortunate worker gets a food-ticket for 10/- on which he has to feed a wife and six children.  If he has seven children he may get 15/-.  I hope the present Government will get to work immediately to relieve the unemployed.  Deputy Byrne, as far as I can see, is more concerned with the Oath.  I am not concerned in the least with the Oath.</P>

      <P>What I am concerned with is that the Executive Council will do something for these unfortunate people.  Rathdown area is in pretty much the same position.  Home Assistance there has increased from £3,000 in 1922 to £13,615.  In Dun Laoghaire it was £18,000 in 1926.  To-day it is £32,130.  These are the three outlying districts in Co. Dublin. £250,000 is distributed by the South Dublin Union.  I appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and to the Executive, to see at once what can be done.  I am sorry that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Local Government are following in the footsteps of the late Government in regard to registering at labour exchanges and the giving of work to the unemployed on the roads when a relief grant is given.  If they continue to do that, I say, without hesitation, that they are going to come to disaster the same as the late Government.  There is only one labour exchange between here and Drogheda.  An unfortunate man looking for work has to walk 15 miles to Balbriggan Labour Exchange and walk back without, perhaps, a bit to eat, in order to register.</P>

      <P>The man who registers by post has very little chance of getting a day's work.  Young men are sent out by labour exchanges to do work while married men remain idle. The officials in the labour exchanges do not mind whether they are married or single.  The present surveyor in Co. Dublin, I must say, does give a preference to married men, but there is a provision that a man must register at the labour exchange before he gets work.  There is work going on, at the present time, on the Velvet Strand at Portmarnock, and men are sent out there from Dublin, while local men are idle on account of this provision.  I have sympathy with the new Government and I am not blaming them.  I hope they are not going to follow in <Col N="519" /> the footsteps of the late Government. I have sympathy also with the farming community.  They are not able to provide money for all this relief.  I hope that the present Government will put the country in a better position than it has been in for the past ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Government have a scheme and are working on it that is to put an end to unemployment.  We have heard some remarks to-day on where that is going to lead us.  I would like to urge on the Government that they should not abandon the ordinary and every-day methods of giving employment on reproductive schemes.  I would like to bring a couple of matters in that respect before this House.  Before the Dáil was adjourned, President de Valera stated that each Minister would enquire in his own department what necessary and reproductive expenditure could be proceeded with immediately. When you come to examine some of the matters that have come under my notice, I would like to ask him to practise what he preaches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was considerable trade which gave a certain amount of employment carried on from Dublin with the Six Counties.  I will not now go into the question why that arose.  There were questions of sentiment, people who knew the stocks held in Dublin and other centres and so on.  A certain amount of trade went on and employment was given.  There is no doubt that there has been political partition with the North for some time past.  I can say without fear of contradiction that the last vestiges of economic connection with the North have been severed by the recent regulations that have come into force on the Northern boundary.  I do not know whether the Government have made any representations as to these conditions that have to be fulfilled, but I say that if these trade matters could be alleviated by negotiation, the Government, even if they failed, might make the attempt.  There is no reason that I can see why they should not negotiate with their neighbours <Col N="520" /> and why that avenue for the relief of unemployment should not again be opened up.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters, coming under my own personal observation, which I would like to bring before this House.  A number of houses would be erected if sewers were provided in the public road at Stillorgan and Dean's Grange.  I might explain that it is not a question of bringing up a sewer for miles to these two particular sites.  The sewer is in each case at the corner, and has only to be extended along the public road.  I would like that this matter should be considered seriously. It was brought to the notice of the Dublin Board of Public Health, Rathdown area.  I understand from one of the previous speakers that there is considerable unemployment in the Rathdown area.  One would have thought that if the President's pronouncement were being gone into seriously, in face of these representations, that would have provided over 100 houses, the Government would have gone into this question seriously. I do not suppose that it is necessary for me to argue the question that the provision of sewers would give desirable employment or that the erection of one hundred houses would also provide desirable employment for a number of men.</P>
    <P>What was the reply to these representations? They replied that they cannot consider the question as the actual construction of houses on the ground has not yet begun.  I would like to assure any Deputy who is not an expert, that the person who would build a house, without any provision for a drain in the roadway, would be a lunatic.  I do not know whether the House can accept that statement or not, but I would like anybody who thinks I ought to be contradicted, to do so.  I do not know whether I must compliment the Board on the tactful way in which they turned the matter down, because there is no doubt about it, that absolutely ends the question. If you are not going to provide sewers on the road, you are not going to have houses built.  Do the Government expect people to erect houses <Col N="521" /> first and then wait for the drains to be connected at the pleasure of the Board?  I would like to say that in my humble opinion there is no use in expecting employment to be provided along those lines.  I did bring that matter to the notice of the Government and I was not any more successful.</P>
    <P>There is just one quotation I would like to make, and I know it is true.  At least, I hope it is true. Deputies can judge of that when I read it to them: &ldquo;General Election 1932.  Fianna Fáil.  Constituency of County Dublin.  Paragraph 9.&mdash;Sewerage and water supplies are needed in the villages all over the county.  The local people cannot pay the whole cost but the Government have given nothing.&rdquo;  That is taken from the election address in the County Dublin, and I say it is true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent a rural area in the West of Ireland where 75 per cent. of the small farmers have a valuation under £4.  The majority of these farmers and their sons have to emigrate each year, many of them to America.  That emigration to America has now been stopped.  Their prospects in England are not very bright, either.  There are several of them already there and they are unemployed. Furthermore, there was a partial failure of the potato crop in the West last year and no employment has been provided for these poor people.  Will the Minister now, in his statement, say whether any scheme has been prepared to deal with it? Listening to the debate here, I can see that there was no notice at all taken of the West.  It was all Dublin and Cork that were talked of.  I do not agree with that.  I believe in giving fair play to Dublin and Cork, but I do not believe in turning down the West altogether.  Perhaps it is on account of some international question that the prospects of the people who migrated to England are bad.  I cannot say, but I know cases in which young men went last year to England and were promised employment before they went there.  These young men have been unemployed in England for the past three or four weeks.  I cannot <Col N="522" /> say what is the cause of that, but perhaps before a week or two we may be able to say whether it is due to an international question or a domestic question.  On the other hand, there are some areas in the West and if a waterworks scheme or a sewerage scheme were started in an urban district, men living outside the towns would be told by the trade unionists in the towns when they went to seek employment on those schemes, &ldquo;You need not come in.  You do not belong to the town.&rdquo;  I believe the same state of affairs prevails in the City and that if men from the country wanted work in Cork, Limerick, or Galway, they would be told to stay at home and starve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect when the Minister is replying that he will bring from the pigeon-holes of his Department some road schemes as a method of giving relief to the unemployed.  I have had some experience of what road schemes did in the past in the way of providing employment for those skilled in that class of work.  I wish to submit to the Minister a suggestion which might be attended to immediately. There is no use in promising consideration for suggestions that are put forward if they are not dealt with quickly. The building trade in Dublin, usually employing 2,000 to 3,000 men, is at a stand-still.  To suggest to carpenters, plasterers or painters, that you are going to provide relief work in the way of road-making will give them little satisfaction.  The engineering trades in Dublin, those engaged in boiler-making and ship-building, have been idle for from two to three years.  I hope the Minister will give relief to those men as well as to the road workers.  Then we have the clerk or store man, the man who will take different kinds of work, but who would not be fit for road-making. It is well to recollect that that type of man also has a family to keep.  Whatever schemes are devised they should embrace that type of worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are in Dublin to-day 8,000 families living on food tickets given by the Board of Assistance.  There is no allowance made for rent and the result is that the police courts recently have <Col N="523" /> been filled with tenants of rooms and cottages making appeals for time.  That condition of things is not confined to one class in this City.  You have the good type of cottage dweller who thought a couple of years ago that he would be able to keep a cottage and let a room.  He got a cottage and shortly afterwards discovered that through some process or another his eldest son or eldest daughter lost employment and the casual employment given to the head of the house did not permit him to continue to pay 10s. or 12s. a week rent.  One young man has to pay 10s. a week for a single room in a very poor part of the City.  I am hopeful that the Minister will consider these cases when he is producing his relief schemes for the unemployed.  I hope the schemes will not embrace one class only.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about the tax on butter.  This 4d. a lb. on butter affects our own people very considerably. Daily one can see arriving in our port handsome, costly motor cars and motor buses ready to be put on the road, even the numbers being painted on them.  Not a shilling's worth of upholstery, painting or coachbuilding has been done in Ireland.  It is all Continental or English work.  I think something should be done to provide work for the City coachbuilders.  Within the past couple of weeks, I have had experience of cases where people living in country districts come to Dublin in the hope of finding employment.  One was a very sad case of a man who brought his whole family to Dublin on the day of a football excursion.  Next day he found himself in a back kitchen in one of the worst tenements in the City.  His health broke down, he went to Crooksling Sanatorium for 14 weeks and it was only a few days ago one of our Dublin institutions sent the man and his family back to the country.  The unfortunate people, not having the two years' residence qualification, were not entitled to any kind of relief in the City.  Such cases should get the immediate attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I appeal to every Deputy to use his best efforts to prevent people leaving <Col N="524" /> the land and coming to Dublin in the hope that they may get work.  We have a labour bureau in operation in the Corporation where 250 to 350 men are watching closely for a day's work. The 8,000 families on relief tickets in the City do not represent the actual number unemployed here.  There are families receiving 15s. a week through having a son or daughter working and they do not apply for assistance.</P>
    <P>It is sad to see men with large families, seven, eight or ten, as the case may be, out of employment for the last five years.  One man in that position was sent to me and he told me he had nine children and he had not been employed for several years.  In another case a man wrote: &ldquo;I will appeal to you for the last time to save a life and a home; will you do it?&rdquo; When these cases are investigated we find that even the very mattresses on the beds, as well as the bedsteads, are gone to the pawnbroker's.  In some cases, only the religious pictures are left in the rooms because the pawn offices will not take them in.  I have been in a room where there was nothing but sacks to sleep on, and sacks to cover the children.</P>
    <P>I will not bore the House by going into a few of the many hundreds of letters I have received.  I do not want the House to think that I am the only one who receives them.  I know that every Dublin Deputy receives such letters. We are at our wits' end to stave off many evictions that are pending. It might be said that we see few of these evictions.  I can assure the House that when a notice to quit is served and an order made by the court the unfortunate person waits until the very last day and then he goes to one of the Dublin T.D.'s and asks him to see the sheriff.  I know other Deputies in Dublin have interested themselves in this matter, and nearly in all cases the sheriff has given an extra week or two.  The tenant does not wait to be evicted; he does not want to see the last stick of furniture or the bedclothes on the streets.  In one or two cases, I have known the contents of a room to be packed into a perambulator. The people pack up their little belongings and are taken in by <Col N="525" /> some other tenant nearly as badly situated as they themselves are.</P>
    <P>I mention these cases in order to show the Minister the necessity of doing something immediately.  He should not content himself merely with promising road schemes or indicating what is to be done in the case of housing grants in three months or six months.  I have another very unpleasant matter to mention.  It is open to any Deputy to go to the North Wall and there he will see silos being erected for unloading corn from vessels.  That work was done by hand right up to now and there was an average of 250 men employed on that class of work.  I understand the silos will be ready for operation within a week or two.  Then we will be faced with providing for the maintenance of 250 or 300 dock labourers.  After the usual ten or twelve weeks we will have to provide them with food tickets.  I make an earnest appeal to the President and those associated with him to do something speedily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

      <P>I am going to speak on the assumption that the President is going to deal with the question of unemployment from a national point of view.  I want to join with my western colleague in putting forward the claims of the people in my own area, the North-West.  I would like the President to pay particular attention to the unemployment in Co. Donegal and the congested areas in the West.  There are many young men there who will not be able to find employment outside this country in the future.  They live in congested areas, and the problem there created is one that should be promptly tackled.  At the moment no opportunity for employment exists.  In the past the people there lived by migrating to England and Scotland during the agricultural season.  The other avenue open to them was America.  For all practical purposes those avenues are closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this question of unemployment is going to be faced from a national point of view so far as my constituency is concerned I suggest to the President an intensive policy of afforestation.  I think that would go some way towards <Col N="526" /> helping to solve the problem with which the House is now dealing.  In carrying out afforestation we will be doing a national work that will be reproductive and that will provide the country in normal and abnormal circumstances with an essential thing in any State.  So far as my county is concerned it would add enormously from the point of view of beauty and that might tend to attract tourists.</P>
    <P>I have read debates that have taken place here on other occasions, and reference was made in the course of those debates to the cost of procuring land for afforestation purposes.  I could indicates large tracts of land in Donegal that are now utterly barren and that could readily be utilised.  If the Government is going to launch a huge national scheme to cure unemployment I am sure these lands could be secured at a very nominal figure.  I suggest that if it is necessary the Executive Council should obtain power to acquire such land compulsorily in the event of the owners hesitating to dispose of their interests unless they are given a price out of all proportion to the value of this barren land.  If people attempt unnecessarily to increase the value of such land legislative authority should be taken to acquire it.  Afforestation is one of the greatest needs in a county like Donegal.  The timber that grew on the demesne lands was cut down when the landlords ceased to have any interest in them.  Plantations were demolished on the demesnes and now these places are an eyesore to people passing through the country. There remains where the timber stood only stumps of trees and shrubs, so that these places appear to be a wilderness instead of being places of beauty.  If the President is going to outline a policy that will solve unemployment from the National point of view I would urge him to adopt an active policy of reafforestation in Donegal and in the other counties on the western seaboard.</P>

      <P>When the unemployment question was discussed in this House before the last election we were informed that there were about 80,000 <Col N="527" /> unemployed in this State.  Since then large numbers have been added, which means that further burdens have been placed on the ratepayers and taxpayers in order to provide relief for these people.  Conditions are infinitely worse now than they were in the past seven or eight years in North Cork. Owing to depression in agriculture, and to the low prices for produce, many farmers are unable to employ labourers, and these have been added to the role of the unemployed.  Now we have a new Government which sought the active support of Labour to put them into power.  They promised they would leave no labouring men unemployed.  It is up to the Government to deliver the goods.  The majority of the supporters of the Labour Party voted for Fianna Fáil. They accepted as gospel truth the statement that they would get employment from the new Government. Now comes the test when the Government can say what they are going to do to carry out their promise.  Time will tell whether they were honest in their policy or not.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told the House this week that the Government had only been five weeks in office.  I would remind the Minister and his colleagues that they have been five years in Opposition.  Surely during that time they were formulating plans to relieve unemployment, or otherwise their statements were only propaganda for the electors.  Now that they are in office, their only plan so far for relieving unemployment is by way of indiscriminate tariffs.  I am really surprised at the attitude the official Labour Party has taken towards the Government.  Of course, they thought they would get everything they asked.  Otherwise they would remain independent and fight their own case.  They are not doing that, and they will find out their mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The official Labour Party was induced by the present Government to support every scheme they brought forward, especially the legislation that has already been introduced.  When they have got the support of Labour to pass that legislation, the Government <Col N="528" /> will turn round and say, &ldquo;We have done our best to solve the unemployment problem.  We will put it on the long finger until each Department looks into and considers each scheme.&rdquo;  How long that will take we are not aware.  Probably we will not hear the result until after the next general election, when the Government will go to the electors and say, &ldquo;We did not get a chance.  We had our schemes prepared. Now we want you to give us a full mandate to go back independent of Labour, when we will deliver the goods and see that no man is unemployed.&rdquo;  The President has stated that Ireland was a country in which the unemployment problem could be most easily solved.  Now that he is in office, we hope it will not take long until he does so.  I hope the President and the members of the Executive Council will put the interests of people before that of Party, that they will accept the motion, carry out the policy they advocated at the election, and do something for the working classes.</P>

      <P>I understand that the motion that has been put down by Deputy Morrissey is being accepted by the Executive Council.  I do not know if that is true or not.  We were told in posters and on the platforms before the election that Fianna Fáil had a plan.  Not merely were they considering a plan for employment but they had a plan.  A plan is something that is mature.  They had taken decisions, we were led to believe, and knew where they were.  If that is so, there should be no delay on the part of the Government in acting on this motion and delivering the goods.  We heard of this plan during the election at every cross-roads and on every dead wall we had posters announcing the plan.  The Government has or has not a plan.  I do not rise solely to criticise the Government in this matter because I know that the proposition in front of them is rather a big one.  They cannot do everything without the help and co-operation of the citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always been held up here as an antagonist of Labour.  Perhaps the attitude of the Farmers' Party, of which <Col N="529" /> I was leader, to Labour in 1922 and 1923 was hostile.  It had to be hostile, and it was hostile in the interests of Labour itself.  We knew that Labour had gone beyond the limit then and had struck an impossible line.  It is now up to organised Labour, to those in the sheltered trades which are really represented here, to act.  Strange to say, the Labour members are not returned by any of the organised Labour constituencies as such.  The official Labour Party to-day is really a Party of organised Labour&mdash;clerical workers, school teachers, railwaymen, postal workers and those in sheltered trades.  The reason I am appealing to Labour is because of facts that were put before me regarding Kilkenny, the capital of my constituency, where the Corporation were trying to get a type of house erected suited to the poorer class of workers.  They could not build these houses economically, in view of their borrowing powers, unless Labour agreed not to insist upon wages of £4 15s. weekly for joiners, masons, plasterers and workmen of that description, and 50/- for ordinary labourers. My figures may not be absolutely correct.</P>

      <P>That can be decided later.  They are within a few shillings of being accurate.  I know that an offer was made on behalf of the Corporation of £3 10s. 0d. for joiners, masons and plasterers and 36/- for the ordinary labourers.  That was turned down.  I do not think that is facing the situation.  This country was more prosperous in 1922, 1923 and 1924 than it is now, and there was more money in circulation here as elsewhere.  Circumstances have altered.  That is why the attitude of Labour is the greatest obstacle to the provision of work and the greatest enemy of the workers.  I think that statement will be accepted in our altered circumstances.  Money is not as plentiful as it was in those days and workers are not as well off.  To be honest, up to nine or ten months ago it was unusual in my county to find labourers going round looking for work.  It was only occasionally that occurred.  For the past seven <Col N="530" /> or eight months, men are coming into the haggards looking for work, and the numbers are increasing.  It is nothing unusual now to have six men calling to a farmhouse in one week looking for work.  Some days two and three men call.  One man from Kerry called to my place recently and two men from Tipperary. That seems to be general owing to the altered circumstances.  It is time for organised Labour and those in the sheltered trades to come off their high horse and to throw in their lot with the rest of the community. Otherwise, it is up to them to accept the consequences.  Other countries have found it necessary to deal with the pigheadedness that characterised Labour.  Italy did so, so did France and America, because they found it necessary to do so.  That is the position. I am making no threats. Labour cannot be its own greatest enemy and survive.  Deputy the Lord Mayor of Dublin referred a short time ago to the fact that silos had been erected at the docks to deal with corn.  Why was that done? Because labour was uneconomic both in output and in cost.  Labour has done much to have machinery invented and installed because of the pigheadedness of some of its leaders, and because the general body&mdash;dock workers and the rest&mdash;were misdirected. However disagreeable it is to hear these facts, men are being put out of employment and machinery is being erected where perhaps such would not be the case if Labour met the situation.  The workers may be offended with what I say, but we may as well face the facts fairly and squarely and not stick our heads in the sand like the ostrich.  I appeal to the Labour Party to realise the situation and to save themselves and the people they represent from the consequences.  Other countries have had to take action.  They saw that it was a waste to continue talking, and they had the vision and the courage to take action.  The position in these countries is now much better than it is in ours.  In Italy, the position of the worker is much better. If we want proof of the truth of what I say, it is only necessary to look across the Channel to see what <Col N="531" /> happened there.  Britain stood on top of the world in 1918 and 1919.  She had the trade of the world at her feet.  The ball was at the tip of her toe.  Instead of playing the ball, they lay on it.  They thought it was a nation for heroes to live in and that they could live idly.  If they had put their backs into the work, and grasped the opportunity and not allowed the coal miners, the railway workers&mdash;the miners especially&mdash;to ruin their Empire trade, we would have the best market in the world for our produce at our doors.  The British have lost their steel, cotton and coal markets, and I doubt if they will ever get them back&mdash;all through the action of people who should be most interested in them.  They lost them through the pigheadness and the misdirection of people who were vitally interested in them.  That is an example for us.  The British have not the trade of the world to-day. They lost it through their own fault and they may never get it back.</P>
      <P>And, accordingly, the prospect for us is not anything like as bright as it should be.  In fact, I am doubtful about the future.  What I have said, I have said bluntly; but I have said, it honestly.  I want Labour to try and meet the position: to do what they can to meet it.  Otherwise, it is up to the Government to act, to see that the best is made of the situation with the material that is at their disposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the motion.  I welcome the acceptance of the principle of it by the Minister and would like to say that his attitude represents a very great departure in regard to the reception of motions of the kind in this House.  I would press strongly on the Ministry generally to take early steps to deal with the position that exists at the moment.  Schemes that will give permanent relief to unemployment and the machinery necessary to give effect to them cannot be brought into being in a day or two, but there is an urgent need at the moment to have something done. I am aware that the members of the Ministry, when in Opposition, <Col N="532" /> gave expression to the view that certain patched-up remedies were not likely to prove effective, but now that they are in touch with the position that exists in the country, I feel they must realise that some temporary expendients will have to be resorted to to deal with the present situation, which is getting worse, either through the machinery available in the Land Commission or in the manner already indicated in the course of this debate: that is, the raising of a certain sum of money through mortgaging the Road Fund. Some temporary expedient of that kind will have to be resorted to, and at once.</P>
      <P>I would like just to anticipate what I may have to say on certain of the Estimates when they come up for consideration for the purpose of drawing the attention of the President to the opportunities afforded for dealing with this problem through the operations of the Forestry Branch of the Department of Agriculture.  I do not know whether the President is aware of it or not, but to a very great extent the activities of that branch have ceased practically.  Schemes formulated for various parts of the country have been pigeon-holed in the Forestry branch for the last five or six years and have been completely forgotten. I understand that some little change for the better has occurred recently, but I would urge on the President and the Minister for Agriculture to avail as much as possible of the opportunities that the Estimate for that branch affords for the initiation of useful schemes of reproductive work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would, of course, be too much to hope that the debate on this motion could conclude without our having to listen to the usual sort of ill-informed lecture that we get from time to time in debates of this kind. They afford opportunities to members who know nothing of the subject under discussion to relieve themselves, with the result that we get views expressed here that are altogether unbalanced and unfair.  On occasions of this kind one of the stories usually trotted out here&mdash;the same occurs elsewhere&mdash;is that all our <Col N="533" /> economic ills, particularly in regard to housing, are due to wage troubles. One would have thought in regard to stories of that kind that certain happenings in this country in recent years would have cleared up that position.  I wonder if Deputy Gorey, who has devoted a considerable portion of his speech to telling us about the sins of organised and unorganised workers in his constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if Deputy Gorey has ever heard of the operations of a body known as the British Housing Corporation, a body that built several houses for the Corporation in Cork some years ago.  That body not alone paid the trade union wage in Cork City, but conformed to all the terrible restrictions that Deputy Gorey associates with trade unions and behaved from the trade union point of view as a model employer in every way.  It carried out its contract for the Cork Corporation at a figure that was several thousand pounds less than the price quoted by the local contractors who had advantages that were denied to it.  I do not know whether Deputy Gorey has ever heard of that position; but it was a clear indication of the fact, that it was not the wages question entirely that held up the erection of houses, but, more essentially, the question of profits, and the degree of profit, that was expected out of house building.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>But if the Deputy has any doubt that the line of argument I am pursuing in this matter is sound, I think that even in the operations of Departments of this State I could adduce some additional information. I would remind the Deputy who has spoken that, in the Housing Act of 1924 power was taken for the central purchase and control of materials, with a view to the erection of houses.  It is within the recollection of members of this House that that power was never used.  It was just a pious sentiment embodied in the Bill for the purpose of giving it a good appearance.  The Gaeltacht Housing Act of 1929 contained a similar provision, but, unlike the Local Government Department, the Gaeltacht Housing Department utilised that power, and I challenge contradiction of the statement, that in certain portions of the State, and in my own county of Cork, particularly, the operations of the Gaeltacht Housing Department, in the matter of joint purchasing of materials for the erection of houses, has resulted in a decrease of forty per cent. in the cost. The figures are to be obtained and can be vouched for even to the satisfaction of such a pessimist as Deputy Gorey.</P>

      <P>Of course it was.  We are asked to say why Labour should continue to be so unreasonable; why we should look for extravagant wages, in regard to house building, and when we are going to be converted from the attitude of obstructing house building in this country. My reply to that is, that the charge is entirely unfounded, and that the difficulty and obstruction of house building in this country results largely from the question of profits rather than the question of wages. In regard to the general question&mdash;</P>
