      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President whether his attention has been called to a statement made by the Minister for Finance in the Seanad on the 22nd March last, that the Shannon Scheme, the Dairy Disposals Board, the Drumm Battery and the Beet Sugar Factory were as precious a collection of white elephants as ever drove their unfortunate owners to the verge of insolvency, and if in view of this statement he will indicate the policy of the Executive Council with regard to those projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  With regard to the second part, large sums of public money have been sunk in these enterprises and, quite irrespective of any views that may be held of the wisdom or otherwise of their initiation and their management up to the present, it is the duty of the Government to safeguard the capital invested in them and if possible to secure their success. I need only add that the Government is resolved to carry out its duty in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the President's answer, will he state if the view given expression to by the Minister for Finance in the Seanad is the view of the Executive Council on these schemes?  Does the President agree with the statement made in the Seanad by the Minister for Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit it does not. <Col N="150" /> Again, I want to ask the President&mdash; and this is a very important matter&mdash; whether the Executive Council agrees with the statement made in the Seanad by a Minister who is a member of the Executive Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the President, seeing that in addition to this mere matter of what the Minister said in the Seanad there is also a considerable amount of public attention being directed to the future of these four schemes, if he is aware that a request was put forward that the Drumm Battery estimate should be put down for consideration at the earliest possible date and that that request was refused on the grounds that the Minister for Finance was occupied?  It now appears that the Minister for Finance is starring to-morrow at the Gaiety Theatre.  Is the President prepared to put down the estimate for to-morrow and recall the Minister for Finance from the Gaiety Theatre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>According to public pronouncements, the Minister is going there.  As I have indicated, and as the Whip will tell the President, a request was put forward to have the Drumm Battery estimate submitted here for consideration.  That request was refused and the refusal was based on the grounds that the Minister was engaged on official business.  Will the President make inquiries and find out if the Minister for Finance will be occupied on official business to-morrow and, if not, will he have the Drumm Battery estimate put down for consideration here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he will state the cause of the delay in the completion of the purchase by the Land Commission of the Newman estate at Glenstar, Co. Limerick (Record No. N. 182); if he is aware that the title deeds were lodged some considerable time ago and the lands were vested in May of last year, and can the Minister say when the matter will be completed and the purchase money paid?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Ruttledge) Patrick J. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the passing of the Land Act, 1931, estates coming under the purchase provisions of the Land Act, 1923, were normally dealt with in the priority of the lodgment of the prescribed documents in the Land Commission.  The Newman estate referred to by the Deputy had not been reached in its order of priority under the old procedure, but it was vested in the Land Commission under Section 9 of the Land Act, 1931, as of the 1st May last, together with a great number of other estates, among which its order of priority still holds in regard to the investigation of title to the purchase price.  It is, therefore, not possible at present to state when the proceedings will be completed and the purchase price paid out, but every effort will be made to have the matter expeditiously dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission intend to take the necessary steps for completing the resale of the Darcy estate as soon as they are in a position to deal with the rearrangement of the holdings on this estate.  Meanwhile the tenants have been placed upon a purchase annuity basis under Section 23 of the Land Act, 1931.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that this estate was purchased by the Congested Districts Board twenty-one years ago?  It is held in rundale and the tenants cannot use their holdings until the land is striped and divided amongst them.  I cannot see why this matter should be postponed any longer, especially in view of the guarantees given by the Minister for Lands and Fisheries that he would take immediate action.  If he promises that this estate will be dealt with within a few months, I shall be quite satisfied.</P>

Kildare, who are occupiers of houses in the area known as the Peat Works, due to the scattered layout of their holdings and the unpurchased portion of the estate, and the consequent grave inconvenience; whether he is aware that the relationship between the Land Commission tenants and the Verschoyle estate owners is unsatisfactory and the subject of disputes, and whether he proposes to take any steps, by purchase or otherwise, to relieve the situation by making these holdings economic.</P>

Ollivers, Buttevant, Co. Cork, has been sold to Messrs. Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien, Dublin, permanently depriving 80 families in Buttevant of means of livelihood, and if he is further aware that the quotas of the Midleton, Clondulane and Mallow mills are now being transferred from East Cork, which will result in 250 more families being deprived of their means of livelihood, and if he will take immediate action to prevent this control of the livelihood of 330 families in East Cork by a foreign combine.</P>

      <P>Consistently with due recognition of the principle that the home market is the best market, it is, of course, the settled policy of the Government to maintain the balance of trade by encouraging the export of all agricultural produce of which there is an exportable surplus. To this end, as the Deputy is doubtless aware, a very great deal has already been done by the Department of Agriculture and the committees of agriculture to improve the quality of our live stock and the produce of our dairies and poultry farms, so as to keep pace with our competitors in the markets of Great Britain.  The health and safe transit of our cattle continue to be provided for by the Department of Agriculture under previous legislation, and the Department have also accomplished much under the several Acts of the Oireachtas passed within the past decade to ensure that our fresh meat, butter, cream, eggs and potatoes are placed on the British markets in such a way as to secure the greatest possible return, while promoting an increased demand.  Amongst the measures I refer to may be mentioned particularly the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Acts, 1924 and 1930; Dairy Produce Acts, 1924 and 1931; Live Stock Breeding Act, 1925; Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts, <Col N="166" /> 1930 and 1931, and the Agricultural Produce (Potatoes) Act, 1930, the purpose and scope of which are too well known to require elucidation.</P>
      <P>I intend to make a fuller statement on the subject when the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture is reached.  Meanwhile, I may mention that I propose introducing a Bill the object of which is to promote the dairying and allied industries by means of export bounties on butter and other milk products.</P>

      <P>I caused an official statement to be issued to the Press on this subject early this month.  I shall read for the Deputy's information the following extract from that statement which appeared in the daily papers of 5th April.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It has been definitely ascertained that the Gárda Síochána station at Drinagh, Co. Cork, was not attacked on the night of Sunday, 13th March, as was alleged; and the further and more detailed allegations that attackers advanced in two sections, each numbering twenty to thirty, that they marched in military formation and that the station was bombarded with stones and bricks, are all unfounded.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What did occur was that two guards on patrol, at a very considerable distance&mdash;between a quarter of a mile and a half mile&mdash;from the station, found it necessary to disperse by force a crowd which, it is alleged, assaulted these two guards. This incident appears to have arisen out of a local labour dispute, but as it may possibly be the subject of legal proceedings it appears inadvisable to make any further statement on the matter at present.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to make a statement at this stage.  I am sure that the purpose of the Bill is known to every member of the Dáil.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going through the formality of opposing the First Reading of this Bill out of any spirit of hostility to the Government. <Col N="172" /> To be quite candid, I have no desire to see the Government defeated nor have I any desire to see their prestige undermined.  The reason I have taken advantage of this opportunity is that I feel that the controversy about the oath in this country has been running upon wrong lines, that men's minds and views are hardening in a wrong direction, that we have been getting too far away from realities.  I want to take the very first opportunity available in this House to make an attempt, however ambitious, to give a somewhat new turn to men's thoughts on this subject.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the fundamental question which the Government have not faced and ought to face, is this: Do we or do we not regard ourselves as belonging to the British Commonwealth of Nations?  Whichever answer is the right one, I submit that this Bill is a mistake.  Supposing that we do regard ourselves as belonging to the British Commonwealth, in that event I submit that this Bill is a breach of international good manners. I leave aside altogether the question of breach of faith, the question whether the oath is obligatory in the Treaty and the question whether a Treaty which brings a war to an end ought to be regarded as binding upon the weaker party, because these are questions that I am conscious arouse angry passions, and it is not necessary to our argument to discuss them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that, however it has happened, we do in fact find ourselves members of a partnership, members of the British Commonwealth&mdash;a partnership in which the Crown is recognised as a visible symbol of unity.  In that partnership, we find each of the other partners having an oath somewhat similar to our own. Suppose we are taking the fullest advantages of the privileges that accrue to us under that partnership&mdash;that for instance we are making use of British consuls and ambassadors all the world over, that our young men are passing into the British Imperial services, that we are taking advantage of any economic concessions that are made to members of the British Commonwealth as distinct from foreign <Col N="173" /> nations&mdash;supposing all that is the case, I submit that the more natural and the more decent thing to do in approaching this issue would be to get into touch with the other members of the partnership, to point out that these oaths have become somewhat anomalous as a result of the Statute of Westminster and, indeed, as a result of the general common sense of mankind and see whether we could not come to some reasonable arrangement. Suppose, on the other hand, that we do not regard ourselves as forming part of the British Commonwealth, I say, in that event, that this Bill is totally inadequate to make our position clear either to our own people or to the world at large. Just as nature abhors a vacuum, I suggest that statesmanship should avoid an ambiguity.  I suggest that this particular ambiguity is one extremely dangerous to our reputation abroad and extremely dangerous to peace at home.  If we want to be out of the British Commonwealth, let us say so and go out of it like men.  I believe that Britain will raise no legal or technical difficulties and the whole thing will go through smoothly and expeditiously.  The Government, perhaps, consider that they have no mandate to go out of the British Commonwealth.  I have heard that stated by members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  But do they realise what that implies?  It implies that we are members of the British Commonwealth, for if we are not members of the British Commonwealth, obviously no mandate is required to go out of it. It is implied that the Irish people have accepted the Commonwealth and if that is the official view of the Fianna Fáil Party it would be very interesting to have it stated plainly.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, they say that they have got a mandate for this Bill. I question that statement.  In my experience during the election there were only three parts of the Fianna Fáil programme that really interested the people&mdash;the promise of retrenchment, the promise of employment for everybody and the hope of abolishing the land annuities.  In any case, assuming there were a mandate with regard to the Oath, it is certainly not <Col N="174" /> one that should have deterred the Government from dealing with the matter by negotiation instead of by one-sided action.  After all, we are a deliberative Assembly.  We are paid £360 a year and given first-class railway tickets to come here and use our brains, to do our best to interpret the considered and permanent will of the people and not to be mere machines for registering mandates.  I urge the Government, therefore, to withdraw this Bill, to initiate negotiations with the other members of the partnership to which we belong for removing the Oath and for substituting some more acceptable form of undertaking to act as loyal partners. After reaching a provisional agreement, or even in the event of their failing to reach agreement, I suggest that they consult the country by means of a referendum and settle the question, once and for all, whether the Irish people wish or do not wish to form part of the British Commonwealth. If they do that, they will, undoubtedly, be able to guarantee internal peace, which I very much fear this Bill will tend rather to impair than to improve.</P>
    <P>This Bill settles nothing.  The propaganda in its favour since the election completely ignores the fact that we are free to leave the Commonwealth if we choose and, in that way, it has given a fresh impetus to unofficial military organisations.  The triumph which the passing of this Bill will procure for the Government will be of the most transitory description. By taking the wiser course, even at the eleventh hour, the Government will earn for themselves the more unfading laurels that belong to those who benefit their country.  We are an ancient race with noble and moving traditions, with tragic and glorious memories. Do not let us behave like guttersnipes. Politically, we are a young nation. Let us form the habit of thinking rather of our opportunities than of our rights.  The lunatic asylums and the bankruptcy courts are the destiny of individuals who brood too much over their rights.  Bad as that is for the individual, it is an equally bad practice for a nation.  On the other <Col N="175" /> hand, if we cannot get rid of the obsession that &ldquo;our rights are being trampled upon,&rdquo; in the phrase of the Leader of the Labour Party, then let us leave the British Commonwealth and be done with it.  Let us get rid of this futile and exasperating nonsense. It is in that spirit that I wish to make the statement, that if this Bill is persisted with and passed, I contemplate introducing a motion at an early date requesting the Government to proceed with the necessary steps for removing Ireland from the sphere of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>

I certainly thought that the Minister would take this the first opportunity available to him of letting the country know what is the <Col N="180" /> policy of his Department because I think there can be no question at the present moment that the Department of the Minister for Justice is the most important Department in the State and that the duties and obligations which are imposed upon the Minister for Justice are heavier than the obligations which rest upon the shoulders of, let me say, the Minister for External Affairs or the Minister for Finance or any other member of the Executive Council, because though our public affairs are matters of tremendous importance; though our financial condition is a matter of tremendous importance; yet of importance far transcending them is the importance of the preservation of peace and order within the limits of our State, and how the Minister proposes to preserve peace and maintain order is a matter upon which I certainly thought the Minister would take the very earliest possible opportunity of enlightening this House.</P>
      <P>We know that, at any rate, there has been, in one respect, a complete change of policy.  We know that, at one time, the law was administered in this country so that it should be no respecter of persons.  The law was administered so that the most influential man or the most influential body of men were equally under the law as the humblest and poorest; were equally entitled to the protection of the law as were the richest or the most powerful individual or group of individuals.  As far as I can discover at the present moment that policy has been completely changed and the law is not for the future to apply to a very considerable number of persons in this State.  Men convicted of crimes have already been released.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, it is now perfectly plain that possession of dumps of arms, though against the Firearms Act, has ceased to be a crime enforceable by law; not indeed a crime not enforceable by law, but a crime against which the Minister will not put the law in force, and, if we are correctly informed by a very eloquent Deputy of the Party opposite, at the present time the Minister is in a <Col N="181" /> position to discover all the dumps of arms there are in this country.  That is the statement of a member of the Party opposite&mdash;as I say, a very eloquent member of this House&mdash;I have the authority of the Attorney-General for that statement, and I am glad to see the Attorney-General sitting beside that eloquent Deputy, Deputy Cleary, because some little time ago, when speaking in the County Mayo, the Attorney-General told the people of the County Mayo that he had been with Deputy Cleary during the by-election campaign in County Kildare, and that Deputy Cleary was so brilliant and so eloquent that he could make even the dull people of the Midlands understand him.  On another occasion, when he was making a speech, not to the dull people, as the Attorney-General styles them, of the Midlands, but to the people of a portion of Connaught, he informed them that, of course, the Fianna Fáil Party knew where the dumps were and that they could be collected within a month or so.  I would like to know if the Deputy has placed that information at the disposal of the Minister for Justice, and I would like to know if the Minister for Justice purposes availing himself of that information.  In fact, I would like generally to know, and I think the whole country would like generally to know from the Minister, as to what is his attitude at the present moment towards the I.R.A. and towards Saor Eire.</P>
    <P>We know, and there is no secret about it, that there is, at the present moment, a body which claims to be the legal and legitimate Government of this country, and that they issued a manifesto to that purport within the last few days and fortified their contention by a very familiar quotation from a speech of the President.  They claim to be the legitimate Government of the State.  There is an army which claims to be the only lawful army in this country.  Their leaders have stated repeatedly that if there is to be one Government and one Government alone in this State, and if there is to be one army only in this State <Col N="182" /> theirs is to be the Government and theirs is to be the army.</P>
    <P>I want to know what is the attitude of the Minister towards that association; I want to know if he intends to allow that association to go ahead; to train; to arm; to prepare; and to strike at its own good chosen time, or whether he intends to take the necessary adequate steps to see that no illegal drilling is carried on, and that no breaches of the law are to be made by any association openly, and in the face of day, or secretly, and by night.  These, I think, are questions to which we are entitled to have an answer.  I consider, and I think most of the Deputies in this House would agree with me when we think that it is the duty of the Minister to put forward plainly to us, and to give us an assurance as to the course which he intends to take, and I can assure the Minister that if he informs this House that it is his determination, and the determination of the Executive, to see that there will be one Government and one Government only, to see that there will be one army and one army only; and to take the necessary steps to ensure that there shall be but one Government and that there shall be but one army, if he does that, he certainly will go a long, long way to alleviate a great number of the fears I entertain about the preservation of the peace in this country.  But I do not wish for mere empty expressions.  I would like to know the measures which the Minister purposes to take.  I do not want mere vague generalities, and I hope that when he comes to speak, he will get away from vague generalities, and that he will come down to concrete facts, and that he will outline to this House, and give, not merely an outline, but, so far as he can, the details of the measures which he intends to take to prove to the people of this State, and to every section of this community, that the law is supreme and must be obeyed by every single person in this community and that there is one law-making authority in this State, and one only, and that is the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> If the Minister, as I say, gives to this country undertakings, and not merely verbal undertakings, but tells us the method by which he is going to carry his undertakings out, he will do a considerable amount towards alleviating the well-grounded feelings of fear which are held by a great number of people as to the preservation of peace in this State.  If he goes further and tells us that the opening of the prison gates, that repeal of the Constitution (Amendment) Act, were mere gestures&mdash;that they were carrying out election pledges, or something of that sort, but for the future he is not going to deal with the openly confessed enemies of this State by gestures of that nature but firmly, boldly and determinedly; if he gives the people of this country that undertaking, he will certainly, as I have said, have gone a long way to alleviate a great number of our fears.</P>
    <P>But I will remind the Minister of this, that against that association the ordinary law cannot prevail; that when that association chooses to do what it considers rightful acts, but which, according to the laws of this State, and, in my opinion, the laws of God, are wrongful acts, the ordinary law is powerless.  Juries will not convict and witnesses will not give evidence.  Let him bear that fact in mind when he comes to make his reply, and let him inform this State openly what are the methods by which he intends to enforce the preservation of the law.</P>

I am glad to know that he is so satisfied with last year's Estimates that he does not think they require a single word of justification.  That is undoubtedly quite pleasant from our point of view.  But that he should on <Col N="184" /> such a very important matter be allowed to conclude without having opened, I suggest is impossible.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the observations of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney with a certain sympathy.  I could not help feeling that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney would have been able to speak with even greater passion, or simulation of passion, greater vehemence, if there had been one outrage in the time that has elapsed since the Party to which I belong has been entrusted with the government of this State.  The debate this year will differ I suppose in some material respect from debates on these Estimates in years past.  I challenge any Deputy to allege and support the assertion that since 9th March I discriminated between any two citizens in this State.  I challenge any Deputy to suggest that any crime has been committed with impunity in that time.  I challenge any Deputy to suggest that the Civic <Col N="185" /> Guards have been in any way impeded in the discharge of their duties to all men alike since that date.  I really felt that there was no occasion for a speech on this Estimate.  If I had proceeded to say anything that really would be worth saying on an estimate prepared by the previous Government it would be to utter words of vain regret that the Department of Justice should in this month of April be responsible, under the heads of the different Estimates entrusted to me, for a considerable sum of money the expenditure of which could easily have been avoided.  Such words of regret would be vain.  I might perhaps also utter words of rejoicing. I was apprehensive, and apprehensive with some reason, that the peace of this State might have been violated in the month of March. Attempts were made which might have led to the invasion of that peace, but happily they were in vain.  Any information at my disposal does not lead me to think that these attempts were inspired or animated by any organisation to which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has alluded.</P>

The policy of my Department is to prevent the commission of any crime with impunity. That policy I will maintain.  The instruments at my disposal for that purpose are mainly the Civic Guards. I will encourage the Civic Guards in their efforts, so far as they need encouragement, to preserve law and order.</P>

I am not myself going to jump until I come up to the stile.  I am not conscious of anything that requires explanation.  As I say during the whole time I have been in office I have seen that the law is enforced and unless I am deluded peace prevails throughout the country.  I have nothing to explain.  If the Deputy will explain any incident, if he will refer to any crime, if he will refer to any act of mine or any omission of mine, in office, I shall deal with it but I will not answer rhetorical questions or hypothetical questions even from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has referred to men convicted of crimes having already been released.  Three prisoners were released by me.  I wonder does Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney recall the file relating to one of these prisoners. I wonder how closely would Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney like that matter to be gone into.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney asked me about reports from the Guards.

      <P>If he invites that in the appropriate way and at the appropriate time, I shall, if the traditions of the Ministry, or what ought to be the traditions of the Ministry, do not prevent me, gratify him.  All I think it necessary to say to the House now is that the public are well aware of the names of the three prisoners whom I have released, and the public are aware of their records.  A large section of the public at all events are aware of the circumstances surrounding the offences, and if the Deputy still cares to harp on the release of the three men I suppose he is at liberty to do so, but perhaps, if he alludes to it again he will be a little more specific and will perhaps indicate what exactly is his objection to the release of these men. They served considerable terms of imprisonment. One of them served a very considerable term, a term so long that even a convict whose crime was not surrounded by anything in the nature of extenuating circumstances, the commission of which might have taken place in the most sordid conditions, has often received a remission of sentence in as short if not in shorter time.  I feel that the strictures of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney in regard to these three prisoners&mdash;I say it without <Col N="189" /> any offence&mdash;are unreal.  If in Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's view they are real, then I am mistaken in my estimate of the public here if Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's view is shared by the community at large.  I believe it is not.  I believe that the release of the three prisoners in question has evoked from the ordinary sensible citizen nothing but words of approval.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney says that the law in the past was administered in such a way that all men were equal before it.  Opinion seemed to differ greatly upon that subject even at a time when Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney might be addressed, without any slip of the tongue, as Minister for Justice. However, be that as it may, I assure the House that my desire is to administer the law in the manner that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has said, in such a way that all men shall be absolutely equal before the law.  I must repeat, in the absence of any specific allegations or assertion that anything that has been done was undesirable or not in accordance with the law since I took up office that I feel I cannot usefully occupy the time of the House by speaking further upon this Estimate.</P>

      <P>If I was disappointed a few moments ago that the Minister for Justice would not state his policy, I am still more disappointed now after his deliberate refusal to state that policy.  I put a plain specific question to him, and his refusal to answer that plain, specific question and to say that Ministers should not have questions put to them because Ministers are to be free from cross-examination, is putting forward a new cloak to hide the responsibilities of Ministers from the public, a cloak which, in my humble judgment, no Minister should be entitled to put forward.  It is not for me to put forward the various crimes committed or deal with crimes specifically. It is for the Minister to let us and the whole country know clearly and distinctly what are his views and what is his policy.  He says it is quite impossible that there should be under his régime any discrimination against persons.  I want to know if the Firearms Acts have been put into force <Col N="190" /> against individuals, if individuals have been fined under the Firearms Acts, and if other persons&mdash;and these are persons who got long terms of imprisonment because they had in their possession, not single weapons but large dumps of arms&mdash;were released forthwith.  Another person is prosecuted shortly afterwards for the possession of firearms.  I want to know if the Firearms Act is completely in abeyance or is going to be enforced against certain persons or against the whole community.  These are the questions which I wish to ask the Minister. These are the questions he has shirked. As far as I can see, he is out to enforce these laws against some and not against others, and that is discrimination.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, what is to be the practice henceforward in this House?  Is the old practice to be completely departed from?  As I understand, the old practice so far was that when an Estimate was introduced questions were raised on specific matters.  On a Minister's Vote there was a general discussion, but so far as I know, when the Minister had spoken, he always concluded the debate and only questions were permitted afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As it was I raised the question, I quite agree with the President that that is the normal practice.  There is nothing in the present procedure which would prevent the Minister from replying and concluding. I think it is right the Minister should conclude, but you have the House in this extraordinary position, that on one of the most important Votes, a Vote that involves the peace and order of the country, after a change of Government, which, as far as we can see, and judging by reading the papers day after day, involves a fundamental change in policy, the Minister gave no opportunity to the House to discuss his policy because he did not declare what his policy is. That is the reason I raised the particular question.  If the Minister had stated his policy it might have been different, but he simply got up and said nothing, though we know his <Col N="191" /> policy is different from the policy pursued up to the present.</P>

      <P>In answer to the President and to Deputy O'Sullivan, I might state that the practice has been that the Minister concludes a debate, but the practice has also been that when a sum was moved for by the Minister for Finance or some responsible Minister, the Minister concerned with the Vote before the Dáil usually made a statement of policy, and only on one occasion until to-day did it happen, I think, that a Deputy spoke after the Minister had concluded.  He is within his rights, but it is not desirable that it should take place, otherwise business cannot be transacted.  I allowed it on this occasion because there was no statement of policy, which was the usual practice.</P>

      <P>Needless to say, I desire to follow any course indicated by the Chair.  May I be permitted to say that before moving the Estimate, which, of course, I am moving for the first time, I took the trouble of reading the Official Report of the Debates of last year.  The Minister for Justice last year in proposing the Vote for the office of the Minister for Justice, stated substantially what I said in proposing this Vote.  The Minister then proceeded, as an examination of the Official Report will reveal, to show with very great detail and with very great accuracy, how variations in the Vote were arrived at.  I have here before me a full and complete explanation of why the Vote for the Film Censorship in 1932-33 is £1,620 instead of £1,572 last year, a difference of £48.  I could explain why that is so in great detail.</P>

If any Deputy here cares to refer to the speech of the Minister last year on this Vote he will find that is what happened.  If there was a statement of policy, I am afraid I did not scrutinise the report with sufficient care to find it.</P>

      <P>Our only chance or one of the few chances we have of discussing the policy of any Department is on the Vote for the Department.  On this Vote for the Minister, he stated no policy.  Are we to assume that there has been no change of policy in certain fundamental matters since we last discussed the Estimate?  He did not explain that.  He was asked specifically by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney what was his policy in regard to the growth of an army which claims to be the only legitimate army in the country.  He made no answer to that.  He ignored it.  I assume, and I think the country must assume, that in that matter he has no policy.</P>

      <P>I wonder what it is that has dissatisfied the members of the Opposition, what it is that is causing them all this uneasiness?  Is it because we have peace?  Is it because the Minister for Justice does not come to the House and say we propose to use a strong hand, we propose to follow out the policy which will make it impossible for people to keep their employment if they are known to have aspirations of a certain kind?  That has been the policy of the Ministry <Col N="193" /> that has just left.  Are they dissatisfied because we do not come to the House with a long list of new Public Safety Bills?  I have a list here in my hand of Public Safety Acts.  We know the amount of peace that they really brought to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Listen to the list. Because we propose to govern the country without Acts of this kind the Opposition is dissatisfied.  There was a Public Safety Act passed in 1923 called the Emergency Powers Act, there was a Public Safety Act (No. 2) passed in 1923, there was a Public Safety (Powers of Arrest and Detention) Act passed in 1924, there was a Public Safety Act (Punishment of Offences Temporary Act) passed in 1924, there was the Protection of the Community (Special Powers) Act in 1926, there was another Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Act in 1926, there was a Public Safety Act in 1927, and there was a Constitution (Amendment) Act, No. 17, in 1931.  I have not all these in order, but there was a Treasonable Offences Act in 1925, Firearms Acts in 1924 and 1925, a Juries Protection Act in 1932.  The men who got all these Acts passed are dissatisfied now because we have peace without any such Acts.  The policy of the Government is this: we propose to remove the cause of dissatisfaction in this country; we propose to give an opportunity to people with different political aspirations to work for these aspirations, to give them a chance of succeeding peacefully in their objectives. That is our policy and we are carrying it out to our own satisfaction and I believe to the satisfaction of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told that there is illegal drilling going on.  We have not heard of it.  I do not believe there is half as much illegal drilling going on since we took office as there was before. We have said that our policy is to be a policy of one Government and one army, and we propose to get a Government which will have the full allegiance of the Irish people, by having it elected by all sections of the people who will be in a position freely to <Col N="194" /> choose their own representatives, who can come in here without having first to forswear any political objectives they may have.  They can come here, this being a truly representative Assembly.  We will then get full allegiance and we will not need either the special powers or forces which the past Ministry used without effect.  They followed exactly the same bad traditions of the British in this country.  I pointed out many a time, at election meetings, that for the first 87 years after the Act of Union the British Parliament passed no less than 87 Coercion Acts, one for every year.  The Government that has been put out by the Irish people are accusing us now because we have reversed that bad policy and that bad tradition.  In the year 1887, having got tired of passing these Coercion Acts which failed in their objective, as every Coercion Act that tries to kill the national spirit will fail in this country, they passed a perpetual Coercion Act.  The late Ministry followed the same bad example when, in order to get their perpetual Coercion Act, they passed Amendment 17 of the Constitution, the most outrageous Coercion Act that was ever passed in any country and was admitted to be such even by the British themselves, who were past masters in the passing of Coercion Acts.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wishes I will change it to anxiety.  What is the reason for their anxiety?  These Coercion Acts ought to be completely wiped out and there need be no danger.  We see no danger.  We are perfectly satisfied that the young and the old people in this country have <Col N="195" /> sense enough to know that if there is to be any national advance in this country it can only be made under a definite rule of order.  That rule of order we have put before the people and we intend to stand by it.  The rule of order is simply this, that all sections of the people will be free to send their representatives to the people's Assembly, no representative having before he takes his seat to forswear any national convictions he may have.  If that rule of order is accepted majority rule will be accepted as determining the national policy.  As long as we are charged with responsibility of Government, we mean to make it possible for all sections of the Irish people to be represented freely here and to have what is going to be the national policy determined by majority rule.  Then so long as we are here we will uphold that majority with all the strength at our command.  That is our position. Is there any anxiety on the part of the people?  We have not heard of it. A great deal of anxiety was worked up by the present Opposition when they were in power by telling the people that we were going over to Bolshevism and all the rest, and when they were rushing this Act through the House trying to induce Deputies to believe that they had secret information which could not be divulged about all these terrible things that were in preparation for us, unless they took this strong action that they proposed and which time has proved was nonsense.  The best proof of our policy is its practical effectiveness; it has proved practically effective.  I have no doubt whatever, speaking here with all the responsibility of the office which I hold, that through the policy we have in mind peace in this country can be made successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would think that the excitability shown by the President was rather unnecessary, except that I quite realise that he obviously thought it was necessary to have some smoke-screen to cover up the lamentable display of incompetence shown by his Minister for Justice.  This is how the argument came about.  We merely <Col N="196" /> wanted to have some statement from the Minister as to his policy before we could discuss the matter.  The Minister for Justice who was in office last year explained all the variations of the Vote, even where it was only a matter of a few pounds, as compared with the previous Estimate.  It seems fairly obvious that if there has been a far-reaching change in the policy of a Department of this kind, the people have a right to expect their responsible Minister, if it be not rather irresponsible to apply the word responsible to the Minister, to give some account of what that change of policy is, and possibly to give some reason in justification of it.  There seems to me to be a very fundamental change.  When we were in office we felt, whatever our shortcomings, our weaknesses, our wrongness might be, that we as a Government, independent of us as individuals, possessed in us the governing authority of this country which, as I have so often said, involves the power of life and death.  It does seem to me&mdash;I take the President's own words&mdash;that the present Government denies its own rights to govern this country.  The President has said that when certain things happen majority rule will be accepted.  The whole implication of the argument of the President and the general propaganda of the Government Party is that at the present moment this State is in a state of anarchy and must remain in a state of anarchy.  It can have no legitimate government until certain changes are made in the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preaching of the Government Party amounts to this, that as far as certain people whom we recognise, and whom immutable moral laws must recognise, as criminals are concerned, they are perfectly justified in using murderous or lethal weapons, or whatever they may be, against the people of this country or against the Government of this country until the laws of this country exactly fulfil what is required by those people who, for the good name of the country, we must assume are a very inconsiderable minority here.  The whole proposal in the President's speech&mdash;there was no proposal in the speech of the Minister <Col N="197" /> for Justice; he spoke for a long time but carefully avoided saying anything of a definite nature&mdash;is that until certain changes are made in the law of this country people are fully justified in refusing to submit to the law of this country.  That is my conception of anarchy.  With such a change in policy surely we have a right, and the people have a right, to get some exposition of it.</P>
    <P>The President has spoken about the extraordinary condition of peace that has prevailed since they took office on, if I remember rightly, the 9th March. Possibly some six or seven weeks lie between the 9th March and 20th April. I would have liked to have had from the Minister for Justice an account of the crimes that took place in the six or seven weeks prior to the 9th March and then a picture of the enormous reduction in crime since the 9th March. That might have meant something.  On Easter Sunday I understand that in Dublin and other places armed men who, according to the President, might rightly refuse to accept the legitimacy of the present Government&mdash;armed men, or rather men in military formation who had received instructions from their leaders not to bring their arms with them, marched through the streets of Dublin and in other places throughout the country.  I understand that this organisation, which does not accept the authority of the Government here, is now organising on very considerable lines throughout the country.  I have heard&mdash;I admit that if I were challenged to give evidence at the present moment I could not do so, but I think I could do it by tomorrow&mdash;of men being turned back upon roads since the 9th March because the I.R.A. were carrying out manoeuvres there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Not twenty miles from where we are&mdash;in the Dublin mountains.  I have heard of these things.  They are matters of which I might be able to get confirmation later. The Minister for Justice was asked if he had received, through police <Col N="198" /> channels, any reports of such drilling. He carefully dodged giving an answer to that question.  Since the present Government came into power they have released prisoners.  As far as I remember one of these prisoners was put into prison for attempting to murder, or doing grievous bodily harm to, Civic Guards.  It would be interesting to know if that is now considered a non-criminal act by the present Government. I quite agree that as the Government denies its own right to govern this country&mdash;it seems to recognise that anyone who disagrees with certain laws has a right to refuse to obey and resist those laws&mdash;it has no right to keep anybody in prison.</P>
      <P>Here is the fundamental change.  We believe that when a Government receives authority to govern it is the duty of that Government to consider all the information at its disposal and to put down by every possible means any attempt there might be to overthrow its authority or the social order.  We know that is not the President's idea. They could get reports from the police about the conditions in the country, but the President apparently prefers to look into his own heart.  He will forgive us for not having that same complete conviction that the Irish people are an unimportant matter when compared with himself.  He tells us that by doing away with the Coercion Acts&mdash;and every Act the Dáil passed is a Coercion Act&mdash;we are going to get into a condition of complete peace and contentment such as never existed in any State at any period of history.  The President, to my mind, appears to have a wrong conception of human nature.  He seems to think that human nature is politically perfect.  He assures us that by merely removing certain laws in this country this armed organisation, this organisation which I believe is still illegal according to the law, will disband.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President tells us blandly that he knows there is going to be complete peace.  He did not say that he was looking into his heart when he made that remark.  He did not even use the phrase &ldquo;blood and tears&rdquo;&mdash;he only uses that phrase in propaganda letters <Col N="199" /> to England.  He tells us that he knows there is going to be complete peace. Assuming that he does succeed in removing the Oath from the Treaty, he tells us that there is going to be no such thing as anybody wanting a communistic State in this country.  No organisation is going to be used for the purpose of stealing land or anything like that.  Is that assertion on his part based merely on a morose delectation after looking into his own heart, or is it based on some knowledge of the people?</P>
    <P>Has he an agreement with the leaders of the I.R.A. that, provided the Bill he has introduced to-day becomes law, they are going to disband their organisation?  Has he any agreement that in certain contingencies they are going to be completely law-abiding and submissive to every law that may be made or that is now the law of this country?  Has he information to that effect?  Has he a guarantee from these people?  If he has not, how can he give us that assurance?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice carefully dodged giving any information.  He was asked did the police reports indicate that there was a complete cessation of illegal drilling.  Does anybody know whether the police reports have indicated that or not?  He has given no answer.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there has been a fundamental change.  There has been a change from a Government that recognised its own authority and, in the interests and the well-being of the people, asserted that authority in making the law operative here.  We have changed to a Government which asserts that until certain changes are made in the law men have the right to arm, to drill, to organise in resistance to and in defiance of this State because they disapprove of certain laws.  That is a new theory of government.  It seems to me to be fundamentally an immoral theory.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice merely says that the Estimate he is introducing is really the Estimate produced by his predecessor.  He has nothing to say <Col N="200" /> upon matters that are submitted to him; he has nothing to say about his own policy or any conceivable policy in this country.  Then the President, with an amount of simulated indignation, endeavours to cover up the incompetence of his Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>I must protest against the exhibition of shadow-boxing that we have had from the two Deputies who have just spoken from the opposite benches.  If ever there was an exhibition of shadow-boxing, trying to find something to hit at but not getting it, we certainly have had it from the ex-Ministers who have spoken.  I think the President was perfectly right in stating that all these exhibitions are due to disappointment on the part of those who were Ministers in the last Government because of the condition of perfect peace that we have had in this country since the Fianna Fáil Government took over control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy who just spoke asked a question about the crimes that were committed during the last six or seven weeks.  I am not aware of any crimes that were committed, but I am aware of crimes that were not committed and which were foreshadowed by the ex-Ministers prior to the change of Government.  According to the members of the late Government we were told that the people could not go about, that a man would not be safe with a sixpence in his pocket if Fianna Fáil took over control.  I am sure that ex-Ministers go about with one shilling in their pockets and more and they have not been waylaid on the roadside.  We were told that crimes would take place, but these crimes have not taken place.  We were told that men were to be shot in their homesteads and that nobody was to be safe; that people were to be hanged, drawn and quartered during the first six weeks of the new Government. But these crimes have not been committed. That is the position that I would like to bring to the notice of Deputies on the opposite benches.  I want again to assert that the exhibition of shadow-boxing given here to-day by the members of the late Government is due to disappointment <Col N="201" /> that these crimes have not taken place.  The speeches we have heard are due to that alone.</P>
    <P>So far as the state of the country is concerned I think there is peace, quietness and no dissension except the dissensions that exist in the ranks of Cumann na nGaedheal.  I think that the fears which the ex-Minister for Justice talks about, and the terrible fears which he and every Deputy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party had in mind are only unreal things.  So far as the country is concerned it has no fears in its mind.  If we take to-day's Order Paper we find that the Deputies on the Cumann na nGaedheal side instead of giving expressions to their fears about the present situation have declared most emphatically their confidence in the stability of the State.  We find Deputy Finlay, a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce about the proposed opening of the Ringsend Bottle Factory.  There is no sign of war or anarchy or fear in that question.  The same Deputy has also a question about the starting of a cement factory in Skerries.  There is no sign of fear displayed there.  Deputy O'Brien, another Cumann na nGaedheal Deputy, does not show any signs of fear when he put several questions down, one of them asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce to start industries in the various localities about the country and not in Dublin.  Even the ex-Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Hogan, has put down a question here and he put it down with a flare of trumpets.  On the last occasion we met here he had a question down about an attack on a barracks in Cork.  He was told to-day by the Minister for Justice that no such attack took place; and, I am sure, that was greatly to the disappointment of the ex-Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister for Justice has told the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies to-day that the barracks in Cork were not attacked.</P>
    <P>When the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies are asking questions about whether and when industries are to <Col N="202" /> be started, others of them should not start shadow boxing here about disturbances and troubles coming in the future.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies have proved themselves bad prophets in the past.  They should not continue to make trouble in the future by stating things here which they do not really believe, or to make prophecies about trouble in the country.  The Minister for Justice has stressed the importance of the Department of Justice.  It is only now we are beginning to realise it is an important office.  The Minister has succeeded in keeping this country in a peaceful state to the satisfaction of everybody except the members of Cumann na nGaedheal.  I do think that there is one other reason for their efforts in trying to create the impression that there is trouble brewing. They are trying to create an atmosphere that there is trouble brewing in order to strengthen the hands of a certain country abroad so that that country should beat this country in the negotiations that will take place in the near future about certain matters of interest to all the people here.</P>

I would like that the Opposition would take these things up in the interests of all sections of the community instead of trying to create an atmosphere abroad and give a picture of things that does not exist at all here&mdash;unrest and dissension.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister for Justice speaks again I would like if he would be specific on this question of illegal drilling.  It seems to me that the Minister deliberately did not answer the question put to him by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  When the President was speaking about it, he, too, was far from specific.  At first he said that so far as he knew there was no illegal drilling.  Then he amended that afterwards and he said he was sure there was not half as much illegal drilling as there was before the change of Government.  There are many reports of illegal drilling here and there throughout the country coming in, and there are reports of increased illegal drilling.  I do not know whether or not these reports are confirmed by the police, or whether the Minister for Justice has any information in regard to them.  It has been certainly asserted in reports from many districts that illegal drilling is going on, that recruiting for the I.R.A. is going on, and that that organisation is consequently becoming more formidable.  It is commonly rumoured, and it can hardly have failed to come to the ears of the Minister, that there is a league or pact between the leaders of the I.R.A. and the Government. If there is no truth in that, it would be well that the Minister should deny it specifically in the House. On the other hand, if there is any truth in the rumour that there is such a league or pact, perhaps the Minister would tell the nature of that league or pact.  Is it that the I.R.A. shall do little publicly until the Oath Bill has been passed or is it a league or pact promising on behalf of the I.R.A. that they would disband their organisation in case the Oath Bill is passed and that they would then give no further trouble?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime is it the intention of the present Government to allow illegal drilling to go on to any extent and allow those who are organising it a free hand and that there should be no interference?  If those who are engaged in that illegal drilling decide to carry arms publicly is it the intention of the Government to take any action against them?  Or has there been an <Col N="204" /> undertaking that for the time being there will be no public carrying of arms?  I can assure the Minister that there is a great deal of unrest and dissatisfaction throughout the country in connection with this matter.  There have not been outrages but the people fear that this organisation which is going on will lead to very serious results. They fear that the permission which appears to be given tacitly or explicitly to this organisation to be active and to expand will lead to outrages later on, to terror and perhaps to the creation of a Frankenstein which will devour this Government which at any rate appears to be conniving at its creation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put it to the Opposition, regarding the amount of talk they have about illegal drilling, that according to the late Ministry there was such a thing as legal drilling and such a thing as illegal drilling.  So long as you were a loyalist, you could don the British Fascisti uniform, you could drill, and carry on as much as you liked.  If you were a Baden Powell boy scout, you could drill and parade but if you were a member of Fianna Eireann your drilling was illegal.  The Deputy who spoke last referred to reports which were coming, apparently, to Cumann na nGaedheal headquarters and not to the Government of the country about alleged illegal drilling.  I hope these reports are as true as the reports they gave the country about the Red communism and the anti-God propaganda that existed before the passing of the Constitution (Amendment) Bill No. 17.  Deputy Blythe has referred to an alleged alliance between the Ministry and the heads of the I.R.A.  I think it would be more truthful if he referred to the alliance which exists between the heads of Cumann na nGaedheal and the ex-Army Comrades Association or the pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is their attitude to law and order?  What truth is there in the report of attempts by ex-Ministers to cause a revolt in the army and police forces on the advent of this Government?  The late Ministers are very annoyed that the present Ministry are not pursuing their methods, that they are not creating <Col N="205" /> internment camps and Arbour Hills. Instead of being a Bastille, Arbour Hill to-day is a place where you can go and honour the dead who raised the flag of revolt for a free and independent Ireland.  The ex-Ministers are very much afraid of conditions in the country.  We know the country more intimately than they do.  Our knowledge of the country has not been obtained from an office in Dublin during the past ten years.  We can assure them that peace and stability reign and that there is new hope in the hearts of the people&mdash;that now they have a Government which is not going to rule by having one set of Irishmen spying on the other but that will rule with judge and jury and which will endeavour to secure that the people get a living in their own country and that they shall not be exploited by the foreigner.</P>

There has, undoubtedly, been a change of policy and the Minister should, at least, have stated the nature and extent of the change.  The Minister answering some criticism by the ex-Minister for Justice, stated that since the present Government had taken office there had not been one outrage in the country.  The Minister must know as well as I do and as well as every school-boy knows that the word &ldquo;outrage&rdquo; is capable of more than one definition.  Is it an &ldquo;outrage,&rdquo; according to the law, for an army or an alleged army not under the control of the State&mdash;an outside or second army&mdash;to drill in the open and to march in military formation to words of command?</P>

      <P>If that is not an outrage, I am prepared to accept what the Minister's definition of outrage is. I agree that it may be highly technical. Perhaps the lawyers would give us a definition of that word &ldquo;outrage&rdquo; in relation to the matters which I have just outlined.  The President has stated in this House on more than one <Col N="206" /> occasion&mdash;I admire him for the openness of his statement and his intentions may be good&mdash;that he stands for one army and for one police force. I ask the President which army.  Is it the army established under the aegis of this State or is it the army we read about&mdash;the I.R.A.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>This question is a little more serious than some Deputies think. I want to be satisfied about it.  Those of us who have any stake whatsoever in the country, those of us who want to see social as well as national progress, are very much concerned indeed with the question as to what army President de Valera stands for.  Is it for the National Army, as established by the State, or is it for the I.R.A. about which we read?  I am delighted beyond measure that the statement made with regard to the peace obtaining in the country is very largely true.  But that peace is not begotten of good government at the moment or of the things mentioned by President de Valera.  The people to-day are in a state of unrest because they do not know what is going to take place next. We have on the Order Paper certain things which it would possibly be out of order to mention now, but there are two outstanding issues which are causing a good deal of unrest.  It appears to me that this is a simulated peace, the kind of peace which often obtains before an eruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain illegal organisations&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; subject to correction by the Minister&mdash;exist in the country, which perhaps have not been brought officially to the notice of the present Minister.  Anybody who reads the Press must have been struck by the fact that numbers of organisations which were established to overthrow the existing State through force of arms are now openly advertising, are now openly holding meetings, and in other ways making it evident that they are live organisations.  Are these organisations legal or are they illegal? I am rather concerned about the definition of the word &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; now, because these organisations have been declared illegal, and I am not aware that they have again been declared <Col N="207" /> legal.  It may be that the release of certain prisoners will have a useful effect.  It may be, as the Minister suggests, that in all countries even some of the basest and worst criminals have clemency exercised towards them, and that that is a good thing for the individual and for the State.</P>
    <P>I am not going to suggest that the Minister has done anything wrong there, but I suggest that if ever a mistake was made in any State it was made here by not calling the Dáil together before certain Acts were taken off the Statute Book.  While they were entitled to do that by virtue of the Constitution I think it would have been more graceful on their part, and a gesture of confidence in the House if they had consulted the Dáil.  I feel that nobody in the House would have objected to the release of the prisoners, but some Deputies would certainly raise an objection to the suspension of the Public Safety Act for a time, at least.  I suggest that the Minister has not treated the House fairly and I say that as one who is prepared to give the Minister and this Government the assistance I gave the last Government, when they proposed to carry out the law and to see that justice was done to the humblest member of the community.</P>
    <P>But there are many things that the Minister might have explained.  He might have told us what he proposed to do about the censorship of publications, and what his policy in that connection is.  Does he propose to continue the policy of the last Government? If he proposes to alter that Act in any way the House should know that.  That would be some indication of the Minister's policy on this Estimate. The sum of £40,218 is mentioned as the extent of this Estimate. Surely the least we could expect from a new and capable Minister&mdash;a capable lawyer&mdash;is that he should give us, under the various heads and sub-heads, some indications of his future policy. A very grave and a very heavy responsibility rests on the Minister for Justice. I think it was the ex-Minister for Justice suggested that this was the most important Department of State <Col N="208" /> at present.  We are comparatively new to Parliamentary institutions.  Deputy MacDermot suggested to-day that we were new so far as the government of our own country was concerned.  We are all aware of the impediments and handicaps suffered by the last Government. Those of us who are alive to what is going on around us know that there are a number of disgruntled persons who do not believe even in the policy of the present Government. They form a minority, the numerical strength of which I am not able to gauge.  I am aware, however, that that minority, relatively small though it may be, is sufficiently strong to force its views on the present Government. If the tail is going to wag the dog it will be for the Minister for Justice, who is a capable lawyer, and I am sure will prove a good administrator in his Department, to indicate to this House what measures he proposes to take to put down the things I have mentioned &mdash;to put down drilling of every kind.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to ask for proof from those who said that drilling was going on, that there were dumps in the country, and that some of the people responsible informed the Fianna Fáil leaders that these dumps could be released at any moment.  It is very difficult to prove those things. Whether proofs are placed before the House or not, every Deputy knows that drilling is going on, and that there are arms in the hands of an army which is not the army officially recognised by this State.  That cannot be contradicted. What steps does the Minister for Justice propose to take to put down that menace to the life of the State?  The President said a few moments ago that he proposed to continue as he had begun.  He cited the cases in which the late Government found it necessary to introduce legislation of a particularly drastic character.  Perhaps if those measures had not been introduced President de Valera and his Ministers would not be sitting where they are to-day.  It is all very well to say that those measures were not necessary, but anybody who has given careful and impartial examination to the facts of the case must readily admit that crimes had been committed, that <Col N="209" /> there was a possibility of many more crimes being committed, but that immediately on the introduction and subsequent passing of those Acts in the Dáil that particular class of crime ceased.  I do not want to justify the passing of those drastic measures in the Dáil.  I am grieved that the necessity should have arisen for such legislation, and I sincerely hope that the present Ministry will not be under the necessity of introducing measures of that character.  The Ministry can expect from me, and, I feel sure, from every member of the official Opposition, every help and co-operation in putting down the class of crime to which I have just referred.  That assurance I give, and as the House is aware I am unattached, with the exception of, let me say, my leader, Deputy Dan Morrissey.</P>
    <P>I stated that the Minister would have obviated all this discussion if he had given us even a synopsis of the policy of this most important Department of State.  I hope he will have a very easy time in his Department, and that we will be able at the end of the period&mdash; the period I cannot define, because I do not know when a General Election is going to take place&mdash;to congratulate the Minister on the absence of crime of every kind in the State.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blythe, when speaking on this matter, spoke of certain pacts and agreements that may or may not have been made.  Deputy Blythe should be an expert on the making of pacts and agreements.  He has also proved himself an expert in keeping those pacts and agreements to himself.  Surely he should not expect other people to do what he did not think it worth his while to do: that is, when he made certain pacts and agreements to inform this House about them.  Now he wants to know if there have been any pacts made outside this House extraneous altogether to the business of this House.  He wants these things spoken about even if they have or have not taken place.  The Deputy also spoke about illegal drilling, and the dangers accruing therefrom to this country. He spoke about the I.R.A.  He said there were complaints coming in&mdash;we <Col N="210" /> will presume to the headquarters of Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;in regard to illegal drilling in the country, and, bearing that out, Deputy Anthony said that the I.R.A. had been established for the overthrow of this State. Now Deputy Blythe is one who should be able to inform Deputy Anthony that the I.R.A. was not created for the purpose of overthrowing this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>Because this State was not then in existence.  Deputy Blythe was one of those who went round the country at one time and who knows more about recruiting for the I.R.A. and the drilling of the I.R.A. and the organisation of the I.R.A. than perhaps Deputy Anthony does.  Deputy Anthony can certainly get all the information he wants from Deputy Blythe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ex-Minister for Justice told us that in all parts of the country illegal drilling was taking place, that there are bombs and dumps and all sorts of things throughout the country, that there are arms in the hands of men throughout the country, and all that in spite of the fact that for ten long years the late Ministry had all the machinery they set up for the express purpose of finding out where all these dumps and arms were, and the men who might be inclined to use them.  As the President has pointed out, the late Ministry passed seventeen Coercion Acts for the express purpose of doing away with anybody who might be inclined to use the arms contained in those dumps for the purpose of fighting for Irish nationality.  In spite of the fact that they passed seventeen Coercion Acts, and had all the special forces they set up&mdash;an army, a police force and the C.I.D.&mdash;the ex-Minister for Justice comes along at this stage of our history and talks a lot of nonsense about dumps.  If he knows so much about dumps why did he not discover them during the last ten years, or during the period that he occupied the office of Minister for Justice? If the dumps are in existence now they must have been in existence <Col N="211" /> then.  He told us the dumps were there.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil attempted in any way in this House or outside of it to point out all the things that had not been done by the late Government to create employment they were told: &ldquo;Please do not say these things because you are ruining the credit of the country; the people abroad will think that this country is a country not fit to speculate in, that it is not a country fit to come to, that it is not a country fit to come to tour in,&rdquo; but now on the eve of the Eucharistic Congress these people who could not discover dumps during the last ten years, have broadcast to the world that illegal drilling is taking place, and that in every back yard and in every field there is a dump.  This is tantamount to saying to visitors who may think of coming here during the Eucharistic Congress: &ldquo;Ireland is a safe place to stay out of.&rdquo;  It is time that the Party opposite changed the record they have had on for the last ten years: dumps, drilling, trouble and Bolshevism and all the rest.  It is time now that the ex-Government put on a new record.  It is time they gave us something constructive instead of this destructive criticism.  We had enough of their criticism and of their destruction for the last ten years.  At least they might reserve to themselves this destructive criticism if they have nothing better to offer.</P>

      <P>(Galway): If the Deputy who has just spoken had any serious concern for the reputation of the country he should not have made that speech.  We did not make any extreme charges at all.  No one said there were dumps in every back yard and in every garden or that every man in the country was armed.  It was the Deputy opposite who said that, and he said it for the purpose of making a political point.  I think that Deputies will generally agree that we made our case in a rather moderate fashion.</P>
      <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We asked for certain information which we are absolutely entitled to get, <Col N="212" /> and I hope the Minister for Justice, when replying, will not forget to give it to us.  It is perfectly true to say that there has been peace since Fianna Fáil took over.  And I want to be quite moderate and to state the facts as I know them.  Equally would it be true to say that there was absolute peace since we passed, before the Election, the Public Safety Act and since we made it unsafe to shoot jurymen. There has been absolute peace since. I want to put it to the Dáil as the first democratic Assembly in this free country&mdash;because who can deny that it is free now?  We can have a Republic if we want it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will get a hearing here without any sufferance.  I want to put this to the first democratic Assembly in this country: there are two sorts of peace there is peace by maintaining the law and peace by surrender.  I want to know which peace have we. Now that is the real question.  I like peace.  I never professed to be a soldier and have often said that the word is prostituted in this country.  I want to see peace in this country at any price.  Law, order and peace and the right of every man to manage his own affairs and to go about his business is much more important than politics. I want to see order and peace in this country and would be willing to make a great many sacrifices, material and otherwise, for it.  Peace is, after all, the greatest blessing the world requires at the present time, but have we peace if it is peace on sufferance? It seems to me to be clear both from the circumstances and from President de Valera's speech that the I.R.A. have really said to the Government: &ldquo;We will keep quiet while you are taking out the Oath, but when you have <Col N="213" /> the Oath taken out we will then tell you what we will do.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I could go on, of course, and quote statements made in the official organ of the I.R.A. as to what they propose to do then.  I do not propose to bring in that evidence at all.  I merely call the attention of Deputies to the circumstances which they all know and to the speech made by the President.  I put it to Deputies, and particularly to the Labour Party who profess to be the guardians of democracy in this country, that it is clear enough that the position is this: that they have said to the Government, to the alleged Government across the way, &ldquo;There will be peace while you are taking out the oath and after that we will tell you what is happening.&rdquo;  Is that the position? Because that is not peace, it is surrender and no democrat would buy peace at that price.  If that is the position, the Deputies opposite are not the Government of this country. While we were sitting on those benches, we were the Government of the country, but if that is the position, they are not the Government of the country; they are only puppets and the Government is outside.  I would be very glad to think it was not the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputies opposite, especially those sitting on the Front Bench, will agree with me, but I would be very glad to think it was not the position, because, as I say, I want peace in this country.  I want all this politics forgotten.  I want to give to the ordinary citizen a chance of settling down to mind his business, and whether you believe me or not, I tell the Dáil I would be very glad to think that that was not the position. But what are we to think?  Prisoners have been released regardless of what they have done.  They are free to parade and we know what they are saying officially.  We know what they are saying in their papers, and if we have peace at the present time, is it going to last?  I hope it will last, and I would go a long way to see it lasting, but this I do know, from whatever little experience I have, and whatever little knowledge I have, of conditions in other countries, that in no country <Col N="214" /> in the world and at no time in the world's history did you ever have a second and irresponsible organisation without war and without trouble.</P>
    <P>I think we are not asking anything unreasonable in this country when we ask the Minister here whether in fact there is that irresponsible&mdash;when I use the word &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo; I mean not responsible to this Dáil&mdash;organisation, and what is his attitude to it, and whether the President of the Executive Council has stated the position properly and accurately when he said that, when, and if, certain things are done by this Dáil then he can get allegiance from that organisation. If that is the position there is no peace in this country.  There is only a tyranny.  If that is the position the people who make that statement and subscribe to that doctrine should go out of this Dáil and go into the I.R.A., because that is their proper place and not here, and this is only a puppet Parliament.  I say, in the interests of this Parliament and of democracy in this country, that if that is the position: that law and order cannot run in this country without conditions, because of some veto from an outside body, this Parliament is not sovereign, and it is not the English people who are preventing its sovereignty but a body in this country who have no right here, good, bad or indifferent.</P>

      <P>During the course of the recent General Election campaign a lady acquaintance of mine was walking along Rathmines Road one day. Passing the Cumann na nGaedheal Committee Rooms she saw a poster which amused her.  It was entitled &ldquo;Devvy's Circus.&rdquo;  She was so amused that she decided to go into the Committee Rooms and ask for a copy of it.  She did so and was supplied with it.  She asked the Election Agent in the Committee Rooms what were the prospects of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in the Election.  He did not appear to be very hopeful and she asked: &ldquo;Is it true that Fianna Fáil may win?&rdquo;  He got so agitated that he took her by the arm to the <Col N="215" /> door and said: &ldquo;Do you see those gutters; they will be running red with blood if a Fianna Fáil Government gets in.&rdquo;  That is the type of propaganda that Cumann na nGaedheal fought the Election on, and every speech delivered here to-day by the Deputies opposite has been designed to justify it.  In fact, as they have been told from this side of the House, there has been peace.  Their campaign has been proved to have been without foundation, and they are trying to cover up their tracks here now by making speeches about dangers that will arise in the future, in order to prevent people thinking about dangers they foretold in the past which did not come true.  The Deputy opposite must have been, I think, reading some of the writings of the late James Connolly, since he quitted office.  One thing James Connolly said was that a true prophet is the person who tries to create the future he foretells, and the Deputy, having foretold trouble in this country resulting from the election of a Fianna Fáil Government, he and the other ex-Ministers are to-day deliberately trying to incite it.  What purpose is there behind these speeches that are delivered? What aim are Deputies opposite trying to achieve, but to prevent and destroy the peace that does exist, and which they admit exists.  The ex-Minister for Agriculture tells us that he hopes these conditions are going to continue.  I find it very hard to credit that.  Certainly I think that if such a hope was generally held by his colleagues opposite, we would have had different types of speeches to listen to than those we have had to endure for the past couple of hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hogan need not worry at the moment if that peace is maintained.  The Deputy said that there were two ways of getting peace: one by maintaining law and the other by surrender.  I only know of one kind, and that is the peace that is based on maintenance of law, and the peace we have had is based on maintenance of law; and it is the intention and purpose of this Government to maintain the law, and if the Deputy thinks it is possible to get peace on any other basis, his experience in office should have taught him that it cannot.  We have had here proposals to abrogate the law and Constitution; to tear up every safeguard the ordinary citizen had over his rights, and as a result of that tearing up and abrogation of the law, they did not succeed in getting the peace which now exists without the aid of Coercion Acts.  Let the Deputy remember that the methods that this Government has taken to get peace have been endorsed by the people and that the methods he stood for have been repudiated by the people.  It is not two months since that policy for which they stood was rejected by the people of this country.  Do not let them forget it, because they appear to be in danger of forgetting it.  They talk here to-day as if they still had the responsibility of administering the law.  They have not.  We have, and we are going to administer it.  This is not an alleged Government.  It is, in fact, the Government of this part of Ireland, and it is going to assert every authority it has to act in that capacity; but <Col N="217" /> it has been pointed out not merely to-day, but on a number of occasions for years past, that the title of this Dáil to legislate for this country is faulty, and it is faulty because of this reason, that it is not open to every section of our people to get representation here. They cannot deny that.  We are going to make it possible for them to get that representation.  We are going to eliminate that fault from the title of the Dáil to govern, and when that is done it will not be possible for anybody to claim justification for taking any action not approved by the majority here.</P>

The first of these is majority rule, the right of the representatives elected by the people of the country to <Col N="218" /> make laws binding on these people without fear, favour, rent or render, or permission from any other authority on earth.  That is what we are standing for.  We are going to see that majority rule will operate, and that it will be effective majority rule; in other words, that it will be possible to ascertain exactly what the will of the majority is by giving them every opportunity of expressing it.  We have had Deputy Fitzgerald asking do we contemplate some possibility at some time in the future of somebody advocating communism? Of course, we contemplate that.  It is open to people to advocate communism, and if they can get a sufficient number of people to elect them in support of a communistic doctrine, to come in here and advocate it. It is no crime to advocate any political policy, and we are not going to make it a crime.  We are going to try and make the Dáil representative of every section of opinion in the country.  It is by doing that that we can achieve more to secure stability and ordered progress than the late Government did by seventeen Coercion Acts during their ten years in office.

      <P>The last speaker has referred to the disturbing speeches made upon this topic.  What more disturbing speech has been put before this House to-day than the one to which we have just listened?  Look at the confusion of it.  First of all they claim that the speeches that came from this side were likely to cause disturbance and were meant to cause disturbance. What did these speeches amount to? A request to the Minister for Justice that he might repair the defects of his opening speech and state certain things which the Dáil had a right to expect from him at the beginning; that he might state whether in fact any drilling was going on; were there any police reports to him about drilling; and what was the attitude of his Department towards drilling, if such was reported to him?  What disturbance is likely to be caused by these <Col N="219" /> questions?  What disturbance is not likely to be allayed if there is not a proper answer to these questions? Considerable disturbance if the Minister for Justice was allowed to leave this House in the befogged state it was in after he had spoken, as representing a country which is getting disquieted over rumours, about which he must be well aware, that there is drilling going on, but which he could kill, by a statement in this House, if he said, first of all, that the rumours were untrue, or, secondly, if he said that the rumours were true and announced the fact that then he was going to take action.  What can the Minister for Justice say now?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has fouled the tracks for him.  We are going to have peace, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, based upon the maintenance of the law.  If he had stopped there it was a satisfactory statement.  But he had to give an interpretation of what the law is, and he gave it in this cryptic phrase: that he had never burked the issue that the title of this Dáil to legislate was faulty. What law are we operating under?</P>

      <P>Is there any law in the country at all?  Where do we get it?  The assertion here to-night, no longer by a man in opposition but by a member of the Government, is <Col N="220" /> that the title of this House to legislate is faulty.  We have asked the unfortunate Minister for Justice is he going to maintain the law and his colleague tells us distinctly and clearly that all the law passed by this House is faulty.  That is the most disturbing feature of the debate here to-night.  What is that but a declaration to the people outside that they should go ahead?  This is not merely a surrender but an abject surrender on the part of the Government and a declaration that they have surrendered and are in full flight. Look at the next phrase.  Permanent peace is a possibility, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if the Oath is taken out.  Was there any implication in that in regard to the present or the period that is to pass, until the possibility that this Oath may be taken out? What is the threat behind it?  That there is going to be war in this country if the Oath is not taken out. The unfortunate Minister for Justice is to operate against that by trying to enforce a law that is faulty, passed by a House that has no title to make it, and upheld by servants who suffer from the same defect because they are paid by moneys voted by this House whose title is completely at fault. We are to have peace in this country or the possibility of permanent peace in this country if the Oath is taken out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We passed certain legislation last year.  We founded it upon certain crimes that had been committed in the country.  Do people here let their minds run back over these crimes and the circumstances under which they were committed?  Let me leave out the killing of Carroll.  Let me simply recall the names of Curtin and Ryan.  Are we to think that the people whose consciences did not prevent them killing, in the way in which they did kill Curtin and Ryan, are going to have their consciences eased because a certain formula is not to be sworn by certain representatives whom they may decide to send to this House?  Is that the conscience for which we have to cater in this country?  Apart from what their <Col N="221" /> crimes may be, are we going to cater for a minority in the country simply because we are told that there is a possibility that there may be peace, and if there is peace and these people do not raise more objections to this House, then this House may retrospectively validate all that it had done previously and we may emerge a completely legislative assembly with power over the citizens of the country?</P>
    <P>This has been a most disturbing day, disturbing because the Minister for Justice seemed in the beginning to be shirking the issues he must have known were bound to be raised on this Vote of his, but still more disturbing and perplexing because the Minister for Industry and Commerce thought fit to intervene in the debate in his aid, and has only left us with this statement that I reiterate again: that from a member of the Government we have the declaration that the title of this House is faulty.  Still the Minister for Industry and Commerce, after making that comment, goes on to say that peace is going to be had in this country based on the maintenance of the law.  What law and from what House does that law proceed?</P>

We had Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald charging the Minister for Justice with releasing criminals and we had Deputy Anthony, a most repentant gunman, following him up and talking about criminals also.

We may also hear a lot of talk about dumps.  There are a lot of people in the dumps.  For the past two months people in Cork have been in the dumps and have been holding special meetings to know what is to become of their pensions out of the £250,000 fund dragged out of the sweat of the unfortunate people for the last few years and handed over to them. We heard the late Minister for Agriculture telling us about an agreement between the I.R.A. and the present Government and amplifying that agreement by saying we will help you until you have the Oath abolished and then we will see what we will do next.  We do not hear any word about the agreements that Deputy Hogan's executive formed with certain Deputies in this House and with a certain organisation outside of it which said: &ldquo;We will help you as long as you give us five times the value of our land and put that in our pockets and clap it down on the unfortunate tenants you have misrepresented for the last ten years.&rdquo;  Now when we see our industries being wiped away one by one under this kind of agreement for the support of a few to <Col N="224" /> keep them in office we hear no talk about that agreement.  I would like to hear something from the benches opposite upon that matter.</P>

I would like to hear for instance whether those gentlemen who invented the kicking cow in Clare are still members of the Force and drawing salaries.  I would like to hear further in regard to the most important question on the Order Paper to-day in regard to the attack on the Civic Guard Barrack in Drinagh in County Cork.  I would like to know if the officer responsible for the delay in that most alarming report, which would have meant so much for the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, but which was three weeks too late, and which should have been published the day before the election&mdash;but unfortunately owing to some difficulty travelling down the long road to West Cork did not come out until three weeks after&mdash;is still in the Force.</P>

It is accepted here that no officer in the employment of the State should be indicated in such a way here as that he could be recognised subsequently. If the Deputy is going to make any allegation against any officer in the State he should not do so in such a way that that officer can be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is very clear. We always hear a lot about police reports.  I should think they got enough of police reports the last day. This is a very definite report that appeared in the public Press and upon which we had a question put here to-day by Deputy Hogan.  We all know what the effect of this report would be if it had been blazoned in the pages of the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Cork <Col N="225" /> Examiner&rdquo; the day before the elections, as an attack by two armed sections on the Civic Guard station in Drinagh.  I seriously suggest to the Minister for Justice that the gentleman who kept that report three weeks late should be looked up.</P>
      <P>I want to know definitely whether those gentlemen who were responsible for outrages in this country during the last four years and who were definitely shielded here week after week until we had to refer to the stereotyped reply that came from the late Minister for Justice, as the gramophone reply, are to be continued in the Force.  That is what I want to know and what I am entitled to know.  These are matters which should engage the attention of the Minister for Justice.  So far as the work in his Department is concerned there are other matters I wish to suggest to him.  One is that I suggest that the Department should seriously consider the enormous amount of money appearing in the Estimates for new barracks.  I suggest that the Minister should seriously look into that question and see whether these new barracks are necessary or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice is not responsible in that connection.  It comes under another Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to his Department lessening the numbers of Civic Guards owing to the peaceful conditions that now prevail in the country.  I think we are perfectly safe in lessening them and in closing down many barracks which are unnecessary. In that way we will save a lot of money for the State.  I would suggest that very seriously to the Minister.  In connection with the storm which has been aroused here to-day, I would like to <Col N="226" /> state that the only disturbing elements that I know of in the country, and that I have seen drilling during the last eight or nine years, are uniformed Baden-Powell Scouts, as they call themselves, Girl Guides and all the rest of them.  I have seen boys younger than they, who went out the following week and who did not do half the illegal drilling, brought before the District Court, and fined or put to jail.  If we want peaceful and ordered conditions here, this Government is responsible for law and order, and will be responsible for law and order, but I hope if it ever comes to the day when they will have to have the kind of law and order we have experienced in this country during the last seven or eight years, that they will decently get out before they lend themselves to that condition of affairs.  The Minister for Justice knows the conditions in which he found decent boys in the torture chambers in the old bastille in Dublin. I think that experience should be enough, and those who are responsible for that experience are very safe in keeping their mouths shut here, for if I had my way they would get a taste of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have written to the Minister for Justice in connection with the proposed new barracks.  Perhaps there has been some misunderstanding on the part of Deputy Corry and myself, but certain advertisements were issued and we took it for granted that new barracks were to be erected in Kerry.  Therefore, I did communicate with the Minister for Justice on the question.  I understand now that no such scheme will be carried through.  There was an item in last year's estimate of £1,500 for each of at least four barracks in Kerry.  The Minister at the moment has intimated to me that it will not be discussed now but later.  I would like to impress upon him that if at all possible the erection of these barracks in Kerry or in any other county should be deferred, and that the money proposed for them would be far more remuneratively spent by providing employment in other ways than in the erection of barracks or the repair of barracks either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> Opposition Deputies have referred to peace and prosperity.  I would point out one real menace to peace in rural portions of the Co. Kerry. Certain members of the detective forces have done terrible things in their time.  They have gone so far as to torture innocent men from political motives, and these forces are still retained in Kerry in certain rural districts.  I would ask the Minister at least, pending a revision or disbandment of these forces, to remove them from the districts in which they did desperate things against certain sections of the people.  I would point out very strongly that it would be a real basis of peace if such elements were removed or if there was an intimation that in the very near future the Minister could accomplish that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the Minister would throw some further light on a matter which was the subject of a question here to-day. In a supplementary question to that asked by Deputy Hogan, I asked the Minister if he was aware that a contradiction to the statement that whatever occurred in Drinagh on a certain night was due to a labour dispute, had appeared in the Press.  The Minister was not aware of that statement and, of course, I accept the Minister's statement fully.  I would like to say that I live within a few miles of that particular place and I would be very much surprised to find that a dispute of that kind existed three or four miles away without my hearing it.  I am aware that a certain labour organisation with which I am connected has a branch in the locality, and that the repudiation I referred to emanated from that branch.  I cannot conceive of a labour dispute existing there under any circumstances.  The little village itself is the centre of a poor farming district.  The people living there are small farmers, and the only employment that would be given to people in the locality would come from the management of the local co-operative creamery.  The creamery is deservedly popular with the community. It has been of advantage to <Col N="228" /> the small farmers and I cannot know of any conceivable grounds for dispute. I say that in justice to the workers of the district who would necessarily be implicated in any dispute of that kind.  There is a tendency, unfortunately, to throw the blame on workers for all ills.  Labour disputes we are told lead to a lack of confidence, injure the credit of a district and things of that kind.  It is unfortunate that a statement of this kind should be made without very clear ground.  I recognise that the Minister has not been many weeks in office and that he could not get this information as quickly or as expeditiously as he might otherwise have done.  If the Minister has got any further information on the matter I would like if he would give it in the course of his reply.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the references to disturbing factors in the country, I would like the Minister for Justice to state if he is aware that there has been a rumour down the country that a prominent member of Cumann na nGaedheal recently visited a high dignitary of the Catholic Church to canvass his view or the views of the Church on an armed attempt to prevent Fianna Fáil from taking over the reins of Government in this country.

      <P>I regret that after I had informed the Deputies of this House that last year my predecessor in this office had not made a general statement of policy in introducing this Estimate, they did not take my word.  I do not quarrel with Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney came here with a speech, so eloquent and so beautifully phrased, that one would almost suspect that it had been carefully prepared.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney suggested, quite inadvertently, that I had omitted to follow the ordinary precedent and make a statement of policy.  I drew the attention of Deputies to the fact that last year's report of the debate on this Estimate showed that no such statement had been made and that in proposing this <Col N="229" /> Vote Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, as Minister for Justice, made in substance the statement I have made, elaborated by slight explanations as to immaterial discrepancies in the Vote.  A number of speakers afterwards thought fit to reiterate the previous charge.  I do not propose to reciprocate that treatment. I think in the interests of the House it is desirable that a Deputy's statement as to a fact will be accepted. I will accept a statement of fact coming from the other side though I may not accept a statement of opinion.</P>
      <P>As my statement was not accepted, I think it right to refer the House to Vol. 38 of the Debates for last year. If Deputies will refer to pages 346 and 347 of that volume they will see that the statement I made here was absolutely accurate.  The insinuations that have been made, to use a phrase twice repeated by Deputy Fitzgerald, that I was dodging something, are entirely unwarranted.  The Deputies opposite have not yet recovered from the surprise that normal conditions and normal government have given them. They seem astonished that it is not necessary for a Minister for Justice, in tendering this Vote to the House, to make a long statement in regard to rumours and things that are passed, some of them almost forgotten.</P>
      <P>I want to repeat what I said before, that the law that has been in force during the six weeks that I have filled this office will be enforced and that there will be no discrimination as between citizens.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald, Deputy Blythe and other Deputies have referred to this matter of drilling and asked what is my attitude towards drilling.  I assure the House that in the six weeks I have been in this office I have not received a single substantiated complaint from any citizen that he has been put to any inconvenience or that he has been terrified by drilling or by the use of lethal weapons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would expect more perhaps from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney than from some of his colleagues.  If Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney <Col N="230" /> will allow me to proceed, I say I have not received a single substantiated complaint.  I use that adjective deliberately because one rather detailed statement came to me through the police of firing at a house near Cork, of a fairly prominent gentleman having been terrified by shots discharged outside his house and of the terrible fright that his wife received from firing outside his house, coupled with an application that I should give this gentleman permission to use a revolver.  The Civic Guards investigated the whole matter with thoroughness. It was found that the discharges which had occasioned so much real alarm, on the wife's part at all events, and which occasioned so much trouble to the Civic Guard and even to me were the discharges from the engine of a motor car, ordinarily called backfiring. The owner of the motor car was traced.  All the details were established after a great deal of investigation and trouble on the part of the officers of the Guards.  It was all established, strange as it may appear, even to the satisfaction of the complaining parties.  I think everyone, including those immediately concerned, is now convinced that the wish, to some extent, inspired the thought in that case near Cork that shots had been fired, but there was no foundation for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of drilling, I would like to know what is the stand that is being taken by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Blythe.  Do they want me to interfere with every procession that passes through the streets?  Do they want me to interfere if words are spoken to ensure that the procession will not degenerate into a rabble?  I listened very keenly when Deputy Fitzgerald stated that on Easter Day men in this City paraded exhibiting arms.  I have made I must say exhaustive inquiries as to what happened on Easter Day. I thought I was about to receive some new and very valuable information, but Deputy Fitzgerald seemed suddenly to take a grip of himself and after having made a statement to the House he proceeded then to tell the House that it really was not so, because he said <Col N="231" /> these men parading or marching through the streets of Dublin on Easter Day did not carry arms because they had received orders from their leaders not to carry arms.  Deputy Fitzgerald spoke as if it were still more heinous that they had not carried arms.  Deputy Fitzgerald said that those men would have carried arms if they had not been ordered by their leaders not to carry arms.  I wish Deputy Fitzgerald had disclosed the source of that information so that we may form some sort of estimate of the value of the Deputy's statement.  How does he know that? I am supposed by certain Deputies to have anticipated speeches of the type of Deputy Fitzgerald's.  I feel that that is imposing too much on me. Deputy Fitzgerald with that politeness which seems to have been suddenly transferred from these benches to the opposite side of the House then stated that I was carefully dodging the matter of drilling.  I am not dodging the matter of drilling.</P>

Is that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's conception of the responsibility of my office?  Let Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney state that drilling occurs in this townland or in that townland, that it occurs in this village or in that village, and I will tell Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney what the police say about it.  But if Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney thinks that I am to read to this House statements received by me as I receive them daily, sometimes in large numbers, from the police as to what they hear or as to what they suspect and so on, then I say that I am not convinced that that is my duty. The efficient police force of this country must necessarily make reports to me of rumours as to this, that and the other. But those are not for the House, and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney knows well they are not for the House.</P>

      <P>Let Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney wait a moment before he repeats the charge of his colleague that I am dodging.  I am making a statement now on a big fundamental matter, the use that is to be made from these benches of confidential police reports. I am making a statement here, and I think it is important to make that statement on this Estimate.  I am making a statement here that reports received by me from the police, confidential reports, will be treated confidentially by me, and that if any Deputy here makes a specific allegation as to anything having occurred I will state the result of my police inquiries in regard to that matter.  I want to make that clear.  I will treat this present occasion as a most exceptional occasion.  Let it not be thought that I am now creating a precedent.  Let not that be imagined.  I want to make that clear, too.  But as I am charged here in terms by an ex-Minister, charged twice with dodging, and, as other ex-Ministers insinuated it, that I have avoided the matter, I will now take a course the wisdom of which I confess I slightly doubt, and it is this: I have received from the police a report in regard to drilling.  I will go further. I will state where it was.  In the mountains of Co. Louth.  So far as I can recollect at the moment that is the only report of a specific nature in regard to drilling that I have received. I have received reports of rumours that there have been drillings.  A few, not many.  That I have received a few is a fact.  I did not intend to make that statement.  Certainly when I came into the House I did not intend to make it, but I think that after the somewhat irresponsible speeches that have been delivered from the benches opposite, speeches calculated to excite grave alarm in the minds of citizens here, I think the members of the House will pardon me for having taken a course of accepting the challenge, a course that it is not my present intention to take again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> Let me go further on this matter of dodging.  Our people here are not a criminal people.  They are a law-abiding people.  As statistics show, our Irish people are a law-abiding people, and no amount of eloquence from the benches opposite will prove that they are a people with criminal tendencies, because that is not a fact.  It is said that they drill.  We all know, of course, that there has been drilling in this country.  There has been drilling in this country certainly for the last 16 or 17 years.  There was drilling in this country during the glorious régime of the late Government.  That Government took steps, the nature of which has been already indicated, several times to stop that drilling.  They seem to have taken these steps without avail. May we not be permitted to pass one Bill with a view to having one Government, a Government not merely entitled to govern because we are entitled to govern, but a Government whose rule will be broad-based on the will of the people?  May we not be permitted to introduce one Bill, a Bill for the removal of that Oath, and at least see if it will lead to the happy results that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney sought, but sought in vain.</P>

      <P>I have enlarged a good deal, but I am still merely enlarging what I said in my first attempt to conclude this debate, namely, that we will enforce the law.  I have no direct evidence of this drilling at all, and I have indicated the extent of it. Such of it as has occurred has not materially interfered with the maintenance <Col N="234" /> of law and order.  Even Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney will confess that in fact has been so during the last six weeks.  After the speedy passage of the Bill which received its First Reading to-day, I venture to think that Deputies opposite will have to find some new theme for alarming speeches. They will find that this matter of drilling will have become quite out of date.</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Fitzgerald who referred to the stealing of other people's land and other topics of that kind, as if that had been going on. Probably if the view of the police were to be taken they would say that never since the Civic Guard force was instituted have they been so pestered for information in regard to the maintenance of law and order as they have been during the past six weeks.  I have made a very extensive and exhaustive inquiry, and I am not aware that anybody's property has been interfered with during the past six weeks or that interference was allowed to proceed with impunity.  There was a measure of interference near Athlone.  I venture to think I was at least as rapid as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney would have been in taking cognisance of that, but I find that there was someone who was even more alert than I was.  The police authorities had already taken cognisance of it and it had already been dealt with.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald made a set speech, apparently, and he has gone away; they have all gone away.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has returned. Will Deputy Fitzgerald tell me whose property has been stolen without the thief being apprehended?  We have heard a great deal in the way of generalities. I have been invited by someone to deal not merely with the past six weeks but with the period long before we took office.  I have had to resist a grievous temptation all the time to deal with that period.  I have read some of the speeches made by former Ministers with regard to Communism, which apparently would not be doctrinaire but would take the form of violent seizure of other people's lands, property and money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all read the results of the voting at the last General Election. <Col N="235" /> We have seen that the Communist candidates received a number of votes so low as to be negligible.  We have even had the delightful experience of reading in one of the newsprints of the city that had it not been for the Constitution Amendment Act the Communist candidates would have got an enormous number of votes and that proves what a blessed thing the Constitution Amendment Act was.  I will concede any merits I can possibly discern in the Constitution Amendment Act, but being one of the dull people from the Midlands, I have been unable to see why in the secrecy of the ballot the Communists, so numerous, so violent and so intense here, did not indulge their fancies by voting for the Communist candidates.</P>
    <P>The Constitution Amendment Act was very far-reaching; I could never quite understand how wide the net could be spread; it was a sort of elastic net.  I do not know if there was something in that Act which would have enabled the Minister for Justice, if he had continued to occupy the office, to examine the ballot papers. Is that what they were afraid of? Have we not had proof positive quite recently that the apprehensions in regard to this matter of seizing property, thieving and a general lawless-mindedness on the part of our people were quite unfounded?  It was almost neurasthenic.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony asked is it an outrage to give words of command in regard to processions.  I am afraid I am not the best authority for a precise definition as to what an outrage is and I do not think the definition matters very much.  I probably have a greater measure of dislike for these processions than any other Deputy in the House.  I regard a lot of them as a public nuisance.  We have them here at different times of the year.  We have them in the spring, we have some of them in the summer.  Even when chill November comes, when the winter is setting in, people will not refrain from processioning through the streets.  I wish to goodness all these processions in Dublin and elsewhere could be dropped.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> I will not go so far as to say that they are an outrage.  I will not go so far as to say that, as long as we have to endure those wretched processions, the giving of certain words of command, words borrowed from the military dictionary which will keep the procession in some sort of order, whether the people who are in that procession are adorned with red poppies or with Easter lilies&mdash;I do not care which&mdash;are an outrage.  Words borrowed from the military vocabulary which will keep people in some sort of order&mdash;as to whether those words are an outrage, well I would not like to pontificate, but I think if we are to have these processions they are not an outrage.  I do not want to be misunderstood in regard to that.  Military words of command necessary to prevent one of these, to my mind, wholly unnecessary processions degenerating into a mob are probably, from a practical point of view, desirable, though from a legal point of view there may be a great deal in what Deputy Anthony says.  From the practical point of view, and taking the facts as they have been created chiefly by Deputies on the opposite side&mdash; taking things as we find them&mdash;they have a practical use.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan says there are two kinds of peace, the peace of government and the peace of surrender.  As an abstract statement one cannot quarrel with Deputy Hogan's statement. But you have to think then of your method of government.  You have various models to choose from.  You have the model of the former regime in Russia; you have the model of certain modern States on the Continent of Europe to-day.  You can carry that idea of strong government too far.  If we succeed in materially advancing the cause of law and order, as a result of removing the Oath, I think we will have gone a long way towards justifying the choice the country made recently.  I regard a method of that sort&mdash;the removal of the cause of the irritation, the cause of potential turbulence&mdash;of just as great efficacy as the use of the mailed fist.  I think that that is a fair enough view to take.  A few other matters were mentioned by <Col N="237" /> Deputies.  If I overlook any of them, I hope they will remind me.  I have dealt with the observations of the Deputies on the Front Bench&mdash;Deputy Blythe, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Hogan. I have dealt with the matter raised by Deputy Anthony.  Deputy Corry has made some charge of delay of a sinister kind against officers, or an officer, of the Civic Guards in regard to the alleged attack on Drinagh Barracks, which formed the subject of a question by Deputy Hogan, of Galway, to-day.  I am aware that you, A Leas-Chinn Comhairle, ruled the observations out of order, but as the observations have been made I claim your indulgence to make a few remarks.  Before Deputy Hogan put the question here, I had read the statement in the newspaper early on the morning on which it appeared.  I at once got into touch, by telephone, with the Commissioner of the Garda.  If Deputy Corry imputes that from that moment there was the slightest delay on the part of any officer of the Garda concerned, he is mistaken.  The officers of the Garda, high and low, who were appealed to by me to assist in obtaining a statement of the facts in regard to what had occurred at Drinagh, acted, in my opinion, with great promptness.  The result of their investigations could not be communicated to this House as early as I would have wished.  Deputies will remember that Deputy Hogan put his question on the 15th March.  At that time, many of us, including Deputy Hogan, thought that the House would sit on the 16th.  It did not sit on the 16th March.  If it had, the information which was communicated to the House to-day would have been communicated then.  Fearing there might be any uneasiness about this matter, I did not await the reassembly of the House, but, through the Press Bureau, I communicated the statement which the House has heard to-day, so that the public might, in a reasonably early time, learn what had occurred.  I want to make perfectly clear that, from the moment the article referred to appeared in the Dublin papers, the Guards concerned acted with alertness <Col N="238" /> and, in my judgment, with a good deal of skill and ability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal further with that.  Deputy Davin may not be aware that his colleague, Deputy Murphy, referred to the matter. Deputy Murphy referred to portion of my answer to-day.  I shall not read the answer in full now.  The part that Deputy Davin and Deputy Murphy have in mind is the concluding sentence: &ldquo;This question appears to have arisen out of a local labour dispute....&rdquo; I do not know how far the objection taken by Deputy Davin and Deputy Murphy to that part of the answer may be due to the need of a definition of &ldquo;labour dispute.&rdquo;  Deputy Anthony asked for definitions of other phrases used here.  If Deputy Davin and Deputy Murphy think that I alleged that a trade union was concerned in the dispute, I certainly did not mean to convey that.  I feel that the words are not fairly capable of that construction, but if anyone here took that meaning out of the words, I wish to make perfectly clear that I have not any fact before me which would justify me in saying that it was a dispute in which a trade union was concerned.  On the contrary, although I have not inquired definitely as to that, every fact I have before me would lead me to think that it was not a dispute in which a trade union was concerned.</P>

      <P>A contradiction of the report appeared in the &ldquo;Examiner,&rdquo; of Cork, a few days ago, in the form of a letter over the signatures of two responsible members of the Labour party in that area.  They contradicted <Col N="239" /> the statement that the matter arose out of a labour dispute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesGeoghehan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not finished my statement.  Deputy Davin and Deputy Anthony are far more quick than I am.  I regret that my power of utterance is not more rapid.  If Deputy Davin had had a moment's patience, I would have dealt with the matter fully, now that it has been raised.  The occurrence, according to the best information at my disposal, arose as the result of the dismissal, several months ago, by the local creamery manager of a workman or carter in that creamery.  His name was Hurley.  There is no harm in mentioning his name, because long before this alleged occurrence there had been proceedings in the District Court against Hurley arising out of this dispute.  An order was made against Hurley.  If Deputy Anthony and Deputy Davin inquire into the matter they will find that the statement made by me is absolutely unchallengable. Since Hurley's dismissal there has been a great deal of ill-feeling. There was a prosecution at which the Guards gave certain evidence months before the last election.  Unfortunately the ill-feeling continued.  There were manifestations of it in various ways.  I am confining myself to a reference to the proceedings in the District Court because that is a matter established now in a court of justice.  I will not refer to the other manifestations that have occurred since, because they have not been the subject of proceedings. But that they have occurred is undoubted. This occurrence, such as it was, in Drinagh was due to them, but the main thing that emerges out of the whole episode and the question put by Deputy Hogan (Galway) is that the statement that the barrack was attacked and bombarded with stones and bricks and that from twenty to thirty men marched in military formation, is unfounded.  That is the big fact that emerges from the question put and from the inquiry into it.</P>

So tired of the statement did Deputy Davin become that he would not allow me to conclude.  Now I will deal with the whole matter.  Deputy Davin gets up and asks if I have any information to show that any labour organisation had anything to do with the occurrence.  I have stated again and again, until even the empty seats are echoing it, that I am not suggesting anything against a trade union or labour organisation, that this was an isolated, wretched and unworthy dispute following the termination of the employment of this man, Hurley, by the creamery manager.</P>

      <P>Very well, I will turn to the Civic Guards.  I have already taken steps substantially to reduce the strength of the Civic Guards.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the Civic Guard force is possibly too large.  The step I have taken is to suspend absolutely recruiting for the time being.  That will necessarily entail a different local organisation of the police.  The suspension of recruiting will inevitably result in the strength of a barrack being reduced from say four to three.  Instead of continuing a barrack with an attenuated strength, that barrack will be closed down and the Guards will be housed in another barrack.  The police will police a somewhat wider area.  Of course that will inevitably result in a substantial reduction in the number of barracks and in a gradual reduction of the strength of the Guards.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made here to a statement made, I think, by Deputy Flynn about detectives who tortured men and so on.  I want to say in this House what I have said repeatedly by letter that if anyone has a charge to make against any member of the Civic Guard let him be specific.  He has abundant excuse for being vague and general because no doubt he reads&mdash; there is very little to read in the country districts&mdash;the speeches made from the benches opposite, the wild, vague charges unsupported by any statement of fact and, taking that as a model of polite letter-writing, he writes me up a letter like this: &ldquo;Oh, the C.I.D. are terrible fellows.  You must get rid of the whole lot of them.&rdquo;  I would implore Deputies on this side of the House not to be infected by the verbosity of which we have had example from the other side of the House to-day, but to be more specific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anyone has any charge to make against a Civic Guard, let him make it, but do not waste time with these generalities.  If any Civic Guard has committed an offence against the code&mdash;it is a well-known code, his own code&mdash;and if there is any question of indiscipline, there is an ordered method of dealing with it.  Let the <Col N="242" /> charge be made.  If any member of the Civic Guard has offended against the law of the land, the courts are there just the same in regard to him as anybody else.  Let them bring him into the courts, but I will treat generalities from this side of the House in the same way as I treated them from the other side.  I want more details.  If there is any member of the Civic Guard who has been guilty of the crime of torture, I would like to get, at the earliest moment, his name and his address so that he can be dealt with in a suitable way.  I propose when I come to the next Vote to state what I have done in regard to the detective branch of the Guard.  I mention that now lest a charge of dodging should be made against me for the fifth or sixth time.  Otherwise, I would have waited until the Vote for the Civic Guard came before this House.</P>

In connection with the Bill, as one of the protagonists of the bacon tariff, I am glad that it has gone even a step further, but I would draw the Minister's attention to the position on the Northern frontier or the only <Col N="243" /> frontier we have got.  There are, of course, pigs purchased on this side of the Border which are taken across the Border to be cured and some of them come back in the form of bacon.  At the present time, on account of the small price at which foreign bacon can be bought, an undue amount is coming across to be sold here.  They are taking advantage of the position and buying cheap Polish, Lithuanian and Swedish bacon in amounts altogether out of proportion to the trade there used to be and the proportion bought and resold in Saorstát territory.  I would ask the Minister to keep his eye on the position so that an undue amount of Northern cured bacon would not be coming in here and replaced in the North by consumption of Lithuanian, Polish and Swedish bacon.</P>

      <P>In this connection I would like to call attention to the fact that Section 3 sub-section (2) remains exactly in the form in which the order was made, and I am taking it that this represents a considered policy on the part of the Government. The sub-section to which I refer says: &ldquo;the duty imposed by this section shall not be charged or levied on any bacon which is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been consigned from a country within the British Commonwealth of Nations and produced entirely in a country or countries within the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo; When the Order was first made, a certain amount of complaint arose in connection with it, mainly centred upon the allegation that the imports of Canadian bacon were of such an amount as if not entirely to destroy the effect of the order, at least to nullify its good effects.  It appears that whether that is true or not, the policy of admitting Canadian bacon free from this tax is going to be persisted in and I call attention to it because, as I say, I am assuming that when we see it appearing in what we presume is a permanent Act, it represents a considered policy on the part of the Government by whom this <Col N="244" /> particular Bill, with this particular section, is being introduced.  I call attention to it also because of the fact that a prominent producer of bacon in the country has raised a certain amount of anxiety in the public mind by statements which he made, to the effect that quite an amount of bacon actually produced in the United States of America was being brought across the frontier and was being brought into this country as Canadian and consequently escaped tax.  That particular statement was countered in the newspapers by a private individual, and, later on, countered by the Canadian Trade Commissioner.  The only apology or withdrawal I saw from the manufacturer who made the original complaint was in reference to a private correspondent, and not at all in reference to what was stated by the Trade Commissioner of Canada in this country.  I am assuming that, inasmuch as this Bill is introduced in a permanent form with this clause incorporated, it represents a considered policy on the part of the Executive, and consequently, we can take it that it also represents their view that the allegations made as to the extent to which the United States of America bacon was coming in, disguised as Canadian bacon, were false.  I welcome the fact that this still remains, because it shows, at any rate, that whatever the Government may be disposed to do on the political side, they recognise the value of the economic association with the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>

      <P>With reference to what Deputy McGilligan has said, the only considered view that the Government want to be taken from this Bill is that they want to be in the position of not having to give back the tax already collected. The Provisional Order was made by the late Government on the second-last day of December, and unless it is confirmed by the Dáil and Seanad, I am told, before the 30th April, the money that was collected as import duty on bacon imported would have to be handed back.  That is the only considered view that can be taken from <Col N="245" /> this Bill&mdash;that we do not want to give back that money.  With regard to bacon coming in over the Northern frontier, as stated by Deputy Gorey, there has been an increase.  As a matter of fact, whereas the import for the first three months of 1931 was 7,600 cwts., the imports this year are 11,900 cwts. But it is certainly not the North of Ireland that has increased its imports so much under this Bill as Canada.  We imported in the first three months of 1931, 123 cwts., and this year we imported 34,500 cwts. Our increase in imports was practically altogether from Canada, with a small increase from Northern Ireland.  The tariff had the effect, it is true, of stopping imports practically completely from the Continent.  Imports from Denmark have gone down from 15,000 cwts. to 2,000 cwts. for the first three months this year as compared with the corresponding period last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The imports from Poland which were 22,000 cwts. for the first three months of last year have gone down this year to 500 cwts., so that the tariff has really been effective so far as keeping out imports against any country against which the tariff was imposed is concerned, but it has had the effect, on the other hand, of replacing Continental imports by imports from Canada and the North of Ireland.  Taking our imports as a whole, they have been reduced considerably during the period of the tariff, as compared with the corresponding period last year, while our exports have remained at the same level, so that as far as this tariff went, it would appear to be effective, but it does not, of course, go so far as to exclude countries like Canada, Northern Ireland or any other country within the British Empire.  The Government must take notice of that position, and I am <Col N="246" /> not in a position, at present, to say what the result may be.  As I said, however, unless this Bill goes through the Dáil and Seanad before the end of next week, we shall be in the unhappy position of having to hand back whatever duty was collected on the bacon during the last three months.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £1,100,365 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1933, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí an Ghárda Síochána (Uimh. 7 de 1925).</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,100,365 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1933, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Gárda Síochána (No. 7 of 1925).</P>
      <P>As regards this Estimate it will be observed by Deputies that it shows a net increase of £73,939 on that of the previous year.  The increase is mainly due to increases under sub-heads A and B and to a decrease in the estimated amount of appropriations-in-aid of the Vote.  If the Supplementary Estimate for 1931-32 be taken into account the net increase is £44,759.  As regards sub-head A&mdash; Salaries, Wages and Pay&mdash;I have some figures here relating, as the analogous figures related in the previous Estimate, to slight discrepancies under this sub-head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly I have some figures as regards sub-head B, and also as regards sub-heads C and D&mdash;subsistence allowances, and locomotion expenses.  Notwithstanding all that was said to me in regard to the previous Estimate, I still think that even a cursory study of the sub-heads by Deputies interested will reveal to them practically everything <Col N="248" /> that I can tell them in the way of reconciliation of these differences and what would appear to be discrepancies. Similarly in regard to sub-head E&mdash;clothing and equipment. I shall have a word to say in regard to that as part of a helpful statement which I propose to make to the House.  As regards furniture, barrack bedding and bedsteads, there is an increase of £1,262 in this sub-head, accounted for in a very routine way, namely, by the necessity of providing for the replacing of an increased number of worn blankets, sheets, bedsteads and so on.  That possibly will be effected by the observations which I propose to make as regards the impending gradual reduction of the strength of the Civic Guard, and the consequent inevitable decrease in the number of Civic Guard stations.  Sub-head H, regarding transport and carriage, and sub-head L, as regards telegrams and telephones, I feel justified in passing over, subject to any observation that I may hear from any Deputy, who speaks on the subject of this Estimate.</P>
    <P>The appropriations-in-aid may also be dealt with by me very shortly. As Deputies will see, the estimated amount to be received as appropriations-in-aid of the Vote shows a decrease of £7,194.  Though relative to the Vote a small figure, that in itself is a fairly substantial figure, and that is my justification for offering a few words by way of explanation of that decrease in the appropriations-in-aid. The automatic reduction of the police rate in Dublin from twopence to one penny in the £ for the coming year, accounts for a fall in the estimated receipts of approximately £6,500. Deputies are aware that there has been going on for some time a gradual, automatic decrease in the police rate in Dublin.  The police rate was originally 8d. in the £.  It is reduced each year by one penny in the £ under the provisions of the Police Forces (Amalgamation) Act, 1925. Needless to say, it will disappear after this year.  This year we are enjoying the last penny of the rate and it will disappear altogether next year. There are some slight changes owing <Col N="249" /> to the Estimates for the sale of cast-off uniforms and so on not being entirely realised, but they are trivial and may be passed over.  What is of substantial importance is this: that the Government hope to effect a saving of over £25,000 on the Estimates, mainly by stopping recruiting.  In answer to some of the inquiries made in connection with the last Estimate, I explained that recruiting had been suspended. As I pointed out at the time, the inquiries made by Deputies would, perhaps, have been more relevant to the present Estimate than to the last.  However, Deputies did make the inquiries and I answered them.  I dealt with this matter of the suspension of recruiting when dealing with the previous Vote and I shall not go over it again, unless, perchance, there was some Deputy interested who was absent when I was concluding the debate on the last Estimate.  If there is and if he will mention the matter, I will again deal with this question of the suspension of recruiting.</P>
    <P>It is also intended, indeed steps have been taken, to reduce the number of men belonging to the Civic Guard in receipt of special allowances for detective work.  These allowances were of a very special character, and we are able to bring them to an end.  Really we are able to refrain from reintroducing them, because that is what it comes to, without in any way detracting from the efficiency of the detective branch of the Civic Guard force.  The intended changes in that respect would, no doubt, interest many Deputies.  What one might refer to as the normal establishment of the detective branch of the Guards is a total of 256.  That is the 1930 figure, I think.  Treating the 1930 figure as a normal figure for the moment, we have 256.  The strength of the detective branch up to a couple of weeks ago was 414.  It is found that there is a surplus of at least 158 in the detective branch, and accordingly 158, or approximately that number&mdash;all these figures, of course, are liable to slight adjustment when being dealt with by the police authorities&mdash;will be placed in uniform.  That is not a very great change, because I should say that the vast majority of them, I would <Col N="250" /> not like to say all of them, have already been uniformed Guards.  They are merely being returned to the ranks that they formerly filled.</P>
    <P>I should say that the economies effected by the reversion of these detective officers to their former positions will roughly amount to between £6,000 and £7,000.  That is, of course, quite a substantial amount.  All that is being done, as I have already stated, without in any way imperilling the police force that is required for the needs of the country.  Probably the number in the detective branch is still too large for the ordinary needs of the country, the ordinary detection of crime, the ordinary duties of detectives.  Some Deputies may, perhaps, think that my pace has not been rapid enough.  I do not propose, unless some pertinent comment or very pertinent question demands it, to go further into that aspect of it.  I am satisfied at the moment on the professional advice at my disposal that 158 members of the detective branch can be put into uniform and used for the ordinary police purposes of the uniformed branch of the Gárda without detriment.  What further economies may be possible in the future, and the very near future, I am not at the moment in a position to indicate with any degree of accuracy. I think I have now dealt with everything of any real importance with regard to this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have practically no criticism to offer on this Estimate. Indeed it does not substantially differ in policy from the policy we had adopted.  The policy of stopping recruiting in the Guards was a policy we had put in force for some considerable time.  It was only when things became very bad last summer that it was necessary to strengthen the &ldquo;S&rdquo; branch by removing uniform men into the &ldquo;S&rdquo; branch, which necessitated the reopening of recruiting.  The passage of the Constitution Amendment Act and the working of it had brought complete peace to the country, and if that state of peace continues then the policy adopted by the Minister is a perfectly sound and correct policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wastage of the Guards as far as <Col N="251" /> my recollection goes is roughly about 200 a year.  The Minister will correct me if that is not the normal wastage and the reduction by that number of Guards can be borne, provided always that the present conditions of peace resulting as I think from the passing of the Constitution Amendment Act, together with the fact that the effect of the repeal of the proclamation putting the Act into practice has not yet shown itself.  The Minister thinks it springs from another cause.  If he finds that he is wrong it will be open to him in the course of the year, to come to the House with a supplementary Estimate for strengthening the force of the Guards and bringing it up to what is adequate for the preservation of the peace of the country.  In consequence I have no criticism to offer upon the Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Minister divided his speech into two parts.  As he himself mentioned in the course of his speech on the last Estimate, he referred to matters which should have been more pertinently discussed upon this Estimate.  I shall just follow his example and deal very shortly with the matter he dealt with at the end of his speech on the last Estimate.  I must thank the Minister very sincerely for the careful and attentive way in which he has been studying my speeches.  He has already told us that he based his speech upon the last Estimate both as to its length and form upon my previous speech. Of course my speeches had been made in different circumstances which he overlooked.  But I am obliged to him for that.  I also see that he has been very carefully studying other speeches of mine, and the statement I made again and again that if anybody had got a grievance against the Guards and wished to bring action against them, the appropriate place to ventilate them was in the courts, and not by making charges in this House.  I am very glad to hear the Minister rebuke a member of his Party for adopting another policy.  I hope the Minister's appeal that people will not make wild and unfounded charges against the Civic Guards will be very carefully observed by every member of his Party.</P>

      <P>There are a few matters I would like to touch upon in connection with this Vote.  I suggest to the Minister that in addition to stopping recruiting he should also start a policy of weeding-out.  We want to see the Civic Guard force a decent force for the preservation of law and order in this country.  I suggest to the Minister that you cannot have that while you have amongst them even one per cent. of undoubtedly black sheep, and black sheep in more senses than one.  Practically every week during the last four years we had Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney making apologies and most extraordinary statements as excuses for the conduct of some of the Guards. We had him for instance suggesting that an unfortunate man who was beaten down the country was kicked by a cow.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should exercise a weeding-out policy in regard to the force.  I also suggest there is a field for enormous economies in view of the present transport facilities available in the country. Unfortunately when the Civic Guard was established, everywhere there had been an old R.I.C. barracks a Civic Guard barracks was established. We have them every three or four miles in rural areas where there is no necessity for them whatever.  In another Estimate there is provided a very large amount of money for the Department of Justice for the building of new Civic Guard stations in the country.  I suggest to the Minister that he should very carefully look into each of these items.  He will find 90 per cent. of them are absolutely unnecessary and a waste of public money. He will also find a very extraordinary condition of affairs in connection with them.  For instance, in one part of my constituency in Ballynoe there is a two-storey house occupied by Civic Guards for the last seven or eight years.  It is a perfectly good house and <Col N="253" /> has every facility that is required. Here in this Estimate we find a sum of £1,800 for building a new barracks. I suggest that that barracks is unnecessary and uncalled for.  There was a move made by the ex-Minister a few years ago to get rid of a lot of those barracks.  The local Unionists in each case had influence enough, apparently, to cause the Minister to withdraw the applications for the closing.  I suggest to the Minister now is the time to get rid of these extra barracks and to effect economies.  There is no occasion for them.  If you have a barracks every seven or eight miles, with the present transport, it is no trouble to the men in the station to travel four miles on either side of them.  We have one barrack in Glounthane, another three miles away in Carrigtohill, and another three miles further in Glanmire. I think every Deputy will admit that economies are necessary, and here economies could be effected.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should go carefully into the proposal for the building of the new barracks with a view to eliminating a greater proportion of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise, on this Estimate, the question of the threatened reduction in the remuneration of the Civic Guards.  I observe from the Estimates that the scale of wages provided for the Guards is the same as last year.  I hope that the new Ministry, through the Minister for Justice, will give us to-night a definite and explicit assurance that they are not going to reduce the wages of the Civic Guards.  Everybody in this House, and every responsible person throughout the country, realises the excellent work which the Gárda Síochána have performed on behalf of the whole community.  We all know their magnificent contribution to bringing about peaceful and stable conditions in this country.  I suggest to the Minister for Justice, and to the new Government, that it is very unwise economy indeed to attack the already low remuneration of the Gárda Síochána, to reduce their standard of living, to pauperise them and to subject them to the temptations which <Col N="254" /> everybody in receipt of low wages is subject to.  I hope that the Minister will be able to give us an assurance, so far as he is personally concerned, that he is opposed to any attack on the already low standard of living of the Civic Guard, and that so far as he is concerned he will do his best to resist any attack on their low standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the plea made by Deputy Norton, the leader of the Labour Party, in so far as it relates to the contemplated cut in the Guards' wages or salaries.  As he has rightly said, they have been instrumental in bringing about a state of law and order in this country, and it would be unwise at this juncture, and for that matter for many years to come, either to reduce very considerably the number of Guards or to reduce their wages or salaries.  We are all aware that a disgruntled or dissatisfied force, whether it be a body of civil servants or a body like the Gárda Síochána, a dissatisfied body of that character, especially men who are entrusted with the preservation of the peace in this country, would be a very dangerous thing indeed, because when they are dissatisfied no great loyalty can be expected from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief reason I stood up was to support Deputy Norton's appeal so far as it related to the wages and salaries of the Gárda Síochána.  Deputy Corry, a moment ago, appealed to the Minister for Justice to weed out certain persons in the Civic Guards or C.I.D. whom he designated as &ldquo;black sheep.&rdquo; I want to know who is to be the judge of the black sheep.  Is it Deputy Corry who is to tell us who are the black sheep, or is it the Minister or the Chief Commissioner of the Police?  If we are going to Americanise our institutions, let us do so right away.  Let every single member of the Gárda Síochána, from the Chief Commissioner down, be dismissed, and let us put in their places the members of this Army that is supposed not to exist.  Will that satisfy Deputy Corry, or those who want to sacrifice the men who have done their duty fearlessly and well throughout a very stormy and stirring <Col N="255" /> period in this country?  If there is anything calculated to cause dissatisfaction or unrest in a police force it is suggestions of that character.  Who knows but that this Government may be supplanted by another Government within the next 12 months; and is it because a member of that force would have done his duty fearlessly and well, throughout the lifetime of this Government, that a new Government should regard him as a black sheep?  Because, boiled down, that is what it amounts to.  To the person in this country who has criminal tendencies every member of the police force is a black sheep.</P>
    <P>Again, it has been suggested here that 90 per cent. of the barracks are not necessary.  So said Deputy Corry. He also said that appeals have been made from time to time to the ex-Minister for Justice to reduce the number of those institutions.  I would ask the ex-Minister for Justice to bear witness to what I say, that when attempts were made to close down barracks prominent members of the Fianna Fáil Party came to him to appeal to him not to close them down.  We cannot close our eyes to the fact that there are isolated hamlets and villages in this country where, were it not for the existence of the Civic Guard barracks, there would be a very strong system of intimidation, not alone in the everyday life of the people, but particularly in times of political excitement.</P>
    <P>I would make this appeal to the Minister, whilst agreeing that economies are necessary, not to have those economies at the expense of the Gárda Síochána.  They are already underpaid. No doubt there are peaceful areas where they have, perhaps, not so much to do as they have to perform in other areas, but perhaps on some other estimate I might indicate to the Minister where good use might be made of the Gárda Síochana.  There are many uses to which their services could be put. We know that there are many dangerous corners where, maybe, because of a certain shortness in the personnel, responsible officers are not able to put men on point duty.  Now that the means of transport has developed so rapidly, we find that there are many <Col N="256" /> serious accidents, and many of these accidents might be obviated if men were on point duty.</P>
    <P>When the Minister revises the whole position he will find that he cannot reduce the Gárda Síochána by any appreciable number.  I would suggest that in any process of reduction he will not have regard to the suggestion made to him now that he should weed out black sheep.  Let us have those words defined.  If there are men in the Gárda Síochána who have brought discredit on the force by any act of theirs, by all means get rid of them.  No Deputy in this House will stand for scoundrelly action of any kind, whether by a uniformed man or otherwise.  I would suggest, when talking in this House, Deputies should have regard to the facts.  We are told that there are 90 per cent. more barracks in this country than are required.  In certain areas there may be barracks every few miles. I hold that reasons have been given for the establishment of these barracks, and if you remove barracks from certain districts you will have very great cause to regret it.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should not pay much regard to the suggestion made to abolish 90 per cent. of the Gárda Síochána barracks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated on this Vote on previous occasions, and now that there has been a change of Government I would like to repeat the statement, that the Gárda forces in this country will always be regarded as a living memorial to the late Minister for Justice who was responsible for their establishment.  They are a credit to the country that gave them birth and they enjoy the confidence of all law-abiding people in the country.  It is very regrettable that during the period the last Government was in office so much of the time of the House was taken up by the foul, lying charges that in most cases were brought against them.  I am glad from this side of the House to be able to congratulate the new Minister for Justice who is going to do the same thing as the ex-Minister for Justice did, to stand up against those charges.  If nobody can substantiate these charges or prove them I <Col N="257" /> feel confident that the Minister will not hesitate to say so.  Deputy Corry is very anxious to reduce the number of Guards and stations.  I hope the Minister will take serious notice of the possibility that it might be a very expensive matter for this country if the number of Guards were reduced.  The money that is voted for the Guards here is an insurance that law and order will be continued in this country.  I am saying that at a period when we all know that the conditions of the country are difficult and when economies are necessary.  I repeat that economies by reducing that great force would be very false and foolish.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Norton and Deputy Anthony in the plea that there should be no reduction in the pay of the Guards because they were given a guarantee in this House that the last word had been said previously in connection with their position.  A large number of them are men of ability and standing who could find much better positions and obtain very much more remuneration than they are getting to-day. I congratulate the Minister on his statement that he is not going to allow the men who are sitting beside him who have come along and calumniated the Guards here during the life-time of the late Government to continue to do so.</P>

      <P>Ninety per cent. of the charges were foul lies because these Deputies do not like the Guards.  The Minister has made a fair statement and I think every member of the House will stand behind him in seeing that law and order will be enforced in this country.  There can be no hope for the future prosperity of the country or for the better times that we all look forward to unless law and order are enforced impartially and fairly.  I congratulate the Minister on standing up against the people who want to take the law into their own hands.  Whatever policy is going to be adopted, let it be done in this House, and I hope the Minister will stand up against the intimidation and the threats which were in evidence during the last election and which appear to be growing <Col N="258" /> again.  I believe from the statement the Minister made to-day he will stand up against them.  If he does he will get the support of all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>Whilst I have every sympathy with every effort made by the Minister to economise, I think he should be very careful before he reduces the strength of a body of men who compare very favourably with the other police force that had been in this country previously.  I think we would be taking a wrong step also in curtailing the present number of barracks.  I would like to point out to the Minister that rural areas at night time are exposed to elements which might not perhaps have very much regard for the rights of property.  These men are guarding our property at times when we are not present ourselves, and I think it would be a most unwise and retrograde step if they were reduced in numbers.  There has already been a number of reductions in Civic Guard barracks.  A barrack at Ballymacoda has been done away with, and I believe a number of other reductions have been carried out by the ex-Minister for Justice. We must bear in mind that the Guards' duties are greatly increased as compared with the duties carried out by the police force previously in this country.  They have also duties that may not be known to the man in the street, and they are carrying them out efficiently and well.  They are carrying out unpleasant duties, perhaps, with all the tact and discretion that an educated and thoroughly moral body of men are capable of.  I for one have no hesitation in giving the highest meed of praise to a body of men to whom we look for protection and the safety of our property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to associate myself with the remarks passed by Deputy Anthony in relation to the remarks previously passed by Deputy Corry on this Vote.  The statements <Col N="259" /> that Deputy Corry made with regard to the percentage of barracks, old or new, that could be done without, or the vast field of economy opened up by tremendous reductions in the personnel of the Civic Guard, are as remote from fact as his remarks about black sheep are remote from decency or remote from any sort of proper understanding of what a reasoned administration would require.  They are so remote from fact and from decency that one can only conjecture as to why Deputy Corry must always walk this line.  I suggest that it is for the reason that he is not himself devoid of personal experience of what the operation of weeding out in connection with a police force is.  The Civic Guard deserve all the commendation that has been passed about them from time to time.  There is an old lilt &ldquo;constabulary duty's to be done, to be done, a policeman's life is not a happy one.&rdquo; When I introduce the phrase &ldquo;to be done,&rdquo; it is not to imply any option on the part of the police when work has to be done.  It is obligatory.  I go on to make the point that the police force find it possible to do unpleasant duties pleasantly and dangerous duties courageously, if they are called upon to act in either of these ways.</P>
      <P>It is to be hoped that the political propaganda that used to be carried on against this force, propaganda which the back benchers who support the present Government thought it was good politics to carry on, will now be dropped.  Let us at any rate recognise as one of the advantages that we have got that those people who used to feel it incumbent on them to make Party capital out of attacks upon a State force, as if they were really attacking a Party force, will now cease those attacks and will not feel themselves under an obligation to indulge in misrepresentations of the vile type that used to be indulged in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With that I will leave the Gárda Síochána problem.  A question was asked to-day with regard to the reestablishment of a bottle factory at Ringsend.  From the answer that was <Col N="260" /> given I inferred that it is still the policy of the Government to keep alive a particular industry.  There is a second side to that industry&mdash;a second method of protection was given to that industry arising out of an Order made called the Standard Bottles Order which falls to be administered&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Standard Bottles Order falls to be administered by the police and comes under this Estimate.  We have had reference to certain receipts which are got in from the stamping of the bottles.  I want to ask the Minister for Justice if I am right in assuming that it is still the policy of the Government to continue this secondary method of protection for this industry, and if he will tell me if any approaches have been made to him with regard to the fees that are charged by the police appointed to this duty, and if he is aware of the complaints that are made on this matter by the Bottlers' Association as to the very heavy burden they find themselves charged with, and if the Minister could tell me, further, what number of sergeants of the Gárda Síochána have been trained for this work; what number are at present occupied upon it; what is supposed to be the cost to the State of the work they do in connection with this particular operation, what fees come into them; and how are these receipts disbursed.  After telling me that will he then add whether or not he has any policy on the matter to which I have previously referred, that is to say the reduction in the fees, a burden which is very definitely complained of by the bottlers at the moment.</P>

      <P>I just rise to refer to a few remarks made by Deputy McGilligan.  In his usual manner the Deputy tries to twist around from the back of our benches to the front certain remarks as being the policy of a Party or the policy of the Government. I want to repudiate emphatically that the Fianna Fáil Party as an Opposition ever attacked the Gárda Síochána as such.  They always indicated <Col N="261" /> that there was a political arm of that force which was being developed under circumstances that existed then, and to which they had great objection. If Deputy McGilligan would take the trouble to read the speeches made on these occasions&mdash;he was very rarely in the House&mdash;he would find that the uniformed force was always dissociated from any attacks made on the political arm of that force.  Deputy McGilligan might read his own speeches because he has indulged now in criticism which was indulged in by this Party when it was on the other side of the House. The Deputy always referred to this criticism as the class of stuff which was fit for political speeches at street corners.  I am glad that he himself finds now that he has to indulge in the same class of criticism when he is in opposition.</P>

      <P>In reference to the Gárda Síochána and to the attacks <Col N="262" /> made on them by the Fianna Fáil Benches I would like to remind Deputy Briscoe that not only were they attacked because of political motives but I remember occasions in this House when Fianna Fáil Deputies attacked the Gárda on other grounds.  I remember, on one occasion, a body of Gárda visited our Holy Father in Rome. About 300 members of the Gárda Síochána with their officers went to pay their respects to the Holy Father. They were attacked in this way&mdash;that they took time which they were not entitled to take; that they were there at a time when they should be on duty. In addition to that the charge was made that the funds used were the funds borrowed from the Widows and Orphans' Fund.  I would like to remind Deputy Briscoe of attacks of that kind.  There was not any political bias in that. That attack was made only out of pure enmity, and because the Fianna Fáil Party could not say a good word for the Gárda Síochána.  Now I am pleased to see a different outlook. Like other Deputies I would like to co-operate with the Gárda in helping to maintain law and order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Jordan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to pay my contribution to the Gárda Síochána on this Estimate.  I do not agree altogether with Deputy Anthony as to adopting American methods, scrapping the whole force and starting anew.  I do not think that is essential.  That is what Deputy Anthony said, I believe, despite what the Minister has stated, that it would be a very good job for the peace of this country, and it would <Col N="263" /> be a thing that a lot of people expect, particularly in view of the action of the political arm of the Gárda Síochána, prior to, and during the last election, if the C.I.D. were scrapped.  Some of us have a distinct recollection of the way these people discharged their duties.  They are now 158 over strength, numbering 400 odd, and it is proposed that these gentlemen should be put back into the uniformed force again.  Although I am now on the side of the Government, I still hold the same views that I held, when I was over there, in regard to some of these gentlemen, and I consider that it is very poor consolation for the people of this island, in view of the way some of them were treated by C.I.D. men.</P>
      <P>They deserve something else, instead of being put back into the uniformed force, and given a clean sheet, for some of the actions they committed when in the C.I.D. Some of us will be sadly disappointed if that is the way they are going to be treated.  We told the electorate that these people would be treated not in that fashion but that it was expected they would be disbanded because they were not a credit to the country.  I hold, with others, that the uniformed Gárda Síochána in the main were and are a credit to this country.  I never said anything else about them even when I was in opposition to the late Government.  They are as creditable a force as any country could expect to have.  I repeat that the C.I.D. as they were constituted and as they acted prior to and during the last election were not creditable to the country and the uniformed Gárda were ashamed to be seen in the same town with some of the C.I.D., because of the way they acted towards some of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If these men are going to be left in the force, I, and I am voicing the opinions of a good many of the electors, am sadly disappointed.  They do not deserve to be left in the force.  They should be disbanded, and they should never be given any employment in this country.  The country could do well without them.  When the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, at the election, by way of a sop for the people, said they <Col N="264" /> were going to effect economies, and they intended to start at the Civic Guards, some of our people had the pluck to say that it was not there economies should be effected.  They pointed out that when the people enjoying bigger salaries had been dealt with, it would be then time enough to reduce the pay of the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I hope the Department will not entertain the idea of reducing the pay of the ordinary Gárda until economies are effected amongst the higher paid officials.  After some time, when the economies we hope to effect will take place, and when the cost of living will be lower, automatically the pay of the Gárda can be reduced, but until such time as that occurs and I do not care what capital may be made out of it, I would not stand for a reduction in the pay of the ordinary Gárda.  It is not fair to the people of the country, considering the way certain members of the C.I.D. have acted, that those men should now be left in the force.  Their services should be dispensed with, because the people do not want them.</P>

I think the Deputy must have had something even stronger than blackguardism in his mind when he said that not only should those men be driven out of the force but out of Ireland. The Deputy said that not only should they not get any employment in the force but they should not get any employment in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will pay no attention to those appeals <Col N="265" /> for victimisation of members of the uniformed or ununiformed branches of the Gárda Síochána unless the Deputies making charges are prepared to put evidence before him which will show that members of the force have been guilty of misconduct to such an extent as would warrant dismissal from the force.  If Deputy Jordan, Deputy Corry or any member of the public can bring before the Minister evidence which will satisfy him that any member of the force has so misconducted himself as to be unfit to remain in it, I say he should be dismissed immediately.  I think it is unfair that charges should be hurled in this general way against members of a police force whom we all know had to carry out their duties under very unfavourable conditions, to say the least of it.  I wonder if those demands which are being made for the weeding out of the black sheep, as they are called, has any relation to the expectations of many of the followers and supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party that when the Party came into power most of the force would be disbanded and they would get their positions?</P>

      <P>It is well known in every village or parish in the Free State.  I hope those demands have no relation to those expectations.  I am satisfied that many Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches are in a rather uncomfortable position now, and they have to put the best face they can on the fact that the Gárda Síochána has not been disbanded and a new force has not been set up. I think it is known to most Deputies that many of the young supporters and workers in the interests of Fianna Fáil were hoping that some day they would be rewarded for their labours, and I am sure they were perfectly satisfied in their own minds that they could perform police duties in a manner that would not incur the displeasure of either Deputies Corry or Jordan.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry has stated that in addition to the suspension of recruiting, a process which he describes as weeding out would be very desirable in the Gárda Síochána. Deputy Jordan has, I think, almost entirely associated himself with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Corry.</P>
      <P>I have repeated myself very often to-day.  May I repeat again that if there is any member of the Civic Guard force of any branch against whom any Deputy or any citizen has any charge to make, whether it be a charge of breach of the disciplinary code of the Guards or of the ordinary law of the land, not merely will I welcome it but I invite details of it. Deputy Corry and Deputy Jordan spoke as if one could deal with these complaints not singly but in battalions. I think a little reflection will convince both Deputy Corry and Deputy Jordan that one cannot deal in a wholesale fashion with charges of this kind. Deputy Jordan feels that it would be a good thing if what he calls the entire C.I.D. force were disbanded.  If I had the power, I think I would have no hesitation in allowing Deputy Jordan to deal with the matter himself.  I feel that once he thought about it for a while Deputy Jordan would realise the fundamental injustice of dealing with a body of men, not by name, not by designation, but in a group in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will endeavour here to make clear what my view is in regard to the matter.  It is this, that every single member of the Civic Guard, no matter to what branch he belongs, is entitled to stand apart.  He is entitled, if a complaint is made against him, to have <Col N="267" /> that complaint, more or less, precisely formulated.  He is entitled to have it established.  Deputies may get it into their heads now that I came here with all sorts of cast-iron ideas about administration of justice and so on, and that all this is highly technical. Let them not take that view of it.  It is ordinary fundamental justice that a precise charge should be made against the man, that he should have some opportunity of answering it, and that it should be supported by evidence.  If there is reasonable proof that within a reasonable time any member of the Guards has done anything that is disgraceful or discreditable I would like to receive that proof.  I will not apply to it the absolute strict rigour of the law of evidence, provided that it would carry conviction to the mind of an ordinary reasonable man, careful in the examination of testimony.  I will seriously consider that, but I will not seriously consider a suggestion that a group of men should be dealt with in a nameless fashion, and in a wholesale fashion, such as Deputy Jordan's unconsidered words might lead one to think he seriously advocated.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Corry that the improvement in modern conditions of transport has rendered feasible a reduction in the number of Civic Guard stations.  During the six weeks that have intervened, certain stations have been closed and the closing of other stations is being considered.  It is a troublesome matter to deal with.  If it is to be dealt with properly, it has to be done very slowly.  At first sight, one is attracted by the idea of having a barracks or station every seven or eight miles&mdash;take any distance you like.  It seems easy to get a map and compass and proceed to deal with it. Really you cannot deal with it in that easy fashion.  There may be something in the configuration of the countryside, there may be a range of mountains, a stream or something like that, and consequently it is necessary carefully to consider the position of every single barracks before you can proceed with any scheme to reduce the number of stations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> I have stated that I welcome any definite accusation, supported by reasonable proof, against any member of the Civic Guard for any offence alleged against him.  May I say that I also welcome any suggestion from any Deputy, no matter where he sits in this House, in regard to the proposed closing of a Civic Guard station.  I would like to hear any reasons he can advance why it could be closed. Deputies can assist very much in that connection by telling me of local conditions of which I could not possibly be otherwise aware.  Similarly I am not wedded to any percentage reduction of Civic Guard stations.  The only test I propose to apply is the test of efficiency and the needs of the country.  Consequently I will equally welcome any reasoned argument for the retention of any Civic Guard barracks that any Deputy feels is likely to be closed down.  Deputies can assist me from both directions if they are so minded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton has asked me to give an assurance that the Government will not reduce the pay of the Civic Guards. Several other Deputies have echoed that request.  I think Deputy Norton stated that all he expected was my personal view as to the Civic Guard pay.  All I can say in regard to that is that the present state of my mind is that the pay is reasonable.  But I am not vain enough to think that I am fully informed in regard to the matter. I may have to consider various facts of which I am at present unaware. I have not yet approached this matter as to the adequacy or inadequacy of the pay of the Civic Guards.  So far as my general knowledge goes, I have the feeling which I have already stated.  But this matter has not been approached at all, and the only promise I can give is that I will do everything in my power to see that the Civic Guards are treated reasonably and fairly in regard to their pay. I think I can speak for all my colleagues in the same phrase.  Of course it may be said that that is not quite definite.  I quite agree with that but I am not in a position at the present time to say definitely that the pay of <Col N="269" /> the Civic Guards will not be reduced. I have no reason to think it will. Further than that I cannot go.  Deputy Anthony spoke about other uses being found for the Guards.  That is something that has occurred to me as a justification for a certain strength of the Guards which might seem to be out of proportion to the population and the needs of the country and a justification for a particular standard of pay. There are various other purposes that the Guards could fulfil.  I have not given the matter enough consideration to feel justified at the moment in stating certain other duties that the Guards might possibly perform, and perhaps enable a standard of pay and a standard of numbers to be maintained. All I can say is that when I come to make these suggestions I hope Deputy Anthony will consider them without any prejudices or any class views, that he will consider them on their merits.  Possibly the reduction of the strength of the Guards may have an effect on the Guards' pay.  We will pay them as much as we can reasonably afford.  Everyone agrees with the most eulogistic statement made here to-day about the services of the Guards. I suppose if we had a much smaller force we would be able to pay them more.  We think that, even as things are at present, the force can be reduced. We know that there is comparatively little danger to property in this country.  Everyone who has had experience of the trial of any case, even remotely concerning property, by a jury of small or medium-sized farmers at a court of quarter sessions, or in the Circuit Court, knows the ease with which a verdict of guilty is brought in, and realises that the whole sentiment of the small farmers is in favour of the protection of property.  There is very little danger in that connection.  A good deal could be done to help towards the reduction of the number of Guards if responsible people inside this House, and outside it&mdash;speakers and writers&mdash;would carefully weigh their words before they would say or write anything calculated to make the flesh of people creep.  So long as you have the hair of people standing on end, or their flesh made creep, by <Col N="270" /> reason of speeches of a bogey nature, there may be need for maintaining a larger number of Guards.  Similarly, the reduction of the number of Guards would be greatly helped if there was an elimination of personal bitterness simply because people differ politically. We have had an example of that in this House.  We have that repeated all over the country.  Deputy McGilligan, simply because he differs in politics from Deputy Corry, indulges in the most vile personal abuse of Deputy Corry, even in this House.  You have that reflected all through the country. You have ill-feeling engendered and perpetuated by speeches of the type we have just listened to from Deputy McGilligan.  If you drop that sort of thing and refrain from personal abuse and vituperation, because of political differences, it will help to justify a reduction of the Gárda force.  I think I have gone through every point that was raised except one matter referred to by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney himself, by Deputy Shaw, and, I think, by some other Deputy.  Two of the Deputies, particularly, heartily congratulated me on modelling myself upon the late Minister for Justice.  I would ask Deputies opposite not to ruin me by making speeches of that sort, because if I were to model myself, without reserve, on Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, I feel that I would be heading for disaster.  I try to free myself from prejudices, and in certain respects I shall be glad to imitate Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney&mdash;where I think he was right.  I felt that he was quite right last year in the manner in which he introduced the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Justice.  I modelled myself upon him in that respect, but for so doing I have been savaged and butchered by Deputies on the front and back benches opposite.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan inquired&mdash;I hope the Deputy will tell me if I have got the inquiry rightly&mdash;if I had received any complaint about the fees payable for stamping bottles.  Personally, I have not received any complaints, and I was not aware of the existence of any such feeling as that to which he referred.  I received no complaints since I came into office on the 9th March.  In the few minutes that have intervened since the Deputy spoke, I have made as full inquiry as I could from my Department and I find that, at all events, since the 9th March, and for quite a long time, indeed, no such complaint has been made to my Department.</P>

Accordingly, I wish to tell the House that, so far as I am personally aware, nothing of the kind to which Deputy McGilligan has referred has occurred.  I have added that in the very short interval which has occurred I have made hurried inquiry from my Department and, apparently, I can give the same answer for the Department.  What Deputy McGilligan has inquired about lends itself, I think, to inquiry by letter or memorandum.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan Mr. P. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Galway): I think I am in order in raising on this Vote a certain matter which is possibly within the knowledge of Deputies.  The Minister will remember, I think, that a prisoner named Cornelius Healy was released from Maryboro', where he was doing a long term for shooting with intent.  He was released, immediately after the Government had been nominated in this House, as a political prisoner&mdash;as a Republican prisoner. Well, some time recently in West Cork &mdash;I should have said in Cork&mdash;a certain man was very grievously assaulted. He spent three months in the infirmary. The State prosecuted a man called Spillane.  Spillane got four months.  He appealed against that sentence.  The sentence was confirmed, with this modification, that to the four months was added &ldquo;hard labour.&rdquo;  He served the four months with hard labour.  Afterwards, the man who was injured took a civil action for damages for £100.  When the action came up for hearing Mr. Healy was in court. I am stating what I have ascertained are the facts.  Healy was in court, sitting next to the defendant, while the action was at hearing.  In the course of the hearing some interruptions occurred in court for which Healy was, rightly or wrongly, blamed.  Anyway, on being removed from court he stood up and, turning to the jury, said, &ldquo;I am a pal of Spillane's.&rdquo;  The proceedings terminated, and the judge, when charging the jury, suggested that the full damages should be given, but instead there were damages given for £24.  It was proved in court that the costs of the infirmary were about £20, and that the doctor's fees were something like £30.  Yet the verdict, in spite of the judge's charge, was for £24.  The Minister for Justice is a member of the Senior Bar and knows perfectly well the implications of a statement of that sort.  I am aware that a letter appeared in the papers from Healy stating that he did not make the original interruption, but there is no contradiction and there cannot be any contradiction of this: <Col N="274" /> that when he was being removed from court, rightly or wrongly, he turned to the jury and told them&mdash;this gentleman who was recently released from Maryboro' as a political prisoner&mdash;&ldquo;I am a pal of Spillane's.&rdquo;  I do not think I need make any comment on that because, as I say, the Minister for Justice is a member of the Senior Bar and is at least as well able as I am&mdash;he has had much more experience of legal procedure&mdash;to sum up the effect of a statement of that sort in the circumstances. I merely recite those facts as showing the sort of prisoners that were released by the Minister as political prisoners.</P>

      <P>With your permission, and with the gracious permission of Deputy Hogan, I will be eventually allowed to deal with the matter also. I have said that the relevancy was rather tenuous, because I desired to provide some sort of extenuating circumstances for the very flimsy nature of my contribution in reference to it.  My knowledge is very slight.  It has been derived entirely during the last few minutes.  I did not even read of this occurrence in the newspapers, but, as I understand it, and I think Deputy O'Neill's speech confirms what I said, Healy made, or was alleged to have made, some disturbance in court.  He was at once brought before the presiding judge to be dealt with for contempt of court.  I understand that the Circuit Judge judicially considered this whole matter and came to certain conclusions. I understand that his final decision was to acquit or release&mdash;use whatever words you like&mdash;Healy.  If that is so, I am rather in doubt as to how far it is proper for me to say anything at all in the matter.  The matter has apparently been dealt with by a judge of competent jurisdiction, and in so far as I may deal with it, I hope Deputy Hogan, with his very large experience, will not suggest that every wrong verdict, whether given by a jury, or by a judge, is to be a matter for <Col N="276" /> which I must stand up and answer. The administration to which Deputy Hogan belonged, of which he was a Minister, is responsible for the statute which enabled this jury in East Cork or West Cork or wherever it was, to try this case and bring in this verdict. The Deputy, with his colleagues, is responsible for the statute which gives the right of appeal.</P>

      <P>The action was tried by a jury, pursuant to the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  The statute set up a method of trying the action.  The jury may have gone wrong or they may have gone right&mdash;I do not know.  The percentage of verdicts of juries open to criticism may, perhaps, be comparatively large&mdash;I do not know, but it seems to me that we cannot advance matters much further by discussing here in the House, the rights or wrongs of a verdict of at least nine members of a jury of twelve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is dodging the point.  I have to use the word &ldquo;dodge.&rdquo;  He has dodged the point. Whether the jury did justice or not is a minor point.  I am raising this question and I am putting it to the Minister that whatever may have been the effect of this entirely illegal and intimidatory action of this man, this was the sort of man who was released as a Republican prisoner. The judge has no responsibility for that, or the jury, but the Minister has, and I wish to draw the attention of the Dáil to the subsequent action of this person who was released as a Republican prisoner.</P>

Unless you kept him in jail for life, what guarantee is there that he will not be guilty of some unseemly act, if you let him out?  Any prisoner, on the expiration of his sentence, or on remission of his <Col N="277" /> sentence, may do something reprehensible like that, but if he does, there is available for him the same court that is available for the Civic Guards.  If he trespasses criminally, let him be dealt with as a criminal.  If he trespasses civilly, let him be sued.  That is the way to deal with Con Healy or anybody else who outsteps the law in any way.  I fail to see, as I said before, how we can get it any further in this House, and if the making of that statement is dodging, I am afraid I have a double dose of original sin.</P>

      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that steps should be taken forthwith by the Executive Council to provide work or maintenance to meet the immediate needs of the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like that the House would take note that I am asking in the motion that the Executive Council should take steps forthwith to deal with the immediate needs of the unemployed. I am sure that I shall be told of the many schemes which the Government have on hands for dealing with this problem.  I have no doubt that the Government have many schemes, and are still dealing with or examining schemes which they hope will have a bearing upon this problem.  But I want to remind Deputies, if it is necessary to remind them, that we have to-day in this country, so far as we know, anything from 80,000 to 100,000 unemployed. The figures circulated recently of the census taken in 1926 show that there were then almost 80,000 unemployed and that, with their dependents, the number of people affected is something like 150,000.  I do not think that any Deputy will fail to agree with me when I say that the position, so far as the unemployed are concerned, is much worse to-day than it was when that census was taken.  Speaking for my own constituency, I have no hesitation in saying, and I am sorry to have to say it, that conditions are infinitely worse to-day than they have been at any time during the last ten or twelve years.  I know that in my constituency there are unfortunately more people compelled to apply for outdoor relief or home assistance than ever before. Only in this morning's paper appeared a report from the Superintendent of Home Assistance for the administrative county of South Tipperary that the <Col N="280" /> total expenditure for March of this year was £1,512 for South Tipperary and for the half year £9,144, this being £927 more than for the half year ending March, 1931, due, he states, to an increase in unemployment.  During the half year ending March, 1931, 211 cases required assistance owing to unemployment, and during the half year ending March, 1932, 361 cases.  I just give that as an indication of the position in Tipperary to-day.  I think we may take it that if conditions such as these obtain in a county like Tipperary they must be considerably worse in many other counties and must be very much worse in cities like Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
    <P>I know that this problem of unemployment cannot be solved by this Government or any Government within a few months&mdash;I mean we are not going to find a permanent solution of the problem&mdash;but I do say that the unemployed of this country have been led to expect more from the present Government than from the Government which they have replaced.  We know that the President and other members of the Executive Council and Fianna Fáil candidates generally told us during the general election that this was one of the most serious, if not the most serious, problem which would have to be faced after the election.  We know that the President and his Ministry when in opposition told us that this problem could be solved and would be solved if they were in power.  We know that on many occasions the President, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and other members of the present Government told us that if this country were being run as a Christian country this state of affairs would not be allowed to continue.  We know that we were told that there was no country in the world where the unemployment problem could be more easily or quickly solved.  But, unfortunately, so far as the unemployed of this country, so far as those who in many cases are nearly hungry, so far as those who are forced to live on charity and beg for home assistance are concerned, the present Government are more concerned with other things <Col N="281" /> which in their opinion and in my opinion are not so important.  I submit to the President and to the Executive Council that if there was one mandate which they got clearly from the electorate at the last election it was that they should tackle this problem immediately to the exclusion of any and every other problem.</P>

      <P>To the exclusion of any and every other problem.  I submit to the Ministry that it is more important that this should be tackled immediately than either the Oath or the land annuities.  People who are paying land annuities will not be hungry unless they are too lazy to grow enough to feed themselves, but the unfortunate 150,000 or 200,000, between the unemployed and those dependent on them, have no annuities to pay, and in many cases have no rents to pay because they have neither land nor houses.  I do not know whether it is necessary for me to elaborate this very much.  I would not have been one bit surprised if it had been intimated to me that the President was accepting this motion. I know that if this motion had been put by me or any other Deputy on the Order Paper three months ago every member of the Fianna Fáil Party would have voted for it.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I do not know whether I should waste the time of the House replying to the Minister for Finance, but I would say this, that on most occasions on which a motion dealing with unemployment has been put down in this House, I was asked by the Labour Party, of which I was then a member, to sponsor that motion.  The Minister can take <Col N="282" /> it from me that this motion would have gone on the Order Paper in my name no matter what Government was in power.  That is not the point. The Minister, short as he is in his position, has picked up a few of the tricks of the trade, if I might say so, and when I put a statement which was not very acceptable to him he tried to put me off the track by asking me a question.  I want to repeat, in case the Minister did not hear me clearly the first time, that if I had put this motion on the paper three months ago the Minister and his colleagues would have voted for it.  Will the Minister say that he would not have voted for it three months ago?</P>

      <P>At the moment I am dealing with Ministers only.  But I want to emphasise the real point of this motion and that is that we have to-day&mdash;and I do not think my figures will be challenged even by the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;at least 80,000 unemployed; that the majority of that 80,000 is dependent upon charity; and that a small minority of them are entitled to and are receiving unemployment benefit.  I believe the Minister will agree with that, but the point I want to get at is this: what are the Government proposing to do for the immediate needs of the unemployed pending their schemes coming to fruition, if they ever do?  I hope they do.  I want to make this point, and I am sorry to have to make it.  Speaking now for my own constituency, as far as I know there is more unemployment and poverty, and more people were compelled to look for charity in Tipperary to-day than ever before in my knowledge. I think some of the representatives for Tipperary in the <Col N="283" /> Minister's own Party will agree with that statement.  I put it to the House that it is the duty of the Government to carry out as far as they can the promises they have made.  It is their duty to come as quickly as they can to the relief of the unemployed.  I want to emphasise this before I sit down, and I put it to the President: That this matter is of more importance to the unemployed, to the citizens and to the nation, much more than either the Oath or the annuities.  I put it to the President it is his duty to give all the time of both himself and his Ministers, if necessary, to the exclusion of everything else, to dealing with this problem and dealing with it immediately.</P>

      <P>When I learned that Deputy Morrissey proposed to move this motion in the Dáil to-day I was curious to know the reasons that prompted him to do so.  I was doubtful in my own mind as to whether Deputy Morrissey was really concerned in getting from the Dáil a declaration of acceptance of the principle embodied in this motion, or whether the desire was merely to score some points against the Government. I am still in some doubt as to what exactly he had in view.  There is a big principle embodied in this motion, and the Dáil must not be asked to accept that principle on purely debating points.  I submit to the House that Deputy Morrissey has not said one single word in the whole of his remarks in support of the principle of this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another point. The point we are faced with now is we are asking the Dáil to consider a motion embodying a big social principle, not asking for a declaration of what the Government is going to do <Col N="284" /> immediately for the relief of unemployment or discussing the relative merits of the unemployment problem in relation to other problems, and I suggest that Deputy Morrissey would have been serving the interests of his constituents, and of unemployment, much more usefully by confining his remarks to the motion he has tabled.  On the question of the relative importance of the unemployment problem let us spend a few moments.  I do not know if Deputy Morrissey thinks of the problems of this country as being in water-tight compartments, having no relation one to the other, so that the Government can ignore one, concentrate on another, and pass again to a third.  If that is his view it is a shortsighted view and a very ill-informed view, if I may say so.</P>

      <P>I do not think at any time in this Dáil, any member, no matter how inexperienced, ever argued before that it was possible to solve the problem of unemployment without producing reactions upon every other problem in the country.  And I say this, and I say it deliberately, that one of the essential steps that must be taken for the solution of the problem of unemployment is the removal of the Oath in so far as it is necessary to secure political stability here, and the retention of the Land Annuities.  I say that anybody who pretends, or who tries to make other people believe, that it is impossible to effect substantial permanent improvement in our economic conditions, while at the same time continuing the exhausting payment to Britain which the Land Annuities represent, is only endeavouring to fool the unfortunate unemployed who are dragged into the debate.  We are proposing to deal with unemployment and we are proposing to deal with these other problems because they are related to the problem of unemployment. I say to Deputy Morrissey and to Deputy Anthony and to the Dáil, that if they can show one single thing that would ease the lot of a single unemployed man which the Government could have done and have not <Col N="285" /> done or are not doing, then there is substance in their complaint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seemed to anticipate that we would have some difficulty in accepting this motion.  He said that if the motion was moved three months ago we would have voted for it.  We have not changed our policy or outlook on social problems overnight, and so far as the principle in the motion is the principle that we stood for at the general election, the principle we were elected to implement, we are accepting it.  Let us examine what it is.  The Dáil is asked to state its opinion that steps should be taken forthwith by the Executive Council to provide work or maintenance to meet the immediate needs of the unemployed.</P>
      <P>The members of this Government have always taken the view that if the system of industrial organisation, which the State permits to operate, and protects in its operation, is not capable of providing opportunities for work, for all who are able to work, then provision out of the general resources must be made for those who, in consequence of their inability to find work, are unable to provide for themselves.  In modern conditions, in fact, since the creation of the world, it has always been the rule that people provided for their necessities by working for them.  &ldquo;In the sweat of their brow did they eat bread.&rdquo;  If that is to continue, if people are to be enabled to provide for themselves and their dependents only by being given the opportunity to work, then, undoubtedly, we accept it, as a direct obligation on the Government, to see that work is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey has spoken about the gravity of the unemployment problem.  It is, perhaps, useful that we should have this opportunity of informing the general public exactly how grave the unemployment problem is, because it is only when all classes realise its exact dimensions that we will be able to get the necessary wholehearted co-operation from them in the successful operation of the plans <Col N="286" /> devised to deal with it.  In the past there was, rightly or wrongly, some tendency to represent the problem as being of smaller magnitude than some of us, in fact, believed it to be.  We have got to change that outlook.  I do not say that any useful purpose would be served by exaggerating the problem, but it is important that we should have an exact and true idea of its size so that we will know exactly what is to be done in order to solve it.</P>
    <P>For a number of years the numbers of persons registered as unemployed at the Labour Exchanges hovered round 20,000.  We never accepted that number as representing the total volume of unemployed, but we did accept it in its fluctuations as an index to the volume of unemployment.  If the number of registered unemployed increased, we could assume that the total number of unemployed increased. Similarly, if the registered number of unemployed diminished, we could assume that there was some diminution in the total number of unemployed. There has been a very substantial increase in the number of registered unemployed.  It is now approximately 31,000.  It may be that that figure is not entirely comparable with the earlier figures, because the Department of Industry and Commerce and I, personally, have been endeavouring to induce all unemployed to register at the Exchanges.  I have met deputations from labour unions and in public speech and in various Press announcements, I have endeavoured to impress on the unemployed the advantage it would be if they registered at the Exchanges.  I would like to take this opportunity to repeat what I have already said in this matter, that if we get all the unemployed registered at the Exchanges we will not merely have an accurate picture of our problem, but it will also enable us to make a more systematic attempt to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The motion, however, asks us to do two things in relation to these unemployed, to provide them with work or with maintenance.  Let us take the question of maintenance first.  To some extent, the principle that persons who are unable to provide for themselves should be provided for by the State is <Col N="287" /> accepted, and has been always accepted here during the lifetime of this State.  Provision has been made for them, one way or another, by a system of Unemployment Insurance Acts, Old Age Pension Acts, by relief grants under the poor law and otherwise. The questions we have to consider, therefore, are not so much whether a new principle is to be brought into operation, as to whether the existing methods of giving effect to that principle are efficient, in all the circumstances existing, and whether the provision made is adequate.</P>
    <P>There is, undoubtedly, a strong case to be made for the revision of the machinery by which relief of one kind or another is administered.  Various aspects of that question are at present being considered in the different Government Departments.  It is obvious, however, that that examination must take some time, and the preparation of legislation to give effect to any conclusions arrived at will take still further time.  I, for one, do not think it wise that we should delay patching up an existing system while waiting for a better one.  There is an old proverb that the best is the enemy of the good, and while we are waiting for the elaboration of what Deputies might consider the best system, in relation to our resources, and our needs, of dealing with unemployment and destitution, it is our view that such amendments in the existing arrangements as can be conveniently made should be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>It is on that basis that legislation to amend the Unemployment Insurance Acts is being prepared and that the question of provision for widows and orphans and similar questions are being proceeded with.  The Government, of course, does not accept the view that our industrial organisation is not capable of providing work for all our people, if adequate steps were taken for its development and improvement. I think it will be accepted as axiomatic that the real solution for the problem of unemployment is the provision of work, and not the provision of maintenance.  When we come to consider this question of the provision <Col N="288" /> of work, we find that our problem is divided into two parts, the long run solution and the short run solution.  In the allocation of the functions of Government, between the various Departments, the Department of Industry and Commerce acquires responsibility largely for what I might call the long run solution, the provision of permanent employment.  The main administrative responsibility in respect of the short run solution, that is, the provision of administrative relief, falls mainly to certain other Departments.</P>
    <P>In the Department of Industry and Commerce work upon the long run solution is at present in progress.  In other words, we are endeavouring to push forward industrial development so that permanent employment may be found for all or most of those who are now idle.  During the past five years, and Deputies should not forget that the Government has only been in office for five weeks, the circumstances of all, or nearly all, existing industries have been examined in considerable detail and their development possibilities explored and discussed with representatives of the trade associations concerned, not merely the associations of employers but, in the case of a number of these industries, in relation to associations of the workers as well.  Various decisions have already been made and will be submitted to the Dáil in due course. For obvious reasons, it is undesirable that the nature of some of these decisions should be communicated at this stage.</P>
    <P>In addition the possibilities of establishing new industries are being investigated.  I mean industries which do not exist here now such as that referred to by Deputy Finlay in his question here to-day&mdash;the cement industry.  We are satisfied of the possibilities of getting them, and a number of other industries not now existing in the country, established here within a reasonable period and plans are being elaborated to that end.  We are endeavouring to inaugurate a system of general planning of industrial development so that progress can continue, once started, uniformly over all fronts, if I might <Col N="289" /> say so, and that one part of the system will not outrun the other, so that we will be able to direct our energies, in so far as it is possible for us to do so, and the resources of the country, into channels in which they are likely to be most effective in the immediate circumstances.</P>
    <P>I agree with what has been said that unemployment need not exist here.  I always had the opinion that unemployment in this country was due mainly to misdirection, bad industrial organisation or some such man-made cause.  The additional information which it has been possible to acquire with the assistance of the Government Departments at our disposal, has only convinced me in that view.  It is true that the world depression has produced its reactions here to some extent.  An increase in the volume of unemployment has been due to that world depression but, despite all that may be said in that connection, I am more than satisfied that unemployment, as we now know it in this country, can be remedied, and it is the intention of the Government, in so far as its ability will permit it to do it, to find that remedy and to give effect to it.</P>
    <P>It may be that we will fail.  We are prepared, however, to stand over our efforts, and if we find that our views are mistaken or that we as individuals are incapable of effectively working out that policy, then we will not stand in the way of some other group who may wish to attempt the task in which we have failed.  It is, of course, quite true to say that while these long-run solutions of the problem are being worked out, the unemployed must exist, and, in so far as it is possible to do so, work must be found for them in the near future.  There are men unemployed to-day for whom, if we could, we would be all very glad to provide work to-morrow or the next day.  Each day out of work is an additional day's misery for them.  In these circumstances we have been investigating what it is possible for us to do.  It is possible in the course of any debate that may follow that some other speakers on these benches may be able to give more detailed information in <Col N="290" /> that connection than I have had at my disposal.  But, generally speaking, our aim has been to proceed as rapidly as possible with all the work in hands in the various Government Departments. In other words, to take the year's programme as set out in the Estimates, and endeavour to complete it in shorter time, and in addition to give effect to other projects of an extremely useful nature which have been hanging fire for some time.  In order to ensure co-ordination in that work and to prevent overlapping and to make certain that there will be no wastage, and that the maximum results in employment will be obtained, the entire task is being planned out under the direction of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Hugo Flinn.</P>
    <P>In addition to these schemes of work to which I have referred, and which are available in the various departments, which are being tabulated, some other projects are being devised concerning which, however, it is not possible to give information at this stage.  But Deputies will have a much clearer idea as to the extent to which it is possible to proceed along these lines with the introduction of the Budget statement in the near future.  It is, of course, correct that housing is one of the means by which widespread employment can be given.  The Government Housing Board policy is being worked out in the Department of Local Government and it will be brought into operation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <i>[An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.]</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the meantime, however, we are anxious that housing programmes in hand, or under contemplation, should be pushed ahead.  The question of the facilities which can be given to local authorities is being considered, and it is hoped that the Government will be able to help them to proceed more rapidly and with larger schemes than in the past.  But again, because of the circumstances of the time, definite announcements must be postponed.  I think Deputy Morrissey must appreciate that this motion has probably <Col N="291" /> been introduced in the Dáil at a most awkward time.</P>

      <P>It is therefore very difficult to go into greater detail than I have done now.  Some attempts will be made to do so by other Ministers who are more familiar than I am with the programmes in hand in their Departments. But I ask the House to realise first of all that we have got a serious unemployment problem and that a genuine attack upon that problem is now being made, but that the success which will attend that attack will depend upon the measure of good will which we receive from all classes and sections of our people.  It is no easy task to take 75,000 people or 80,000 people, or whatever the number may be, now idle and to find useful work for them.  But it can be done, and so far as it is possible to do it, it will be done by this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion proposed by Deputy Morrissey. The language used by him emphasises to an inordinate degree the very serious view he takes of the situation.  I think the Minister who has just sat down has also realised how serious the situation is, and I am glad that an effort will be made on his part to alleviate the position which exists in the country to-day. It has been brought home to me, as Chairman of the North Cork Board of Public Assistance, that owing to the enormous amount of unemployment in Fermoy, Mitchelstown, Mallow, Charleville and Buttevant, and other towns in North Cork, public assistance has materially increased.  The problem before us is to provide employment for all those able and willing to work. Probably the Government of every <Col N="292" /> country has realised that it is their duty, at any rate, to do something to alleviate the problems caused by want of employment.  It is no less our duty here to try to indicate, as far as lies in our power, what means we propose to take to provide for those who are willing to work and who are industrious, but who are unemployed through no fault of their own.  We know of several instances where milling concerns, railways, and various other industrial concerns have closed down because of economic conditions.  The problem that presents itself to the Government to-day is to help some of these concerns which are in need of resuscitation.  There are in this country young men and young women who are not able to emigrate, for emigration has been closed to them.  That is one of the problems that will have to be tackled quickly, because idle men, no matter how well they have been brought up, will turn their minds, perhaps, to things and problems which they would not think of had they been employed.  I feel sure that when you have concerns like the milling industry becoming practically non-existent, or, at least, in danger of extinction, you are faced with problems that will need to be taken in hands at once.</P>
      <P>There is a bigger problem needing to be faced, and that is unemployment on the land.  Encouragement of tillage is needed&mdash;encouragement to those who are not able to carry on tillage.  That is a question that will have to be tackled. I believe protection for agricultural products is a necessary part of Government policy in this State.  We have the malting industry, which requires protection, and the development of this industry would help tillage.  We have the corn-growing industry, which would also help tillage, and I feel that it is right to say that it should be encouraged by protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of employment in this country has been given by the reconstruction work done on the roads.  I think that is an indication of what can be done in that direction, and I would urge that loans be given to further improve the main roads of our country. A proposal has recently been put up to the Minister for Local Government and <Col N="293" /> Public Health to start a loan for the purpose of further road construction. This would relieve unemployment to a very material degree.  I do not agree that the Labour Exchanges are always the best methods of securing employment. Sometimes the man in charge is not able to indicate where the necessities arise.  Our markets, too, are a very serious problem.  We are in danger of losing these markets.  That would bring no possible good to the country.  I think that, whatever may be said for such a question as the Oath or the Land Annuities, it is, at any rate, incumbent on us to secure by every means in our power that our markets will not be alienated to the injury of the farmers and the people of this country.  Our markets are the means of giving employment to agricultural labour, and their alienation would mean driving still further people off the land.</P>
    <P>We have concerns like the Youghal brickworks, the Silica Mines in Cloyne and others which have been closed down and we have not enough of employment on the land.  I am not able to say specifically what the number of unemployed in this country amounts to.  Deputy Morrissey has given certain figures and other Deputies have given other figures.  I do not know what the correct figure is but whatever the number is the problem is there and there is before the Government the necessity of providing work for the unemployed.  If that employment is not provided then the burden of public assistance will grow still greater.  I am personally brought very closely into touch with this matter of unemployment not alone from my position on the Board of Public Assistance but also in connection with other schemes of relief. I would add my best efforts to those of Deputy Morrissey in impressing on the Government the necessity for immediately tackling this problem. Such is the urgency of the question that I know that everybody in the country is in absolute sympathy with whatever means may be adopted by the Government for its solution.  I do not think there would be a single dissentient to any workable scheme that they may put before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I was very interested in the reply of the Minister for Industry and Commerce speaking on Deputy Morrissey's motion.  The part in which I was specially interested was the new ideas which may govern the policy of the new Government in the solving of the problem of unemployment. I do not intend to deiay the House very long.  There are other people besides the Government trying to solve the unemployment problem in this State.  It is on the question of the new ideas that I became interested when the Minister spoke.  It is these new ideas that some firms are very anxious to find out.  I refer to firms who are not going to the Minister for Industry and Commerce looking for subsidies and protection. I refer to firms that are prepared to use their own capital and labour in order to help in the solution of unemployment, but who have no way in which to do it.  If these new ideas are ready to the hand of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day let him put them before the people at once so that we can assist in this unemployment question in a real genuine and sincere way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said when he declared that there ought not to be any unemployment problem in this country.  In a country in which primary and secondary industries are neglected, in which the population is so sparse but which, nevertheless, is rich in spite of it all, we ought not to have an unemployment problem.  We certainly ought not to have a problem of the dimensions that we have to-day.  That is one of the extraordinary features of capitalism&mdash;although nature never gave more bounteously of her products than she does to-day, yet side by side with that we have a picture of abject misery, poverty and starvation.  We have nature giving generously, science aiding more and more in speeding up production, we have more widespread production of foodstuffs, and yet side by side with all that we have that abject misery of which I spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no excuse for unemployment in a country such as this. <Col N="295" /> There is less excuse for the misery and poverty which we see all around us. I want to endorse the viewpoint of Deputy Morrissey.  He said that the unemployment problem is getting steadily worse and worse.  I represent a constituency in County Kildare which formerly provided a good deal of employment by reason of the occupation of certain military barracks there by British troops.  These barracks were evacuated and to-day, instead of employment being given to the people, there is blank misery and hopeless despair in many of the little homesteads where industry and a decent standard of life formerly existed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey said that in his constituency more and more people were being driven to seek home help. In County Kildare 41 persons out of every 1,000 are compelled to seek home help.  The national average is 18 persons out of every 1,000, and that shows conclusively that so far as Kildare is concerned there is poverty and there is distress on a scale which certainly demands immediate attention and relief.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the Government had been only five weeks in office.  I quite appreciate that and I make due allowance for it.  A short period in office must necessarily handicap one in the promulgation of plans for the relief of unemployment. At the same time, I was hopeful that we would hear something more definite from the Minister for Industry and Commerce than we heard this evening.  In one statement he indicated the secret character of certain plans, and it would seem to me that the Government's proposals revolve in a large measure around the policy of tariffs.</P>
    <P>There is, in this country, a section of people who fondly cherish the illusion that if you put on a tariff a day you will keep unemployment away.  I warn the new Government that the policy of a tariff a day to keep unemployment away is going to be a very costly one for the consumers, and is not going to yield the results that some people fondly imagine. <Col N="296" /> Let us take, as an example, the tariff on boots and shoes imposed by the last Government.  Will anybody who can read English and add figures pretend to believe that the tariff on boots and shoes has been a success?  I venture to say that if the late Minister for Industry and Commerce would speak from his heart, as distinct from a political platform, in relation to the imposition of that tariff, he would probably be the first to confess that the tariff has been a ghastly failure.</P>

      <P>When the tariff was imposed the home industries catered for 10½ per cent. of the home market for boots and shoes.  After eight years of tariff, during which the consumers paid nearly £2,000,000 by way of tariffs, the home manufacturers to-day are supplying from 11½ per cent. to 12 per cent. of the home market.  That indicates that £2,000,000 have been paid by the unfortunate people who, in the main, are scarcely able to afford it, for the purpose of increasing our productivity in the way of boots and shoes by from 1 to 1½ per cent.  In the case of every other tariffed industry the same doleful tale may be told.  Reliance on a policy of tariffs is an illusion.  The policy of imposing tariffs as a means of safeguarding our industries is one which will bring its own reawakening. Unfortunately, in the meantime, many workers will have suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Government ought to learn from the experience of other countries.  Other countries have gone through their industrial Gethsemanes. I think in this country we should profit by their experience.  If tariffs could make a country prosperous every country in the world to-day would be prosperous.  If tariffs could make America prosperous, would not America be prosperous?  If tariffs could make every country prosperous, we need have no unemployment problem. Tariffs on their own will not make a country prosperous.  In this country we appear to hug the delusion that we have some divine destiny and that the imposition of tariffs will automatically cure all our industrial ills. <Col N="297" /> I invite anyone who believes that to examine the extent to which our productivity has increased under the tariff policy of the last eight years.  I think it will be found that, having regard to the price paid, the results are very dismal reading indeed.</P>
    <P>This country cannot supply all its home requirements, but there are requirements which it can supply. Instead of attempting to supply all our home manufacturing requirements we ought to concentrate on the provision of staple commodities which the nation needs and which it can supply. Let us ascertain what these commodities are and let us plan in a national way how we can produce these commodities for ourselves.  I am glad the Minister has given an indication that the Government is thinking of a national plan and national direction. I am glad the departmental mind has not saturated the new Government.  I hope in surveying the industrial position the Government's general policy will be one of deliberate and ordered planning, and behind it all there will be an enthusiasm such as we have never known for the last ten years.  I was a bit concerned when I heard that all the planning was to devolve on a Parliamentary Secretary. I hope that is not an irrevocable decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what I said. I said that the duty of preventing overlapping in relation to the expenditure of money upon relief schemes or public works seemed to me to devolve on a Parliamentary Secretary, who is the Parliamentary Secretary of the Board of Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the statement of the Minister in connection with that matter.  However, it only drives me to this conclusion, that there is nobody, at the moment, specifically charged with thinking out and planning except, perhaps, those in the Minister's own Department.  I want to say that the Minister charged with the everyday work of administering his Department cannot find the time, so long as there are only 24 hours in the day, to do this national thinking and national planning <Col N="298" /> which is so essential if we are going to achieve success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I would say to the new Government, and to the President in particular, is what I said to him on another occasion, that some body, or some council, should be charged with the responsibility of planning our industrial development rather than that things should go on in a piecemeal, huckstering fashion, and that we should have that sort of pigmy growth that we have had for the past 10 years.  Let us do something new, let us do something big, and let us do it after we have thought out the plans and decided definitely that these plans are to be reinforced with national enthusiasm, and with all the energy and legislative power that the Government can bring to the assistance of such a scheme.  The Minister stated, and I think stated quite truly, that our prosperity and our capacity to absorb our unemployed people must revolve around the development of our primary and our secondary industries.  In the past our system of agricultural economy has given us a lopsided system of productivity.  We were content to rely in the main on nature's bounteous supply of grass as the chief source of livelihood of our people, while at the same time we have been content to import manufactured commodities and to pay the fruits hardly won in the agricultural industry to foreign workers in exchange for the manufactured goods which they sent here.  It is probably too much to expect that having relied upon the agricultural industry so long we can get away from that industry now, even if it were desirable in existing world circumstances to do so.  I suggest to the Minister that every effort should be made to stimulate a balanced scheme of industrial activity.  Let us maintain and develop the primary industries until such time as they supply the whole of the home market.  At the same time let us realise that our secondary industries will be found to be the really wealth producing industries and thus take steps to ensure that these secondary industries are built up in such a way as to provide <Col N="299" /> employment for the people, and wealth for the nation.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce will not pin all his faith to a policy of unrestricted tariffs.  Tariffs and capitalism seem to be some people's method for solving our industrial problems.  I hope the President, in particular, will give us an indication that he is not standing for an industrial system which will give us soulless capitalism, existing by means of unrestricted tariffs.  I hope he will give the House an assurance that he has some higher, more scientific and more human method of stimulating our industrial productivity and prosperity than mere reliance upon tariffs.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce suggested that the solution of the housing problem would make its own contribution to the solution of unemployment. I gladly concede that it would.  I have already said so here. The Minister said that he was prepared to help local authorities in the matter of speeding up a house building programme. I want to remind the Minister, and in particular the Minister for Finance, that many local authorities anxious to go ahead with the house building programme are being held up in their activities, because of the fact that they are not able to get money except for short periods and at such high rates of interest as would impose crippling rents on the working class people who would occupy the houses. I hope that the Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Finance and Local Government will, as part of Governmental policy, do something to make money available for long terms at rates of interest which will not necessitate the imposition of such high rents as have been imposed under short term loans.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked if any Deputy had any suggestions which would deal with the problem immediately.  He said that the best was the enemy of the good.  I think that indicated a desire on his part just to struggle on until such time as the Government found the permanent and best solution of our economic and social difficulties. It may be true that the best <Col N="300" /> is the enemy of the good, but I suggest to the Minister that there are diseases, physical and economic, which are so serious that there must be some temporary remedy found for them, until such time as there is convalescence and a permanent cure.  I hope the Minister's speech does not indicate that he is not going to do something immediately to relieve the problem of unemployment.  The Minister asked for suggestions, which I hope indicates that he is prepared to do something.  I would make just one suggestion.  There is no way in which work for the unemployed could be distributed better than by the provision of work on the roads.  Our first-class roads are in fairly good condition. I would say that they are as good as any roads in Europe.  The second and third-class roads are by no means in good condition, and I would suggest to the Minister that £2,000,000 could readily be raised on the strength of the Road Fund, and that that money would carry out a scheme for improving these roads, and would provide relief on a national scale for our unemployed people.  In every town and village relief could be provided in that widespread way.  I hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce will give some consideration to that suggestion and that, as a result of the debate, and of the Minister's own appreciation of the gravity of the unemployment problem, we shall have, at the earliest possible date, a definite declaration of the Government's detailed plans for dealing with unemployment and with our agricultural and industrial development.  I am glad to have the assurance of the Minister that he accepts the basic Christian principle that it is the duty of the Government to provide work or maintenance for the unemployed.</P>

      <P>It is difficult for this House to realise that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who spoke here to-night, is the same man who thundered forth, when he sat on these benches, about the various remedies that his Party had up their sleeve to deal with the unemployment problem. He was very meek and mild this evening. We heard a great deal about world depression, but when we, from the opposite benches, ventured to speak of world depression, it carried very little weight with Deputy Lemass. The Minister in his opening remarks made one very important admission. In introducing this motion, Deputy Morrissey said that unemployment had become much worse than it had ever been.  The figure of registered unemployed given by the Minister to-night at 31,000 shows an increase since last July of over 9,000.  There are 9,000 more workless people on the roll to-day than there were then.  Since the Government came into office, there appears to be in the City of Dublin&mdash; I do not know what the reason is&mdash;a perceptible slackening off in all endeavour and development.  We have now in power a Government which accepts the responsibility of providing work or maintenance for the unemployed. They accept that as a State responsibility.  I am glad they accept it as a State responsibility.  Speaking on behalf of the harassed ratepayers of the City of Dublin, who are paying an annual contribution of about £250,000, I hope that one of the first acts of the new Ministry will be to remove portion of this stupendous burden from the overburdened ratepayers who are barely able to pay their own rents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin is very hot, but he knows there was no reduction <Col N="303" /> whatever in benefits under the last Government.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce is correctly reported in the Press, by one of these grand schemes which are in course of preparation, we are going to have the burden on capital and labour not diminished but increased.  That is the solution for unemployment which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has furnished to the House.  Nobody will say that since the Government came into office we, on these benches, have acted in an unreasonable way. We did not, and do not, expect a ready-made solution of the problem to-night, but we did expect, in view of the promises which, in the main, secured the return of the Party on the opposite side at the election, that some alleviation of the conditions of the unemployed would be forthcoming, that some immediate help would, as Deputy Morrissey suggested, be provided instead of putting the solution, as the Minister did, on the long finger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have read in the papers during the past few weeks of the condition of the unemployed.  We have read of wholesale ejectments and of people being put out of their little holdings after 23 years occupancy.  What are these people going to do while the Minister for Industry and Commerce is formulating his long-period solution of the unemployment problem?  I suggest that the solutions put forward here by those who are now the Government were, as Deputy Norton said, illusory solutions. Deputy Norton dealt very effectively with one industry&mdash;the boot and shoe industry.  He told the House that it had cost the consumer over £2,000,000. The President intimated in the last unemployment debate that that was one of the industries in which he hoped to find work for over 5,000 additional hands.  It is clear that the allies do not see eye to eye on that particular method of solving the unemployment problem.  If this motion is put to a division, I hope these seven good men and true, who voted against our relief motion for £250,000 last Christmas, will go into the Division Lobby and show their disapprobation of the new <Col N="304" /> Ministerial policy, as expounded in this House.  We did not expect a great deal from the new Government.  They have been only a few weeks in office. But we did expect something.  I was listening to a Labour speaker in this city a few weeks ago.  He said that the Government had only been a short time in power and that it would be unreasonable to expect them to produce a solution of the unemployment problem in that time.  But he said that if the Government were in earnest they would, although only a short time in office, have done something for the unemployed by way of giving increased benefits.  What the Minister intends to do is to find any benefit he can by a fresh imposition upon capital and labour.  The President told us in the last unemployment debate that there was no country in the world in which an easier solution of the unemployment problem could be found than this country. There has not been a single bit of progress made since the President took office, although his Party have no doubt been considering this problem for years.  I expected that we would have made much more progress and that we would have heard of much more detailed schemes from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If no solutions are to be put forward until we get the Budget, the outlook for these unfortunate people who are looking for the rent is not very hopeful.  Dublin Corporation could do very effective work if the Minister for Finance was in a position to give them £100,000.  The foreshore at Clontarf needs improvement and if that £100,000 was given by the Minister for Finance, it could be expended reproductively.  I want to say on behalf of the workers of the city that they would appreciate a great deal more, however small, the wages they would earn than the money which they receive by way of poor law relief, which is the only form of relief that they at present receive.</P>
    <P>
      <i>[An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.]</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have undertaken the responsibility of finding either work or maintenance for the unemployed. I agree with what Deputy <Col N="305" /> Norton said this evening with regard to the solution for unemployment propounded in this House by President de Valera.  President de Valera told us that the cure for unemployment lies in supplying ourselves with the manufactured goods that we so needlessly import.  Since the present Ministry came into power we have had one tariff, that on agricultural machinery, imposed.  I wonder is that a tariff that will commend itself to the members of the farming community in this House? Will the farming community be content to pay on the importation of parts alone required for their machinery a sum amounting to something like £20,000?  I do not wish to be unfair in my criticism in dealing with this question, but broadly speaking I think we may take it that the import of machinery to this country would run to something like £300,000.  There may be some classes of machinery which come into that figure of £300,000 which are not covered by the recent tariff, but if we take it that the figure is £300,000 and that you have another 25 per cent. added to that, then the farmers of this country will probably be paying a sum of £120,000, which the new Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want them to remember that they are not so secure in the saddle as perhaps they may believe.  A 13,000 turnover of a preference vote is not a lot to turn the other way.  Therefore, they had better toe the line and get on with the work or put up with the consequences.</P>

      <P>My opinion with regard to this unemployment problem is this, and I speak essentially as a Dublin <Col N="306" /> Deputy, that the internal and the external policy of the new Government has been such as to create a feeling of insecurity and such a lack of confidence and such a shaking of financial stability that it tends not to cure the unemployment problem but considerably to accentuate it.  I remember that at one of the last meetings that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party held at College Green I ventured to say that if the cast iron policy of indiscriminate tariffs propounded by the Party opposite were carried out in this country it would have the most disastrous consequences.  I referred to two industries that particularly affect the people of Dublin City who sent me here to represent them.  I referred to Messrs. Jacob and Company. I asked the question: If we have an indiscriminate policy of tariffs in this country what will happen to the 3,000 hands employed by Messrs. Jacob and Company, over 2,500 of whom are employed on the export trade of that firm?  I pointed out that 500 of the total number would be sufficient to meet all the requirements of the home market.  In this connection I may say that the home market seems to have got on the brain of Deputies in the Party opposite.</P>

Jacob, which sends its products to all parts of the world, is adversely affected by the policy of the new Government.  In making my speech at College Green, I also ventured to refer to the reactions of the tariff policy of the Party opposite on the great firm of Messrs. Guinness, which gives employment to something over 5,000 hands, a firm, too, which is also carefully watching events.</P>

      <P>I am speaking on behalf of the workers of the City of Dublin however distasteful it may be to Deputy Davin.  I am speaking here on behalf of the interests of Dublin City, and it is my duty to point out that the present policy of the Government Party means threatened disemployment in Dublin City of anything from 6,000 to 8,000 hands.  That is the mode and that is the manner&mdash;that is the great panacea&mdash;the new Government have to offer for solving the unemployment problem.  If there was one thing that helped to put the present Party in power&mdash;I have often told this to my own Party&mdash;it was this problem of unemployment. It was the workless man who went to the polls and voted against us in the last election.  Therefore, the new Government have a special duty, as Deputy Morrissey has told them, not to put the solution of this problem on the long finger, but to give us something to be going on with for the present time at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Press has been teeming with all the plans and activities of the Government Party.  We have read in the new Press day after day all the things that were going to be done, all the plans that were going to be carried out for the solution of the unemployment problem.  The Minister for Finance, speaking to-night, had not a single answer to give to the House when asked if he had anything to offer on this subject.  He said that some of the Ministers who would follow him would probably deal with it.  Surely if the responsibility rests on any Minister it rests on his shoulders.  The solution that the President of the Party is going to find is a development of the boot and shoe industry, which as Deputy Norton has already told us, is costing the consumers of this country something over £2,000,000.  We are told that there is to be fresh employment in the wood-working industry, while we have no machinery in the country.  The tariff imposed by the new Government will probably affect the imports of that machinery.  If we in this country have got to develop an industrial policy we <Col N="308" /> must proceed upon sound business lines.  We cannot dream of imposing tariffs without suffering the reactions of those tariffs.</P>
    <P>If this policy of indiscriminate tariffs is to be put into effect I want to ask members of the farming community in this House what will become of the £14,000,000 worth of livestock that we export annually to the English market?  What happened in this country when the tobacco industry was set up here?  Immediately a tariff was imposed in England and any exports that we sent to the English market were at once locked out.  Do you think that Great Britain is going to hold up the cheek and say mildly &ldquo;Yes, brother, strike me on the other&rdquo;?  In my opinion, you are immediately going to have a tariff imposed if this indiscriminate tariff policy of Fianna Fáil is carried into effect.  Surely, as Deputy Norton has said, we ought to profit by the example of other countries.  We are going to impose indiscriminate tariffs regardless of whether we can produce economically or not the various manufactured imports which come into this country.  If we could produce any of the imports that at present are coming in on an economic basis I, as a business man, unhesitatingly say that we should proceed at the earliest possible moment to produce them, but if, on the other hand, we are going to have a levy of indiscriminate tariffs regardless of whether the production can be carried out economically or not, I say that is a policy that can only end in the national bankruptcy of this country.  We have, as Deputy Norton properly remarked, many examples to guide us in dealing with this problem the magnitude of which the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke of.  I move the adjournment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I had on to-day's Order Paper a question addressed to <Col N="309" /> the President, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To ask the President whether his attention had been called to a statement made by the Minister for Finance in the Seanad on 22nd March last, that the Shannon Scheme, the Dairy Disposals Board, the Drumm Battery and the Beet Sugar Factory were as precious a collection of white elephants as drew their unfortunate owners to the verge of insolvency, and if in view of this statement he will indicate the policy of the Executive Council with regard to those projects.</P>
      <P>The President replied:</P>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  With regard to the second part, large sums of public money have been sunk in these enterprises, and quite irrespective of any views that may be held of the wisdom or otherwise of their initiation and their management up to the present, it is the duty of the Government to safeguard the capital invested in them and, if possible, to secure their success.  I need only add that the Government is resolved to carry out its duty in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said at question time that that was not an answer to my question. I want to say now that not only was it not an answer to my question, but I submit it was an attempt to evade my question altogether.  I asked the President if he would state whether he and the other members of the Executive Council agreed with this statement.  This is a very important matter; it is a matter of great importance to the people of this country. The people of this country have, as the President quite rightly stated, sunk a lot of their money in those schemes, and we are entitled, as representatives of the people, to know exactly whether the statements made by the Minister for Finance in the Seanad represent the view of the Executive Council.  I may say that when I read the statement in the Press I was amazed to believe that any Minister of this State would be so irresponsible as to make such a statement, and would have such <Col N="310" /> little regard for national schemes, and for the national credit, as to make a statement of that kind.  I decided to wait in case the Minister was misrepresented, or was not correctly reported, until I got the official report, and when I received the official report I found that the Minister was correctly reported.  Now, I do not want to use very strong language in this matter, but, in my opinion, the language is not too strong when I say that that statement made by a responsible Minister of this House, speaking as a member of the Executive Council, with regard to four schemes of national importance, was nothing less than an outrage, and I want, and I think I am entitled to get, as a member of this House, from the President, a plain &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to my question.  I am not going to put the President to the trouble of going into a long, detailed explanation of the matter.  I gave in my question the statement made by the Minister, and I asked the President to state whether that was the view of the Executive Council or not.  The President can answer me in one word, &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and I hope that the President will shorten the proceedings by giving me a plain and straight answer.  I do not wish to say any more about it.  It is not going to do any good to drag the matter out, but I do say I am entitled to, and I hope to get, a straight answer.  Is the view expressed by the Minister for Finance, who is a member of the Executive Council, holding collective responsibility, the view of the Executive Council on these four national projects?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement to which Deputy Morrissey's question related to-day, and to which the evasion of the President was supposed to relate, was made by the Minister for Finance in the Seanad, much as Deputy Morrissey has quoted it, but there was something more to it than was quoted.  This is the full text:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1927, the Minister said, the Cumann na nGaedheal Party went to the country with this as their programme&mdash;the hydro-electric development of the Shannon, the reconstitution of the Dairying industry <Col N="311" /> of this country on a new basis, and the establishment of a Beet Sugar Factory.  When they came into power they added to that list a new project&mdash;the development of the Drumm Battery.  The success of that Government's practical policy is expressed by the four schemes&mdash; the Shannon Scheme, the Dairy Disposals Board, the Drumm Battery and the Beet Sugar Factory, as precious a collection of white elephants as ever drove their unfortunate owners to the verge of insolvency.</P>
    <P>That statement was made when the Minister for Finance was replying in the Seanad, in concluding the debate on the Central Fund Bill.  The Central Fund Bill included a vote on account of £8,000, out of a full estimate of £25,000, which had been put down for the development of the Drumm Battery, so that, speaking on the very Bill which included the £8,000 vote, taken by him for the development of one of these schemes, he thought fit to say to the House, and through them, to the people, that this was one of &ldquo;as precious a collection of white elephants as ever drove their unfortunate owners to the verge of insolvency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are two points in this&mdash;one is the very minor point of what public criticism and public chastisement ought to be given to the Minister for Finance for his folly.  That is a minor thing, but the bigger thing is whether the present Government is big enough to say about one of their Ministers that a mistake had been made, and that their policy was not that policy of deriding four schemes in which the country was vitally interested, and on the success of which the country's fortunes, to a good extent, depend. What do we get&mdash;the evasion to which Deputy Morrissey referred.  The President says &ldquo;With regard to the second part, large sums of public money have been sunk in these enterprises,&rdquo; and the next part I consider to be an aggravation of the ludicrous folly of the Minister for Finance&mdash;&ldquo;Quite irrespective of any views that may be held <Col N="312" /> of the wisdom or otherwise of their initiation  their management up to the present, it is the duty of the Government to safeguard the capital invested in them.&rdquo;  There was not a person who could have been criticised for opposition to the Shannon Scheme, on account of a pro-English bias, who did not, at some time or another, when the scheme was becoming a success, crawl in again with that same sort of statement, that the country's money had been sunk in it, and somebody had to safeguard it, and the President is in good company when he takes that particular line in his attempted evasion of this question.  He says &ldquo;It is the duty of the Government, if possible, to secure their success,&rdquo; and that, to my mind, is an aggravation of the previous statement to which attention has been called.  Surely it is time that we knew the mind of the Government on the matter, or at least whether they have a mind on the matter.  The Minister for Finance is in that particularly blissful state about some of these schemes that it would be folly to expect him to be wise about them.  We have known that of old.  He criticised the Drumm Battery.  I think his comment about that scheme was the one which shocked the public in this country most. He criticised it in his speech on the original Vote on the grounds (a) that there was no patentable device, (b) even if there was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all to be done under the supervision of the President and other members of the Executive Council.  It is to be presumed that this represents the Government's policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not; it is a statement of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, we had other statements.  Senator Connolly told us in the Seanad in October last year that the Drumm Battery was a failure.  Deputy Boland told us in this House a week previously that he knew the Drumm Battery was a failure.  Is it the policy of the whole Party as well as the Government that this scheme has got to be derided and if it is their policy will they let us have, at any rate, this information: What expert advice had the Minister for Finance, because he is no expert in these matters himself, upon which to base that statement with regard to one of these schemes, the Drumm Battery, that it was a white elephant?  If he believes it was a white elephant for what reason did he include £8,000 in the Vote on Account out of £25,000 that now stands in the Estimate for the coming year?  I thought it would be a good thing when I saw the blunder that had been made by this statement of the Minister for Finance to have this matter discussed in a better way than by Parliamentary question and answer and I asked that we should have it taken at once, that we should have the Estimate put down on the first day that we met.  The information I got from the Whips was that the Minister was so involved in Budget preparations that he could not attend.  That was the official reason given.  I find to-day an advertisement in the public Press that at some meeting with reference to the everyday uses of electricity the Minister for Finance proposes to display his form on the boards of the Gaiety Theatre.  I wish they would keep him on for the evening performance.  I see there is a play to be produced called <Col N="314" />&ldquo;It's a Boy!&rdquo;  A more appropriate play for him to appear in could not be found.</P>
      <P>Are we going to get a statement from the President as to the Government policy on any of these four schemes?  As Deputy Morrissey says, if he had given a plain answer when asked about the matter, it could have been settled.  But the country wants more than a mere answer of yes or no.  The country wants more than a mere repudiation of this ludicrous folly on the part of the Minister. They want to find out had the Minister any expert information at his disposal which warranted his speaking on the matter at all, and if so, who were the experts and what was the expert advice he got?  They want to know if he has put that expert advice, if it has been got, before the members of the Cabinet, and if they agreed with him, because there were two members of the Cabinet present in the Seanad when he spoke.  They want to know, if that is not the case, having regard to the expert advice previously got, and which is on the files for the Minister and other members of the Cabinet to examine, will they make amends by giving us a detailed statement at the earliest possible opportunity of the prospects of any one of these four schemes and, in particular, I stress the scheme with regard to the development of the Drumm Battery?  Are they going to get expert advice?  Did they not consider the expert advice which had been got sufficient?  Have they any appreciation of what that advice amounts to?  Did they know what the proposals of the Great Southern and Western Railways Company are with regard to the particular electrification scheme that has been put before them? Did they believe them to be founded upon expert advice and good expert advice?  What has the Minister for Finance discovered that made him expose himself to the ridicule of the populace by this type of statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Harm can be done to these schemes by irresponsible statements.  Probably the Minister has such a record for irresponsible statements that the harm that might be done by his saying these <Col N="315" /> things about any of these schemes is less than if these things were said by somebody else.  I said there was a shock to the public.  The shock to the public was not so much that the Minister could find it possible to say these things, but that it was possible for a man who could say these things to be made Minister for Finance. One begins to have doubts for the stability of the country in the matter of finance unless there is going to be something amounting to very close supervision of all that the Minister for Finance works at and announces with regard to what he is working at. I suggest to the President that if he can find no other way it would be a good plan, even at a further cost to the State, to get a second bed in Government Buildings and make him sleep there at night so that he will not be able to give out these fatuous statements to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I want to deal with is the suggestion that there was an evasion in the answer given here.  I deny that. Anybody reading the question could only infer that Deputy Morrissey wanted information on one point: Whether we propose to safeguard the public money that was invested in these enterprises and whether we propose to do our best to ensure their success?  That at any rate was what I understood was the intention of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Then Deputy Morrissey ought to be able to express himself a little more clearly than he has done in the question.  The Minister for Finance, in dealing with the extravagant boosting of certain enterprises initiated by the recent Government, in the Seanad, gave warning that from the financial point of view these require very careful consideration and had imposed upon any Government a very heavy and weighty responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we get a quotation about the extravagant statements?</P>

    <Col N="316" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan knows perfectly well that I cannot put my hand now on the quotations. There is no Deputy who was in the last Dáil who does not remember quite well extravagant statements such as that which sent up the stock of the Great Southern Railways Company several points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Were they made in the Seanad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>They were made in this House.  We were told that £80,000 was going to electrify the railway from Cork to Dublin.  On coming into office and taking responsibility after extravagant statements like that we have to make the public really aware of the exact situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very big difference between our attitude in these matters and the attitude of the late Government.  There is a big change of policy, namely, that of honesty about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">
      <NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;White elephants.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody who is interested in these schemes was watching the amount of public money that was involved in them.  Whether the epithet &ldquo;white&rdquo; was applicable or not that they were big schemes is certainly clear when you take the figures and see how much money was involved in them.  There is involved already directly in the Shannon Scheme a sum of over £8,770,000; in the Drumm Battery up-to-date there has been paid £30,300, including £5,300 taken from the Contingency Fund; in the Beet Sugar Scheme there has already been given in direct subsidy the sum of £980,000 and in indirect subsidy a sum of £1,080,000, making a total of £2,060,000 in all.  The sum of £870,000 has been spent in the enterprise of the Dairy Disposals Board.  Now considering the resources of this country I think every Deputy will admit that, at any rate, the Minister was not far wrong when he said that we were given charge of certain elephants.  There is no doubt that <Col N="317" /> maintaining these enterprises is going to put a very heavy tax upon the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that an honest way of dealing with the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an honest way of dealing with it because the community were led to believe that we were being handed over, in accordance with the extravagant statements of the recent Ministry, enterprises which were going to be of tremendous immediate value.  What was the position? Take the Drumm Battery that the Deputy has been speaking about. There is nobody in this House so anxious to assist research in this country as I am; nobody more anxious to see that public money, when it is necessary to help that research, will be given to it.  Deputy McGilligan when he was Minister came along and said that they were acquiring a patent.  He did not acquire a patent.  He acquired an investigation.  That was what he acquired, and he did his very best by extravagant statements made for political purposes, I hold, to injure the chances of that investigation becoming finally a great commercial success.  He did everything in his power to injure that scheme himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

Deputy McGilligan possibly will not be present in the House when it is possible to prove or <Col N="318" /> disprove his prophecies.  Let us not prophesy but keep to solid facts.</P>

That is the policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance did not do anything like the damage against these schemes that was done by the extravagant statements from those on the benches opposite. It was absolutely necessary to bring people down to bedrock and to recognise what was involved. If the Minister erred, on the other side there was a balance that could be secured between the two.</P>

Everybody <Col N="319" /> in the House agreed with the idea of using the water power of this country for providing power.  It was a question how it should be done, and I still hold, with the extra knowledge I have got now, the original view I held, that from a commercial and economic point of view it would have been better to commence developing our water power otherwise.</P>

      <P>The information desired is being prepared, but its completion will necessarily take some time.  The particulars will be more voluminous than could readily be printed in the Official Report, and I would propose, therefore, to furnish copies in stencilled form which would be available to any interested Deputies.</P>
